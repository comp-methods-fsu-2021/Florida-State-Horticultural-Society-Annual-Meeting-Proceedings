The Twenty-Seventh Annual Meeting of the Florida State Horticultural Socie¬
ty convened at Palatka on April 28th.
The attendance was unusually large, the largest in fact that we have had for sev¬
eral previous years. The good people of
Palatka welcomed the members with open arms and extended to them the free¬
dom of the beautiful and progressive lit¬
tle dity, and the many courtesies and at¬
tentions shown the members of the society during their stay in Palatka did much to increase their pleasure and satisfaction.

The opening session of the society was held in the parlors and lobby of the Put¬
nam House, and at its close the members of the Palatka Woman’s Club held an informal reception. This “social hour”
was enjoyed by" the visiting mem¬
bers, as it gave them an oppor¬
tunity to meet and become ac¬
quainted with the good people of Pa¬
latka, as well as to renew old acquaint¬
ances among themselves, and to meet and become acquainted with the more recently initiated members.

The regular sessions were held in the commodious opera house, which was


tastefully decorated for the occasion by the energetic local committee in charge of arrangements.

Our programme this year was one of the best and most comprehensive we have ever had, as it covered a wide range of subjects of most vital importance and in¬
terest to our members. The papers read showed most careful preparation and close study of the subjects treated, and the interest shown was emphasized by the discussion following the reading of the papers. These discussions as usual brought out many new points and valu¬
able ideas.

The problem of marketing citrus fruits, is of course ever with us, and the valuable paper and report submitted by
Mr. Tenny claimed the attention of the society for nearly one entire session
That Mr. Tenny was talking to a deeply interested and appreciative audience was evidenced by its close attention and the many questions propounded to him.

Another interesting number on the pro¬
gramme was an illustrated lecture by Mr.
J. Horace McFarland, of Harrisburg,
Pa. The many beautiful colored views

presented during the course of the lec¬
ture added much to its interest. Mr.
McFarland’s address was an inspiration,
and will no doubt do much to inspire in the hearts of his hearers a greater desire to beautify both the back and front yards of their homes. Recorded elsewhere is a short address by Mr. McFarland.

Among other attentions shown the members of the society by the good peo¬
ple of Palatka was a pleasant excursion on the beautiful St. John’s river—the steamer City of Jacksonville having been chartered for that purpose by Pa-
latka’s enterprising Board of Trade. In addition to the steamer excursion there


was an excursion by automobile through the great potato fields of Putnam county and to the immense camphor grove a few miles south of Palatka—the largest culti¬
vated camphor grove in the world.

When the question of the next place of meeting was taken up, Arcadia. Gaines¬
ville, Ft. Myers and Taimoa—each ex¬
tended cordial invitations to meet with them the coming year. Gainesville grace¬
fully withdrew and Ft. Myers was dropped after the first ballot. On the second ballot Tampa won by a good ma¬
jority, and at that place the Society will meet next year.


Addresses of Welcome and Responses


ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PALATKA


Mayor S. J. Kennedy


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

I deem it an honor and a pleasure to meet you here tonight, and in be¬
half of the citizens of Palatka, to ex¬
tend to you a welcome; a welcome with the word written in large, gold¬
en letters. We have no walls or fences around our city; neither have we a key that I might present it to you,
but our borders are all open and we come to you with open arms and say to you that all we have is yours; en¬
joy it, and when you return to your homes, we trust that your stay with us shall have been so pleasant that you can congratulate yourselves that you have been present at the twenty-sev¬
enth annual convention of this organ¬
ization.

We are glad to have you with us tonight, tomorrow and the following day, and we would be glad to have you longer. We are proud of you;
we are proud of you as an organiza¬
tion, one of Florida’s products, with


its membership extending throughout our State, and beyond. We are proud of you, for we feed that Palatka is the birthplace of this organization, for it was here thirty years ago that a few orange growers gathered together and formed themselves into what was known as the Florida Fruit Growers’ Associa¬
tion.

Some of you present here tonight may have been members of that asso¬
ciation. There are not many left of the number. Some of them who were dear friends of mine have crossed the river and are resting under the shade of the trees in the Great Beyond.

We are glad you are with us, and we hope you will continue to .'grow, that your organization may be known in every part of Florida and the United
States.

In conclusion, permit me again to say to you, in behalf of the citizens of
Palatka, that we welcome you to the
Gem City of Florida.

RESPONSE

Lloyd S. Tenney, Orlando, Fla.


Mr. Mayor :

We are here; all of us, I think. I
should hate to tell just why we have come, because I expect the excuses and reasons would be quite varied. Some of us have come because we have our new dresses to show. Some of us are here because we have our new Palm
Beach suits. Some of us are here be¬
cause Palatka has the reputation of giving us good things to eat. I heard one or two persons say they had come because they had not seen Palatka for twenty-three years, and they wanted to see if it had changed. The causes are numerous for our coming, but we are all here.

Seriously, though, Mr. Mayor, and officers of the Horticultural Society, a gathering like this is significant. Fifty or one hundred years ago, this would not have been possible. Agriculture was an entirely different type of busi¬
ness than it is today. Each individual farmer—and we are farmers, notwith¬
standing the fact we call ourselves hor¬
ticulturists—has an entirely different problem to solve. Farming then was a different industry. Each little farm had its own life; it grew its own pro¬
ducts which were essential to that life;
it manufactured its cloth and other commodities used in the home. It was practically sufficient unto itself. This was as it should be, in those days, and the life at that time tended to foster


the spirit which is, perhaps, the strong¬
est characteristic of the American farm¬
er; independence, self-reliance. Or,
looking at it from another angle, it de¬
veloped the characteristic which has made it so hard for the American farm¬
er to co-operate with the other farmer,
his neighbor.

But these days are past. With the development of the railroads, tlie re¬
frigerator cars, the opening of distant and new markets is made possible,
two thousand and three thousand miles away. No longer is the farmer able to supply his necessities and comforts from his own farm. The industry can¬
not be carried on, on the old individu¬
al lines. ' There are things in our com¬
mon problems that the individual can¬
not solve; that two or three together cannot solve; and for these reasons it is necessary for us to come together to consider these problems. More and more the farmers are realizing this and great meetings are being held, from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.

We are coming here representing just one State, just a few industries,
but we have come with the hope that,
in addition to having a little pleasure,
we may gain a little strength, gather a little information, that is going to carry us through our trials and tribulations with a little more light than if we had not come.

*

And this is why we have come.

ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE

Mr. Howell A. Davis


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

The program announces that the welcome from the Board of Trade was to come from Mr. Selden, our presi¬
dent, but as he is absent that pleasant duty has been placed upon me. I con¬
fess, however, that under hasty circum¬
stances, having the day only to frame the words of welcome L am to speak, I
come before you with some hesitation.

Naturally I am proud of Palatka,
and you will not censure me if I tell those who may not be familiar with it,
that it is a mighty good town; that it has more miles of brick street paving and concrete sidewalks than any other town in the state, if not in the South,
as far as I know, of equal population;
that it is at the head of deep water navigation on the St. Johns river, and accordingly gets lower freight rates than inland towns; that the only wagon bridge across Florida’s greatest river is here; that we have six steamer lines and four different railroad systems;
that it is in the chief artesian well dis¬
trict in the state, with pressure to carry water 25 feet above the surface; that in its territory is the leading winter grown
Irish potato section of the state; that we grow corn and many other things;
that the only cultivated camphor plan¬
tation in the United States is in our county, and it’s a sight worth seeing,
and it made 10,000 pounds of camphor last winter; that we have the largest


cypress saw mill in the South, and ships from Atlantic Coast ports are here reg¬
ularly; we have the largest door fac¬
tory in the South; the only cedar pail and lard and tobacco bucket factory in the state; the only dynamite factory; a large fertilizer plant; the largest han¬
dlers of orange box material in the state, distributing over a million boxes last season, one-sixth of the entire num¬
ber used in the state; and our county “
produces as fine oranges and grapefruit as any in the state, over 200,000 boxes last year; the largest exclusive paper and stationery house in the state; a wholesale drug house, besides several wholesale grocery houses; the largest mail order seed house in the state; we have three newspapers, none better in the state, and one of them a daily,
with extras on the street when there’s news worth telling; a successful busi¬
ness college; our fraternal spirit is seen in every form of lodge and society,
and altogether we feel that we are en¬
titled to a place on the map. And as more than an incident, I do not wish to overlook the fact that we have one of the most active Boards of Trade in the state, and visitors are most cordial¬
ly invited to visit our rooms, and.1 hope the members of this society may take a look in while they are here.

Palatka is my home, I was born here,
and I feel its welfare as sincerely as I
do my own. I want you to feel at



24


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


home, and I want you when you go away to bear only good feelings for our city. Palatka this week is your home and we will be glad to believe that your stay with us may always be a cherished experience, and the wish is expressed that you may come often.

If my memory serves* me, this society is the outgrowth of a meeting held here by orange growers twenty-eight years ago. In the years since then mighty changes for the better have taken place in Palatka, in Florida, and in the strength and fortunes of your society,
one of the best, if not the best, among all similar organizations ill the republic.

Your society has made a reputation for Florida, and I am proud of you, and our people are sincerely glad to have you here. The reports of your meet¬
ings are sought for and serve as text books in the homes of intelligent peo¬
ple on every continent. This is a fact of which all of us can be proud.

Your deliberations reflect the achiev-
ments of men and women whose minds are free and hands unbound, and who are wresting from the ground, the pa¬
tient mother of us all, the bounties she freely yields to those who gently and intelligently and earnestly perse¬
vere.


No land is fairer than our Florida.
The climate in Florida is nature’s smile and goes with the land. Florida is a land of flowers, of plants in myriad va¬
riety and of trees. I was looking over a list of the merchantable trees of Flor¬
ida, not long ago, and was surprised to find over two hundred, one-half more in number than in any other state.
And yet the stranger hurrying through our state and forming his opinion from a car window survey, says “nothing will grow in Florida.” He has eyes, yet he sees not. The more I study the pos¬
sibilities of Florida the stronger my convictions of a greatness to come without comparison in any equal area on the continent. Florida is going to help solve the problem of how to keep down the high cost of living by grow¬
ing plenty of things, and growing them at minimum cost. Florida has the soil,
mark you I say soil, the water, the warmth, the light, the great markets are near and available by car or ship,
the food demand is large and growing,
and with more farmers and fruit men to join the pace set by the splendid men and women before me, to what heights of greatness can our state not attain?

I thank you. Come again.

RESPONSE
W. S. Hart


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

When the mail brought me notice from our worthy president advising me that I had been appointed to reply to the address of welcome of the pres¬
ident of the Board of Trade of this city, and saying “Don’t write ‘No’—
that will do no good. Copy has already gone to printer.” I asked myself why he had done this thing, knowing near¬
ly as well as I do, my entire lack of qualifications of an orator and most else that would fit me for the task, except an abiding love for this Society and a pretty thorough knowledge of its his¬
tory. I came to the conclusion that it was through an error of judgment on his part, coupled with a desire, in the kindness of his heart, to give me a run¬
ning start early in the game, fearing that, in my old age, I might not be able to hold out to the end, as in form¬
er years.

Following out this thought I am go¬
ing to ask you to be indulgent and pardon me if I speak in part of mat¬
ters with which the older members are familiar and for the frequent use of the first person, singular number. I have been privileged to share in the benefits of this association from the time of its first meeting after its organization, held at Ocala in February, 1889, where it entertained the American Pomological
Society, the foremost pomological society of the world, and the Georgia State


Horticultural Society, with that giant horticulturist, Prosper J. Berkmans, to call the great convention of three hor¬
ticultural societies to order and preside over its deliberations. The meeting was held in the immense building of the Semi-tropical Exposition, where the finest display of citrus fruits, scien¬
tifically considered, ever gotten togeth¬
er on earth, was one of the chief at¬
tractions.

From that date to this, I have taken part in all but two conventions, and was absent from them only because it was not possible for me to attend. I
have followed closely the history of the society, and in my humble way,
tried to help in making it a worthy and a valuable one.

As secretary, for some years, I wrote its early records and was privileged to edit, with President Adam’s assistance,
and publish its first printed and bound report, as well as others that followed.

From the time I resigned the secre¬
taryship that the work might be placed in more able and experienced hands*
I have been entrusted with the funds of the society and have been on its exec¬
utive committee for twenty-five years.
I am proud of this because of the splendid record the society has made,
and have inflicted that much of my con¬
nection with said record on you sim¬
ply to show that I speak with authority when putting a high value upon it.

It could not have been other than



26


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


a glorious one with such men as Dud¬
ley W. Adams, Rev. Lyman Phelps,
Jas. P. DePass, J. B. Anderson, Geo.
L. Taber, Arthur Manville, Pliney W.
Reasoner, O. P. Rooks and other strong men to give it birth, soon to be joined by E. O. Painter, E. S. Hub¬
bard, Professors Rolfs, Swingle, Web¬
ber, Heime, by F. G. Sampson, C. F.
A. Bealby, Dr. Richardson, C. T. Mc¬
Carty, W. C. Temple, Mrs. Rolfs, Mrs.
Prang, still later by Mrs. McAdow and scores of other earnest and able horti¬
culturists. It has in its twenty-seven years of strenuous life, faced a multi¬
tude of grave problems with fortitude and seldom failed to solve them, in a way to increase the sum of horticultur¬
al knowledge and benefit to its mem¬
bers, the state and others everywhere who are working along similar lines.

In these labors it has always had the very able and valuable assistance of the Scientists of the Agricultural
Department at Washington, and of those of our own Agricultural College and Experiment Station, they appre¬
ciating the advantages to themselves as students, that a membership and close association with this society would give, and at the same time, its value as a medium through which they,
as scientific workers and teachers,
might make the results of their labors immediately effective and valuable to those who were eager to receive and benefit by them.

This society, outside of political and religious organizations, has been for much of this time, the strongest and most influential in the state. It has al¬


ways had the highest respect of her

people and done more than any other

to increase her wealth and build up her

industries. Except for it, Florida would

have been far behind where she is to-

*

day and many millions poorer. These are generally accepted facts, yet few realize anything like the full value of its work.

As an illustration of this, I have in mind the great disaster of the winter of 1894-95, now but a tradition to many of you, when, in one night, property was destroyed that was paying good interest on eighty millions in value.
The state had but a small population (I
think something like a half million; all told). Every interest in it suffered se¬
vere hardship, we had no insurance money coming in to help rebuild our groves, we had little credit, few had means with which to hire help; we sent out no appeals for assistance, or received any contributions. It would take years to get our trees back to a profit-bearing condition; but many went bravely to the task, got vigorous,
but tender, sprouts started on the old roots, only to have them cut down by cold again in two years. Again we made the attempt and again, in 1899,
came a cold spell that destroyed all our work and killed more citrus trees out¬
right, than any previous cold spell.
Some of our best meii were heartbrok¬
en, could stand the strain no longer,
and dropped wearily into their graves.
Others, by the hundreds, abandoned their groves and either went into other lines of business or left for other parts.
A few sturdy, unconquerable souls ac-

cepted conditions as they were, came together each season in convention of this society, talked matters over, com¬
pared notes, earnestly discussed plans for the rebuilding of our horticulture and its protection from injury by cold;
told each other of their individual fail¬
ures and successes and went home with their faith refreshed and their courage renewed to continue the fight. At the end of seven years of famine and heroic struggle, the horticultural interests of the state were on a safer basis than ever before, a few had gotten the fruit to growing again and to markets that were hungry for it and willing to pay prices that, with returns from truck grown among the trees, once more put the faithful on their feet and proved their faith well founded. Florida was soon restored to her proper place at the head of the citrus growing world and as the winter garden of the United
States. This is but one of the many instances in which this society has done grand work for Florida, and yet, up to this date, she apparently has never,
through her legislative body, become fully assured of her existence.

Other states make annual appropria¬
tions and many of them very liberal ones, to foster the work of their hor¬
ticultural societies and deem it money well spent. The finances of this socie¬
ty have ever been run on lines of gen¬
erous helpfulness to its members, never on those of prudence. It has given more than it could afford each year,
rather than curtail its usefulness To those who needed its help, and those who loved her best and were able to do


so, have each season met the deficit.
This may have made the tie closer, but
I, for one, am ashamed of this neglect on the part of my adopted state and I
always shrink from asking for contri¬
bution from our members, as I know that some will respond who can ill afford to do so; yet I see no way of meeting the increasing expenses in the future, otherwise than as in the past,
unless the state does give help, or some of the loyal ones continue to help, after they are gone from our midst, by en¬
dowing the society with funds, as did
Marshall P. Wilder endow the Amer¬
ican Pomological Society, when death took him; its first and only president up to that date. His legacy has done much to increase the usefulness of that body.

I have hardly yet reached the “three score and ten” mark, nor are any of us fully assured that we ever will.

I believe that Mr. Taber, Mr. Gaits-
kill, Mr. Hoyt and myself are the last of the “old guard,” and I think I speak for them as well as myself when I say that it would add to our peace of mind before we step off the stage to know that the future of this society was as¬
sured through an ample income that would allow of the expansion of its work and usefulness.. I leave the thought for your consideration.

From what has been said, I believe it has been clearly shown that, in my estimation, any town that secures the presence of this society in annual con¬
vention must show good credentials and is highly honored by a winning vote. I am glad to note that the most


28


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


wide-awake and progressive towns of the state eagerly compete for this priv¬
ilege. Palatka has entered the field re¬
peatedly; the first time, if my memory serves me correctly, at Ormond, in
1892, Mr. W. H. Mann, of Manville,
acting as her spokesman, and with a
Palatka man as our first stenographer,
but Pensacola won, so the next year we gathered in the extreme western part of the state.

When I was fourteen years of age,
one cold winter morning in my native town in New Hampshire, I listened to a schoolmate reading in the South Flor¬
ida Journal, a stray copy of which had in some way fluttered down in our midst, an account of Col. Hart's orange grove at Palatka, Fla., and the returns that his crop had that year brought him.

There and then I decided, and an¬
nounced that I was going to Florida and raise oranges. Ten years later I
arrived, having been in the state 39
years this month and have grown oranges.

All this time I have had a warm spot in my heart for this town, be¬
cause of its association with that de¬
cision. I have always desired that our society should gather here because I
wished to meet her people and be known by .them, and have waited, rather im¬
patiently, for the invitation to become sufficiently urgent to bring this about.
I am told that she “did herself proud”
at DeLand, so we are here, are re¬
ceiving a warm, earnest and hearty welcome, which this society fully ap¬
preciates as coming from one of the


oldest towns of the state, yet one which we have been assured here this even¬
ing, has renewed its youth and awak¬
ened to the new order of things.

By noting her late improvements we see that she has a spirit of up-to-
dateness to rival that of her younger sisters and only awaited the coming of the State Horticultural Society con¬
vention to prove this to the world.
When we return to our homes I hope,
and believe, that most of us will have given Palatka new prominence on our mental maps as one of Florida’s most beautiful and best located towns, one that has a future of great promise and a warm-hearted citizenship that we shall count it a privilege to have become more intimate with and in whose wel¬
fare we shall take a deeper personal interest.

Gentlemen and ladies of Palatka,
you have known some of us per¬
sonally for years, some only by name and others not at all. I think I express the sentiment of each member who has listened to your greeting tonight when
I say it is our hope that from this meeting may grow up many warm and lasting friendships and that in the fu¬
ture the name “Florida State Horti¬
cultural Society,” either seen or heard,
may remind you of a season of happy and improving experiences that will cause you as well as ourselves to wish that its next convention to be held in your city may be at an early date and that, if possible, an even more earnest and cordial greeting may welcome its arrival.


President’s Annual Address


H. Harold Hume.


Members of the Florida State Horticul¬
tural Society , Ladies and Gentlemen :

It used to be, if there was a br ight boy in the farmer’s family, he must needs forsake the farm to become a lawyer, or a doctor or some sort of a so-called professional man, but Jim or
Jack or Bill, somewhat dull of mind and wit would do very well on the farm. On the surface it would seem that the farms lost and the professions gained. But it was not always so and more often the farmer lad who chose to remain on the farm outstripped his brighter brother. Yet because he dealt with things earthy his occupation and he himself likewise were looked down upon. As years went by, however, it became more and more apparent that to succeed in crop-producing required knowledge no less exacting in its re¬
quirements and covering a vastly wid¬
er range of subjects than the knowl¬
edge which brought success in other walks of life. For many, many years,
however, it was true that our practice as applied to crop raising far outran our knowledge of the principles in¬
volved. While it is true that the cul¬
tivation of the soil and the handling of crops will never become an exact science, yet the knowledge which we now apply to the work- in which we


are interested and which Jim or Jack or Bill must have at his command has increased many fold within very recent years. And it is because of this gain in knowledge, both theoretical and practical that the attitude of every one toward the farmer and his occupation has changed. Today farming in its several more or less specialized branch¬
es of vegetable growing, fruit growing,
cattle raising, poultry raising and field crop production is regarded as a worthy calling for the brightest and best minds in the land.

As already intimated, for many years our knowledge as applied to farming lagged behind our practice, but it is now equally true, speaking always in general terms, that our practice is not keeping pace with our knowledge.
Now it is to this thought that I desire at this time to direct your attention by reference to the lines of work in which we are engaged and with which we are most intimately acquainted.

Cultivation of the soil began with the desire on the part of the cultivator to destroy weeds or plants not desired that were likely to crowd out and in¬
jure the ones in which he was inter¬
ested. But we now know that the de¬
struction of weeds is a matter of very secondary importance. We now cul-


29



30


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


tivate to conserve moisture and to pro¬
mote chemical and biological activity.
Our view point has changed greatly with increased knowledge, yet it is a fact that we do not.do all we might in this direction. We do not stir the soil during rainless periods as frequent¬
ly as we should, or we do not do it at the time we should and allow valuable moisture to escape. It must be borne in mind that it is often quite as impor¬
tant to do a thing at the right time as it is to do it at all.

Great stress has been rightly laid on the vegetable matter content or our soils. And so important is this mate¬
rial that in a large measure we take it as an index of the fertility of the soil.
Under cultivation humus is worn out of the soil, but in spite of this, under proper management, the amount in a piece of cultivated land should actual¬
ly increase. In many types of Florida soils, humus is woefully deficient, and it is furthermore true that soils are cultivated with the expectation of sat¬
isfactory returns that are little more than chemical pure sand. Are we do¬
ing all we should in this direction?
Are we growing cover crops to help maintain the fertility of our soils?
There are some crops which we may cultivate successfully on soils deficient in humus but the large number of crops we produce cannot be successfully and economically produced except on soils rich in humus. Many of us are not doing as well as we know.

Go with me to some of the richest horticultural regions in the world and let us examine the soils. We will be


impressed at once by the fact that these lands are rich in lime. And how much lime is there in the average
Florida soil? True, here and there the lime content is sufficient, but in the majority of Florida soils there is none at all, or only a trace. Have we not known in this society ever since its beginning that lime in plenty in the soil would help us to produce more and better crops? Yes, we have known this, for the value of lime runs like a well defined thread through the warp of every report we have issued. From our first report published in 1892, let me quote the words of a member who is here tonight and who has long been noted for the production of fine fruit:
“The shells (referring to the material from shell mounds) when burned to lime make an excellent application to apply to groves when there is a good supply of humus in the ground.” We know, too, that by the use of ground lime stone we may have all the good effects of lime without any of the ill effects that attend the use of some forms. Yet in spite of our knowledge of the benefits to be derived from its use, there are thousands of acres of cultivated soil in Florida, woefully de¬
ficient in lime, to which none has ever been applied. Here again our knowl¬
edge has outrun our practice.

The old practice in applying commer¬
cial fertilizer to our soils was to make one or two or perhaps three heavy ap¬
plications each year. But it has been proven that by following this practice,
fertilizer is wasted, because it leaches from the soil or gets out of reach of


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


3i


the plant roots before they can get it.
And we now know that more frequent ap¬
plications of smaller quantities will en¬
able the plants to get more of it, yet the general practice of making heavy applications still continues in spite of the fact that loss could be prevented by using the same amount in smaller doses. Again we know better than we do.

For many years it has been gener¬
ally accepted that our citrus trees are better off with a minimum amount of pruning. This principle seems to be sound enough, but some of us are in¬
clined to carry it too fan Our Experi¬
ment Station workers have pointed out the menace to the health and welfare of our citrus trees that lurks in the dead twigs and branches that are so often in great evidence in our tree tops. They are responsible for a long list of crimes against tree health.
Wither-tip, anthracnose, melanose,
stem-end rot and perhaps other dis¬
eases are carried over from one season to another in dead twigs and branches.
Time and time again this fact has been held up before our gaze, and still the dead wood remains in thousands of trees throughout the state. And we

t

wonder why our crops are light, and why our fruit does not carry well to market. The value of grove sanita¬
tion has been made plain to us, yet we have not done the things we know we should do.

For a number of years past the
United States Department of Agricul¬
ture has carried on a series of experi¬
ments in the handling of fruits and


vegetables in this state. From this work much valuable information has been gained and plainly set before us.
Is it too much to say that the results of these investigations properly ap¬
plied along the lines they have indi¬
cated would entirely revolutionize our fruit handling? Already a long step has been taken in this direction, but much yet remains to be done in apply¬
ing the principles laid down. Every one knows how to pick, handle and pack fruit, or if he does not know, there is no excuse for his ignorance, but it is not done as it should be. Were it only the individual who suffered it would not perhaps be so grave, but outside and beyond the individual is the good name of Florida, which every good shipper of good fruit adds lustre to, and from which every bad handler of poor fruit detracts. The benefits which should have come to us from the les¬
sons gained in fruit handling have fall¬
en very far short of what they might be, simply because we have not used the knowledge at our disposal.

Our orchards and groves and fields and gardens are unfortunately troubled by more pests in the way of diseases and insects than we like to have. The returns from our labor and investment would be larger and our peace of mind would be better were there fewer of them. One very important thing has happened, however. The causes of these diseases and the life histories of these insects have been studied and their mysteries and secrets laid bare, thanks to the efforts of investigators entrusted with these problems. The unexplored


32


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


area in this field of investigation has grown wonderfully small compared with the area of ignorance of a de¬
cade or two ago. Contrast, if you will, the days of resin wash and kero¬
sene, when the sprays applied did more damage than the insects they were used against, with the present, when miscible oil and soap sprays or water charged with the spores of friendly fungi are really effective without in¬
jury to the plants and we have some measure of what we have gained. But,
alas, this really wonderful store of knowledge is not drawn on to the ex¬
tent that it should be.

In Florida today there are numerous organizations, born of the hope that they may be more or less helpful to the people, and whereas there should be the fullest co-operation among these associations, there is too often instead,
petty jealousies and dissensions. Is it not time that these were banded on a common basis of action for the public good? Is it not time that petty squabbles and jealousies were laid aside and the whole welded together for the upbuilding of Florida’s great¬
est industry? Let us present a united front, not primarily for the individual,
but for the good of Florida’s products
—knowing that when we have estab¬
lished their reputation we have then


benefited ourselves. For nothing can benefit the people as a whole without each individual among the people be¬
ing benefited as well. We know that in co-operation there is much to be gained for all concerned, yet we do not act on the knowledge.

Now, do not think that my arraing-
ment is unduly severe for in a large way it is true and let us take this truth to ourselves: “We do not do as well as we know how to do ” I voice the thought of every worker in the ad¬
vancement of agricultural knowledge,
when I say that it is not lack of knowl¬
edge, but the lack of application of the knowledge that we already have,
that operates against the greater suc¬
cess that might come to us in our labors. In coming here for our meet¬
ings at this time—each one of us has had some object in view, perchance to meet our friends, perhaps to gain something of knowledge to assist us in our work, or maybe to accomplish something for the larger good, the ad¬
vancement of the horticulture of the state. But whatever may be the ob¬
ject, let us go back home resolved to put to practical use some of the latent power that knowledge has given to us and by so doing Jim and Jack and Bill will come more abundantly into their own.
