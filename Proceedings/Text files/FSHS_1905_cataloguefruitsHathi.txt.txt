CATALOGUE OF FRUITS.
ADOPTED BY THE SOCIETY AT THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING.
In making a complete Catalogue of the Fruits of Florida, indicating intelligi-
bly, in summarized and tabular form, the relative value of varieties for different sections, the wide-stretching territory, diversity of soil and climate, and the lim-
ited range of each of the numerous fruits, render it essential that the State be divid-
ed, so that regions allied throughout in their adaptability to fruits may be desig-
nated and referrred to. _
To this end, four districts have been formed, as described below. Geographi-
cal lines cannot be made to indicate pomological conditions with accuracy. More than approximate correctness could not be expected from an arbitrary division of this kind, especially where local conditions vary so greatly as in Florida. Work-
ing by general averages, some sections are unavoidably left in the wrong districts,
judging by the standard of local conditions. The divisions, however, will be found to answer their purpose better, than any that could be made without fur-
ther sub-divisions, which would be impracticable. ,
WESTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State west of the Au-
eilla river.
EASTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State between the Au-
eilla river and a straight line drawn across the State from the mouth of the St.
Johns river to Cedar Keys.
CENTRAL FLORIDA—That part of the State between the line above re—
ferred to and the counties constituting South Florida.
SOUTH FLORIDA—The counties of Brevard, Dade, Monroe, Lee, De-
Soto and Manatee.

CITRUS FRUITS.
SWEET ORA HG ES—Citrus aurantium.

Norm—The development of orange culture in this State has given rise to a multiplicity of varieties. man of which, while meritorious, have no distinctive qualities. or superiority. as compared with others. It has been deemed advisable to omit the names of many varieties which have disap-
peared from cultivation. The list, however, is still large.
The names in heavy type are designed to constitute a complete list for the State. embracing varieties of the highest excellence in all the desired characteristics of season, quality. distinctiveness,
productiveness. etc The names in light type are those whose characteristics are possessed in an equal or superior degree by other varieties which appear in heavy type. Some varieties in light type equal others in heavy type having the same characteristics but where there is a. difference it is in favor of the varieties in heavy type. In cases of equal excellence, the best known has the preference.'
Sothat the varieties in heavy type, as a whole, and without disparagement to other excellent sorts,
may be said to embrace the leading kinds for general culture New. or comparatively unknown varieties also appear in light type; but for this distinction see
"Adaptability" column.

Norm—In referring to the time of ripeningv in the column headed "Season", “very early" ap-
plies to varieties marketed in September and October; “earl ”. to October and November varieties;
“early medium", November and December; "medium", ecember. January and February; “late medium", February and March; "late". March and April; “very late". April, May and later.

Nona—The region of orange production proper extends southward from Central Florida.
overlapping the upper portion of Southern Florida. Therefore. under “Adaptability” below theva-
rietics have been starred for “Southern Florida"; here. however, the starring applies more particu-
larly to the upper portion of the district.

over ﬁve million boxes were produced in the season of 1894-95.
Tim NAVBL VAan'rms are much esteemed on account of the delicatetexture and superior quallty of their fruit. They are usually shy bearers, although experience indicates that they are much more proliﬁc upon "rough" lemon and trifoliata stock: than,as generally grown, upon orange stocks.

_<-._.c_s TKI Bacon VARIle are sweet, and therefore marketable, early in season, as indicated by the abbreviations in the “Season” column. At this time their distinctive character is not apparent,
and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts. As the season advances, their ruby tints develop, until-quite apparent on the exterior,and their qualitycontinues to improve until, at full ripeness, they are equaled by few and surpassed by none. In locations sufficiently exempt from frost t9_p,ermittheir being held on the trees until they reach perfection, they bring high prices and are exceptional] y proﬁtable. '
OTHER leTras.—Excluding the Navels, Bloods and Satsuma, noted above, and without dis-
paragement to other sorts of equal merit, the following are suggested as a desirable list for general planting, arranged in order of succession: Very Early, Boone, Sweet Seville; Early, Enter rise Seed-
less, Parson Brown; Early Medium, Nonpareil, Centennial; Medium, Pineapple, Jaffa, omosassa;
Late Medium. Majorca, Du Roi; Late, Bessie, Maltese Oval; Very Late, Hart Varieties distinctly marked in their exterior appearance, like the Navels, Bloods, Du Roi, etc.,
are, other things being equal, most desirable for market. ,

Rhianna—The Peach is successfully grown in localities throughout the ﬁreater part of the State, and in some districts is extensively produced for shipment to orthern mar-
Kets. As a rule, for this purpose, only those varieties are grown which are marked “earl ” and
“very early” in the above table, and which come in before the general crop farther north. 0 this there are some exceptions, notabl in Western North Florida, where some mid-season varieties, like Elberta, are successfully grown or shipment.
While the list of peaches grown in the State embraces many varieties, the various sections,
covering a wide range of latitude and longitude,diﬂer to such an extent in soil,climate and conditions of local environment, that the varieties adapted to a particular region are comparatively limited in number. A ﬁrst and vital essential to successful peach production is the adaptability of variety to llolcality; in general this is true of peaches to a greater extent than other fruits, and especially so in orida. ‘
No. 21 is of peculiar shape, being elongated, with deep suture, and sharp recurved point. It is very sweet as its name “Honey” indicates: This variety comes from China and is the progenitor of a race of peaches well suited to the central and northern sections'of the State. No. 38, the Peen-to, is also possessed of marked individual characteristics; its shape being ﬂat like a tomato. and unless grown with fertilizers rich in phosphoric acid and potash is apt to he possessed of a bitter almond or noyau ﬂavor. It comes from Southern China or Java and the varieties that have originated from it have given us a sub-tropical race of peaches well adapted to Southern and Central Florida. It is safe to say that nine-tenths of the commercial peach culture of peninsular Florida is conﬁned to the varieties that have been originated from the above two introductions from the Orient. It should be mentioned, however, that neither the varieties that have originated from the Honey or from the Pew-
to retain to such amarked extent the shape of the parent. Those that have originated from the Honey show a tendency to the recurved point but in a less marked degree. Those that have originated from the Peen-to are of regular peach shape. ‘

Ghana's—In many locations throughout the State varieties (as indicated by the starring above)
succeed well, and are grown for shipment to Northern markets as well as for local consumption and the manufacture of wine.
Fon Marmara—Delaware, Niagara, and lves (only) have proved a success as shipping grapes for distant markets (when properly packed). Diamond, on account of its compactness and tendency to crack, does not stand long shipment.
Fon Ran an.—Cynthiana, Norton and Ives are the red-wine grapes of Florida, as they are the red-wine grapes of the United States. Especially is this true of the ﬁrst two named; their juice is dark and rich in saccharine matter, and the wine made from these two grapes is said to possess great medicinal properties, owing to its large percentage of tannin.
F01! Wm]; Wm.—Elvira, Delaware and Niagara are, among the varieties above named, the best grapes for white wine—especially dry wine. It is from Elvira that the famous San Luis Sau-
ternes are made, which have established the reputation of Florida wines. Delaware is better adapted to the manufacture of sweet wine, and from Niagara a good dr wine can be made—much superior to the article made from Northern grown Niagaras, our Florida iagaras being almost entirely free from that foxy taste so prominent in all Northern Labruscas.

While new markets are often reluctant to take hold of it, wherever known it~sells well.
Nomenclature—While there has been much confusion in regard to the names of vari-
eties, the above kinds are now as well known as the leading varieties of other fruit; they embrace the most valuable kinds, and the names as given are correctly applied.
Characteristics—Some of the varieties have dark ﬂesh, others light ﬂesh, still others a mixture of the two. The light and dark ﬂesh differ radically in texture and consistency as well as appearance, and when found in the same fruit are never blended, but always dis-
tinct. The dark ﬂesh is never astringent; the light ﬂesh is astringent until it softens. The dark-ﬂeshed fruit is crisp and meaty, like an apple, and ls edible before it matures. Some of the entirely dark-ﬂeshed kinds improve as they soften, like Hyakume and Yeddolchi; oth-
ers are best when still hard, like Zengi and Tab ers No. 129. As they are good to eat before they are ripe, it is not so important that the dark-ﬂeshed kinds be allowed to reach a certain stage before being offered to consumers unfamiliar with the fruit. The light‘ﬂeshed kinds,
and those with mixed light and dark ﬂesh, are very delicious when they reach the custard-
like consistency of full ripeness. In some the stringency disappears as the fruit begins to soften, as the Yemon, and in a less degree with Okame and Tanenashi; in others it persists until the fruit is full ripe, as with Tsuru. The light-ﬂeshed kinds should not be otfered to con-
sumers unacqualnted with the fruit until in condition to be eaten. A person who has attempted to eat one of them when green and “puckery” will not be quick to repeat the experiment.
Seeds accompany the dark ﬂesh. The light-ﬂeshed kinds are seedless. The kind with mixed
ﬂesh have seeds in proportion to the quantity of dark ﬂesh. Hyakume, Zengi and Hachiya are usually overspread at the blossom end with penciling or net-work of dark lines, and this sometimes occurs in other kinds. , -
Varieties.—Tanenashi, Okame, Yemon and Yeddoichi excel in quality, perhaps in the order named. Okame (on account of the dliﬂculty of getting the fruits all in the same stage of ripeness) and Hachiya are not as good shippers as the others; the latter is valued for its immense size and showiness. Okame, on account of its long season, exquisite beauty, and superior quality, is the best for home use and local market Zengi and Tabers No. 129 are val-
ued for their earllness, as are Tsuru and Costata for their lateness. Oostata is very distinct and handsome in both tree and fruit. Hyakume is most generally grown of the dark-
ﬂeshed kinds. Tanenashi is, perhaps, most highly esteemedin the market Stock—The Kaki should be grafted on the native persimmon, on which it is much more satisfactory than upon its own or imported stocks.

;I‘hellianatee Dewberry, and the Northey, presumably a hybrid, have proved satisfactory in many oca ities.
Loqua'rs—Are grown in a small way for home consumption. They are adesirable fruit for table, as well as culinary use. At present the Loquat is propagated largely from seed, and the fruit varies greatly in size and quality. A number of varieties have been Introduced from California and are being tested.

from cold. In South Central Florida they require artiﬁcial ' heat to protect them from frost during the winter. Further North they cannot be successfully grown except under glass.
The S nish, Porto Rico, and Cayenne are gro'wn most extensively for market. The Egyptian Queen, and ernambuco are grown for market less extensively. These remarks apply to the East Coast. ' »'
w In the numerous and expensive shedded pineries of Orange County and the West Coast, which are cultivated on an intensive system, the Cayenne is planted almost exclusively.

COMMERCIAL BANANA CULTURE is conﬁned to the extreme lower portion of the peninsula.
Vanrs'rms.—The Baracoa is the ordinary Red Banana of commerce The Cavendish (M.
Cavendishii) is a dwarf species, also known as “Dwarf,” “Dwarf Jamaica," "Chinese."
Except the Orinoco, Hart's Choice has a more northern range than the other sorts. The Orinoco matures further north than any other variety, it is an ordinary plantain (M. paradisaica sapientumi as distinguished from the Banana or Sweet Plantain (of which Baracoa and Golden' are varieties); when allowed to ripen on the plant, it is of good quality, and desirable for home use, in sections too far north for other kinds.

Nuta.—The pecan has long been grown in the State in a small way; it ﬂourishes in many localities and its culture is proﬁtable. In addition to the four varieties above listed, other good varieties as yet only of local repute, will undoubtedly become prominent in the near future. The Japan chestnut, ot comparativer recent introduction, has proved fairly well adapted, but hardly worthy of extensive commercial culture. The Japan walnut, 01' still more recent introduction, bears well and makes a remarkably handaome tree, but is not up to the standard or the beat English walnuts in quality.
Extensive Cocoanut plantations are to be found on the southern coast. Little or no attention has been paid to varieties.

Bananas—Since 1895 strawberry culture has been largely extended, especially on the Western slope-of the peninsula. The Newnan has been allowed to degenerate and the fruit is now rather small for shipment. The Hoffman does better on clay than on sandy lands and needs high fertilizing.
The Cloud is vigorous in North Florida and stands drouth well; proliﬁc early in the season. Not liked so well in South Florida. Rising is very vigorous and proliﬁc. a ﬁrm berry and an ex-
cellent shipper. Its foliage, however, grows rather open and it does not protect its fruit well against a frost The Phenomenal seems to be almost identical with the Hoﬁman in physical characteristics.
but it has a longer season in South Florida. In Bradford county Aroma and Middleton's Early have been tested by individuals and reported on favorably. Glen Mary, Hood River, Dollar. Warﬁeld, Star,
Robbins Early, Splendid, Pride of Cumberland and Gandy have been tested and condemned. Klon-
dike is a recent introduction of great promise, and has been given a place in the list of desirable va-
rieties.
