Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth
Annual Meeting of the Florida
State Horticultural Society


When the members voted in 1914
for the next meeting* to be held in
Tampa, they went with promises of much in store for them, and they were not disappointed. The people of Tam¬
pa entertained the Society royally. One very interesting feature of their enter¬
tainment was the display they had in the Fair Building of things useful to the grower on his farm. They also gave a very pleasant morning to the members in the way of a vaudeville en¬
tertainment and moving pictures. Mr.
Hamner was untiring in his efforts to give individual attention to each mem¬
ber and help everyone have a good time.

Never before have the members re¬
sponded so willingly to help make our
Tampa meeting a success. The pa¬
pers were unusually good, and a full


report was made by each committee.
We were unusually fortunate this year in having with us Dr. L. H. Bailey,
former Dean of Horticulture at Cornell
University. His address was unusually interesting and his pleasant manner charmed his hearers. We hope to have
Dean Bailey with us again some time in the future.

When the question of next place of meeting was taken up, Arcadia, Or¬
lando and Fort Myers all sent invita¬
tions for the 1916 session to be held with them. When Arcadia invited the
Society at Palatka and Tampa took it away from her she said she would win out the next year. This year her dele¬
gates came to win, and they won.
Therefore the Twenty-Ninth Annual
Meeting will be held at Arcadia, Fla.,
next May.

Call to Order, Addresses of Welcome

and Responses


CALL TO ORDER


L. B. Skinner, Vice-President


Members of the Florida State Horticul¬
tural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen :

The meeting will please come to order.
I am very sorry, and I know you all feel the same way, that Mr. Hume is not here to start this meeting, but I promise you he will be here in a day at the latest;
sometime tomorrow, we hope. Mr. Hume is at Tallahassee working very hard and,


I

as we hope, successfully, to get our crop pest bill passed in order to save the orange and grapefruit industry of Florida from what apparently threatens its utter de¬
struction.

It devolves upon me to take Mr.
Hume’s place and to call the twenty-eighth annual meeting of the Florida State Hor¬
ticultural Society to order.


ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF TAMPA


Mayor D. B. McKay


Mr. Vice-President, Ladies and Gentle¬
men :

I welcome this convention to Tampa with very great pleasure and with the keenest satisfaction. I anticipate that this is to be one of the most important con¬
ventions ever held in this state. I have read the subjects that are to be discussed;
I have considered the make-up of your
Society, and I feel confident I am justi¬
fied in that prediction.


Tampa feels the keenest interest in your deliberations; our fortunes are bound up with yours. You represent the great¬
est industry of the state; this is its center.
We want you to feel confident of our co¬
operation, our sympathy and our interest.
If there is anything we can do to promote your welfare, to preserve your comfort or your happiness while your are here,
you have but to make your wants known.
L thank you. (Applause)

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


RESPONSE


Dr. W. F. Blackman, Winter Park, Fla.


Mr. Vice-President, Ladies and Gentle¬
men :

I have been asked to respond on be¬
half of, the Horticultural Society to these words of welcome by the mayor of the city, and I do so with great pleasure.
These words of Mayor McKay have been friendly, though few; beautifully so;
friendly, courteous, hospitable, nor have they been sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. We know they were sincere and honest. They represent the feeling of warm welcome which this kindly city gives to us as representatives of the fruit growing industry of the state. I trust we will act in such a way that we will not appear before the mayor’s court and in that way bring disrepute either to the city or the Society. (Laughter.)

This is the Valley of Baca spoken of in the Scriptures—where cigars are made in great abundance. (Laughter.) But it is also a town of very many other in¬
terests and enterprises of great impor¬
tance in many directions. When I think of what Tampa was about thirty years ago; a village, small, straggling, sandy,
ill-kept, and compare it with the Tampa of today, with its splendid buildings, its substantial banks, its newspapers, and re¬
alize the success that has made these things possible, I rejoice greatly, as a citizen of Florida, because this success be¬
longs not only to Tampa, but to the state


as a whole. We are all of us proud, of
Tampa; as proud as we are of any city in the state. (Applause.)

I want to tell Mayor McKay—I think he knows it—that we, the horticulturists of the state, are a body of very consider¬
able importance and force, and we de¬
serve these words of welcome. We think well of ourselves. We are the represen¬
tatives of the most ancient order in ex¬
istence ; we were old before there were any colleges, any doctors, any lawyers or preachers. We are older than the Ma¬
sons, the Knights of Pythias, the Odd
Fellows; not even the churches are so old as we nor so important, in some ways.
We trace our pedigree back to Adam and
Eve: they were the primary horticultur¬
ists, and from their day to ours there has been a splendid line of tillers of the soil on the earth, and we are the last and the best of them, no doubt. We are the primary foundation upon which our civi¬
lization rests; upon which nations rest,
and cities, and communities, and the whole order of men lives.

Time was when the farmer was laughed at; he was the butt of ridicule; the “rube,”
the “hayseed,” the “horny handed son of toil.” He is no longer so estimated.
He has developed into a scholar, a scien¬
tist, a philosopher. He is coming into his own and taking his proper place among the orders of men on earth.



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY

And this particular Society, as I re¬
flect upon it, seems to me to be worthy of the splendid men and women who have formed it and to whom it belongs. There have never been, so far as I know, a finer company of men and women than those who have gathered from time to time in the meetings of the Florida Horticultural
Society.

More than a quarter of a century ago,
when men were laying the foundation of the citrus industries in this State, men like Dudley Adams, and Dr. Inman and
Lyman Phelps, in the days when I was young and full of enthusiasm, how I loved to listen to them and read what they said in the papers. They were men of com¬
petency and culture, and quality and kindness. They are all gone from amongst us, but we still have with us men like our presiding officer, and Mr. Hart, and Mr.
Hubbard; some still remain of those fathers to show us what they were like.
There were giants in those days; giants in intellect.

There is something about the cultiva¬
tion of fruit, especially I might say, the cultivation of fruit in Florida, that ap¬
peals to what is fine and imaginative in men. There is a certain element of al¬
lurement and charm that does not go with all lines of work, by any means.
This work is developing a fine quality of men, and I think Florida is to be con¬
gratulated upon the kind of citizens who are tilling her fields.

I want to say a word, if possible, of encouragement and inspiration with ref¬
erence to Florida and its industries. I
trust we shall enter upon these meetings with high hope and good cheer. We have


not gotten as much money as we would like out of our fruits this year and we pause appalled before the canker and other threats of disaster. We have always been in a “funk;” always having some great disaster which is about to befall us,
and this year we have had our full of that sort of thing.

But how much happier we are than some. At least, we who are tilling with plowshares, are not handling swords.
When we are wielding pruning hooks,
we are not piercing men’s hearts. And we sit down in peace under our own vine and fig tree, instead of devastating the home and the hearth of innocent non-
combatants.

The Citrus Exchange states that oranges are coming up a little in the markets, and grapefruit are, also. So I
hope we may have a cheerful view of ourselves and our occupation, while we are together here.

When the doctors and friends said to me a little while ago “It is necessary for you to resign the presidency of Rollins
College,” and after a long struggle of spirit—for I loved the work to which thirteen years had been given—I con¬
cluded that this must be, Mrs. Blackman and I sat down together to plan what we should do. We were about to be foot¬
loose and free; the whole earth was be¬
fore us. Golden California^ \Vith its wealth of sunshine, New England with its green fields (and old maids), Sunny
Italy, where we had spent many happy days, Germany, now bloody indeed, but with its philosophy, its music and its cul¬
ture, the mystery of the Orient; wher¬
ever we wanted to go, we were free to










22


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


go. We thought of these places, and then we said, “We will stay in Florida.
We will live here together so long as
God gives'us to live, and when we shall cease to live on this earth longer, God grant that we may lie down together be-
‘ neath the pines and sleep until the resur¬
rection.’'

This decision of ours represented a very real and profound affection for, and be¬
lief in, this state and the people of this state. And so, being bidden to give up any considerable amount of work, I
bought a four-thousand-acre ranch, so that I might have room enough to lie down and rest. Then came a man who wanted to know if my orange and grape¬
fruit groves were for sale. I put upon them a price twice as much as they were worth and he turned away. I did not want to part with them.

So I hope you will be hopeful and joy¬
ous for the outlook of this State.

As a part of this message of cheer,;’!
want to read to you a poem about Florida.
When we decided we would live here and die here, I wrote down on a little card, a creed which was printed in the papers. I
daresay some of you have read it. This is the creed of a Floridian, and I hope you will join with me, with conviction and enthusiasm.

“I believe in Florida, land of the open and fathomless sky, of lambent stars, of mountainous opalescent clouds, of soft benignant airs, of incessant summer, of unstinted and vivifying sunshine, of re¬
sponsive and fecund soil.

“I believe in Florida, laved on every hand—cooled and warmed and cleansed and fed and decorated—by the azure and


teeming waters of tropic seas, and by countless and sparkling lakes and streams.

“I believe in Florida, land of wide-
stretching and open woods, of limitless green prairies and glades, of dense and vine-hung hammocks, of mysterious bays and swamps, all in their various forms lovely and fruitful; the land of fragrant pine and mourning cypress, of moss-draped oak, of waxen magnolia, of comely palm,
of regal poinciana, of flaming vine and of shy and brilliant orchid.

I believe in Florida, land of the orange and pomelo and spicy kumquat, of peach and pear and persimmon and loquat, of pineapple and guava and mango and avo¬
cado ; of corn and cotton and cane and cat¬
tle, and of whatever else is anywhere borne of trees or grown by the soil of the earth.

I believe in Florida, the home of crea¬
tures strange, curious and beautiful—the saurian monster, the gliding reptile, the darting dainty lizard, and aquatic mana¬
tee, the egret in snowy nuptial array, the roseate spoonbill, the exuberant mocking¬
bird, the flame-like, flute-like cardinal, the woodpecker with ivory bill and the hum¬
ming-bird with ruby throat, the painted butterfly sipping nectar in winter days.

I believe in Florida, land of romantic legend and adventurous history, of towns the most ancient and the newest, of swiftly growing cities, of farms and orchards,
and of wide and inviting solitudes still awaiting man’s coming.

I believe in Florida, magnet and meet¬
ing place for men and women of the
North and the South, the East and the
West, and countries over-sea, Americans all, one blended and indissoluble and free

people. I believe in her eager boys and winsome girls, in her schools and colleges,
in her churches of divers faiths, in her institutions of philanthropy and mercy,
and in her press, the voice and the instruc¬
tor of her common mind and will.

In fine, I believe in Florida, the com¬
monwealth old, yet young, unformed as yet, but palpitant with energy and faring forth into the future with high hope and swift step; and believing thus, I cove¬
nant with all her citizens of like mind to


give myself to her service, mind and heart and hand and purse, to explore and de¬
velop her hidden resources, to celebrate her praises truthfully, to win worthy citi¬
zens for her void spaces, to till her fields,
to keep pure her politics, to make more effi¬
cient her schools, to strengthen and unify her churches, to cleanse and sweeten her social life, and thus to make her in full fact what she is by human right and Di¬
vine dower,

The Oueen of Commonwealths.


ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE
D. C. Gillett, President Tampa Board of Trade


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

Representing the Tampa Board of
Trade, I heartily appreciate this oppor¬
tunity and the privilege accorded me in being permitted to bid you a sincere and cordial welcome to the most prosperous and progressive city of Florida—and des¬
tined to be the greatest city of the South.

We people of Tampa believe that state¬
ment, and we are strenuously and stead¬
fastly working to that end with a firm and an abiding faith.

As a member of your organization, and keenly alive to its usefulness and possibili¬
ties, I feel a personal pleasure in extend¬
ing to you the hospitality of my home town. I want all of you to come to know
Tampa as she is, and to believe in her as she is to be.

It seems to me that it is peculiarly ap¬
propriate that the State Horticultural So¬
ciety should meet here at this particular


time. Tampa business men have just had a revival. We have all joined forces,
and in a systematic and persistent way we are going to exert our every effort in the determined endeavor to build a greater and a better city.

We know that primarily and funda¬
mentally all wealth comes from the soil,
and that every city, in large measure, is necessarily dependent on the surrounding country, and we realize that as the terri¬
tory tributary to us grows and prospers,
just so will we thrive and attain to civic greatness—if we do our part.

Our revivified Board of Trade will be divided into departments, and one of the departments which will have our most thoughtful and persistent attention will be known as the Bureau of Agriculture.

The men of Tampa know and appreci¬
ate the worth and importance to a city of the farmer, the fruit grower and the







24


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


stock raiser, and we are going to widely and loudly proclaim the merits and the rewards of the calling which you men rep¬
resent, and we are going to invite the dis¬
satisfied thousands of other states to come and cast their lot among us.

We will preach the doctrine of the soil,
and recommend that they get close to
Mother Earth and delve into Nature's secrets, assuring them that they will find not only that wealth which all men crave,
but a veritable storehouse of happiness and contentment—and the life which God intended.

The country is the backbone of the city.
Among the cities of Florida, Tampa is the natural and logical center of the busi¬
nesses in which you are engaged, and while we expect to derive great and last¬
ing benefits from your industry and ad¬
vancement, just as all cities do from the country back of them, we want you to feel that you have our co-operation and sup¬
port, and that in every way consistently possible, we are spending* our time and our money in the promotion and ene©ur-
agement of the things you represent. We intend to give you ample proof of this in the years that are just ahead.

But, I digress. I have not forgotten,
though, that I was to extend the hand of welcome, but sometimes I get so enthused about Florida as a land of fruit and vege¬
tables, of palms and flowers and hidden wealth, that, were it geologically possi¬
ble, I would be inclined to believe that the
Garden of Eden had been located here.

Voicing the sentiments of the business men of Tampa, I want to bid you a wel¬
come which will not end with your de¬
parture. As an organization, or as indi¬


viduals, you will always be welcome to a share of anything we have.

Today, we offer you as many as you can smoke of the 4,000,000 cigars which our factories will make during the four days that you are with us;

We offer you the use of a land-locked harbor and a twenty-four-foot channel;

The use of 75 miles of paved streets and boulevards, and 52 miles of street railway;

The use of 82 miles of gas mains, and complete possession of our two and one-
half miles of bright White Way;

We offer you the use of 5,500 auto¬
matic telephones, and for irrigating as well as drinking purposes'', 4,500,000 gal¬
lons of pure water each and every day.

We offer you the use of our clubs and the hospitality of our homes; we offer you our fine hotels and our public build¬
ings and the strength of our financial in¬
stitutions, and in the future years, as we grow in wealth and in those things which make for greatness, we hope to share our prosperity and our successes with you.

On behalf of Mr. Louis A. Bize, Presi¬
dent of the Citizens Bank and Trust Com¬
pany, I extend to the members of this As¬
sociation a cordial invitation to view the city of Tampa from the top of their ten-
story building, Citizens Bank and Trust
Company. On behalf of Mr. J. T. Ma¬
honey, President, I extend to the mem¬
bers of this Association the courtesy of the Tampa Yacht and Country Club. On behalf of Mr. Frank Bentley, Vice-Presi¬
dent, I extend to the members of this As¬
sociation the privilege of the Tampa Au¬
tomobile and Golf Club. On behalf of
Mr. George Steelier, President, I extend



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


25


to the members of this Association the courtesy of the German-American Club.
On behalf of Mr. A. L. Cuesta, President,
I extend to the members of this Associa¬
tion the courtesy of the Centro Asturiano.
On behalf of Mr. R. T. Joughlin, Exalted


Ruler, I extend to the members of this
Association the courtesy of the Elks Club.

Just as we do today, so will we always welcome you, collectively and individually,
with all the cordiality contained in that one word—welcome.


RESPONSE

A. P. Spencer, Gainesville, Fla.


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

It gives me a great deal of pleasure to respond to the address of welcome.

My first visit to this city was the time of the meeting of the Pomological Society here in 1911. I know that what Mr. Gil¬
lette has said comes from the bottom of his heart and that it is prompted by the
Board of Trade of Tampa. I am pleased to note in his remarks that they have es¬
tablished in their Board of Trade what is called an agricultural bureau. This is a step in the right direction, and I should like to see Jacksonville and other cities doing the same thing. In our work at the University and in the extension work,
we require the support of the horticultural and agricultural people of this state, and
I am pleased tO' say that we are receiving that support, and receiving it in a most satisfactory way. I want to say some¬
thing especially good about Hillsborough
County. We feel that the work is going along more smoothly because we have the backing of the agricultural bureau and its superintendent. This is very gratify¬
ing and encouraging indeed.

Mr. Gillette has ^offered us a great many attractions. He spoke of the 4,500,-
000 gallons of water per day we are in¬


vited to enjoy. It reminds me of the old lady who had not had very much to eat,
and the preacher came along and told her she should pray for what she wanted, so she got down on her knees and said, “Oh,
Lord, send me a barrel of flour, and a barrel of pork and a barrel of meal and a barrel of salt and a barrel of pepper—oh,
no, Lord, that’s too much pepper.” So that 4.500,000 is more than we need.

There is one thing that I regret; that is, that the President of the Society can¬
not be with us. There was another gen¬
tleman who promised to be with us and bring with him a membership of 1500.
I don’t see him, either.

I want to close my remarks about here.
I predict for you a happy sojourn in this city of Tampa. I have been here many times since my first visit; I know some¬
thing of Tampa and something of her hos¬
pitality, and we will not regret that this meeting is held here. I hope we may see a great deal of each other in our meeting here. I believe our Horticultural Society will have one of the best and greatest meetings it has ever had, in view of the fact that we have some very important legislation now before the legislature in
Tallahassee. I thank you.

SOME REMARKS

B. L. Hamner, Secretary Board of Trade


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen :

These men have been given weeks to prepare a speech; they give me half a minute to come up here and make an ad¬
dress. I take it they do this because they have run short on the program and the
President, who was to deliver an annual address, has failed to deliver the goods.

Now, I am not going to make the Presi¬
dent’s annual address.

I remember the first meeting of the
State Horticultural Society I attended,
and I sat down in the audience and I won¬
dered what it took to become a member.
Now, if there is anybody in this audience who does not know what it takes to be¬
come a member of the Horticultural So¬
ciety, let me inform you that it takes $1.00,
and you sign your name, and you hear these fine addresses, and when the report is printed you get your copy.

Mr. Skinner has said I am here to get the money; that is my place on the pro¬
gram on this occasion, and I will live up to it. I do not want anyone to lose the opportunity of becoming a part of this
Society. This Society is made up of those who are interested in seeing our country prosperous, from a horticultural and agric¬
ultural standpoint.

Now, if you want to know what you are going to get for your dollar, let me tell you; tomorrow, and the next day and the next day you will hear from those who know whereof they speak; men who are trained in horticultural and agricultu¬


ral lines. It is worth a dollar to hear any one of them talk upon the subject assigned to him. In addition to that, every word of the speeches and the discussions is ta¬
ken down and reduced to writing, and that is put into a bound volume that is de¬
livered to you about the month of August,
and that book alone is worth from $5.00
to $10.00; they are treatises upon the sub¬
jects of horticulture and agriculture, and

I don’t want anybody to leave here with-

*

out becoming a member of the Society,
and if you are once a member, you are always a member, provided they do not take the meetings so far away that you cannot get to them.

Tampa will try to entertain you during the next three days, and tomorrow we will have 1500 people in attendance at the meetings. We promised that to you last year and we are going to deliver the goods, so you will appreciate that we can¬
not provide the usual form of entertain¬
ment ; it would be an impossibility to pro¬
vide enough automobiles to carry this large crowd about the country, so if you will be here, in this room, next Thurs-

*

day morning, you will see what we have provided for you.

I don’t want any of you to overlook the exhibits we have put here for your en¬
tertainment. Immediately back of the
Tampa Bay Hotel, in the ball ground, is what is known as the Woman’s Building.
In that building is an exhibit of anything that was ever advertised in the Florida

Grower, and these gentlemen can tell you how to spray and take care of your groves and your farms, and you can purchase there the things you want, and the men will tell you how to use it. Then you wiH find irrigation and spraying outfits,
which will be demonstrated and in actual operation, irrigating and spraying trees in the park. Then in the front porch and the hall there is fruit and exhibitions of paper with which to wrap your fruit.
Then, on Thursday, there will be another demonstration, and I am going to men¬
tion this because your chairman this even¬


ing is too modest to mention it; there is going to be demonstrated automobile trucks in the heaviest sand that can be
* found, with the idea of getting the grow¬
ers in this state to realize the advantage to be gained by using these trucks, thereby reducing their cost of operation in haul¬
ing fruit from the grove to the packing house. You will find other exhibits scat¬
tered around through the hotel; there is an exhibit of pianos in the parlor.

We want you to take in all these ex¬
hibits and the entertainment we offer, and we will ask you to come again to Tampa.


INTRODUCTION OF QUESTION BOX


Okie C. Painter, Secretary


For the past several years it has been customary to the opening of our meet¬
ings for the Secretary to present to the members of the Society the Ques¬
tion Box. If you have any questions you would like to have asked and do not have a chance to ask them from the floor, if you will write your ques¬
tion on a piece of paper and drop it


in the box, your question will be an¬
swered from the platform some time during the meeting. These questions and answers are always made a part of the report when issued.

The Question Box has been of great help to many of the members in the past and I strongly urge you to make use of same.
