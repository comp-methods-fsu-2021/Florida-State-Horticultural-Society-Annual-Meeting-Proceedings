Address of Welcome.
BY MAYOR G. M. NOLAN.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In looking over this large audience I see
a great many familiar faces, emphasizing
the fact that you are not sojourners in our
beautiful State nor strangers in its metro-
polis, but one of the oldest organizations
in the State and one of its staunchest pil-
lars of prosperity. I am glad also to see so
many ladies, fair daughters of Florida,
present, and congratulate you and the
Florida State Horticultural Society upon
the large attendance at the opening of
your eighteenth annual session.
Mr. President, the city of Jacksonville
as you know has now become one of the
greatest convention and assembly meeting
places in the country. I may tell you in
advance, that the gentleman who will fol-
low me in an address of welcome on be-
half of the Board of Trade of this city,
Captain C. E. Garner, will inform you
that these annual meetings of societies and
conventions keep the mayor almost con-
stantly on his feet delivering welcoming
addresses, and that I have a cut and dried
speech which I deliver to every one of
them. While it is true that it is one of the
most important functions of the mayor-
alty, these privileges are a great pleas-
ure to me, and these annual meetings of
the various societies are a great beneﬁt
not only to the city of Jacksonville, but to
the State at large as well. I am not here
to give you a cut and dried or second hand
address of welcome, for of all the socie-
ties that hold their annual sessions in this
city, none of them are, I wish now and
here to assure you, more heartily welcome
than the Florida State Horticultural So-
ciety, whose great work, past and future,
for the interests of the great State of
Florida, has been basic, and it is and will
continue to remain one of the staunchest
foundation-stones of the prosperity of this
State.
Mr. President, I must confess that I am
not sufﬁciently versed in the nomenclature ‘
of Horticulture to know or deﬁne its
limitations. My idea, however, is that
horticulture embraces everything at least
that would not properly come under the
generic term of agriculture, and of neces-
sity it must include some of the arts of
agriculture, I therefore conclude that it is
esthetic agriculture, it gives us the fruits
and ﬂowers of the gardens and orchards
of the homes, rather than the products of
the broad acres, and as the State of
Florida is destined to become the garden
and orchard of this country, the great
work of your society is of the greatest in-
terest to the prosperity of the State of
Florida. Indeed Mr. President I have
perceived and do perceive, as must every
onewith common knowledge of your great
work, that upon your endeavor and
achievement rests in a great degree the
name and the fame of the great State of
Florida.
Now, Mr. President, should I attempt to
catalogue the vast collections and varieties
of the fruit of the orchard, the ornamen-
tals of the garden, tropical and semi-
tropical, with which every active member

I4 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
of your society is doubtless familiar, I
should become bewildered. The greatest
ancient achievement in horticulture was
perhaps the hanging gardens of Babylon,
from whence transplanted from Persia we
know came the rose, apple, pear, quince,
pomegranate and the peach—there, Mr.
President, at the mention of the luscious
peach. I can proceed no further. I do not
say this with any disparagement against
any of the other of our great family of
citrus fruit, the orange, the grapefruit, the
plum, the apple, but the vision and aroma
of peaches and cream makes oratory suc-
cumb to appetite, and I must stop. (Ap-
plause.)
Mr. President, in conclusion, I have the
great honor to tender to you the keys of
the city, and to extend to you and each of
you a double, thrice welcome to the City of
Jacksonville, the Metropolis of your State,
and bespeak for you a session of great
beneﬁt to the State as well as of pleaSure
and proﬁt to each of you individually, and
as a society.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.
BYCAPT.C.E.GARNER.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
On behalf of the Board of Trade as its
president, and as representative of the
business interests of the City of Jackson-
ville, I desire to extend to you, to the
Florida State Horticultural Society and
to each of you individually and collective-
ly a most hearty, cordial welcome to our
City. I wish to reiterate what has been
said by the Honorable Mayor who has
just preceded me, that Jacksonville has
become one of the greatest convention and
assembly meeting places in this country.
There are at the present moment several
other organizations and societies holding
their annual sessions in the city, moreover
these conventions and gatherings are not
conﬁned to those of the State, they come
here from all over the country to hold
their annual meetings. Many of these
dates being arranged for during the win-
ter months in order that they may enjoy
the balmy climate of our fair State for
their deliveratioﬂs, Mr. President, I wish
here to assure you that, of all of these
societies, none of them are more welcome
than the Florida State Horticultural So-
ciety, indeed we claim you as one of us, to
you, to your great work, is due in a great
measure the renown of our fair State.
Mr. President, I wish at this time to
invite the attention of your society to a
movement in this State which in my judg-
ment, if properly handled, will prove of
much beneﬁt to the State and to the Horti-
cultural interests of this State. I refer to
the effort now being made to the trans-
planting of a Japanese Colony in Florida.
The Japanese. Mr. President,as you know,
are essentially a horticultural people, and'
I believe if this movement receives the
encouragement it merits that the State
will be greatly beneﬁtted, especially the
horticultural interests of the State.
Now, Mr. President, after you have lis-
tened to the eloquent address of the Hon_
orable Mayor, you will perhaps be inclined
to expect me to soar into similar ﬂights of

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 15
oratory, this I am unable to do, it has
always been my portion to follow the
Honorable Mayor, and he has the happy
faculty of covering the very points on
which I would address you. This he does
with. so much grace and elegance that it
would be folly for me to undertake to
improve upon it, therefore I crave your
indulgence in that direction, but when it
comes to the cordiality of the welcome that
I am commissioned to extend to you, that
is peculiarly my province, and where I
may fail in eloquence, I hope to come up
to the measure of a counterbalance in the
fullness and completeness of this privilege.
In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish to
announce that the Board of Trade has
planned and arranged for a portion of
your entertainment, a trip up0n the beauti-
ful St. Johns river on the good Steamer
May Garner, which is duly announced
upon your program.
Trusting that the deliberations of this
your eighteenth annual session, will prove
to be of much pleasure to the society and
of beneﬁt to the State, and with as-
surances of .that welcome which is yours
as of right as your home, I bid you again
a most hearty, cordial welcome.
Response for the Society.

~I
BY C. T. McCAR'I'Y.
Mr. Mayor and Mr. President of the
Board of Trade, and Mr. President of
the Florida S late Horticultural Society,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It affords me inﬁnite pleasure to be
given the opportunity to reply to the glow-
ing and cordial words of welcome to
which we havelistened with so much pleas-
ure, uttered by his Honor, the Mayor of
the City of Jacksonville, on behalf of its
citizens and the President of the Board of
'Trade, representing the great commercial
interests of this Metropolis of the great
State of Florida. The address of we]-
come of modern times has become an ora-
tion—a poem, and it has been made the
occasion for the display of wit and wis-
dom, oratory and rhetoric of some of the
most brilliant and far-seeing of our fellow-
countrymen. The responses to the ad-
dresses of welcome have necessarily had
to keep pace with the character of the ad-
dresses themselves. This has imposed
some hardship upon those who are called
upon to respond to these eloquent ad-
dresses of welcome.
Jacksonville is to—day pre-eminently the
Convention City of the State. Within her
portals she has harbored and entertained
during the last year the various Conven-
tions that have represented the great Busi-
ness, Commercial, Horticultural and
Agricultural enterprises of the State. In
the progress of these Conventions you
have developed some trained Orators, in
the persons of your magnetic and eloquent
Mayor, and your sound and far-sighted
President of the Board of Trade. Among
the splendid efforts that. they have made
in the past, none, we think, exceeds those

glowing speeches to which we have to-
night listened.
Th_e lover, whose eloquent words of en-
dearrnent and encouragement are breath-
ed into the ear of his beloved, tells but little
that is new. He repeats the same old,
old story, but it is always fraught with
magnetism and poetry for the loved one
who hears it. This shall always continue
to be the case so long as Humanity shall
continue to remain true to those high and
holy instincts that have characterized it in
the past.
The mother standing on the threshold
of the Home, who receives to her bosom
the long-absent son, speaks a few broken
words of welcome and receives in re-
sponse a few words of gladness and com—
fort, only an interchange of expressions of
welcome of the mother and the response
from the glowing heart oithe son. In
both of these cases the phrases spoken
were reduced to the plain, “Thou art wel-
come” and the response that the welcome
“is appreciated and reciprocated,” what-
ever is said means the same.
But in_ the evolution of these civic and
fraternal gatherings these addresses of
welcome and responses have grown to
things of beauty and things of great pro-
portion, and among the various illustra-
tions of such beautiful addresses, those
we have listened to to-night stand pre-
eminent. I do not hope to be able to give
ﬁt utterance to the feelings that well up
within me in attempting to-night to re-
spond to these eloquent addresses. I can
only assure you, Mr. Mayor, and Mr.
President of the Board of Trade, that
what my words shall lack in oratory and
logic they shall amply make up in sinceri-
ty and cordiality.
This Society in its travels about the
State, has visited nearly all of the prin-
cipal cities and towns. We have been to
far-off Pensacola; we have been down
to beautiful Tampa; we have enjoyed the
hospitality of the young and lusty Miami
by the Bay of Biscayne; we have dreamed
in the historic old St. Augustine, and en-
joyed its hospitality, we have enjoyed our
visit to Ocala and Ormond and to many
other places and at all of these towns and
cities we have listened to glowing words
of welcome by their distinguished sons,
and the Mayors of those proud munici-
palities. Our best efforts have been called
in play to reply to these words of wel-
comeand show our appreciation of the
hospitality extended to us everywhere we
have gone. O'n none of these occasions
have the words of welcome spoken. been
sweeter to us, or more ﬁttingly expressed
than at this hour. Your eloquent Mayor
is famous throughout the State for his
witticisms, his profundity and his elo-
quence. The President of your Board of
Trade has in his analytical and business-
like way nobly presented the sentiments of
the business element of this fair city who
have greeted us to-night.
A few years ago we accepted your hos-
pitality and before the meeting time the
ﬁery demon ran riot through your fair
city. The Fire-King added to his trophies
the destruction of beautiful Jacksonville.
He added your ﬁre to the history of cele-
brated ﬁres, those of Moscow, Boston and
Chicago. In your hour of fallen splendor
and buried glory we accepted the hurried
invitation of your sister City, St. Augus-
tine. We came as close to Jacksonville as
we could _well come and be entertained.
As soon as your recovery permitted, we
again accepted your cordial invitation to
hold our meeting in your midst. \Nc
came—and behold! a new city had arisen.
The spires of your churches and school

houses again pointed heavenward. Mam-
moth business blocks had arisen, adding to
your commercial prosperity and your
noble river was crowded with the com-
merce of the State, bound for the nations
of the earth. Your magniﬁcent railway
systems were taxed to their fullest
capacity in carrying t0 and from your
busy marts the commerce that was to glad-
den you and build up the entire state. We
enjoypd on that occasion, and on every
other when we accepted your hospitality,
sessions of the greatest success, marking
the greatest prosperity in the history of
our Society. Your sons and daughters
entertained us with excursions, with
music, with receptions, with everything
that became them and was worthy of the
City they represent. We are again
your guests. We see all around us new
evidences of that prosperity which not
only at this time characterizes Jackson-
ville, but the whole State of Florida and
the entire South.
Mr. President: In viewing the pros-
perity of this country at large we are
prone to forget its real importance. We
are likely to overlook the main things that
are bringing to pass this commercial and
business prosperity. To-day there are
two great industrial enterprises on foot
that shall stamp their impress upon this
country, that shall give it new' impetus. 1
refere to the great Panama enterprise and
the extension of the East Coast system of
railroad to the distant island of Key
West. Of the latter I wish especially to
speak and ~in speaking of it I feel that
I represent not only the people of the
South and the people of the State of
Florida, but in a special way,¢he business
of the Florida State Horticultural Socie-
ty. It has been well said that, “The his—
tory of a country is the biography of her
great men.” In dealing with this im—
m-ensebusinessenterprisetheextensionof
railroad facilities to the Island of Key
West, we must necessarily consider the
part played in it by the Friend and Patron
in the development of what was but a few
years ago the wilderness known as the
East Coast of Florida. That wilderness
became the object of attention of one of
the great Captains of Industry of the
twentieth century. In it he beheld vast
possibilities. Actively and indomitably
he pushed forward step by step south-
ward until the shores' of the Indian
River were reached. Onward, still on-
ward, until beautiful Lake Worth was
bound to Jacksonville by ribs of steel.
Here a pause was made until the beauties
of the Bay of Biscayne were brought to
light by this indomitable developer. Then
he pushed forward into the country of the
Seminoles, the country of the everglades
the faraway tropics of the State. Every-
where palaces of beauty arose. The vari-
ousindustriesofthe sections touchedwere
developed. Splendid facilities for trade
and commerce were afforded and the East
Coast became the Shibboleth of the Home-
seeker, the Tourist for pleasure and those
in search of health. And to-day the stu-
pendous announcement is made that this
Captain of Industry is determined to link
the isolated Key West with the balance of
the state and of the nation. At what cost
of energy and of capital I dare scarcely
guess. That it is one of the most stu-
pendous enterprises of modern times 15
admitted by all, and yet the Wizard of
the East Coast, with vision sharpened by
experience and with the courage of the
man of affairs, and above all with the love
for his State which has strengthened
with the passing years, is eager to under-
take this great enterprise. A glance at the

map of the State will show the splendid
geographical situation of Key West as
entrepot of the commerce of the West In-
dies, of South and Central America, and
the far-off Paciﬁc Coast via the Panama
Canal. It requires no prophet to foresee
the prosperity and the development that
will follow the completion of this enter-
prise, and that it will be completed, and
within the lifetime of its great originator
I have no doubt. Where has that brain
expended itself for the betterment of a
locality, for the accomplishment of a
great purpose—and ever failed? On that
progressive escutcheon only the word
“SUCCESS” is engraved. In that great
heart only sentiments of generosity ﬁnd
a lodgment, That ample purse is always
open for the development of new 'enter-
prises and the addition of new resources
to the commerce and industries and en-
lightenment of the age.
Mr. Chairman: I know not what the
generous people of Jacksonville have pro-
vided in the way of entertainmentfor this
society, but if the experience of the past
is to be the prophecy of the future that
entertainment will be ample, delightful
and worthy of the guests and of the hosts.
On behalf of the Society I extend to the
people of Jacksonville a cordial invita-
tion to attend our sessions,to partake with
us in the deliberations that shall come be-
fore our Society. We are here, not alone
for entertainment, and pleasure, but for
work. In the every-day experiences of
the Horticulturist there are problems to
solve, questions to answer, that call for
the wisdom of all of our members and in
the solution of these problems will be
found the key to our success. It will
afford us extreme pleasure to see as many
of the ladies and gentlemen of Jackson-
ville present at our meetings as can con-
veniently attend.
Mr. President, in conclusion I desire to
thank most cordially the people of Jack-
sonville through their_ distinguished
Mayor, and the business interests of Jack-
sonville, through the President of the
Board of Trade, for the cordial welcome
they have given us; the words of cheer
they have spoken, the high and noble pur-
poses to which they have called us, and
when the Session of 1905 shall have pass-
ed into history, we trust that the work
done in this meeting. its joys and its pleas-
ures will endure as a memento of the Pros
ent and a prophecy of the Future.

President’s Annual Address.
BY G. L. TABER. \
Members of the Florida State Horticul-
tural Society; Ladies and Gentlemen:
The message that I bring you to-day is
of the woods. It is written in the midst
of what is, to me, a most interesting
thicket, covering an area of some thirty
acres, which for seventeen years has been
protected from ﬁre. The particular trees
under which my impromptu seat is placed
are Liquidambars; seventy-ﬁve to ninety
feet tall and from eighteen to twenty-four
inches in diameter, The four trees that
remain of this older generation are the
survivors of many protracted and unequal
battles. At the ground, their still open
wounds bear mute evidence of the ter—
rible onslaught of ﬁre that destroyed
their comrades. Higher up, their trunks
are covered, for the distance a boy can
reach, with healed-over scars, where
youngsters of twenty years ago had made
incisions for the liquid amber to collect
and harden into the prized chewing, or
sweetgum—from which the common
name of the tree is derived.
Everywhere, individually and in clus-
ters, throughout the basic pines of the
thirty acre thicket, is a younger progeny
of lusty trees of many species. As is ﬁt-
ting the giant Liquidambars, the largest
deciduous tree in this particular thicket,
are rearing up a younger brood and their
light green, starry, maple-shaped foliage,
as it glints in the sunshine against the
darker background of the pinesy presents
an effect no less pleasing than that of the
tops of the giant parents as outlined
against the sky.
Less than ﬁfty feet from the large
Liquidambars, stands another gum but of
a different genus—the so-called black or
sour gum, Nyssa sylvatica. This is also
a stately tree but of a very different habit
of growth from the Liquidambars; for
while the former send out their branches
at an oblique angle and are inclined to
climb skyward, the latter sends out
branches more nearly at a right angle,
and often clustered, in such a way as to
offer the fantastic suggestion that one
might cut from the trunk a succession of
naturally grown wagon hubs in which the
spokes are already set.
A few feet farther on stands an Ameri-
can Holly, the shiny broacl-leaved, spiny-
toothed Ilex opaca. At all seasons of the
year, this is a most beautiful tree but par-
ticularly striking during the winter
months when its smooth, light colored
bark, bright green foliage and abundance
of scarlet berries accentuate the fact that
the most rigorous winters we ever get in
the Southland possess no terrors for it.
In speaking of hollies, this is the species
that we naturally associate with the name,
and yet it is much less frequently seen
than other species of Ilex—many of
which we pass by with but little thought
other than that they are graceful shrubs
or trees as the case may be. In this thick-
et. there are at least six different species
of Ilex, as follows: llex opaca_ as above

described.
pointed, smooth foliage, and which also
bears an abundance of yellowish red
berries, Ilex verticillata, with smooth but
darker colored bark, foliage somewhat
serrate, and, as its name indicates, of slen-
der, upright growth. Ilex cassine, found
in abundance in this section, around the
edges of shallow pondsor bay heads ;rang-
ing in height from three to twenty feet,
and, during the winter, covered with ber-
ries of a color varying from scarlet to red-
dish-yellow. This is the very small-leav-
ed species sometimes called “Yaupon”
and “Ilex vormitoria.” Its leaves are
supposed to have a medicinal quality as in-
dicated by the latter not particularly at-
tractive name—or at least attractive, in
its signiﬁcance, only to one who might be
possessed of a feeling that his stomach
was overloaded. Equally in evidence,
handsome shrubs when growing in
clumps in congenial situations, are Ilex
lucida and Ilex glabra. Some of you may
think that nothing possessing the com-
mon name of gall-berry should be men-
tioned among desirable plants; and yet
varieties which carry this distasteful name
and that come under the above named
species are, with their lustrous dark, ever-
green foliage and shining black persistent
berries, more attractive as a part of Na-
ture’s handiwork than some of the less
thirfty exotics—even if possessed of
more euphonious names—with which the
average horticultural gardener might be
inclined to supplant them.
In further reference to names, I would
say that it is not the purpose of this ad-
dress to pick a bone with the champion of
either botanical or common names; nor
to air any slight amount of knowledge the
writer may possess. Common names may
be however, in some cases. very inade-
‘
Ilex dahoon with oblong,
quate. For instance, Small gives “Win-
terberry” as the ernacular for three dif-
ferent species of Ilex; the smallest of
which, Ilex glabra, reaches a maximum
height of about ﬁve feet and the largest,
Ilex verticillata, a maximum height of
about twenty feet. We therefore see that
in gathering “Winterberries” we may
either go to the woods empty handed, or
carry along a twenty-foot ladder, accord-
ing to our own interpretation of the name.
On the other hand, gall-berry is not men-
tioned, as a common name, in any botani-
cal description I can ﬁnd although it is a
name commonly enough applied to
several species of Ilex, including Ilex
glabra and Ilex lucida. If we could
forever disassociate the name of gall-ber-
ry from the handsomer varieties of some
of these species of Ilex it would be equally
' desirable with that of striking the com-
mon, deprecatory name of stinking cedar
from the beautiful Torreya taxifolia of
the Apalachicola River, or the inappropri-
ate and entirely unauthoritative name of
Judas tree from the handsome Cercis
canadensis, or Red Bud.
In speaking of shrubs, we must not
overlook the cornus or dogwood which,
in its several varieties, is one of the ﬁrst
harbingers of spring. Its numeroust
clustered small ﬂowers—which present
the appearance of one large one—put in
their appearance in advance of the foli-
age; as do also those of the handsome
pink azalea or wild honeysuckle, the b0—
tanical name of which is Rhododendron
nudiﬁorum. Dogwood and pink azaleas
are very much in evidence in this par-
ticular thicket and it might be said that
the pink azaleas were establishing sub-
thickets of their own.
But if the handsome pink azaleas are
colonizing, our beautiful native yellow

jessamine, Gelsimium sempervirens, has .
already colonized; for,'~ running into the
fringe of the woodland, it has blanketed
the smaller trees without respect to genera
or species, and farther on, ﬁnding a com-
paratively open glade, has covered it as
with a carpet; although a carpet, it must
be confessed, that is badly frayed at the
edges and that displays a surprising ten-
dency to climb up anything that would an-
swer for chair or table legs.
Equally at home with the yellow jessa-
mine are the cat briars or sweet briars,
one of which, Smilax Walteri,produces an
abundance of coral red berries which, in
winter, as they hang from the then in-
conspicuous, leaﬂess vines, give to the
trees over which they run, the peculiar
effect of having formed a trust and settled
amongst their respective genera and
species, upon one particular fruit that they
will bear. The smilax, of which there are
many species, together with wild grapes
of the muscadine type, contest with each
other and with the yellow jessamine for
the honor of most quickly covering up de-
caying or decayed matter as well as the
height to which they will climb on any
natural growth of trellis-like formation.
I see I have wandered from large trees
down to shrubs and vines. Let us return
in the same way and, in passing, consider
the haws. Of these, the botanists list no
less than forty-seven species found grow-
ing wild in this' state, many of which are
decidedly worth cultivating, either as in-
dividual specimens or for hedges. In my
thicket, I have at least three species, all
handsome in ﬂower and leaf. They be-
long to the genus crataegus. It is one of
the same family as pyruséto which ap-
ples and pears belong.
Wild huckleberries, or vacciniums, are
also very much in evidence and one
species of these which assumes large,
shrub-like proportions—often reaching
a height of twelve feet—is very beautiful.
This is particularly true when in early
spring its delicate pink and white blos-
soms, on slender branchlets, are putting in
their appearance in advance of the foli-
age.
The bare mention of early spring
brings us back to two different species of
prunus. One Prunus angustifolia, our
common wild Chickasaw plum, with its
abundance of snowy white blossoms; the
other, Prunus serotina, our common wild
cherry, with its smooth, dark glossy bark
and beautiful, shining dark green leaves.
Both of these are amongst the earliest
trees to notify us that spring is at hand—-
the wild plum with its blossoms, the wild
cherry with its foliage. '
Almost, in the same breath, as far as
season of growth is concerned, we notice
ﬂames of scarlet, both isolated and in
clusters throughout our woodland.
These are the tiny young leaves and blos-
soms of the scarlet maple, Acer rubrum,
which furnishes a wealth of color during
its season of initial spring growth; con-
tinues it during the ripening of its keys, or
samaras, and grandly accentuates it again
later in the season when it begins to think
of disrobing for its winter nap.
Although the sweet gum does not have
the gorgeous spring coloring of the scar-
let maple, it vies with it in the fall and
both are surpassed, if such a thing is pos-
sible. by the black or sour gum. One
writer has said that if the leaves of sweet
gum and scarlet maple are ﬁery in their
fall redness those of black gum are a con-
ﬂagration. Of this, I have abundant
proof for standing by itself just outside
this thicket, and in plain sight of my ofﬁce
window, a magniﬁcent black gum has, for
i.

many successive years, impressed all be-
holders with the magniﬁcence and per-
sistence of its autumn color.
And here I wish to insert a word as to
character of growth—and this applies not
only to the Nyssas, or gums, but to many
other genera—which is that one must
bear in mind very closely the environment
when he is trying to identify a tree for
his own satisfaction or to describe it to the
satisfaction of others. The particular
black gum just referred to has, for in-
stance, a wide, spreading, well-rounded
top with branches that would sweep the
ground if, unfortunately, these lower
branches did not have to be trimmed, an-
nually, to keep open the road that runs be-
neath it. The gums in the river swamp
close at hand send up a sturdy hole for
many feet before signs of the ﬁrst decay-
ing or decayed branches give intimation
that the foliage,necessary to the tree’slife,
has had to climb higher and still higher
after air and sunshine. The crowding of
many trees into a space where but one can
fulﬁll its allotment of years offers an in-
teresting study in the survival of the ﬁt-
test, as well as the scope allowed by Na,-
ture in the form of growth the surviving
species may assume in the struggle.
If through dimness of vision, or ex-
treme height of our supposed black gum,
we are unable to differentiate the foliage
from that of the neighboring species, that
interlace it, let us use the convenient
hatchet we have brought along and cut out
a small section of root. This, in the deep
mold where alone our tree would have
grown tall enough to require such proce-
dure. will not materially injure it and, if
we have been correct in our guess, we can
take home a section of root so light and
corky in character as to be a handy substi-
tute for the bottle stoppers of commerce-
which are made from the bark of a par-
ticular species of oak. If, on the other
hand, we should happen to run across a
black gum in the open, its branches will be
so close to the ground that no hatchet or
root will be necessary to identify it; but,
if our quest has been made in the fall, we
may then carry home a few quarts of the
bluish-black, cherry-like drupe, that is its
fruit, and make it into a most excellent
jelly. '
But I have strayed from my thicket
into the clearing on the one side and into
the river swamp on the other. Let us re-
turn and for a few minutes examine the
genus to which so many complimen-
tary adjectives have been applied,—
grand. sturdy, time-defying—Quercus,
the oaks. They are here in abundance
and, like the Liquidambars, preempting
ground in the most lavish. way. The
outlines of their respective staked claims
are but dimly marked; and here again it
will be a case of “might is right” unless
some friendly hand decides in favor of
one over the other.
\Vhich shall it be; shall we interfere
or let them rustle for themselves? And
again, if we do interfere, shall we do so
without respect to families? Shall we
tell Quercus aquatica that he is, and
should recognize that he is_ a water oak,
and that it is both indecorous and ungai-
lant to ﬂaunt his ﬂaming spring habili-
ments in the face of his more sedate and
more permanently clothed relative, the
live oak, Quercus virens, from Virginia?
If we do tell him anything of this sort, let
us do it in a kindly way and impress upon
him that if he will take time to think it
over, he will at least look cooler.
However, perhaps it is best to say noth-
ing but just lie low and await develop-
ments. Our water oak will undoubtedly

I
show a hectic ﬂush again in the fall but
this may be one of either shame or choler
at having to disrobe for the winter. At
all events, his choler, if choler it is, will be
surpassed by both the sweet gum and the
scarlet maple, and all three of them out-
classed in this respect by the black gum‘.
But as even the dwarf, illy-developed
sumach seems to vie with its o’ertopping
neighbors in this direction, we will as-
sume that they have all merely eaten and
drunk to repletion and that the plethora
of fullness, as sometimes observed in their
two-legged neighbors, shows in their
faces,
In this connection, I would say that the
formerly accepted theory that highly
colored autumn foliage is due to the
action of frosts, has of late been widely
disputed. Careful investigation seems to
show that richness of tint in fall foliage is
dependent, to quite a considerable extent
at least, on the character of the preceding
summer. If the summer and fall have
been very dry, only low tints will be shown
in the foliage. If wet, high tints will de-
velop.
Still, I know one man, at least, who will
dispute the latter theory; the editor of a
paper very properly called “Above the
Clouds,” printed on top of Mount Wash-
ington, New Hampshire. I had the good
fortune to spend an evening with this
editor, last summer, in his rocky eyrie,
and he told me that the fall foliage was
much more resplendent as seen from the
top of the mountain than when viewed
from the valley. As his point of vision
was from an altitude of considerably over
a mile above sea level, and he was there-
fore above the trees, as well as, often,
above the clouds, he was necessarily look-
ing down into the tops of the trees instead
of looking up into them like ordinary
mortals. It may be that this inverted
angle of vision may have a bearing on the
subject. I did not think to ask his views
on this point. At any rate, he would have
seen more of the upper, and more highly
colored, side of the foliage than the most
of us, and with less intervening shadow to
dim its splendor,
But to go back to our thicket and our
oaks. Here are not only water oaks and
live oaks but the post oak, Quercus minor,
with its beautiful large ﬁve-lobed leaf, and
several other species besides, all of which
show more difference in individual speci-
mens than a casual observer would give
them credit for. And indeed it is an in-,
teresting study to pick out varieties of
these or in fact, any species of trees and
note the latitude of form that Nature
gives to her offspring. We must remem-
ber that botany stops, for the most part,
with species and that beyond these are in-
dividual characteristics as varied in dif-
ferent species of our forest trees as are
those in any species of fruit trees like the
orange and peach. If these forest species
produced edible, merchantable fruit, there
would be the same necessity for varietiz~
ing them as there is with the kinds we cul-
tivate in groves and orchards; but as they
do not, we simply pass them by with the
general remark that such a tree is a live
oak, the next a maple,'and so on. without
ever really becoming acquainted with. the
varietal characteristics of any particular
individual of a species.
Here, for instance, is a young sweet
gum with comparatively smooth. light
colored bark resembling a maple, and with
foliage too that, at a little distance, might
easily be confounded with that of the
maple. The lighter tint of green of the
sweet gum’s foliage might, however,
strike us at once and lead us to identify

it as a sweet gum. A little farther on,
we come to another tree, the trunk of
which is covered with peculiar, ridged,
corky bark and the smaller limbs and
twigs possessed of fantastically winged
appendages—the bark apparently fasten-
ed on edgewise—and we immediately
know it for a sweet gum.
Take also Ilex opaca, the spiny toothed
one known as American holly, and close
examination will show well accentuated
varietal characteristics in individual speci—
mens, some trees possessing much broad-
er leaves than others and the leaves hav-
ing much longer spines. I have mentioned
this particular species not that it is distinct
from others in the number of its varietal
changes but that the species itself is so
distinct as to be, we think, unmistakable.
We had best handle this word unmistak-
able with gloves, however, for its too free
and careless use has, before now, gotten
many a man into trouble. Indeed it is
strange how lacking in astuteneSs some of
us can be at times—0r at least I know I
can—and following is a case in point;
There is a half acre of comparatively
open ground in this thicket where tree
growth is much more sparse than any-
where else, and I have wondered, a dozen
times, why it (lid not grow up as fast as
the rest. But one day, all of a sudden, it
ﬂashed over me that, a few years ago, the
man with the mowing machine had been
there, appropriating bedding for the
mules. Any succulent new tree growth
that was mingled with the heavy crop of
wire grass was not suﬁicient to make it-
self apparent or to interfere with the
mower, and the mowing machine and
horse rake had denuded this particu-
lar half-acre of several successive
years’ accumulation, which would have,
by this time, turned into a heaVy mold and
been recognized as a ready seed bed by the
thousands of seeds that wait on proper
conditions to develop.
Just now, I am as interested as a boy,
watching development on-that particular
half acre. What particular species will
ﬁrst assert itself? The black gums and
sweet gums are pushing in from either
side. The pink azaleas have thrown out
skirmishers. A few scattering pines are
holding up their unlighted candles as if
awaiting instructions to proceed; and the
scarlet maple, which holds its growing
tips afiame all summer, in readiness for its
fall conﬁagration, is apparently proclaim?
ing “Come on, there is good footing here,
I will lead the way.”
I have not mentioned all the species to
be found in my thicket and those named
are not necessarily the same as would be
produced in other portions of the state.
Nature does not make exact reproduc-
tions of herself over any large given area.
Latitude, longitude, altitude, isothermal
lines, soil formations, proximity to bodies
of water, large or small, fresh or salt, run-
ning or stagnant; all of these things have
a bearing on what we may expect. The
point however is that we may not only
expect, but look forward with absolute
certainty to a reforestation of our denud-
ed lands if we will but keep ﬁre out; and
not only to reforestation of the land but
enrichment of the soil; for Nature’s forc-
es work continually toward conserving
and building up, instead of dissipating,
whenever they are allowed to do so.
This is one application of my thicket
story but by no means the only one; and
to more fully illustrate the next one, I
should like to take you with me, if we
had time, just over the fence, across the
road and into the borders of the fast run-
ning creek that during the rainy season.

rises to its full river dignity. By follow-
ing the crooks and turns of this creek and
up a conﬂuent that runs out of the ham-
mock a few miles away, we should see the
most of the species that we left in the
thicket and many more besides; innumer-
ably more than the upland pines and low-
land cypress which the traveler over our
public highways gives us credit for. Here
we should ﬁnd chestnut oaks, with most
magniﬁcent, broad, and as their name in-
dicates, chestnut-like foliage; ash of
several different species; the magnolia
family including both grandiﬂora and the
several varieties of bays; horn-beam or
iron wood; poplar, myrtle, laurel, birch,
alder, virburnum, farkleberry or sparkle-
berry, elm, several species of gums,includ-
ing the so-called ogeche lime; red cedar,
cabbage palmetto, and other species of
trees, shrubs and plants, which in wealth
of numbers or beauty of individuality
might easily divert us from our search for
those named.
And herein lies the broader applica-
tion of my thicket: Notwithstanding its
attractions I did not keep myself within
its conﬁnes, anymore than you will or can
keep yourselves within the conﬁnes of a
similar one, after you have become really
interested in it. Once one becomes inter-
ested in studying the various tree and
plant growths, in all their wonderful
varietal characteristics, he will not be con-
tent with any stipulated boundaries, but
will wander, as I have, over the fence, into
the river swamp and nearby hammock.
The more he investigates the more he will
wonder why he himself, or his native
town or village, has not drawn more free-
ly on home-grown plants for the purposes
of shade and embellishment—plants that
are growing at his very door and a
hundred times better adapted and more
satisfactory than many of the high-priced
exotics.
Once having become really interested in
the magniﬁcent growths about us, the
larger applications follow in rapid,
natural sequence. We will transplant
specimens that show natural advantages
for the purpose wanted to our own home
grounds. We will commence lining the
streets that lead by our homes with other
equally ﬁne specimens. A little effort will
induce others to becOme interested with us
and our home village will have its streets
lined with trees, and a village improve-
ment association whose ﬁrst thought will
be for their welfare. The trees thus
planted will themselves exert a salutary
and benign inﬂuence, which will show it-
self in many ways. Tin cans and other
extraneous, undesirable village adorn-
ments will be relegated to less conspicuous
places than formerly and even the profes-
sional village loafer with his perennial
jack-knife and dry goods box, will be
brought into line with those who have a
higher conception of life’s duties—or
_ pleasures.
Civic pride is not hard to enlist and par-
ticularly when that pride reaches out in a
direction that is of equal beneﬁt to all;
but one must ﬁrst become enthused him-
self before he starts to enthuse others.
This is a rule that applies to progress in
any direction, And I speak from actual
experience when I say that if in our re-
spective localities, we demonstrate our
tree-planting enthusiasm on our own
grounds, we will not ﬁnd it hard to in-
terest others in the same direction. In
our own little village, a few of us got to-
gether this year and planted out over 400
shade trees. I_ say few of us because the
town itself is small. Not a single man but
became immediately interested or soon fell

into line. The trees we used were water
oaks, live oaks, maples, sweet gums and
wild cherry—all growing wild in this im-
mediate neighborhood. Each street
planted was set solid to one or the other
of these species. Later on, other streets
will be opened up and either set out with
these or other species—plenty of which
yet remain to be drawn on. In other sec-
tions of the state, other species than those
we have used might be preferable. We
have them—all of us—in our respective
localities. If we are interested we will
ﬁnd out what theygare and, in ﬁnding out
surprise ourselves with the quantity and
suitableness of the material at hand.
When we have come into contact with
Nature’s plants and shrubs and vines in
all their lavishness of form and color, and
her native trees in all their stateliness and
grandeur, and have become not merely
superﬁcially acquainted but have, so to
speak, established friendly relations with
them, as individuals—instead of meeting
them as a collection of perfunctorily-in-
troduced and soon-forgotten strangers—
we shall experience a sense of loss in not
sooner having come into direct fellowship
with them; in not having earlier accepted
their proffered, standing invitation of
companionship.
Some years ago, I had the good for-
tune to drive through one of the most ma-
jestic avenues of live oaks in this coun-
try—situated at Audubon Park, New Or-
leans. The remembrance of their gran-
deur led me, a short time since, to obtain
authentic information in relation to these
Oaks. I ﬁnd that there are one hundred
of them in the park and that they are now
approximately sixty feet high and have an
approximate spread of one hundred feet,
with a trunk diameter of four feet or over.
These trees were planted in 1813 by Judge
Gayerre and his grandfather, Etienne de
Bore. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I do
not know anything more about Judge
Gayerre and Etienne de Bore than the in-
formation I have conveyed to you. They
may have done other deeds for which they
should be remembered but I submit to you
that for this one deed they deserved, and
in its accomplishment unwittingly erected
to themselves, monuments, not one but
a hundred of them, that will keep their
memories green and their names revered.
long after worthy expressions of their vir-
tues in costly stone or marble would have
been forgotten,
And so, to summarize, I would say to
you, get acquainted with the trees. In
doing so, you will derive pleasure and
beneﬁt. Protect them from ﬁre; in pro-
tecting them, you will serve your own
interests, together with those of the state.
Plant them around your houses and along
your highways; throughout the streets of
your respective towns and villages. From
a purely investment basis it will pay you
in enhanced value of property. From the
point of personal comfort, they will soon
repay you in shade, beauty and compan-
ionship. From a higher, beneﬁcent,
philanthropic standpoint, you will leave
an inheritance for which future gene-
rations will bless you.

Reminiscent Remarks.

By Major George K Fairbanks.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I thought it might be of interest to some
of you to hear a few reminiscences of one
of the oldest citizens of Florida. I came
to Florida in r842. At that time there
was no settlement on the east coast south
of Palatka or south of Micanopy in the
central portion of the State. The travel in
those days was by stage coach from St.
Augustine through Middle Florida to
Pensacola. The stage coach ride to Tal-
lahassee in those days was long and tedi-
ous, and only accomplished by relays, and ,
the best time that could be made was
about thirty miles a day, quite a difference
in the palatial travel now at thirty miles
per hour as a maximum. I remember the
I ﬁrst time I ever saw the city of Jackson-
ville, it was a very small place, with four
or ﬁve docks on the river front. The mail
was brought by boat from St. Augustine
by way of Picolata or brought over to St.
Augustine on horseback, twice a week,
and the arrival of the boat was the signal
for every man in town to go down to the
docks and get the news.
Tampa was in those days a mere ﬁshing
village, and Tallahassee a small town.
The principal industry in other than what
is known as Middle Florida was the get-
ting out of timber; in Middle Florida the
chief crop was cotton. Commerce was
carried on by schooner lines to and from
New York in the east and New Orleans in
the west. In those days the entire popula-
tion of the State did not much exceed the
population now claimed for the city 0f
Jacksonville. This remarkable develop-
ment of the State within the life-history
of one of her citizens is a very impressive
matter to reﬂect upon, and I doubt not but
that some young citizen now within my
hearing will ﬁnd the same degree of de-
velopment shall he live in the State as long
as I have, for in my judgment we are to
have one of the greatest and most densely
populated States in the Union. The
question has often been asked, why is it
that the State of Florida has developed
with such rapidity, especially the city of
Jacksonville, with no extensive back coun-
try to support it. This question is easily
answered. If_y0u will take your globe or
atlas and look the world over, ascertain
the peninsulas, you ﬁnd without ex-
ception that the peninsulas contain the
most dense populations on the earth, this
you will ﬁnd to be true without exception,
take the peninsula of Italy as a notable ex-
ample, and all other peninsulas. The
State of Florida you will ﬁnd is a very
narrow peninsula compared to a great
many of them, and it is my prediction
that within the life of many of my hear-

ers they will ﬁnd Jacksonville grown to
be a very'large city and the State of F lori-
da to be the most densely populated State
in the Union. I say this because we have
everything here necessary to sustain a
large and dense population, besides the
State has now come to be known as the
world’s sanitarium.
By George W. Wilson.
After listening to the eloquent address-
es that have been delivered you this even-
ing, I feel unable to add thereto. I hope
however to always be able to respond to
anything that will be of interest to the'
Florida State Horticultural Society. I
congratulate the society upon the large at-
tendance at the opening of this it’s eigh-
teenth annual session. I am not only in
sympathy with the great work of this so-
ciety, but I was once an ardent horticul-
turist myself, until varying vicissitudes
of life cast my lot in another direction,
that of journalism, during all of which
time I have never failed to take advantage
of every opportunity to foster and en-
courage your every welfare. I consider
the history of the development of this
State largely the history of the horticul-
turist; that it is largely due to the en-
deavor and achievement of the Horticul-
tural Society that has given the great
State of Florida the renown she to-day
enjoys, and as it has justly been said, in
your future endeavor and achievement
rests in a great degree the name and fame
of our State. When I speak in these
terms I speak with a great deal of signiﬁ-
cance, for I am informed that nearly 85
per cent of the horticulturists are .college
men, you are therefore prepared by ex-
perience, education, and training to cope
with the greatest interests for the welfare
of the State unhampered by political
afﬁliations or hurtful partisan motives.

Report of Committee on Diseases of Citrus.
By P. H. Rolfs.
Wither Tip.
This disease, which manifests itself in
so many different ways on citrus fruits,
continued to be exceedingly virulent dur-
ing the past year. The total amount of
damage done by this disease was, un-
doubtedly, greater during the last season
than any season heretofore.
Work upon it has been prosecuted quite
vigorously during the past year, and
some new and interesting facts have been
brought out. Considerable difﬁculty is
encountered from time to time because
this trouble is frequently complicated with
other disturbances. Any condition of the
orchard or of the fruit that low-
ers the vitality renders it more sus-
ceptible to attack from this fungus
(Colletotrichum gloeosporoides), so that
many trees and much fruit is found infect-
ed. Though this disease must be con-
sidered a secondary difﬁculty. in many
cases, the primary difﬁculty would not
have been sufﬁcient to cause the destruc-
tion of the plant or fruit.
Late Rant.
It is a well-known fact that the rust
mite causes very considerable russeting of
fruit. This may occur either during the
early portion of the mid-season, or when
the fruit has nearly matured. As a rule.
when the fruit has passed 'mid-season
there is very little danger of russeting.
This year, however, many orchards have
russeted severely after the fruit had reach-
ed its full size, and in many cases after
the fruit had begun to color. Vigorous
spraying with the usual remedies for pre-
venting russeting proved of no avail.
This occurred on account of the presence
of the wither tip fungus, which produced
a form of russeting that in general ap-
pearance resembles the rust mite russeting
to a considerable extent, and in many
cases is mistaken for it,
This form of russeting can, however, be
readily detected by rubbing the hand over
'rthe fruit. When it is due to the rust mite
the fruit feels smooth, while when it is
due to the wither tip fungus the surface
will usually be rough, something like rub-
bing the hand over sandpaper. Not in-
frequently the two forms of disease occur
on the same fruit.
Tear 81:51:11.
This peculiar form of russeting mani-
fests itself by streaks running over the
fruit from the side that hangs uppermost
to the point which is nearest the ground.
The cause of this peculiar form of 1'th-
seting is that somewhere above the fruit a
twig occurs which has been infested by the
fungus, and which contains the hold-over
spores. Whenever sufﬁcient rain or dew
occurs to cause a dripping from this
disease infected twig onto the fruit, the
disseminating spores are liberated from
the twig and carried with the rain or dew
over the epidermis of the fruit. Many of
‘the spores are left along in diﬁerent
places and these produce sufﬁcient irrita-
tion to the epidermis to cause russeting

along in streaks, hence we have the
peculiar form of tear staining or tear
streaks.
All of the fruits of the citrus family are
more or less subject to this trouble. Bit-
ter sweet, sour oranges, sweet seedlings,
kumquats and lemons have been found
affected in this way.
Frequently this peculiar form of in-
fection does not injure the keeping quali-
ties of the fruit. Of course this fruit must
go to market as russets, and consequently
a very material loss in its selling quality is
encountered.
Kmquate.
Heretofore it was thought that kum-
quats were quite free from the destructive
attack of this disease, but during the pastr
year many trees were discovered that had
lost as high as 40 per cent. of the fruit.
They were carried off by drops, directly
or indirectly induced by this disease. In
addition to a number of drops occasioned
by the presence of this fungus, a very con-
siderable number of the fruits themselves
were infested with the characteristic spot.
This has been described a number of times
in various publications, and has been il-
lustrated by photographs before the
Horticultural Society, so it will not be
taken up again at this point.
Remedy.
All of these investigations, of course,
have for their aim the determination of
some practicable remedy. Different lines
of treatment were started immediately
upon commencing the investigations.
The ﬁrst line that suggested itself was of
thoroughly spraying with Bordeaux mix-
ture. This, however, proved to be insuﬂi‘
cient. The most thorough work possible
was done upon an orchard of about four-
teen acres in extent, and continued
throughout the entire year of 1902. At
the end of this time the fungus seemed to
have as strong a foothold in the orchard
as it had in the beginning of the work.
This seemed to indicate that spraying
with Bordeaux mixture was merely sufﬁ-
cient to hold it in check, and not suﬂicient
to reduce the diﬂiculty in the orchard.
In 1903 the work of cutting out the
diseased twigs was begun. During that
season this same orchard was submitted to
the treatment with Bordeaux mixture,
and a thorough pruning out of the twigs
which had become leaﬂess and had lost
their vitality. Before the end of the year
this remedy showed itself to be thorcmgh-
ly successful. A more successful treat-
ment could scarcely be expected to be
found in any particular line. During the
summer of 1904 still further investiga-
tions were made as to the best time for
cutting out the diseased twigs by divid-
ing the orchard of some twenty acres in
extent, into six different plots. These dif-
ferent plots were subjected to treatment at
different seasons of the year. From the
experiments here we deduced the follow-
ing facts: That the ﬁrst time of the year
for pruning is during the winter, just be-
fore the spring growth occurs, which is
some time before the ﬁrst of February,
and a second pruning is usually necessary.
In the grove under experimentation it was
found that the plot N0. 4, which was -
pruned during July, that the remedy was
as successful as where pruning had
occurred earlier. In plot No. 6, where
the pruning had not occurred until
August, the increase in the amount of the
wither tip disease was so severely marked
that the point to which the pruning had
been carried in July could be seen to the
row.
As a general rule we would say then


## p. 31 (#41) ##############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 3.;
that the proper line of treatment would
be: First prune out all dead wood, or
wood of low vitality, during January and
then again during July. Second, spray
thoroughly with Bordeaux mixture im-
mediately after each pruning.
This will, in a great measure, reduce the
amount of fungus in the grove, and so very
materially reduce the danger of infection.
It may, however, be found necessary in
the fall, when the fruit begins to ripen, to
protect this against the characteristic
Anthracnosc spot. This has been done
repeatedly last year in orchards of vary-
ing size, from a few acres to twelve acres
in extent. These characteristic spots do
not occur until the fruit has practically
matured, then they make their appearance,
ﬁrst about the size of a pinhead, from this
they gradually enlarge until a consider-
able portion of the fruit is involved. At
the ﬁrst appearance of the spots the fruit
should be sprayed thoroughly with an
ammoniacal solution of copper carbonate.
If treatment has been delayed until the
fruit has begun to drop off severely, it will
take about two or three weeks to notice
any perceptible diminution of the drop-
ping. From that time. however, the
sprayed trees show from 25 to 75 per cent
reduction in the amount of the drops, and
also show a similar amount of diminution
in the spread of this spotting.
Foot Rot.
The past year, for some reason, seems
to have been one in which this disease has
been making its presence felt in many
groves that previously had not been at all
troubled by it., Just why this condition
should occur is difﬁcult to explain. We
know, however, that many people whose
groves have heretofore enjoyed freedom
from this trouble have this year found
themselves in a position to enquire
diligently for the best remedies. The
remedy for this given by Mr. Waite a
year ago is about the best that can be used.
On page 53, of Report for 1904, Mr.
Waite gives his formula for making the
antiseptic wash, as one part sulphur and -
two parts of land plaster, or air slacked
lime. Then this is made into a thick bat-
ter by addition of water, and then painted
on the tree, the soil having been removed
from around the crown so as to permit a
ready application of the remedy. Other
remedies are also successful in keeping
down this trouble. The one essential feat-
ure in all remedies is that of removing the
soil from around the crown and exposing
the diseased area to the sun if possible, or
where the limbs shade the trees too much,
exposing it to the air. In some cases it
has been found sufﬁcient to expose the
crown of the roots to the air. However, it
is better not to take any chance, but to
apply some antiseptic treatment, either
that suggested by Mr. Waite, or a solu_
tion of one part of crude carbolic acid to
two parts of water, then cutting away the
diseased patch and applying the antiseptic
wash to the area exposed.
Blight.
!'
This old disease is still with us, and will
probably stay with us as long as citrus
growing is carriedon in Florida. The
studies upon it, and investigations in con-
nection with it have been pushed as
rapidly and as extensively as possible.
The members of the Horticultural Society
will realize that an immense amount of
work has to be done on the study of this
disease, and that observations conﬁned to
one section or one grove would
scarcely be sufﬁcient, When we
remember that blight rarely, or

never, occurs on trees under six years of
age, and that the possibility of infection
occurs at the time of setting the tree out,
it is readily seen that to prove any particu-
lar theory in regard to the matter will re-
quire years of awiting. I am, however,
more hopeful of ﬁnding a practicable
remedy for thisdisease than I have been
at any time previous to this. Just what
the line of treatment may be, and just
what precautionary measures must be
taken, I am yet unprepared to say. I may,
however, be permitted to say that the in-
vestigations inprogress are indicative of
ﬁnally securing a favorable and practic-
able remedy.
Scaly Bark of Orange Trees.
This diseasegf the orange tree has been
reported quite a number of times in the
last three or four years, and specimens
have been sent a time or two very recently.
The name describes the disease fairly
well. An attack of this disease causes the
bark to peel off and look very shaggy and
Report by
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
My ﬁrst recollection of the war between
man and the insect enemies of the orange
was about twenty-ﬁve years ago. My
father came to Florida from Pennsylvania
in June 1878 and set the ﬁrst tree the fol-
lowing winter and a very short time after
that the ﬁght commenced. I recall seeing.
boxes of \Vhale Oil Soap in the barn and
seeing the wash-boiler full of water and
tobacco stems boiling on the kitchen stove.
Don’t you know, friends, that my mother
was a good-natured woman to stand that?
scaly. This, of course, is very unusual
for citrus trees, and consequently is
noticed at once. When anything
of this kind occurs on the young-
er limbs the disease causes round-
ish or oblong brownish blotches,
varying in size from one-fourth
of an inch long to sometimes three or four
inches long. Mrs. Flora W. Patterson,
Mycologist in the Department of Agricul-
ture, has identiﬁed the fungus as belong—
ing to the genus Hysterog'raphium.
As yet we know no convenient and
practicable remedy, consequently where it
occurs on the small twigs of the tree the
orange grower will ﬁnd it prudent to cut
out the disease and burn it.
Mention is made of this disease in this
place to keep people on the lookout for the
trouble, and so cut oFf its ravages in its
incipiency. It very frequently occurs
that a most innocent looking species
causes a very considerable damage. As
yet no serious consequences have fol-
lowed an attack of this disease.
J. J.Beers.
When the stock solution was ready, a jug
full was taken to the grove and, while a
boy carried water from a nearby pond or
lake, my father added a little of the stock
from the jug and on his knees with a
scrubbing brush washed the bodies and
even the faces and hands of the little trees.
He soon discovered,however, that thebark
on the trees was getting hard and the trees
stunted and in casting about for a better
method, found a brass syringe, holding
about a quart, with ﬁne holes for an out-
let, with which the trees were sprayed.

Next came a little hand spray pump.
With these pumps half a dozen men
sprayed the trees from pails, while a horse
hauled barrels of water from some con-
venient lake. What was used for an in-
secticide at this time, I do not know, but I
remember seeing them churn “kerosene
butter” with these little pumps and it was
made of kerosene oil and “Eagle Brand”
condensed milk.
All this ﬁghting appeared to do no
good and the scale was still there. although
I am not prepared to say that the spraying
was properly done, or done at the proper
time, for spraying orange trees was a
comparatively new thing at that time.
In 1884 I was sent away to school and
when I returned three years later, I found
that father had gotten up the rig which
I am now using. This is a four—wheeled
wagon, with a three barrel tank and a
force pump geared to one hind wheel of
the wagon. This throws a strong spray
and I spray from ﬁve to twenty-ﬁve acres
per day with one hose.
Our main ﬁght is against the rust mite
and we use the sulphur solution. but when
we spray regularly for that we have never
been troubled with scale, except one of the
wax scales which cause “smut” and this is
always killed with one- application of
double strength.
We start spraying the ﬁrst of May and
spray the ﬁrst of every month for ﬁve
months and the result, until last season,
has been clean, healthy trees and bright
fruit. Last spring we had purple mite
enough to damage the trees and drop a
large part of the fruit, therefore about
the ﬁrst of January of this year, seeing
the mite starting again, we sprayed once
and intended to continue it to keep them
in check, but have found it unnecessary.
The spraying destroyed a large per cent
of the mites and this, followed by the cold
of January 25th and later by an unusual
amount of rain, has almost destroyed the
mite.
One of the ﬁnest groves in our section,
well known as the “Pet Grove,” property
of Mr. J. P. Felt, is greatly damaged by
what appears to be “foot-rot.” We have
many groves here which, like this one, are
budded on sweet stock. In this grove a
part of the bank was allowed to remain
for two or three years, so that the earth
close to the tree was six to ten inches above
the natural collar even through the sum-
mer and I have no doubt that this was the
cause of the “foot-rot.” Mr. Felt is hav-
ing this earth removed now and the trees
will probably not be banked next winter
to give them a chance to hEal.
Grape fruit trees have been damaged
some by scab and the fruit made unﬁt for
market. Spraying with Bordeaux Mix-
ture appears to entirely prevent this, as
trees badly affected two years ago were
sprayed last spring and last season pro-
duced ﬁne fruit and the new growth was
free from disease.
My idea of combating diseases of trees
is, ﬁrst to prevent it if possible; then, if it
appears, cure it if you can. Study the re-
quirements of the trees and make the con-
ditions suitable as far as possible and
above all give them plenty of food of the
very best quality, then watch your trees
closely and be ready to meet trouble when
it comes.

34 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Report of A. B. Harrington.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I conﬁne myself to my ‘own locality
and citrus trees only.
There has been nothing new to develop
during the last year, therefore shall have
to go to our subject in a way that many
of us are already familiar with.
We are beyond the worry of the com-
mon scale, as this is easily kept under by
use of fertilizer and an occasional spray-
ing with Hammonds Thrip Juice. This
is the best, cheapest, and most convenient
to use of anything in my experience for
scale. '-
It is usual to have a visit of the Red
Spider during the Spring months.
The Rust Mite is nearly ever present.
For these insects I use the Sulphur
spray. I have used the sulphur and Thrip
Juice mixed and the combination seems to
give equal results as when used separate-
ly.
The rust mite is the worst of all our
troubles, causing more expense and time
than all other insects and diseases com-
bined,
I do not believe it is possible to have
ten percent bright fruit without spraying;
but by being presistent, observing care—
fully the conditions and following it up
each year,we' have about ninety percent
bright fruit. As proof of this, trees, that
have never been sprayed, (a few miles
distant and all other conditions apparent-
ly similar,) have scarcely any bright fruit,
so little that no attempt is made to classi-
fy or grade it and it is marketed from the
trees without grading. These groves that
are badly infested with Rust Mite seem to
produce fruit one or two sizes smaller than
do the groves thoroughly sprayed. The
White Fly, I am thankful to say, has not
appeared here.
As to disease, we have none. While we
have some insects that cause us trouble, I
do not think there is as yet a disease‘ of
any description in our locality,
Die back shows up occasionally but
this is a condition rather than a disease, as
I took upon it. There seemed to be some
confusion on this subject of die back last
year. My own experience is such that I
am conﬁdent it is not so very easy to
overcome. I have read where treatment
showed an improvement in a few days and
a cure in a few weeks or months. Trees
can be helped in a year but I say three
years is required for a cure if the case is
anything bad.
My views are to thoroughly under-
stand your soil and fertilizer, as this is
where the complete recovery is to start
from. Much beneﬁt is obtained by the
use of Bordeaux.
I have not tried the insertion of Blue
Stone myself but have observed good re-
sults where others have used this method
of treatment. An orange tree will exist
under the most adverse circumstances yet
to grow and produce well, paying a proﬁt
each year to the owner, requires care,
cultivation, and fertilizer.
I use for applying spray, a good hand
power pump, a double line of hose, requir-
ing, three men and a pair of mules to run

the outﬁt. It depends very much on the
size of the grove as to what the investment
in machinery should be. Begin with a bag
of fertilizer and a hoe increasing with the
number of trees.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, it seems
that some legislation is at present pending
at Tallahassee on the white ﬂy and insects.
A copy of the pending bill has been called
for but it appears that none of the mem-
bers have it, nor have many of them seen
what the measure is. I am not personally
interested in the white ﬂy, as it has not yet
appeared with us, but I am deeply inter-
ested in behalf of the society in this pest
and believe that if something is not done
to stop its ravage the state will be over-
run. However, we should be careful
as to what character of measure is enacted.
We should see that it shall be a measure
as will not work a burden or hardship upon
the growers. Yet, I conceive it to be
essential that some measure be enacted
that will control the ravages of the white
ﬂy.
Dr. Richardson—I heartily concur in
the remarks of Mr. Blackman. The white
ﬂy is a most destructive, pernicious pest,
still we should carefully watch any meas-
ure of legislation that is proposed, and
should not endorse here any measure
to be enacted unless we know what
that measure is. It has been said that the
the measure purports to provide
that if the grower does not com—
ply with the law that his proper-
ty shall be taken in charge by
the county commissioners and the ex-
pense 0f dislodging the white ﬂy taxed
upon it by the county. This would in my
judgment be very unwise and would work
a hardship in many instances to a groer
who was ﬁnancially unable to protect his
property and who was wholly irresponsi-
ble for the introduction of the pest upon
his property. It is well known that the
white ﬂy infests not only grove trees, but
other trees, and shrubbery as well,
especially hammock growths, and if we
are going to legislate we ought ﬁrst to
legislate them out of the swamp before
we tax the property of the grower for dis-
lodging it from the grove property. I
think this matter should go to our legis-
lative committee with power to act in the
premises, and with plenty of time to look
into remedial measures of legislation.
This is a very important matter and
should receive the very best consideration,
in all of its phases and in its operation
after enactment, before we give it an
endorsement upon the ﬂoor of this so-
ciety. .
Dr. Kerr—This is a very important
matter touching the interest of every
grower in the State. It should in my
judgment go to our legislative committee,
who should be g‘Yanted plenty of time in
the premises, bringing in its repo'rt to this
society for further consideration.
Mr. Gillett—Mr. President, as a mem-
ber of the legislative committee I agree
with the gentlemen who have preceded me
on this subject. I think the matter should
go to the legislative committee and that it
should have plenty of time to act in the
premises. I have had some experience in
formulating measures for enactment into
laws and it requires time to 190k carer”
into proposed measures of this kind. to
calculate the eFfect of the operation of the
law upon its enactment, comparing and
weighing similar measures in other States,
so as to get the greatest good to the great-
est number as far as we can.
The President—The matter of this

preventative measure against the ravages
of the white fly will go to the legislative
committee with power to act. If any
enactment is to be had at the present ses-
sion of the legislature, no doubt the special
legislative committee, which has been
heretofore appointed at this session, will
be of service to the committee in this re-
gard.
COTTON BUG.
Dr. Richardson—I have been very
much interested in these papers. I desire
to call the attention of the society to an
insect that I have so far been unable to
ﬁnd in any of our society literature,
scientiﬁc or otherwise. He is a
bug and is, I have lately learned,
known to the cotton planter as
the cotton bug—and if any of you have
never met him, I hope you never may.
In markings and color he is beautiful,
brown, green,red and gold with a diamond
in the center of his back, his shape is some—
thing like a common pumpkin bug but not
so large. In numbers and rapacity he is a
devastator. His appearance is sudden. I
ﬁrst met him in about 1892 I think it was,
with very disastrous results as I lost some
10,000 or 12,000boxes of oranges through
his depredations in the course of a few
days’ time. I thought, as he had not ap-
peared again, that I was free from his
kind, and had nearly forgotten all about
him until last fall, when my manager tele-
phoned me he had found a strange bug on
my tangerines. I went over and found the
ground. the fruit and trees literally cover-
ed with the bugs so thickly in fact that
you could scarcely see the fruit—there
were millions of them—and I lost probably
40 or 50 boxes of tangerines. Having met
him before, I determined upon heroic ef-
forts to get rid . of him. After trying
almost every insecticide known without
success, I ﬁnally made a carbolinium whale
oil soap mixture, rather as an experiment
than anything else, knowing the virtue of
the carbolinium on account of the percent-
age of carbolic acid it contains. The mix-
ture or emulsion was made of one quart of
carbolinium to seven pounds of whale oil
soap boiled and stirred into three gallons
of water, pouring the same into about
ﬁfty gallons of water, making a solution
with which I sprayed the fruit and leaves.
To my agreeable surprise this completely
routed and destroyed Mr. Cotton Bug. I
mention this for what it may be worth.
Mr. McCarty.—The gentleman’s expe-
rience is very interesting and valuable.
The bug he has described, is what is
known as “the common cotton stainer.
They are a very proliﬁc pest, but I think
Dr. Richardson might modify his numbers
to myriads instead of millions. The thanks
of the society are due the doctor for his
solution, the component parts of which
the society will in all probability proﬁt by
remembering.
Dr. Richardson—Myriads may be all
right, but anyone having experience with
cotton bugs will agree to millions. Mod-
ern scientists tell us that microbes repro-
duce by binary division at the rate of
sixteeen or more millions from a single
specimen in twenty-four hours. The cot-
ton bug will in the old-fashioned way of
egg and hatching, it almost seems, do
pretty nearly as well. I have a neighbor
who examined his grove in the morning
and found not a bug, but at four o’clock
in the afternoon his large seedling trees
were covered with them, and by the next
day he had lost some four or ﬁve thousand
boxes. This was Mr. Rogers, of Suther-
lad.

Mr. Boggs—The discussion in regard
to insects reminds me of an experience
I had a year or so ago with grasshoppers.
It is well known that the grasshopper or
locust in numbers is very voracious and
on occasions he will attack a fruit tree as
quickly as he will grass. Finding myself
menaced by grasshoppers in such numbers
as to cause some alarm, I wrote to Wash-
ington for a culture which had been ex-
perimented with for the extermination
of the hopper. Receiving the same, I
took an old darkey out with me to catch
some of the hoppers, dip them and let
them go on this way of self-destruction,
as well as that of their ilk. After this per-
formance was over, and we had dipped
I suppose some 200 hoppers, I noticed
the darkey in deep meditation. Finally
he said to me:
“Boss. is yer after killing dem hop-
pers ?”
I assured him that was the desired end,
he then said:
"\Vell, boss, why didn’t yer mash dem
we kotched instead of dippin em and turn-
in’ ’em loose? (Laughten)
I was never annoyed to such great
extent after the experiment, and think it
was of some beneﬁt. I am informed that
the Department at \Vashington has several
cultures and that this was not what is con-
sidered by the department the best. I do
not think the experiments, however, have
proved entirely satisfactory. though to
some degree helpful. I will here also say
that the Department of Agriculture is also
extensively engaged in the study of insect
extermination by fungus. These fungus
experiments have proved very satisfactory
in a great many instances. While it is not
claimed for the fungus process that it is
a total eradicator br exterminator, it has
proved to be of positive beneﬁt. ‘
, 37
Mr. McCarty—I have followed the ex-
perimentation reports of the fungus pro-
cess of extermination of insects for several
years with a great deal of interest, and I
am always glad to hear anything concern-
ing it. It seems to me that it has already
proven to be of great assistance, and I
trust scientiﬁc research and experiment
will further demonstrate its value as
against spraying, which is always ac-
companied with more or less deleterious
effects, unless the utmost precaution is ob-
served and followed. I believe there are
many instances in which great harm has
been done by ill advised spraying, which
occurs both ways. sometimes through the
strength and character of the solution,
as well as the age and condition of the tree
and fruit at times of application.
Mr. Hampton—I have been very much
interested in these discussions upon insect
extermination and especially with refer-
ence to the cotton stainer. I ﬁrst met the
cotton stainer in 1897 and for the past
several years I have seen him occasionally.
In numbers he is. voracious and devastat-
ing, he is a sucker, and usually when you
ﬁnd him you have got to do something so
quick that he has gotten through with his
business before you get your solution
mixed. I have never been able to ﬁnd
anything to kill him, and my previous ef-
forts to get a preparation which would kill
him were ineffectual for the reason that
not knowing anything myself that would
kill him off, I had to write to some one
for information, and by the time I could
get a reply to my inquiry he had ﬁnished
up his business and gone. I am sure the
society is much indebted to Dr. Richardson
for his experiment in this direction and
that they will proﬁt by it should this pest
show up upon their premises.

tention has been paid to blight, I am very
much interested in the solution of the
question of blight. Being desirous of see-
ing an effective remedy for this tree
disease, I offer the following resolutions
which I trust the society may see ﬁt to
adopt
The resolutions were adopted and are as
follows:
, WHEREAS, The orange growers of
Florida are annually suffering the loss of
many thousands of dollars in the reduc-
tion of their fruit crop and still more in
the market value of their groves'thropgh
a disease known as orange tree blight,
which usually selects the largest and most
productive trees for attack; and
WHEREAS, Though the desease has
been carefully studied for'many years by
very able Department experts. it is not yet
well enough known to allow of its positive
identiﬁcation, in many cases, before the
second or third year after its appearance,
while investigations pretty surely prove
that the disease is contagious, which
makes each diseased tree a nucleus from
which it is carried to others when caring
for or working the grove; and
WHEREAS, Progress has been made
that encourages the belief that if ad-
ditional help with special ﬁtness can be
sent here and allowed to devote their
whole time to assisting in this select work,
we have reason to hope that the cause
may be found for it; therefore, be it
RESOLVED, That the Secretary of this
society be instructed to correspond with
the Florida Representatives in Washing-
ton and earnestly request them to call
upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon.
Wilson. and urge upon him the import—
ance of this work and the pressing need
that we feel for further assitance from his
Department. Be it further
RESOLVED, That each member of this
society exert his or her influence as an in-
dividual to secure increased appropriation
for this work and its more vigorous prose-
cution.
Member—If I am correctly in-
formed, and I believe I am, the
Department of Agriculture at Wash-
ington has always been able, ready and
willing to lend any assistance within
the power of the government to promote
the interests of like societies in the
various States, in never-ceasing scien-
tiﬁc experiments to exterminate insects
and eradicate disease from useful plant
life. I think it all comes under the generic
head of forestry preservation. However
that may be, I know that the National
Government has always met the various
States half way in the matter of expense
in this direction, that wherever the State
will spend a dollar the Government will
spend one in intelligent effort to this end,
it therefore seems to me, Mr, President,
that we should have the beneﬁt of this
National aid in this State, in order that
the horticulturist of this State may have
the beneﬁt of all blight preventatives, the
. culture spore and fungus processes, scien-
tiﬁc spraying as well as all known scien-
tiﬁc research to sto the ravages of these
diseases and insects of whatever kind. I
trust that our legislative committee will
hold this matter in mind and use their best
endeavor to secure for the State her pro-
rata share of this experimental scientiﬁc
work.
The President—The remarks of the
member are timelypthe chair has no doubt
the special legislative committee will take
the matter in charge and secure for the
State these considerations.

A Steam Boiling Plant for Insecticides.
ByPLAGosear-d.
Where the lime-salt-sulphur wash, bi-
sulphide of lime, resin spray, or any in-
secticide requiring prolonged cooking is
needed the most economical method of
preparation is by boiling with steam. I
prepared the accompanying diagram by
combining the best features of two or
three different Ohio boiling plants. By
courtesy of the Ohio Experiment Sta-
tion I give it to the Florida horticultur-
ists before having used it in our own pub-
lications.
A is a water tank into which water is
raised by wind or steam power. In the
plant from which the diagram was
taken it is a I , 500 gallon tank of
galvanized iron, sitting on the up-
per or haymow ﬂoor of the barn,
and water is pumped into it through
the water pipe x by means of a windmill.
The stopcock b is closed when the tank is
full. A is a faucet from which cold water
is drawn at will to meet the miscellaneous
needs of farm and household. D is the
boiler reservoir and, being connected with
A by means of the water-pipe X is
kept ﬁlled. In the plant represented, the
boiler reservoir was a galvanized iron
cylinder, perhaps eight feet high and one
foot in diameter. having a capacity of
nearly 50 gallons. It was a discarded gas
chamber, having once beerupart of a gas
supply plant. Its bottom end sets just a
few inches behind the boiler so that the
water is kept moderately warm and can be
safety turned into the boiler without ad-
ditional heating. H is the boiler, the pipes
w leading from it, being steam pipes. The
stopcock v opens and closes a pipe leading
from the reservoir D into the boiler H.
When it is desired to ﬁll the boiler with
water, the stopcocks v and u are both
opened; the steam, passing through u into
the top of the reservoir D, forces the water
through v into the boiler H, doing away
with the need of an injector. The steam
in D soon condenses and water is drawn
into the reservoir through x to ﬁll the
vacuum which would otherwise be pro-
duced. V is a platform upon which sets
the hot water tank B and the boiling cask
X. B may be of either iron or wood, like-
wise X. In the plant diagramed, X rep-
resents a 50 gallon barrel and B a 100 gal-
lon galvanized iron- tank. Opening the
faucet c ﬁlls the tank B with water; open-
ing the stopcock d lets steam into the
water, which escapes through the three
openings at m. On the opposite side of the
arm at r. are three openings, letting out
steam in an opposite direction, thus set-
ting the water in a whirl. l is a faucet
from which warm water may be drawn at
pleasure. h is a stopcock letting the water
into the diluting tank 0, which sets on the
platform I. By opening the stopcock e,
steam is conducted into the boiling cask X
where it escapes through three openings
at n and three on the opposite side of the
other arm at 0. This arrangement gives
constant agitation or whirling during the
cooking process. g is a stopcock to let the
boiled product into the diluting tank O.
g must be located as close as possible to

the boiling cask G, otherwise the pipe will
be sure to clog with sediment in cooking
lime and sulphur together. The pipe or
hose on which g is located should not be
less than one and one-half inches in diam-
eter. The stopcock k closes the pipe
conducting the diluted spray into the tank
on the spray-wagon. f is a stopcock ad-
mitting steam to the diluting tank for the
purpose of keeping it warm. y and t are
the oriﬁces through which steam escapes
and are arranged like thOSe in the other
tanks.
The diluting tank 0 is not an absolute
necessity, since B may be used for the
same purpose.
Report of Committee on Citrus.
E. E. Hubbard, Chairman.
Previous reports of this standing Com-
mittee have pretty well threshed out the
questions of commercial varieties, prop-
agation, fertilization and culture, but
there is still room for improvement in
varieties, especially of early oranges, and
I have thought it well on this occasion to
review the work and conclusions of some
of the foremost plant propagators of the
country, with the view of stimulating ob-
servation, selection and improvement of
varieties by every intelligent fruit grower.
As all know, the U. S. Department of Ag-
riculture is working to develop early,
hardy, oranges from hybrids and in this
connection I will quote from Luther Bur-
bank the foremost living authority on
hybrids and crosses:
“The main object of crossing genera,
species or varieties is to combine various
individual tendencies, thus producing a
state of perturbation or partial antagonism
by which these tendencies are, in later
generations, dissociated and recombined
in new proportions, which gives the breed-
er a wider ﬁeld for selection; but this
opens a much more difﬁcult one—the
selection and ﬁxing of the desired new
types from the mass of heterogeneous
tendencies produced, for by crossing, bad
traits as well as good are always brought
forth. The results now secured by the
breeder will be in proportion to the ac-
curacy and intensity of selection, and the
length of time they are applied. By this
means the best of fruits, grains, nuts and
ﬂowers are capable of still further im-
provements in ways which to the thought-
less often seem unnecessary, irrelevant or
impossible.”
“The plant breeder before making com-
binations should with greatcare select the
individual plants which seem best adapted
to his purpose, as by this course many
years of experiment and much needless
expense will be avoided. The difference
in the individuals which the plant breeder
has to work upon are sometimes extremely
slight. The ordinary unpracticed person
cannot by any possibility discover the ex-

ceedingly minute variations in form, size
color, fragrance, precocity and a thousand
other characters which the practiced
breeder perceives by a lightning like
glance. The work is not easy, requiring
an exceedingly keen perception of minute
differences, great practice, and extreme
care in treating the organisms operated
upon, and even with all the naturally
acquired variations added to those secured -
by scientiﬁc crossing and numerous other .
means the careful accumulation of slight
individual differences through many
generations is imperative after which sev-
eral generations are often but not always
necessary to thoroughly “ﬁx” the desired
type for all practical purposes.
The above applies to Annuals. or those
plants reproduced by seed. The breeder
of plants which can be reproduced by div-
ision has great advantage, for any valuable
individual variation can be multiplied to
any extent desired without the extreme
care necessary in ﬁxing by linear breeding
the one which must be reproduced by seed.
But even in breeding perennials the ﬁrst
deviations from the original form are
often unappreciable to the perception, but
by accumulating the most minute dif-
ferences through many generations the
deviation from the original form is often
astounding.”
“By crossing different species we can
form more variations and mutations in
half a dozen generations than will be de-
veloped by ordinary variation in a hun-
dred or even a thousand generations.
The evolution of species is largely depend-
ent on crossing the variations contained
within it. Forms too closely bred soon
run out, because generally only by cross-
ing does variation appear.
It is of great advantage to have the
parents a certain distance apart in their
hereditary tendencies. If too close to-
gether, there is not range enough of varie-
ty. If too far apart the developed forms
are unﬁtted for existence because too un-
stable. Radical changes of environment
for a series of generations will produce a
tendency to sport, but hybridization will
bring it about far more abruptly and for
practical plant or animal breeding or for
scientiﬁc study of all these variations. far
more satisfactorily.”
Mr. Burbank asserts there is a close
analogy between hybridization and graft-
ing. An instance is cited ill which Prlmus
myrobalana Var. Pissardi was imported
from France and grafted on the Kelsey
plum, a variety of Prunus Triflom. The
graft did not bloom, but its presence on
the tree brought about a cross between the
two species. Many hundred descendants
of this cross are now living, .
These remarks of Mr. Burbank's on
other plants show how slow and difﬁcult
will be the processeof developing early
and hardy oranges from hybrids and
crosses. The chances are very small of
anything of market merit in the ﬁrst seed-
lings and selective crosses of the improved
hybrids and testing of hundreds and even
thousands of their Successive offspring
may be necessary before the object is
achieved.
I therefore turn to the work of another
Californian whose work was described
some time ago in the “Citrograph” in
part as follows;
“It has long been the popular feeling
that the Washington navel orange is
“good enough." Consequently when Mr.
A. C. Thomson, of Duarte, announced his
Improved Navel there were many who
doubted such a possibility. And when he
told the modus operandi of its origin the
doubters said “Oh, be!" To produce a

new hybrid by splitting buds and inserting
a half bud each of two varieties in the
slit sounds implausible; and yet that is
just what this ingenious Scotchman says
he did.
There is a diversity of opinion as to the
merits of Thomson’s Improved Navel, but
all who are acquainted with it frankly con-
cede that it is a distinct variety. The
manner of its coming is immaterial,
although there is no good reason for doubt-
ing the narrative of its sponsor. Having
placed the new orange in the race with its
progenitors, both as regards earliness and
quality, it occurred to Mr. Thomson that
the next thing to be desired Was a late
navel—one which should lengthen the
navel season even unto the coming of the
Valencia. With this important possibility
in mind our Scotchman again split buds
taking them from the Improved Navel
and the Late Valenicia. During a visit to
his place recently he told me of the pro-
cess and the diﬁiculﬁes involved. In the
majority of cases the buds live and start,
each half sends out an independent shoot,
and not simultaneously. In other
instances, even when starting at the
same time, they fail to unite properly in a
perfect shoot or stem. As proof that even
a perfect union is not necessarily produc-
tive of an improved fruit, Mr. Thomson
showed me a freak tree, with long curved
leaves in which olive green and white
seemed struggling for control. The few
oranges on it were ribbed from stem to
blossom end and were scarcely edible. Out
of the many buds inserted in conjugal
fashion from the Improved Navel and
Late Valencia there came one tree which,
as it stood in the nursery row, showed dis-
tinct characteristics and habits of growth.
Mr. Thomson relates that Alexander
Craw visited his place at this time, and,
being told that there was a tree of a new
variety in the nursery, he went in and
pointed it out. In due season it was set
out in the orchard, where it now stands in
one of two rows of its kind, these two
rows of Navelencia extending through
an orchard of Thomson’s Improved Na-
vels of the same age. The Navelencia trees
average about a foot higher than the Im-
proved Navels. In the half-dozen years
since it ﬁrst fruited, it has become the par-
ent of many trees, its progeny including
the two rows in which it stands, as well as
orchards and individual trees in nearly
every orange growing section throughout
the world.” -“As regards lateness, it
should be stated that the conditions of the
fruit on the young trees about Highland
and Redlands indicates that in this climate
it promises to partially make good Mr.
Thomson’s original claim and to length-
en the navel season by at least a few
weeks.” As further evidence of the
feasibility of split bud grafting I will
quote from an address delivered by Pro—
fessor N. F. Murray before the annual
meeting of the Kansas Horticultural So-
ciety:
“Several years ago we began to experi-
ment in hybrid grafting. \Ne worked on
apple, pear, and plum, root-grafting in the
usual manner, except we cut out all the
buds from the scion to be grafted, then
split from end to end and with a sharp
knife cut through the center of the top
bud. Then taking two half scions of two
different varieties we spliced them to-
gether, knowing full well that the desired
union or cross of the two varieties must be
accomplished by a union of the two buds.
In part of our work we simply split the
buds, always using a very sharp knife and
a magnifying glass, and taking great care
and pains, wrapping with ﬁne thread and

then waxing. We operated on in this
way, making quite a number of apple,
pear, and plum. In the apple we used Ben
Davis as a foundation and to this variety
we united Johnathan, Wine sap and
Grime’s Golden, our object being to infuse
better quality into the Ben Davis. We
planted all with care and watched results,
eight per cent grew, and from the ap-
pearance of the leaves we think we have
at least three crosses out of 100 in the
apple and we are awaiting their fruiting
with interest. We are much encouraged
from the fact that one plum tree out of
twenty, crossed with Wild Goose and
Abundance, fruited last year and shows a
hybrid, or cross between the two.
We shall continue our experiment. feel-
ing conﬁdent that in hybrid grafting and
budding we have the means to greatly im-
prove our ﬁne fruits, ﬂowers, and shrubs.
we shall select our scions and buds only
from the most healthy and vigorous trees
and plants and those that produce the larg-
est and best fruit. Our ﬁne American
herds have been brought up to their pres-
ent high standard by the most careful
selecting and breeding for generations.
We believe that in a similar manner our
American horticulture must be improved.”
I think it will also be of interest to con-
sider the experience of Mr. O. W. Black-
nall of Kittrell, N. C., with natural varia-
tions of fruits. He says: “I will give
my experience as to variation during the
past forty years of three well known fruits,
those are the Winesap apple. the Scupper-
nong grape, and the Wilson’s Albany
strawberry. Forty years ago the‘Wine-
sap apples grown in this neighborhood
were comparatively uniform in size and'
color. Since then a great many trees have
been brought in and planted from widely
separated nurseries in ditferentparts of the
United States. The result has been a wide
variation in the size and color of the fruit;
probably this variation has extended to
the ﬂavor and also to the shape of the ap-
ple. But of this I am not sure. I am
only stating what I know to be positively
true. Then as to the Scuppernong grape:
A very few if any Scuppernong grape
vines have ever been brought into this
neighborhood. It is fairly certain that
nearly if not all, of the many vines now
fruiting have originated from a few old
vines growing in the neighborhood time
out of mind, many of them certainly a cen-
tury old. Still there is a variation in the
size, quality, and time of ripening of the
fruit of different vines which is most strik_
ing. Some bear fruit fully twice as large
as others and that when growing side by
side, some have thick hulls, and some thin,
some ripen at the beginning of September
and some not till the last of October. Now
it is barely possible, that the most dis-
similar vines may be seedlings. But this
is extremely improbable, as according to
my experience when the Scuppernong seed
is planted it reverts to the black grape
similar to the Muscadine or Bullace, the
wild parent of the Scuppernong. But
even admitting that the widest variation is
the result of vines grown from seed, there
is still such a wide variation in the fruit of
vines known to be grown from cuttings
that it fully establishes the case in point."
In order to give a comprehensive view
of the ﬁeld, opportunities and principles
of fruit improvement I have given these
brief extracts from the writings and ut—
terances of men who are acknowledged to
be authorities and experts in their several
lines of effort. In the Citrus it seems to
me there is great range for variations, and
I would call attention in particular to one

phase of probable variety variation that
cannot occur in deciduous fruits.
The graft of deciduous fruit trees must
be taken and put in when dormant, though
buds of the peach for instance like the
orange are put in during the growing sea-
son. Before blooming in the spring or
late in the fall when the summer growth
is used, for budding oranges, I think we
may expect the new trees to be true to the
parent. but budwood taken just after
blooming in the spring is liable to show
variations if taken from twigs on which
the bloom has been cross pollenated from
other varieties. Rev. Lyman Phelps work-
ed on this line before the ’95 freeze with
artiﬁcial pollenation and produced several
modiﬁed oranges of which all were lost so
far as I know except Tephi, a Jaﬂa im-
proved with Malta Blood. The ﬁrst ex-
ample of this kind I discovered was
Botelha navel, a bud sport from May bud-
ding about 1885, a round, nearly seedless,
midseason navel that overbore so persist-
ently as to be undesirable. It was lost in
1895. I think most orange growers have
noticed variations in standard varieties
and I think if these could be traced they
would be found to result from effects of
cross pollenation on bud wood used just
after blooming,
All will concede that the foreign pollen
cells are the only cause of hybrids and
crosses in the seeds of fruits. The pollen
cells are the only motile cells in the higher
orders of plants. A single grain attached
to the pistil of an orange ﬂower for in-
stance sends its Icells down that pistil into
the ovary or embryo fruit and the mature
seeds of that fruit make trees with fruits
differing from the parent tree.
Mr. Phelps contended that the inﬂuence
of these motile pollen cells not only af-
fected the embryo fruit and seeds, but for
a short time, at least, aﬂ’ected a leaf axil
bud or two adjacent to the ﬂower.
For any person who has the time and
patience the method of taking a bud next
an artiﬁcially pollenated bloom offers a
short cut to variety improvement. I am
also of opinion that the split bud and cross
pollenation bud methods offer quicker and
snrer means of obtaining thin skinned, ﬁne
grained, seedless or nearly seedless fruits
of high quality, by combining varieties
that are already high bred or superior,
than the growing of crosses from seed.-
In conclusion I would call attention to a
difﬁculty in producing high grade, early,
hardy oranges. The hardy trait must be
derived from the Citrus Trifoliata while
the sweetness of juice and tissue with ﬁne
ﬂavor must be derived from fruits that
have derived these qualities from the ten-
der citron. In my experience the Tan-
gerona and Early Oblong, for instance,
are not so resistant to cold as the Satsuma
and Mandarin which clearly show traces
of Trifoliata ancestry. The Citrus prob-
ably more than any other fruits have the
predisposition to throw to excess in cross_
ing, some one characteristic of form.
structure, color or ﬂavor, with the odds
enormously in favor of monstrosities, and
a happy combination of desirable qualities
will be as much a matter of chance as of
scientiﬁc management.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 45
By 0. W. Conner, Tangerine.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
There are so many subjects that must
be taken up, in making a report on “Citrus
Fruits” that I hardly know where to be-
gin, but I trust you will be patient with
me, and that what I have to say will be of
some beneﬁt, to the beginners, if not to
those older in experience. The cultivation
of Citrus Fruits in Florida has, within the
past few years, advanced to ﬁrst place, of
all Horticultural pursuits, and vast
amounts of capital have been invested in
large. and small groves all over the state,
but most particularly, in the central and
southern portions. And where ten or
twelve years ago, a grove of ﬁfty, or one
hundred acres was considered a big thing,
we now have many groves planted, that
cover anywhere from one hundred to ﬁve
hundred acres, and more going out every
year, so I feel well assured, that in a very
short time, we will enjoy the distinction of
having the largest acreage of citrus
groves, of any state in the Union and per-
haps of any area of equal size in the world,
and as the success of citrus fruits depends
largely on these new groves, I trust you
will pardon me for giving them so much
attention in this paper.
With the increase in acreage. it becomes
a necessity to so distribute the varieties
planted as to reduce to a minimum the
chances of overproduction, in any one
class of fruit. And by reviewing the
Grapefruit situation, we can surely learn
the disadvantage of even partial overpro-
duction, There is no question in my
mind, but that there have been too many
Grapefruit trees budded, and planted in
Florida in proportion to the fruits of other
varieties, and we have seen excellent fruit
drop from almost fabulous prices three
years ago, to about cost of production, the
past. season, and it was chiefly due to the
fact that the demand was not sufﬁcient to
clean up at any time, the excess of fruit
shipped. It is true that in some
cases, good prices were realized, but
this was not a rule, and the average was
far below what the leading growers ex-
pected to receive. The demand is cer—
tainly limited. If the Pomelo was such a
fruit as it is customary to eat out of hand,
it would be different. But its uses are
almost entirely limited to table, or dessert
purposes, while the round oranges are
eaten by almost everyone, on all occaSions,
from one end of the world to the other.
And even when making up the lunch for
outing parties, this delicious fruit almost
invariably ﬁnds its way into the hamper.
It is true that the demand is in a small
way increasing, for Grapefruit, but not
rapidly enough. to keep up with the in-
creasing output of Florida, California,
Cuba. Jamaica, and Porto Rico, all of
which, except California, produce nearly
the same quality of fruit that we do.
I have no way of determining the ex-
act proportion of Pomelo, that are already
plantul, but believe that fully one third of
the whole number of Citrus fruit trees now
growing in this state, are Grapefruit, and
as the majority of these trees have not as
yet come into bearing the results of over;
production have not as yet been felt, and I
feel perfectly safe in saying that ten years
hence (if all the Grapefruit now planted
come into bearing, and barring freezes)

that the price will be so low, that it will be
a diﬂicult matter to ﬁnd a market for this
fruit that will pay for production, and
packing, to say nothing about transporta-
tion charges, to market.
Citrus fruit groves, if properly arrang-
ed as to variety, and intelligently cultiva-
ted, and fertilized, and in other ways
scientiﬁcally, and methodically managed.
are now, and will continue to be a good in-
vestment in Florida, and I do not want
to say anything, that will haye a tendency
to discourage anyone from making such
an investment, for I believe that the future
holds many gratuitous results to reward
intelligent labor in this vocation, but Hor-
ticultural progress has made many rapid
strides during the past few years, in the
way of determining the best thing to have
for good results, and getting it, and to
those who are beginning, I would most
earnestly urge the necessity of getting the
right thing, particularly in the way of
variety, as a starter, and then to be sure to
take good care of it.
There is no question but that in all sec-
tions where citrus fruits are grown, there
are some varieties. that do better than
others, and in planting new groves in any
of these localities it would invariably, be
the better to consult those who have
already planted and fruited budded trees,
before deciding on what you will plant,
and not depend on something that you
knew as a ﬁne fruit which was grown a
hundred or more miles distant.
I believe one of the results of “The
Freeze” was to weed out many varieties
that had been propagated extensively in
the early days of citrus fruit growing in
Florida, because they were not proﬁtable,
and we now have in our list of good
varieties as compiled by our committee,
and published in last year’s yearbook, a
catalogue of Citrus fruits, each with its
distinctive marks, and so arranged, that
even a novice can pick out the winners,
with a little local aid, and research, as to
adapability to location, etc. and I believe
every variety listed, is a goo-l one for
some locality, and among the best of them,
for universal use, I believe the following
are entirely safe: Early Boones, Parson
Brown (Carney) Satsuma; Midseason:
Pineapple, Homosassa, Majorca, Ruby;
Late: Hart’s (Tardiﬂ') Valencia Late;
Very Late: Lamb’s Summer. Novelties:
Dancy (Tangierine;) King, Mandarin,
Kumquats. I prefer the Parson Brown,
to all others on the list of early varieties.
The Boone will color up eariler in the
season, but its appearance is against it, and
it is inclined to roughness, and a thick
rind, and is of a very uninviting color,
even when fully ripe.
For midseason varieties, there is noth-
ing on the list, that quite equals the Pine-
apple, and it differs from other varieties,
inasmuch that it can safely be" depended
on, in any, and all localities. where any
kind, or varieties of citrus can be grown
It is the most proﬁtable sort for high pine
lands, and is perfection on hammock and
other rich, or heavy soils. This variety,
like the Parson Brown, has made a reputa-
tion for itself, on the different markets,
and I believe I am perfectly safe in saying
that it has netted the growers fully a dol—
lar a box more than any other variety, the
past season. Next to the Pineapple, is the
Homosassa, and as a midseason, to
medium late variety, I believe there is a
good chance for the Ruby. Ruby should
always be classiﬁed, and shipped as a
Blood and it should be put up in as attract-
ive a manner as possible. The Hart’s
and Valencia Late, I have found to be of
about equal merits as to quality of fruit.

However, if there is any variation, it is in
favor of the Valencia Late in evenly
coloring up, and smoothness, and texture
of peel. The Tardiff will hang on the trees
a little later in the season, but I am not
sure that the quality of the fruit improves
as it is apt, especially so on lemon stock,
to get greener after rainy season com-
mences. I have noted the past winter,
that late varieties, owing to their im-
mature condition probably recover from
the effect of cold weather better than any
of the midseason, or early varieties. A
neighbor shipped in good condition April
I 5th Tardiﬂ oranges that were seeming-
ly ruined by a temperature of 22 degrees,
two nights about January 20th.
I believe, too, that there is a good mar-
ket waiting for a good navel orange. This
variety, when of good quality, has always
brought good prices, and as there have
been some improvements made on the old
Washington Navel during the past ﬁve or
six years, there is good reason to believe
that we will yet be able to produce the best
navels to be had anywhere, and if the new
varieties prove to be proliﬁc bearers on
sour, and sweet stock, and of good quality
on lemon, and generally successful in
most sections of the state, instead of cer-
tain restricted localities, as heretofore,
they will be a most proﬁtable variety to
plant, and propagate.
By planting the varieties as listed above,
or others of equal merit, and so dividing
the different classes of fruit, as to give
early, midseason, late, and novelties, about .
an equal share, or area in the new groves,
one could pretty well cover the entire ship-
ping, or marketing season, and in this
way get an average of season’s prices,
which ought to bring the account out on
the right side of the ledger.
The subject, Stocks, was pretty well
covered by Prof. Rolfs, in his paper “Re-
lation of Science to Horticulture” See
pages 56 to 66 last year’s year book; but,
I want to say that there is probably no
other state in the Union that shows such
a diversity of soil, as Florida, and while
I agree with most others here, that the
sour orange is the best stock to use and
that it is this stock that has been used to
produce most of the prize winners at vari-
ous exhibitions etc., there are soils upon
which it would hardly produce a leaf, on
account of their extremely light, sandy
composition. If we, in the larger portion
~ of Orange county, on our high sandy,hilly
lands depended altogether on the sour
stock,- we would not have a very good
show for the money invested, and a large
portion of our groves are on sweet, and
rough lemon stock. The sour stock is
a favorite in all localities, where a good
quality of soil is to be had, and there can
be no doubt, that fruit will carry longer, in
good condition, on this stock than on any
other, but on light, or high thirsty pine
lands, it would be cultivated chieﬂy, at a
loss. The Citrus Trifoliata stock has been
tried, and proven an absolute failure, and
the pomelo, or grapefruit stock grows off
well until it has been budded to some
variety of round oranges, and after that
it usually loses its thrift, and does not do
any better than the sour stock. There-
fore, about all that we have to depend on
is the rough lemon as a stock.
This stock is a very rank feeder, and
rarely suffers from the effects of dry
weather, as other stocks do. It is healthy,
and will thrive with us, under most ad-
verse circumstances, and can always be
counted on to produce a good crop of
fruit, when treated fairly, and' properly

fertilized. It is folly to expect that trees
worked on this stock over-supplied with
nitrogen, will produce good fruit, and
especially is this true, if organic materials
are used, with an excess of nitrogen, and a
deﬁciency of phosphoric acid, and pot-
=ash. This is not only true of lemon stock,
but it has been my observation, that every
grove so treated will produce a poor grade
of fruit, and sooner or later, develop that
most trying disease, “dieback,” which
might truly be called indigestion of the
orange tree. There are many growers
who have ﬁne looking groves, that are
bearing large quantities of a poor quality
of fruit, who blame it all to the stock,
when they might by taking into considera-
tion the fact that this stock is an immense
feeder, and does not require the same
amount of nitrogen that the sour stock
does, nor the same methods of cultivation
as other stocks, and cultivating, and fer-
tilizing them accordingly, produce a good
quality of fruit.
I do not advocate the use of this stock
on any but light soils. and by those who
have had experience in cultivating citrus
fruits, and who understand the require-
ments of their soils but those who have
this stock already planted, and developed
to a bearing stage, can do much to im-
prove the quality of their fruit by regulat-
ing their formula of fertilizer in such a
way as to most accurately meet the re-
quirements of their soils as, well as their
methods of cultivation, etc.
I would like to add that the late D. W.
Adams, who was for many years president
of this Society, and during his residencein
this state one of our most practical Hor-
ticulturists, and one who was noted for
his success with citrus fruits, had before
his death, decided in favor of the lemon
stock for all his new groves, not because it
was the best stock for universal use of
course, but because he had solved the
problem of its successful cultivation, and
fertilization. His methods of cultivation
are too well known to make mention of
here, except to say that they mainly con-
sisted of very light working with hoes, and
plenty of mulching. I think his plan of
mulching might have been improved upon,
but the fact remains, that he produced the
best fruit grown in the state, and it was
seldom that a box of his Navels, or Tar-
diFfs went out of his packing house. that he
did not get back from $5 to $10 for it. No
matter where the lemon stock is used, it
cannot be cultivated, and fertilized in
same manner that other stocks can, with-
out producing coarse ungainly fruit, and
if kept highly cultivated, and fertilized
with a formula containing over 4 per
cent ammonia, and less than 7 to 8 per
cent Phosphoric Acid, and 10 to I2 per
cent potash it will naturally follow, that
the fruit will be insipid, ﬂavorless, coarse,
and of light weight.
In localities where sour stock thrives,
no other stock is to be considered, and the
less fertilizerrequired, the moregratifying
will be the success of the grower, but in all
cases I would warn you to beware of, and
ﬁght shy of a fertilizer formula. consist-
ing of any but pure chemicals, and if once
you are tempted, and fall into the use of a
cheap source of the different requisite
elements, or an organic form of fertilizer,
you at the same time put yourself into a
position to regret it later on. when your
trees begin to bear, if not before. I am
sorry to have to say that in many portions
of Florida the balance will show up on the
wrong side of the account this year, for
with the condition of our markets, and the
general falling off in quality of fruit pro-
duced, the net earnings of our groves have

fallen many thousands of dollars behind
what most of us conﬁdently expected to
receive for our fruits, and in the main, I
fear it is the growers’ fault this time in
many ways. First, in quality of fruit pro-
duced, Second, in poor packing, Third,
in rushing green fruit to the market very
early in the season, with the resultof hope-
lessly glutting the markets with slow sell-
ing fruit, and so demoralizing the market,
that there was no settling to real values, at
any time during the season; and added to
all this, was the effects of the cold of Jan-
uary and the consequent loss of large
quantities of fruit, waiting to be shipped,
when the market once got settled. Such
good fruit as was left on the trees in many
localities has brought very low prices, in
consequence of frozen, or partially in—
jured fruit having been shipped, usually at
a loss, but I trust all these hard luck ex-
periences, have carried with them their lit-
tle lessons, relative to properly sorting,
and packing fruit, etc., as well as bringing
to the minds of all. growers, the necessity
of producing a good article to offer to the
consumer if good prices are expected in
return.
I trust I will not be encroaching on the
privileges of some other committee, if I
say a word or so about insects, and spray—
ing, for I believe a great deal depends on
spraying, that is essential to producing
good fruit, for good fruit must have a
good appearance, as well as a sweet, aro—
matic interior. From the time the bloom
drops off the young fruit in the spring,
there are enemies lying in wait to prey
upon it, during every stage of its develop-
ment, and while there are many locations,
where soil, and atmospheric conditions are
at enmity with these insects, and fungus
diseases, and work wonders as prevent-
ives of damage to the fruit and trees by
their effects on them, I believe the rule is
that these insects, and fungus diseases do
a great deal of damage, and spraying be-
comes a necessity, in order that a good
quality of fruit may be produced, not-
withstanding opinions held to the con-
trary. However, I have learned of cases.
during the past season where beginners
(at spraying I mean) had done as much
damage, with their spraying ,or more per-
haps, than the insects sprayed for would
have done, if left alone. This was because
they did not use the spray at the right
time, or used it too strong, or too often.
\Vhile I believe that it is absolutely neces-
sary at allinterior points, to spray,I would
caution those who do it, to be sure they are
right, before they go ahead. Use the
right thing, at the right time etc. As
there are numerous, bulletins to be had for
the asking, from the Experiment Station
at Lake City, besides which advice will be
gladly furnished by the Station director,-
Dr. Sellards. I would recommend that
growers avail themselves of all the knowl-
edge these sources afford and thus equip
themselves with perfect knowledge of
their enemy before entering the arena.
White Ply.
I believe the mention of this little in-
sect is sufﬁcient cause to make every
grower, who has the well being of his
grove nearest his heart, look himself over,
and brush his clothes well before thinking
of entering his grove again, and if we
were all as careful as this assertion would
indicate, I believe it would be a simple
matter to keep the insect in check. During
the past two or three years we have all be-
gun to realize what a serious menace this
insect is to our orange groves, and man
plans have been suggested, for ﬁghting t
successfully, and keeping it in check, and
4

we cannot afford to get careless. If you
would keep free of their damage, keep free
of them. Never go near them and then
into your own grove, without ﬁrst making
sure that you carry none with you on
your clothes, in your carriage, etc., and in-
kist on the same consideration of anyone
else who enters your grounds. The
beneﬁts to be derived from local protective
organizations are too manifest to need
more than a passing remark here, and
those neighborhoods that can do so, would
be more beneﬁtted by this method of pro-
tection than by any other. It is cheaper to
keep this insect out of a community than
it is to ﬁght it after it has gained a foot-
hold. We have kept it out of our neigh-
borhood for several years by spraying it
at the nearest points, and cutting down all
food plants in its path, and now the ﬂy is
not as near us. as it Was at the beginning
of our ﬁght to keep it out.
There is not much danger of getting the
ﬂy from any of the leading nurserymen,
for I believe they have a scruple in the
direction of spreading so damaging a pest,
but there is danger of shipping nursery
stock through. the country, either by ex-
press, or freight when the fly is on the
wing, unless it is packed very tight. and
no chance for the insect to get to the con-
tents of the package. The express and
freight cars gather them up. when passing
through infested places, and often carry
them many miles from their original
breeding places. I have seen ﬂies at Wild-
wood, which came all the way from Or-
lando, in the express car. a distance of ﬁfty
miles. You can imagine what would have
occurred if there had been an open top case
of citrus trees in that car.
And now in conclusion, I want to say
that if we bend all our energiesto the point
of breaking, and strive'to keep our pro-
duct up to its known standard of excel-
lence I can see no reason why we cannot
succeed in keeping the reputation of Flori-
da oranges at the head of the list, believ-
ing that there is only one thing that we
can do, one that will be of lasting beneﬁt
to our organization, and that is, to strive
every way possible to make our product
better each year, until we have well earned
the reputation that we now enjoy, that of
producing the best citrus fruit grown in
the world and then by untiring effort keep
its reputation right there. Regretting
that I cannot give you anything better in
the way of a report, as an aid in that
direction, I am,
Yours respect fully,

M.r. President—I have a letter that was
intended to have reached me in time to
have been incorporated in my report, but
it did not do so and I beg to have the same
received and attached as a part of report
of the Committee on Citrus Fruits.
On motion duly seconded and carried,
the following paper referred to by Mr.
Conner was received as a part of the report
on citrus fruits:
May 9th, 1905.
O. W. Conner,
Jacksonville, Fla.,
Dear Sir;
I have your letter of recent date stating
that you are preparing a paper on citrus
fruits, and thatyou would like me to
write you something regarding the situa-
tion in Cuba, knowing that I am entirely
familiar with it while you are not. You
also say that you would like to have a gen-

eral statement from me as to my opinion
as to the future of the citrus and nursery
business. I fear very much that it will not
be possible for me to attend the meeting at
Jacksonville much as I would like to do so.
I had expected to be in Cuba, but was
able to get away somewhat sooner than
usual, but ﬁnd that I must go to New
York at once, which will prevent my at-
tendance at the meeting. I do not suppose
you will have much time for a lengthy
statement from me, and will therefore en-
deavor to make it brief.
Orange growing in Cuba, up to com-
paratively recent date, was merely inciden-
tal. None of the groves had ever been
planted with the idea of shipping fruit to
market, but such fruit as was grown came
from trees which happened to be planted
in one place or another by accident. These
trees are found growing all over the
Island, and have never received any care
worth mentioning. In many parts of the
Island there are many wild trees growing
in the forest, just about as they did in the
hammocks around Orange Lake, except-
ing that they are not quite as plentiful.
There are also a great many bitter sweet
trees growing throughout the Island, and
the fruit on these trees, as well as that on
the sour trees, seems to be identical with
the fruit grown in Florida. In regard to
the quality of the sweet orange I will say
that there is as wide a range as there is in
Florida, and while I have eaten oranges
in Cuba which I consider to be as good as
any I have ever tasted, I have also eaten
many which were very poor. There is
nothing very surprising about this, how-
ever, when the circumstances under
which they were grown are taken into con-
sideration. The trees are generally stand-
ing where there is no chance whatever to
cultivate them. and in many instances the
entire ground surrounding the trees is
choked with a dense growth of other trees
and plants. Many of the trees are grow-
ing in what is called Guinea grass land,
and this grass grows very rank. and often
attains the height of eight to ten feet.
During the many wars which have pre-
vailed on the island, either one army or the
other persisted in setting ﬁre to anything
that would burn, in order to burn out or
smoke out the enemy. This was, of
course, pretty tough on the orange trees,
as many of them were burned to the
ground, while others were badly injured.
A great many people who have been to the
Island have told me that they never saw a
large orange tree, but had the trees in
Florida been burned as they have in
Cuba, the same statement might truthfully
be made here. If we were to have a freeze
which cut our trees to the ground
about every four years I doubt if anyone
would ever see a large orange tree in
Florida. There has been practically no
shipment of oranges from the Island of
Cuba for many years. The entire product
of these scattering trees being consumed at
home. Within the last two or three years,
however, several American Syndicates
have planted large groves of oranges and
grapefruit in Cuba, and the prospect is _
that within a very few years Cuba will be
known as a factor in the citrus fruit busi-
ness. While it is true that oranges will
grow in any part of the Island it is also
true that a great deal of the soil of Cuba is
not well adapted to citrus fruit culture.
owing to the fact that it is very heavy and
almost impossible to cultivate. Such land
will produce magniﬁcent sugar cane. as
during the rainy season they do not ex-
‘1Ject nor is it necessary to cultivate sugar
cane, and at such. time as I have described
it is impossible to work a horse for the

reason that it would soon sink out of sight.
The lands with which I am most familiar
are located at Ceballos in Porto Principe,
Province. Here I found the soil very
similar to that in our best Florida Ham-
mocks, except that it is red instead of
black. The land is covered with a dense
growth of hardwood timber, and it stands
so thick that a cat can hardly crawl into
it. \Vhen I went to inspect this land for
the Development Company of Cuba I
found that where wells had been dug the
soil was twenty-six feet deep before they
struck sub-soil, and it seems to be just as
good at the bottom as it is at the top.
There is 29 per cent of silica in the soil
and this makes it porous enough so that
when a heavy rain falls it soon soaks
through it. I have seen it rain steadily
for nearly twenty-four hours, and within
two hours after it stopped I could ride a
horse all over the well-cultivated ﬁeld
with out any discomfort whatever, and the
ploughs and cultivators could be operated
next day. I think all things considered
this is the ﬁnest soil for orange growing
that I have ever seen. The time may come
when we will have to fertilize, but I think
it is a long way off. The Development
Company of Cuba. of which I am the
General Manager, determined to plant or-
anges on an extensive scale, and we be-
gan operations there two years ago. Our
ﬁrst planting was about 10,000 trees and
we ﬁnished on the ﬁfteenth of February.
1903. To anyone who has not visited
Cuba, it would seem almost incredible if
they were told that trees planted at that
time are now, many of them, 12 feet high_
and the stocks three to four inches in
diameter with a corresponding spread of
branches, that they bloomed in March, and“
that many of them are now carrying three
to four boxes of fruit. Whether this will
shed or not I cannot say, but I never saw
healthier looking fruit in all my life. Thus
it was when I left there a week ago. I do
not wish to convey the idea that every tree
is twelve feet high, or that every tree has
three to four boxes of fruit, but I believe
the grove will average nine feet in height,
and unless they drop very badly. the pres-
ent indications are that we will have more
than an average of one ' box per
tree. It must be taken into con-
sideration, howeverv that these trees
grow the entire season. and there
is never a day in the year but what
you can go into the grove and ﬁnd plenty
of new growth on them. In Florida, you
are all aware that there trees generally
rest for three or four months each year,
and then if they have been fortunate
enough to escape Jack Frost, they con-
tinue to increase in size. but you can
readily see that this is a much slower pro-
cess than when the growth is continuous,
and where the land is so rich that they
never lack for a square meal. The De-
velopment Company in connection with
the colonists who have settled there have
now planted about 2.000 acres to citrus
fruits, and these will probably be increased
from ﬁve to eight hundred acres per year
for several years, as it is'the intention of
the Company to plant at least 3.000 acres.
I never saw trees anywhere that seemed
to be in any more healthy condition. and I
can see no reason why the production
of citrus fruits in Cuba should not be car-
ried on successfully, and on an enormous
scale. We have had some little trouble
with gumming, but this has entirely yield-
ed to treatment and the affected
trees seem to be in perfect con-
dition at the present time. We
have also had more or less scale to con-
tend with, but I do not anticipate much

53
trouble on this score. We were never
troubled much on the rich Hammock
lands here in Florida for the reason that
the trees grew so rapidly that the scale
could not seem to do much damage. I
had several hammock land groves be—
fore the freeze, and do not recollect ever
having sprayed one for insects, but on
the pine lands we always had troubles of
our own. The soil in Cuba being so very
much richer than any in Florida, I do not
apprehend much trouble from scale in—
sects for the reasons above given. We
have not, as yet, had any white ﬂy to con-
tend with, and I sincerely hope that we
will be able to keep them out. Judging
from the growth the trees already plant-
ed have made, and by the prospect we
have for fruit this year, I think I am safe
in saying that the present planting at
Ceballos in the course of ﬁve or six years
ought to yield easily one and a half mil-
lions of boxes. We are located on the
line of the Cuba Railroad, and this Com-
pany is building enormous docks at its
terminus at Nipe Bay, which will be our
shipping port, and we expect to deliver
fruit from our packing house to the
wharf in New York in ﬁve days or less.
There is one great advantage in ship—
ping from Cuba, and that is, after the
fruit is loaded onto the vessels, there
are no way stations or side tracks, but
it goes direct to its destination without
stopping. I am satisﬁed that thousands
of trees will be planted in unfavorable lo-
cations in Cuba, and do not believe such
trees will ever amount to anything. I
have seen trees grown on heavy black
lands which produced beautiful fruit,
but upon examination I found them bad-
ly creased and would not stand shipment.
This land is very similar to some I own
at Silver Springs Run, and while my fruit
was very handsome to look at it was al-
ways badly creased, and it put me to lots
of trouble to market it, as I could never
sell the crop to the same man twice, for
the reasons above stated. There are
bound to be failures in Cuba just as
there have been in Florida and Califor-
nia, but in my opinion where careful and
intelligent selection of land and location
has been made there ought to be no trou-
ble to succeed in growing as good citrus
fruit in Cuba, as in any other place in
the world, and I believe when our im-
proved budded varieties begin to fruit
there will be no question about its quality.
Many people in Florida have an erroneous
idea that good oranges can not be grown
anywhere else. I think, however, that
you will all agree with me that there are
some mighty poor oranges grownin Flor-
ida, especially on lands which are not
well adapted and which are not properly
fertilized. It is doubtful if any better
fruit than is grown in some parts of Flor-
ida will ever be produced anywhere, and
it would be an unreasonable man who
would ask for anything better, but with
the experience I have already had in
Cuba I feel perfectly satisﬁed that we
will produce a great deal of good fruit
that will compete with the best in Flor-
ida and California.
In regard to the nursery business I
do not suppose this will interest your
hearers, but Will say brieﬂy that I have
never yet seen any trees grown in Cuba
which compared to those produced in the
sandy lands of Florida. Any one who is:
at all familiar with the propagation of
trees or plants knows very well that a
light sandy soil is much more desirable
for the reason that it will produce a much
better root system. In the rich lands of
A Cuba there is so much plant food always
present in the soil that the young plant
does not ﬁnd it necessarytothrow out any

large quantity of roots as a comparative-
ly few seem to sufﬁce for its needs, while
in the sandy lands of Florida the young
plant must hustle for food as soon as the
seed sprouts, and this continual hustling
gives our trees the magniﬁcent root
system for which they are so justly not-
ed. In planting our trees if proper care
is taken by the nurserymen in digging
and by the planters when setting there
should not be a loss of one per cent, and
I have known. several instances where
several thousands of trees were planted
without the loss of a single one. On
the other hand with the Cuban grown
tree, if the same precautions are used
as in the other case there is often a loss
of from twenty-ﬁve to ﬁfty per cent, ow-
ing undoubtedly to the lack of roots on
the tree grown in the rich soil. I have
seen nursery stock grown in California,
Jamaica and Cuba, but have never seen
anything that could “hold a candle” to
the tree grown in the sandy soil of Flor-
ida. A great many of my friends have
talked with me on this subject of orange
growing in Cuba, and seem to fear that
Cuba would soon put Florida out of
business. I do not think we need to have
any fears on this score, as there will be
but little competition. I have always
advocated the planting of late varieties
in Cuba, claiming that we should take
advantageof the climatic'conditions there
and grow something that could not be
grown in Florida. About 90 per cent of
the orange trees I have sold in Cuba are
of the late varieties, and will not get into
the market until after the ﬁrst of Feb-
ruary, at which time practically everyl
thing has left Florida. I have advised
against planting the early varieties for
the reason that we can not get them in-
to the, market any earlier than can be
done from Florida, and as our growers
have a bad habit of rushing their fruit
into the market regardless of the fact
that it is green and unﬁt for use, and
without any reference to the demands of
the market, I thought it would be bad
policy to get our fruit in at the same
time, as we would all go down together.
There will of course be some fruit ship-
ped during December and January, but
I do not think these shipments will have
much effect on the market, as the bulk
of the fruit will come later.
There is much more that might be
said, but I have already made this letter
much longer than I intended.
Trusting that it may be of some inter-
est to your hearers, I remain,
Yours very truly,
M E. GILLETT.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Boggs—Mr. President, there is es-
pecially one important point in my judg-
ment contained in the committee report
that should be fully discussed by the so-
ciety. That point is the question of
overproduction of grapefruit. There has
been a great deal of complaint this sea-
son of the prevailing low price of grape~
fruit and it behooves us to inquire into
the cause. \Vhile I must admit that I
have myself seen but a small portion of
the state and am not entirely familiar
with the acreage or output of grapefruit,
I have gained the impression. from the
press throughout the state that it is now
large and still growing; in fact, it seems
that everybody is planting grapefruit.
Mr.‘ President, this is a very important
subject to this society and to the citrus
fruit industry of this state. The market
conditions on this crop are decidedlybad.
There seems to be no let up in the plant-
ing of grapefruit trees and there scemsto

be no let up in depression of prices, so
far as my observation goes and I would
like very much indeed to have the views
of other members of the society upon
this very important matter.
Mr. Carroll—Mr. President, before I
could entirely agree with the gentleman
I think we should ﬁrst look to the mar-
ketable condition of the fruit, picking
handling, packing and shipping and the
proper distribution before we come to
the conclusion that we are approaching
an overproduction in this handsome new
fruit. Grapefruit, Mr. President, is a new
fruit, a comparatively new citrus prod-
uct. There are thousands of people in
this country who do not know what
grapefruit is. They never saw the fruit,
and when they see it they have to be edu-
cated how to eat it. Further than this
my observation is that the condition of
the marketable crop up to this time has
been positively bad. The handling and
packing has been bad, shipment and dis-
tribution has not been the best. I be-
lieve I can safely say, Mr. President, that
fully one-third of the fruit shipped out-
of the state this season has been shipped
out in a green. immature and decidedly
unmarketable condition. Such condi-
tions as-these will make the market
slump on anything. Another thing, Mr.
President, the hue and cry was raised
some years ago that we were on the
verge of overproduction in oranges.
We do not hear any more about it
now. The proper handling, picking, pack-
ing and shipment of the orange crop se-
cures good prices on the market. I believe
it will be the same with grapefruit. Let
its rather make improvement ﬁrst in these
important conditions, Mr. President, and
give the great markets of this country a
taste of the delicious grapefruit before we
indulge in the pessimistic views of over-
production. I am an. optimist in the
matter of the grapefruit industry, as I
am with regard to almost the entire fam-
ily of Florida citrus fruits. Give us some
legislation if it is needed in the matter
of crateage and package and rates. Let
us send our fruit to market in prime con-
dition and I believe the low prices will
abate and vanish.
Mr. Connor—I think you will ﬁnd, Mr.
President, that attention is called in my
paper to marketable conditions. These
conditions must be bettered before we
can expect to realize better prices. The
matter is a very serious one and we must
seek the cause. I am inclined to believe
myself that there is now a partial over-
production of grapefruit, or to put it
transversely, under-consumption. The
conditions exist and they should be met
if it is possible to meet them or suffer
disastrous consequences.
Mr. Blackman -- Mr. President. I
heartin concur in the remarks of Mr.
Carroll. During my travels last summer
I came across scores of people who had
never heard of grapefruit and did not
know what it was, and didn’t know how
to eat it when they saw it, but who were
all delighted with the fruit when it was
offered them and they had once tasted
it. If this be true, and it most assuredly
is true. how can we apprehend overpro—
duction in this comparntnely new citrus
fruit? The great majority of the people
of this country as yet do not know what
grapefruit is. They have never seen it.
It has never been offered to them. It has
never been placed upon their market.
In my judgment, Mr. President, we cer-
tainly should not apprehend overproduc-
tion until we have at least put the fruit

properly upon the market in good con-
dition. I found this state of things at
the St. Louis Exposition. There wasn’t
-a man in ten who had ever heard of
grapefruit. I had some of the fruit with
me. I induced a commission merchant to
take a shipment of it, and exhibiting the
fruit there, I told the people where it
could be procured. The consequence
was. the merchant sold out his entire
shipment in a few days. Mr. President,
we have not overproduction of grape—
fruit at all in my judgment. It is rather
a lack of 'systematic marketing. I do not
fear overproduction. I have always been
able to dispose of my fruit on the trees
in many instances at good prices, and
I believe with proper systematic manage-
ment, the same good results can be had
now from the fruit of every grapefruit
tree in the state. You can not get good
prices for an inferior, green, immature,
badly handled, packed or shipped fruit
on a glutted market. The grapefruit in
my judgment has as bright a future be
fore it as the orange. I therefore can
not believe that there are any grounds
of apprehension or fear of overproduc-
tion of this delicious, comparatively new
fruit, which as yet has barely been .in-
troduced to the markets of this coun-
try.
Mr. Boggs—I feel unwilling to leave
the subject without another word or two.
The comparison has been made here be-
tween the grapefruit and the orange.
There is no comparison. Mr. President, in
my opinion, between the two fruits—at
least so far as market results are con-
cerned. In the ﬁrst place, the grapefruit
has to be eaten at the table after prepara-
tion in the culinary deartment. It there-
fore requires too much handling before it
reaches the point of consumption. It
is a large fruit and can not be handled
in the same manner as the orange. There-
fore, it will never have a very large sale,
as a notable instance on trains, which
aloneis an important channel of consump-
tion. It is well known, or if it is not it is
time it was becoming known, that the
average patron of the fruitstand, where
the two fruits are displayed, the orange
and the grapefruit, will buy ten oranges
to one grapefruit. He can eat the one
on the spot. if he chooses; the other
he has to take home with him and
have it prepared before he eats it. I
want to say here and now, Mr. Presi—
dent, that those of us, and I believe there
are many, who indulge the delusion that
the grapefruit is ever to rival the orange
on the market,are doomed to disappoint-
ment and despair. That can, in the very
nature of the two fruits, never be. It is,
in my opinion, the utmost folly to en-
tertain such a thought. The gentleman
from Miami. Mr. Blackman, is the only
person that I have heard of who has this
season received what he thought he
ought to have gotten for his grapefruit.
Let us, for a single moment, consider
his-conditions. The grove of which he
speaks is within a short distance of the
Royal Palm Hotel, and situated upon a
favorite driveway for tourists. The owner
sells entirely to this CIHSS of trade. and
gets twice as much per box in his grove
as the fruit could be bought for in New
York City. How many of us have a
grapefruit orchard in the shadow of a
palatial winter resort hotel, where the fruit
may be picked from the trees for the break-
fast table? The gentleman is to be con-
gratulated upon his situation and upon the
fancy prices he has obtained for his fruit,
but that situation, Mr. President, is a very
different one from the average grape-

fruit grower in this state. In conclusion,
‘ I must reiterate that my observation is,
that we have even. now, or we soon shall
have in this state, a very large overproduc-
tion of grapefruit. I would not be un-
derstood as discouraging its culture en—
tirely, but it should certainly be made _
subservient to the real condition of things
. as regards its scope and its market.
Tropical Fruits.
By Mrs. E. E. Ankeney, Eldrcd, Fla.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gcntlvmcn:
In the recent reports of this committee
I ﬁnd that those reporting gave y0u a
wide outlook upon the pineapple industry,
its history, increase and desirability as an
investment. One committeeman says:
“To go into the details of pineapple cul-
ture would be entirely foreign to this re-
port,” and another says “I should hate
very much to feel called upon to relate
* * * the details * * * and I
take it that people generally care little for
such information.” As I have neither a
wide experience nor extended observation,
I must necessarily conﬁne myself to my
smaller knowledge which covers only the
methods of culture employed by myself
and some others in my own vicinity.
I have been a member of this society
and read its reports for six years past, but
have never had the pleasure of attending
a meeting where I could ask questions:
so that when I read that Mr. Porcher has
found a new bug on his orange trees,
which he got rid of by spraying, I am glad
if he describes it so that I may know it
should it come down our way; or when
Mr. Hart says there is a fungus which
will take care of that bug just as well, and
does not tell what, that fungus looks like,
whether green, brown, or yellow, or
where it grows, how shall I know that I
have the panacea on hand when the dread
enemy appears? I-am sure the facts and
minute details are what make the Annual
Reports of this society valuable.
PINEAPPLES.
Pineapples have as yet only one great
enemy and he is the, hitherto, unconqucr-
able Jack Frost. He has laid them low
several times but, like Truth, though
crushed to earth they rise again and grow
and grow. In the hope of making my
paper practical, therefore. to those newly
starting in the business, I will tell you how
some of us grow Red Spanish pineapples
out of doors at Eldred on the East Coast.
Our land is spruce pine and high ham-
mock. It is cleared, grubbed deeply and
raked as for a garden. The slips which
form around the base of the apple are
allowed to grow after the fruit is picked
until mature, and are considered the most
desirable to plant, although suckers usual-
ly bring a higher price per thousand.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY
Good plants should be eight inches or
more in length. These are cut otf slightly
at the base and enough of the leaves or
boot peeled off to expose the root system
and planted with a dibble or trowel,
twenty inches each way and in beds
twenty to forty feet wide being found
most satisfactory. At this distance it will
require about twelve thousand per acre,
more or less, according to the space given
to paths. Some, immediately after plant-
ing, put a pinch of cottonseed meal, or
cottonseed meal and tobacco into the heart
of each plant. but generally this is not
done until the plant begins to root. From
this time till the plants bloom, the scuﬁ'le-
hoe is the grower’s best friend, and its
constant use without fertilizer will make
better plants than the fertilizer without
the scuffle-hoe. Neither should be used
sparingly if the best results are to be se-
cured. When well rooted an application
of ﬁve hundred pounds to the acre of cot-
tonseed meal and tobacco or of high grade
blood and bone will keep them growing
nicely. If the weather does not become
cold enough to check growth, still another
application of the same kind. say one
thousand pounds per acre, may be applied
in the late fall or winter though this may
be delayed till February or March.
By mid-summer the plants should be
nearly full grown and stocky at the base.
Until recently it has been usual to apply
at this stage simply an ammoniated fer-
tilizer and if they are at all backward that
will be best, but otherwise I prefer to add
a slight percentage of phosphoric acid and
potash to the ammoniate. One hundred
pounds of fertilizer to each one thousand
plants is sufﬁcient. The plants will then
need nothing further until they are ready
to fruit and this is applied any time be-
tween September and March, owing to the
1
condition of the ﬁelds, the weather or the
ideas of the individual grower. A for-
mula for this last application often used is
3 to 4 per cent of ammonia, 7 to 8 per cent
phosphoric acid and 10 to 12 per cent pot-
ash.
I have thus outlined as brieﬂy as pos-
sible one system of cultivation which has
given good results, but of course there are
many variations from this, both in the
amount of fertilizer, proportions, and
time of application. The pineapple is
tenacious of life and lives to' fruit so it
does its level best with whatever comes to
it, but repays richly for good feeding and
care. An acre well cared for will, if the
plants were vigorous and all conditions
favorable. produce 90 per cent or from
300 to 400 crates the ﬁrst crop, but as
neither slips nor suckers are uniformly
good and some years are all below par,
the average yield is not so high. After
plants cover the ground. cultivation ceases
and fertilizer is applied broadcast, two
applications a year being considered suFﬁ-
cient in our locality. Formerly cotton—
seed meal and tobacco dust was the uni—
versal summer fertilizer, but recently a
more or less cOmplete one of high grade
materials is growing in favor, especially
when there is much fall fruit.
Believing that those who have never
seen» a pineapple ﬁeld or seen the fruit
handled would be interested, the writer
takes pleasure in showing some pineap—
ple views taken in the East Coast pineap-
ple belt in St. Lucie county. The pack-
ing of the fruit will be of especial inter-
est to many.
The growing of pineapples is no longer
an experiment. The problems remaining
to be solved are largely' economical and
commercial. Increased production means
smaller proﬁts and must induce better

business methods by the growers; less
waste and the obtaining by combination
or otherwise, wholesale prices on needed
supplies. We need a wider distribution
and cheaper rates, particularly to near-by
markets; and above all quicker transpor-
tation and more careful handling. Six
days to New York, and eight to Boston,
will never enable us to compete with
Havana fruit should our seasons be iden-
tical.
The freeze of January 25 to 26 left our
ﬁelds brown as stubble ﬁelds in Autumn.
But the wonderful vitality and recupera-
tive power of the pineapple plant has
again been demonstrated and our ﬁelds
are rapidly renewing themselves. The
yield from the older ﬁelds will be cut
down 60 to 70 per cent but those coming
into bearing for the ﬁrst time will produce
almost as many pines, but unless weather
conditions are perfect, they will average
much smaller than if they had not been
frozen. A strange characteristic of this
freeze was, that the newly planted ﬁelds
were practically uninjured. A white frost
has often done more damage to young
plants than did those two nights of freez-
ing weather,
We have no sheds in Eldred so I cannot‘
report upon their efﬁciency, but suppose
that now, if ever, their owners will realize
upon their investment.
At your last meeting the question most
persistently pressed was: “Do pineapples
pay?” To which I answer, “If they do
not, why do we grow them ?” For pine-
apple ﬁelds unlike an orange grove do not
appeal to the sentimental side of one’s na-
ture. When I look over their green slopes
I involuntarily begin to ﬁgure on the
number of crates and probable proﬁts, but
when I turn from these and walk down
through our small and not very produc-
tive orange grove, which has cost much
pains and money, and has never brought
a dollar of proﬁt, there is a fascination
and a compensating satisfaction in the
beauty of the trees alone, and a certain
charm of mystery and expectancy, as well.
The late Mr. Joseph Jefferson is reported
to have remarked to a caller at his Palm
Beach home that one of the disadvantages
of old people was that they had nothing to
expect, so this winter he has been garden-
ing. In the spirit of this bit of philosophy
I grow orange trees, that I may cherish
expectation and so keep ever the enthusi-
asm of youth, but I grow pineapples be-
cause they are proﬁtable.

The Government Viticultural Experiment Station.
By H. von Lutichau.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Two seasons have passed since my last
report on Viticultural Experiment Sta-
tion in my charge at Earleton. The time
allotted to this experiment has now
passed and we are in a position to recom-
mend a few successful varieties of this
class of ﬁnest table grapes. Not much
difﬁculty will be experienced by a care-
ful grower to get a good supply of excel-
lent fruit, superior to any native kind.
Varieties recommendable are:
\Vihite Grapes.—Admirable de Cour-
tiller, Chasselas Besson, Florence, Mon-
tauban, Dore, Parc de Versailles, Satin
Blane, Muscat Saint Laurent.
Black Grapes. — Black Alicante,
Frankenthal prexose.
Red Grapes.—Chasselas rouge, Rose
de Fallowx, Tsien-Tsien, and Chasselas
rose.
By application I think the United
States Department of Agriculture, Mr.
Husmann in charge of grape investiga-
tions, will supply a few scions of these
varieties for grafting. For stock, our
wild blue bunch grape is likely as good
as any and easy to get; otherwise Ru-
pestris in different forms. Personally, I
like the Taylor, a small cultivated grape
Riparia X.
It is not advisable to plant these
grapes on a large scale for distant mar-
kets; but for home use. for the lover of
beautiful fruit, they will prove most
satisfactory and a great enjoyment.
I have raised the best crops in the
third, fourth and ﬁfth year—after that
a decline is noted—but this may yet
be prevented by dif’ferent forms of prun-
ing, governed by variety, as well as soil
and locality. A good plan would be to
graft and plant new young vines every
six or seven years and the old vines may
be kept or discarded accordingly. After
planting, let vine grow at will ﬁrst year—
by winter cut back to two eyes—permit
but one to grow—the strongest—pinch
leader when about 3t04 feet high—let all
laterals grow and next winter trim to two
eyes spur system. I say “two eyes" for
I have found this preferable to the short
one eye spur trimming. Too close trim-
ming should be avoided, as well as the
growing of long spurless canes—and
short ones as well, which would at best
only bear fruit on the end, even when a
hundred feet long. Summer pruning
must not be done,except shortening in
a very strong and long growing cane.
For fertilizer blood, bone and potash is
best applied March or April; if possible
nothing but the cultivator should be
used: if plowed, then very shallow, keep
clean culture all the time.
Guard against overbearing. This will
ruin a vine quicker than anything else.
The wonder stories I used to hear occa-
sionally at our meetings testify but to
the ignorance of the grower. It is bet-
ter for the grower and especiallv better
for the vine to have a reasonable number
of ﬁne large bunches, than a display of
a great number of “berries.” Localities
where Anthracnose, rot or mildew is

found, Bordeaux spraying hasto be done;
begin early, as soon as bloom is over,
not forgetting one spray just before buds
are swelling. Preventive is better than
cure.
Bagging the bunches is necessary
Birds and wasps prefer such sweet grapes
to all others, and if done as soon as ber-
ries are formed, will almost prevent rot
and mildew on the fruit. Common pa-
per bags are used, large enough to hold
the full grown bunch, and fastened with
copper wire. A small hole or slit is to
be cut at the bottom.
Of insects, the steel blue beetle will
do the most harm, their destructive work
comes in when buds are ﬁrst swelling,
even before, and should be picked off by
hand.
I have often- seen growers cut their
grapes when they should have remained
two weeks or longer on the vine;
let fruit hang as long as possible. Sweet-
ness and aroma will then come to per-
fection.
l

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Painter—I would like to know if
any member of the society has any in-
formation he can offer on what is
known as the St. Augustine Grape. I
know of one or two vines, one of which
has been bearing for the last twenty
years. I know of but the two vines. The
grapes are small, something like the
Delaware, though not quite so large, and
grow in very large clusters. I think it
a good grape to get better acquainted
with.
Mr. Hampton—I have seen this grape
quite frequently in St. Augustine. It is
a proliﬁc grape, growing in large clus—
ters, somewhat smaller than the Dela-
ware,which it resembles. It is ahardyvine
long lived and a good bearer. It is a nice
table grape and is a grape that ought to
be and could be without trouble grown
anywhere in the state. I agree with Mr.
Painter that it is a grape that we should
get better acquainted with.
Mr. Hart—I should like to ask the
gentleman what measures, if any, are
taken to prevent the depredations of
birds, or if they are subject to such
depradations in his experience.
Mr. Hampton—I suppose they are to
some extent, but depredations of birds
are very easily remedied. I have been
bothered by birds in times gone by, but
am not any more. I have found that an
easy matter to remedy. Simply take a
small looking glass, tie a string to. the
edge of it and fasten it up in the top of
the tree or vine where it can have some
room to whirl or turn, and I can guaran-
tee that that particular vine or tree will
never be troubled with birds.
Member—I would like to ask if that
applies also to lady birds? (laughter).
Mr. Hampton—I regret to have to in-
form the member that it does not. This
will be found to be a cheap but most effec-
tive remedy against depredations by
birds.

Report on Figs and Kaki.
By J. H. Wylie.
Mr. President and Members of the S tatc
Horticultural Society:
Having been made one of the commit-
tee on Grapes, Figs and Kaki, I feel
it my duty to contribute what I can. The
other two members of this committee
are well known to this society, and their
practical experience in the past has been
of an instructive character in this state.
Hence my little report will be conﬁned
to our section and county. In grapes we
have fruited several varieties of the Mus-
cadine class quite successfully, and be-
lieve them perfectly at home in any part
of this state. We consider the following
kinds the best, viz.: Thomas, Scupper-
nong, James and Flowers. We ﬁnd that
the James at two years old will begin
fruiting at the same time not retarding
the growth, the fruit holds on until late
in the season. We have also succeeded
in getting very ﬁne specimen bunches
of some of the trellis varieties, such as
Niagara, Concord, Moore’s Early and
Delaware.
H‘s.
My experience with ﬁgs has been
mostly with the native varieties of Ce-
lestial, Lemon and Brunswick. These
seem to be the leading kinds. While
these all do well in our section I consider
the Celestial the most valuable, as the-
tree seems to be hardier and is the most
proliﬁc and regular bearer. The fruit,
though not so large, is very sweet and
excellent for preserves.
One of my neighbors, Mr. Charles
Francis, has succeeded in working up
quite a trade on ﬁg preserves. About
two years ago he began in a small way
putting them up in fancy glass jars, and
sending to friends in the North. The re-
sult is that his business has increased so
until now he is unable to ﬁll his orders;
he ﬁnds it proﬁtable and is thinking of '
going into the business on a larger scale.
If we can succeed in producing an
abundance of ﬁne fruit I believe there
will be great possibilities in canning; al-
so in fresh fruit for nearby markets. I
feel sure that if we would give the ﬁg
culture as much attention as we do oth-
er fruit trees, the time will not be far
distant when we will have as good ﬁgs
in our market here as any that we can
import from any other part of the world.
Kaki.
The Kaki or Japan persimmon is cer-
tainly a ﬁne fruit for home use, and also
has considerable market value, as they
are found in all our large fruit markets in
their season, and practically all of these
are raised in Florida.
In conversation with a man not long
ago, who has been the means of estab-
lishing a colony in Putnam county, he
remarked that the different varieties of
the Japan persimmon were grand, and
after testing the different kinds as to
ﬂavor, quality, etc., has become so in-
terested in the matter that now he in-
tends to plant quite an orchard, at least
40 acres to begin with, and in. the future
work up a special trade on the fruit.
The right soil for persimmons is quite
an important thing to consider, for while


## p. 63 (#79) ##############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 63
the native persimmon seems to thrive
well in almost any place, we have noticed
that the Japanese varieties on sandy soil
last much better.
For home use there is no better va-
riety than Zengi, the most of its fruit is
good, while hard, and improves as it
gets soft, it makes the best tree and is
the most proliﬁc, and regular bearer.
The Hyakume, Hachia, Tane-Nashi,
Yemon, and Okame, are the favorite
market sorts; they must be thoroughly
ripe and soft before they are good to
eat.
We must all agree that the Kaki is
most delicious fruit, beautiful in coloring
and shape, has ﬁne keeping and curing
qualities and is sure to become a favorite
in this country when our people become
educated up to its peculiar characteris-
ties.
The Kaki.
By Mr. Wm. Macklin, Dinsmorc, Fla.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Mark Twain tells of himself that he
was once suddenly and unexpectedly, in-
troduced to President Grant, and the only
thing he could ﬁnd to say was, “Mr.
President, I am embarrassed, are you P”
_ That describes my case exactly, as it is
only a month since I sent your secretary
my initial subscription to the Florida
Horticultural Society, and, before I could
get my breath, he launched upon me the
news that I must prepare a paper on the
Japanese persimmon. I wilted im-
mediately and wondered if there was any
way by which I could get that dollar back,
but decided it was gone beyond recall, and
that I must do my best with regard to the
paper, so I hope my immature effort will
taste better than an immature persimmon.
The Japan” Persimmon.
From all the information I have been
able to gather I believe that I have the
largest orchardof Japanese persimmonsin
America. It consists of about 2,500 trees,
planted in the years 1899, 1900. 1901, and
1902 and the remarks that follow are con-
ﬁned to observations of my own trees.
I have found the persimmon a very
interesting study, as it has qualities not
common to any other fruit tree with
which I have had experience, and a
knowledge of its habits is not widely dis-
seminated, or very easy to obtain, as in
the case of the more familiar fruits.
To begin with the matter of culti-
vation: I have long ago come to the con-
clusion that the persimmon is better with-
out what is generally understood by that
term. For the ﬁrst two years after I
started planting I kept my trees clean cul-
tivated, but as they grew I found that the
entire surface of the ground was literally
full of very ﬁne hair-like roots, and that
no matter how lightly the ground was
scratched quantities of these were torn up

so I abandoned tillage altogether and for
several years past merely run the mower
through the orchards during the late sum-
mer and again in the fall, using the cut-
grass weeds to mulch the trees. During
the ﬁrst season or two there was not sufﬁ-
- cient grass to make a heavy enough
mulch, and I had to cut over some twenty
acres or so of old ﬁelds and haul in sufﬁ-
cient to make up a coating about six in-
ches deep and cover an area as large as the
limbs of the tree. I found this more ex-
pensive than cultivation, while it lasted,
but now that the sod in the orchard has
become older and produces heavier grass-
es, such as broom grass, there is enough
to mulch heavily. The ground under this
mulch is looser and more friable than it
could be made by any system of cultiva-
tion, being protected continually from the
packing effect of rains, while at the same
time the ﬁbrous roots remain undisturbed.
The trees are vigorous and healthy and
make a good growth each season. No
other fertilizer except this rotting mass of
vegetation is given, and its slow and con-
tinuous effect as a fertilizer seems more
suitable to bearing persimmon trees than
any other I have tried, for reasons which
I will explain later.
In large quantities for commercial pur-
poses I have only three varieties. The
“Hyakume,” “Tane-nashi.” and “Hache-
ya,” though I have also a few trees of
“Yemon” and “Taber’s N0. 129.” Of
these “Tane-nashi” is the best market
kind; of good size and appearance; nearly
always seedless and holding its fruit better
than the others.
The “Hyakume” produces larger fruit,
is more juicy and of a better ﬂavor than
“Tane-nashi” but not so clean and bright
in appearance, and sheds its fruit badly.
“Hacheya” is also very large, with a ﬁne
ﬂavor, but must be kept till very ripe, as
the astringency common to nearly all un-
ripe persimmons is more marked in this
variety than the others.
The persimmon seems very free from
diseases and insect pests. I started plant-
ing my ﬁrst trees in peach orchards that
were badly infested with “San Jose” scale
and although the persimmon tree is class-
ed among those on which this scale can
exist, I could never ﬁnd the slightest trace
of any attack by the “San jose” from the
surrounding peach trees. Twig girdlers
and borers give them some attention but
I have not had suﬁicient trouble from
them to make treatment necessary. My
orchards are on pine land. In hammock
districts where there are probably larger
quantities of these insects they would per-
haps work more injury. The greatest
evil that the persimmon grower has to
contend with is the extraordinary propen-
sity that most varieties have for shedding
their fruit. The cause is unexplained in
any existing literature on persimmons
that I have seen, but I have formed my
own conclusions on this subject and
whether. correct or not they may be of in-
terest. The varieties having a very deep
cavity at the stem and a hard stiff calyx,
such as “Hyakume” shed much more than
those with shallow cavity and thin more
pliable calyx like “Tane-nashi.” I fre-
quently have “Hyakume” trees which
after setting thousands of fruits, shed
them all, while the “Tane-nashi” bears a
fair crop. The preliminary shedding just
after the fruit is formed is common to
most deciduous trees that habitually set
more fruit than they could possibly bear.
It is not to this that I refer, but to the con-
tinuous dropping that takes place after-
wards during the growing season right up
to .the time the fruit is mature. After

b
shedding it will be found that the stem
and calyx is always left on the tree, 01
in other words; separation takes place
only between the fruit and calyx. In the
deep cavitied kinds the calyx will always
be seen to be dragged down into the cavity
before the shedding occurs, My theory
therefore, is, that the strain produced by
the resistance of a very hard calyx against
being dragged into the narrow, deep
cavity, tears the fruit off. Whether this
solution of the mystery is correct or not, I
am not prepared to say, but after several
years of close observation, it is the only
one I have been able to arrive at and it is
borne out by the following reasons:
I. The deep cavitied and hard calyx-
ed kinds shed most. '
2. Any sudden stimulus, such as a
heavy rain, or an application of com-
mercial fertilizers, causing a rapid ex-
pansion of the fruit is immediately fol-
lowed by greatly increased shedding, and
3. A sickly or unhealthy tree on which
the fruit makes slow growth will in_
variably hold a full crop and vice-versa a
very vigorous tree will strip itself of every
specimen.
It is for the above reasons that I aban-
doned the use of fertilizers on my trees.
If applied at all it should only be done
during the winter, so as to give the stimu-
lus time to abate before the fruit is set.
The Hyakume has a peculiarity—a
good one too-—that I have never seen in
any other fruit tree. The larger the crop
on the tree, the greater the size of the fruit,
and, on the other hand, where a tree has
only one or two specimens, they are usual-
ly under the average size.
Regarding picking, packing‘and mark-
eting fruit must be clipped from the tree
like oranges, and should be fairly well
colored but stillquite hard .A suitable pack-
age is hard to ﬁnd, as the fruit varies so
much in size. When possible, the SIX
basket carriers should be used, and are
best liked by the trade, but some of the
fruit runs so large that more than two or
three cannot be packed in the four quart
basket used in these crates. For fruit of
that size I use the crate without the baskets
or sometimes the square cucumber crate.
Fruit should be wrapped and in each crate
I always put about a dozen copies of
plainly printed instructions as to using the
fruit only when perfectly ripe. These in-
structions ,I now have printed on paper
bags, which the retailer can use in de-
liyering the fruit to his customers.
Japanese persimmons are slowly mak-
ing headway in Northern markets, New
York taking them a little more freely than
other places, but the demand is still very
limited and large plantings would easily
glut the markets. In London, England
they are coming into considerable favor
and one small shipment I made there by
express, sold well, but the express rate
was prohibitive. The following season
I shipped ﬁfty crates, in two lots, by
freight, and they arrived in bad or-
der which can only have been due to bad
handling on the Atlantic steamships as
I kept samples of both lots here, till two
weeks after the bulk had arrived in Lon-
don, and they were still in perfect condi-
tion, though packed the same as the others
and kept in our ordinary September tem-
perature. I can see no reason why per-
simmons, should require refrigeration,
even on such a long trip. Moderater
good ventilation would probably be far
better. Specimens will keep for several
weeks while the temperature is still in the
seventies and eighties. -
A point in favor of the Japanese per-
simmon is, that it will exist and thrive on

ﬂat-woods land underlaid with hard-pan,
where other fruit trees fail.
Their handsome appearance is another
great recommendation. An orchard when
in full leaf, outshines in beauty, even the
far-famed orange grove.
I believe I have covered most of the
points necessary to a grower, but I will be
pleased to answer questions, or give any
information in my possession either now
or by correspondence with anyone who
is interested.
Report of Committee on Vegetables.
By C. G. White.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Hastings is in the last quarter of ship-
ping a one-hundred thousand barrel crop
of potatoes. The biggest day's shipment
reached over thirty-nine cars, all heavily
loaded.
It has been a season of big yields and
low prices. Prices have been kept no
worse than they are by the distribution
of our association. The potato crop in
this state is too large to be dumped into
the North hit or miss fashion. Every
barrel that leaves the state should have
its proper destination and must have if
the grower is to have the full reward of
his labor and risk.
It takes a big yield to pay expenses
when New York prices are under four _
dollars a barrel. Two days last week the
quotations touched three dollars. This
price means a net return of about one
dollar and a half per barrel as the crop
runs, and requires a yield of sixty barrels
to the acre to make ﬁve dollars proﬁt.
However, prices have so far run better
than this,-and the majority of the grow-
ers will probably clear up even or better.
There are many yields of ﬁfty barrels
and some of seventy and eighty. These
are ﬁeld runs, not favored corners, and
are unusual with us.
The railroad service has been bad.
Day after day, when there were empty
cars on an inaccessible track, hauling has
had to stop to the demoralization of our
working forces, and barrels have been
piled up on the platform because all the
cars on the switch were overloaded al-
ready. Finally, these ears have gone
forward at irregular times, and it was a
lucky shipper that got his car out of
Jacksonville short of twenty-four hours
later than the time taken last year. The
railway “shares our prosperity” as the of-
ﬁcials put it, at the rate of sixteen cents
per barrel to Jacksonville.
The potato methods are much the
same as of old. An effective machine dig-
ger is much needed. And another rail-
road.
Late blight made its general appear-
ance too late to be of material damage
to the yield. and the resulting rot has not
set in because weather conditions have
have not been suitable for its develop-
ment in that way.

So there are many people claiming
that it is useless to spray. Some that
have sprayed will spray more efﬁciently
next year than this.
Prof. Conner has just dug some suc-
cessful experiments with fertilizers and
varieties. Prof. Rolfs is conducting for
the government a test of ﬁfty-one for-
eign varieties, hoping to ﬁnd a disease
resistant variety on which to build a new
and healthy sort. The foliage on some of
these varieties is immense and peculiar.
One or two varieties cost large sums.
None of us wanted the responsibility of
knowing which these are, for fear it
would get out and the patches be raided.
It is interesting to know that the Eu-
ropean taste is for a yellow-ﬂeshed po-
tato. /
Concerning other vegetables I am not
conversant, having but lately returned
to the state.
This is my busy time, or I should ap-
pear with you at the meeting.
Celery and Egg Plant Report.
By F. C. Armstrong.
As the Florida State Horticultural So-
ciety has placed me on the Standing
Committee to make a report on vegeta-
bles, I will conﬁne my remarks to the
growth, culture and marketing of celery
and egg plants, only, thinking that my
brother committeeman, Mr. C. G.
White, of Hastings, would tell us how
to cultivate, grow and dispose of the
Irish totato to the best advantage and
that Mr. E. V. Blackman of Miami,
would give us the methods used on the
East coast.
Now, in Manatee county, we have
thousands of acres of land well adapted
to the culture of celery, it requiring a
rich, moist loam for the best results.
The culture of this crop bids fair to
become one of the leading and staple
crops in the county. We have been es-
pecially favored by having had not
enough cold to injure our crop or in
marketing it.
The seed of the celery is very small
and delicate, requiring, when young and
tender, to be protected by a framework
to keep the young plants from being
scorched by the hot rays of the sun.
Seeds must be planted very shallow,
beds must be kept wet daily, and other-
wise properly cared for, that they may
develop early and be good and thrifty
plants.
In setting plants we put about forty
thousand plants to the acre, double rows,
four or ﬁve feet apart, using from one
to two tons of best fertilizer to the acre
according to the nature of the soil, which
necessitates moist, well drained land. To
insure a good crop we must have irri—
gation, which can be had at a very small
cost from artesian wells.
The average crop per acre is about

68 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
from ﬁve hundred to one thousand crates
per acre; some instances going much
higher.
The plants must be boarded at a cer-
tain growth and kept there till well
bleached, and ready for market. It re-
quires about thirty-two thousand feet of
lumber per acre to board it properly. Af-
ter the celery crop is marketed, the land
is then followed by egg plant. In the
meantime the seed of the egg plant has
been placed in the hot beds and is now
ready for transplanting. Here again ir-
rigation is very desirable, although not
absolutely necessary. The cultivation of
the egg plant is much like the cultivation
of any ordinary plant, move the soil fre-
quently, and keep clear of grass and
weeds.
Under ordinary circumstances and con-
ditions by May 15th the fruit is ready for
shipment and continues till up to July,
when the Jersy crop comes in.
From six hundred to one thousand
crates of egg plants are produced per
acre with us. _
\Vhat we need most is a uniform pack-
age for celery. As it stands now, we have
three diﬁerent sizes, one 12x18x22, and
the Sandford 8x20x27 and one on20x2 5,
this last. we think, should be the state
standard.
California uses standard barrel crates,
and of course it is regulated through the
association of that state, and they have
secured a rate which is equal to ours, we
having the small poney crate.
I therefore, recommend that this as-
sociation take some action looking to
the procuring of a standard crat:, and
that a better and more equal freight rate
be obtained. -
Vegetable Report from East Coast.

By Mr. Blackman.
Mr. President, as amemberofthecom-
mittee on vegetables, I will submit an in-
formal verbal report from my section of
the state, the lower East Coast. Taking
it all in all, we have had a most success-
ful season in our section of the state, the
truck growers in better condition gen-
erally, and have gotten more for their
truck than ever before in the history of
the lower East Coast section. Mr.
President, I desire to emphasize this
great and important subject, the import-
ance of the vegetable trafﬁc in this state
It is, or it ought to be, a matter of com-
mon knowledge that the truck industry
of Florida is the greatest industry in the
state. It is, or ought to be, a matter of
common knowledge that the truck in-
dustry of Florida amounts to a great deal
more than all of the citrus fruit crops
combined. Vegetables are the staple
products of Florida, and an industry that
should receive at all times the highest
consideration and attention. I could, Mr.
President, give' you instances of enor-
mous yields and fancy prices for this sea-

son’s vegetable and truck crop from our
section of the state. This trafﬁc is taken
from our section of the state by the train-
load, to say nothing of_ the other sec-
tions. The tomato crop this season has
been the best in the history of that sec-
tion and tomato growers as a rule have
made lots and cords of money. There
has also been good money made in Irish '
potatoes. I recall one notable instance
where a trucker made nearly $2,000 from
his Irish potato patch. Altogether, the
lower East Coast country has enjoyed
an unprecedented season in the vegeta-
ble business. Of course, the early cold
snap set'some of the truckers back but
replanting soon recuperated them and
they got their crops to market ahead of
everything else, and sold at good prices.
I would particularly call the attention
of the society and the truck growers of
the state to the Bermuda onion. It was
at one time thought that this onion could
not be grown successfully in Florida.
This is a great fallacy, as has been de-
monstrated by later experimentswith this
crop, especially with last season’s crop.
It was also contended that it would com-
pete with the Bermuda crop and this has
also been dispelled. The onion thrives
well on the lower East Coast. It gets to
market before the Bermuda crop of the
Bermuda Island and is a big money
maker.
Report of Committee on Ornamentals.
By Mrs. C. T. McCarty.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In our school days, long ago—so long
ago that I dread counting the years
which have since passed—we learned
that one proof of man’s superiority over
all other animals lies in his ability to rise
above the limitations of locality. To
the far ends of the earth, north, south,
east and west, he reaches out, and brings
unto himself, what is called for, either by
his fancy or by his complex needs. Look-
ing about with a critical eye he grasps
the suggested possibilities of nature and
turns the knowledge to his own account;
he sees on one hand a scarcity which he
makes abundance; on the other a su—
perﬂuity which he modiﬁes. He, of
course, puts forth the greater effort for
material return, but at the same time la-
bors, faithfully and continuously to.ex-
press, in an alliance with Nature, the artist
love, in-born in human hearts; that desire
to create “a fairer creation than we know,”
to omit the pros; the details of nature
and produce the spirit and splendor.
It has been truly said that “he who
knows the most, he who knows what
sweets and virtues are in the ground, the
waters, the plants, * * and how to come
at these enchantments—is the rich and
royal man. Only so far as the masters
of the world have called in Nature to

their aid, can they reach the height of
magniﬁcence. This is the meaning of
their hanging gardens, villas, garden—
houses, islands, parks.”
Before us in this fair southland, lie
stretched out upon all sides, materials for
attaining easily to a degree of that mag-
niﬁcence, for which these masters have
struggled. It is my privilege to speak to
you concerning certain of these materi-
als, and to lay before you such facts as
a non—professional can glean from the
ups and downs of several years’ experi-
ence with ornamentals. What I have to
offer may not be new to you, neither may
it seem of value, but if such be the case
I can only comfort myself with the say-
ing of Daniel Webster, that “What is
valuable is not new, and what is new is
not valuable.” The territory concern-
ing which I speak lies on the west side of
Indian River from Wabasso on- the
north, to Palm Beach on the south. Oth-
er localities will be covered by other pa-
pers. and moreover I wish to be quite
certain of my statements, that my words
may carry conviction, as did those of the
old German who invariably clinched
every argument with the emphatic re-
mark: “I knows vot I knows, und dats
vot_I knows.”
I shall also call things by their good.
common, every-day names, not. of
course, that I may be the more readily
understood, but that I may save myself
some embarrassment? The foundation
for all successful ornamentation is, of
course, grass, and it is a very difﬁcult
foundation to lay. For the grass goes,
“creeping, creeping, everywhere,” ex-
cept in Florida. Here it must be coaxed,
pushed. and carefully nurtured. and then
perhaps it may not creep far. I can with
the clearest conscience. recommend St.
Augustine grass. It grows readily in
shade as well as sun, is a brilliant green
all the year, and makes a velvety sod
when close—cropped. Can be cut with
a lawn-mower. St. Lucie grass is a ﬁner
bladed grass, but is much shorter lived.
Of Bermuda grass I will not speak, be-
cause I am peaceably inclined, and know
full well the war-like possibilities of the
Bermuda grass question. No doubt
there are some among you who fully
catch my meaning when I say that there
is always doubt, when you plant Ber-
muda grass, as to whether you have the
grass or the grass has you.
Passing on to the fencing-in of the
grass covered lawn, nothing is prettier
than a well-kept hedge. If you want a
low. thick, square-trimmed hedge, you
will ﬁnd satisfaction in the Amoor River
Privet. It stands, untouched, a tem-
perature of 24 degrees above zero, is
evergreen and grows rapidly. It can
be planted in single or double rows,
plants being from 12 to 18 inches apart.
The time for planting is between Ne-
vember Ist and February 1st. The
hedge must be worked in spring and fall,
and orange tree manure used for fer—
tilizing. Some good results have been
obtained with Arborvitae, but it is of
slow growth. and while, according to
Longfellow. “patience is powerful," it
is not equal to an arborvitae hedge in
Florida.
A row of Philanthus, bright-hued and
graceful. is good to look upon, but it is
with you today and gone tomorrow, if

cause of its cheerful contentment under

background of dark green leaves, all the

‘ For windbreak, or tall hedge pur-
poses, the camphor tree is a friend in-
deed, while, grown apart, and trimmed
to tree shape, it is a joy forever, because
it is a thing of great beauty. The ocean
winds can not blast it, nor the cold, such
as we have, shrivel it. It grows in poor
soil, not even disdaining our white sand,
which some say is no soil at all. It is
neither a great eater nor a great drinker,
and is graceful, glossy, and evergreen
and moreover can more than pay its
way by furnishing the camphor of com-
merce.
Mango and avocado pear trees can be
made to please the eye as well as tempt
the palate. Both can be raised from seed,
provided you plant the proper end of
the seed down, the pear preferring to
stand where planted, the mango yielding
more gracefully to change of location.
Both can get along without fertilizer,
but they do eat when they are able to
dine with friends, the mango preferring
to eat with the pineapples, the pear lik-
ing better the fare of the orange trees.
Neither tree can stand our cold weather,
so when your thermometerhas registered
24 degrees and the “eager and nipping
air" has been “biting shrewdly" take
your little saw and go out and saw off
your mangoes and “alligator” pear trees
—short-—-if you ever want to see them
again.
' Judging from the frequentrecurrence
of the name Royal Poinciana in Florida
geography and literature generally, the
outsider might reasonably expect to ﬁnd
this famous tree as plentiful as golden
rod. But the fact is, that while many
are planted. but few are seen, in the
gorgeous perfection possible to the tree.
The Royal Poinciana is hedged about
with enemies. The cold is fatal to it. In
1895 I saw a tree having a trunk twelve
inches in diameter and a spread of six-
ty feet, go down in a temperature of 28
degrees; and while a temperature of 28
degrees is rare, the winds we have al—
ways with us, and a strong wind makes
a Royal Poinciana tree look like “Polly”
after her celebrated tussle with the
monkey. The Dwarf Poinciana is less
of atrial than its Royal kinsman, yet
carries much of the family beauty. It
reaches the height of twelve feet, and,
planted in a hedge or in a circle, with the
red and yellow alternating, produces a
truly gorgeous effect. An every-day
acquaintance which can be used with tell-
ing results is the Kumquat. It is hardy
and grows rapidly, and in two years’
time its glossy foliage will be dotted here
and there with those miniature oranges
which never fail to elicit admiration and
arouse curiosity.
Palms, of course, are the distinctive
and characteristic glory of this section,
and the natural impulse is, to plant them
in profusion regardless of everything
but the dictates of fancy. This is es-
pecially the case among those who are
fresh from the land where a palm is a
possibility only to the millionaire or the
ﬂorist. My advice to palm enthusiasts
who are just starting on their mad ca-
reer is this: “Stick to palmettoes, date
palms and sago palms.” If, in this latitude
you rely upon cocoanuts, royal palms,
and other fancy varieties, for yard ef-
fects, some real cold, wintry day will
leave you with nothing of beauty where—
on to rest your eye, after it tires of con-
templating the frozen emptiness of your
pocketbook.
In order to enhance the tropical charm
of your home be sure to leave a corner
for the giant bamboo; a corner where

seen, in true Japanese relief, against a
clear green-blue, western, evening sky.
Toward this comer your glance will of-
ten stray. The bamboo can be rooted
from cuttings, buried about two inches
beneath the surface of the ground, in
the month of January. But, as you
value your bamboo corner, don’t let it
have one dry 'moment for two years.
Like the children, I have kept for the
last the best of all the game, and .in
closing will say a few words concern-
ing my favorite ornamental—the rose.
Queen of the garden, she is yet with-
in reach of all, for any one who has a
pump can have at least half a dozen
vigorous, ﬂowering rose bushes. That
is, provided the pump is united with
muscle, patience and a high resolve to
rise above- the pleasantries of an unbe-
lieving family. I have had roses on
my breakfast table for ﬁfteen years, dur-
ing the greater part of which time they
were the result of the aforesaid combina-
tion of pump and patience.
'A rose bed 9x14 feet will hold ten
bushes and do well. In preparing the
bed, ﬁrst dig out the earth to a depth
of from 2 1-2 to 3 feet. Over the bot-
tom of this excavation lay a floor of
old boards; ﬁll in above this, for two-
thirds of the depth, a mixture of old
chips and leaf mold; then ﬁnish with
about one foot of well rotted stable ma-
nure and sand mixed. Soak down thor-
oughly.
The best time for planting is Decem—
ber. I have never lost a plant set out
in this month.
Never let the rose bed get dry and
hard, yet do not keep too wet. Re-
member that one soaking-is better than
a dozen sprinkles, and, when bushes are
well established, one weekly soaking is
better than seven soakings.
I always set out two-year-old budded
roses. Some of my friends prefer roses
grown on their own roots. We do not
argue the question—I just keep on pick-
ing roses!
Once a month I give my 9x14 foot
bed eight quarts of hard wood ashes.
Once every month I also give two
tablespoonfuls of Painter’s Special Rose
fertilizer, to each bush, working it care-
fiully into the soil and wetting down
well. Once a year, in the fall, I cover
the bed with a 3-inch mulching of to-
bacco stems, bought by the bale. In
picking the ﬂowers cut every rose stem
so as to leave one leaf next the parent
stem from which the ﬂower stalk has
sprung. Leave one leaf, not more and
not less. Then the new growth comes
quickly, and new growth, with roses,
means ﬂowers. There are no pests, in
particular, to be feared, but there is no
harm in an annual spraying with either
water and whale oil soap, or water and
pearline. using one package of pearline to
ten gallons of water. Generally speak-
ing, tea-roses give the best satisfaction;
that is, they bloom most continuously,
in this climate, though certain others,
such as Chromatella and Clothilde
Soupert can always be depended upon.
The following list comprises the names
of those roses which I hold as “tried and
true :”
Chromatella, a climber which can be
cut back.
Clothilde Soupert.
Marie Van Houtte.
Bon Silene.
Catherine Mermet.
Souvenir of Malmaison
Helen Gould.
Duchess of Brabant.

Cut your roses early every morning
and you will begin each day well; neith-
er can summer’s heat nor winter’s frost
deprive you of that sweet solace.
"God might have made the earth bring forth
Enough for great and small,
The oak tree and the cedar tree,
Without a ﬂower at all.
We might have had enough, enough,
For every want of ours,
For luxury, medicine and toil,
And yet have had no ﬂowers.
Then wherefore, wherefore, were they made,
All dyed with rainbow light,
All fashioned with supremest grace,
Upspringing day and night.
Springing in valleys green and low,
And on the mountain high,
And in the silent wilderness
Where no man passes by.
Our outward life requires them not—
Then wherefore had they birth?
To minister delight to man,
To beautify the earth,
To comfort man—to whisper hope,
Whene'er his faith is dim,
For whoso careth for the flowers,
\Vill care as much for him."
Report of Mrs. P. H. Rolfs.
M 1‘. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In selecting a subject, for the paper in
hand I have not been as partial to the
East Coast of Florida as were the gentle-
men who made up the program for this
meeting when they selected the entire
committee on ornamentals from among
the East Coast members, but will brieﬂy
mention a few plants that can be success~
fully grown in any part of the state.
Angelou“. Gudneﬂ, Book.
This plant is generally, but incorrectly,
known_in the trade catalogues as An-
gelonia grandiﬂora. Although there is a
species, Angelonia grandiﬂora, this is
quite rare. 'I‘he plant has been in cultiva-
tion for many years in the green-houses
of the North, and has, to a limited extent,
been introduced to the South, especially in
Florida. Its original home is in South
America. In the green-houses of the
North it is planted out in pots and then
placed on benches~ where it blooms con-
tinuously and profusely.
I wish, however, to speak of this plant
more especially as a border plant, and bed-
ding plant for outdoor work in our state.
It is one of the hardy and very promising
recent acquisitions that will come into
general favor very rapidly. It is unusual-
ly free from disease and stands all diﬁi-
culties which ordinarily surround decora-
tive plants remarkably well. The color of
the ﬂower is dark purple with white spots
in the throat. This makes it a very hand-
some, attractive bedder. It blooms pro-
fusely, and rarely attains a size higher
than a foot or eighteen inches. It is bet-
ter, h0wever,'to keep it cut back so as to
have it from eight inches to a foot high.
Side shoots are constantly being pro-
duced, from which new ﬂower spikes are
thrown in.

Propaglﬂon.
Where plants can be secured from some
other bed or by purchase, it is better to get
them in this way. If this is not practica-
ble, seed may be obtained from reliable
seedsmen at about twenty-ﬁve cents a
package. The difﬁculty in securing plants
in this way is that which usually befalls
seedlings, especially when planted in a
small way. If one has merely a package
of seed, these are often placed in flower
pots, carefully attended and watered for
a few days, and possibly before one knows
they are over watered. and the soil be-
comes water-logged. Then again, in the
busy rush of the ordinary day, with fruit
growers, there will be sonYe days when the
seed are forgotten. By the time one re-
turns, the seed bed will be found as dry
as sawdust. Even if the seed should not
really be overlooked or forgotten, when
the seedlings come up there is always the
constant danger of damping off. All of
these difﬁculties are avoided by securing
large plants, which can be set directly into
the bed.
By taking cuttings from a hardened
wood, they may be struck and grown
from cuttings. A much more preferable
way, however, is to divide the old plants.
In this way little difficulty is experienced
in securing a good start.
Planting In Bedl- '
In preparing a bed it should be
thoroughly worked over and a generous
supply of compost spaded in. There is
really no danger of getting too much of
it, or too much vegetable matter into the
bed. After this has been thoroughly in-
corporated into the soil. it is well to wet it
down, so that every particle of it is
thoroughly soaked. The ground may
then be ﬁrmed down by treading over the
bed, and left for some time, possibly ten
days to two weeks. This will give the
fertilizer in the compost an opportunity to
become thoroughly incorporated with the
soil, and avoid the danger of scalding the
roots. The top of the bed at the end of
this time can be worked over with a
garden rake or small tool, and the plants
set into place. If abundance of plants are
on hand they may be set in rows six to ten
inches apart. If one has but few plants,
they may be set a foot, or even two feet,
apart. Then as the bushes grow large
they may be divided and the spaces be-
tween ﬁlled in,
During extremely dry weather it is de~
sirable to give them an application of
water once a week. or at intervals as the
bed becomes somewhat dry.
Protection of the Bed.
This plant is of unusual interest to us
because it will stand slight cold weather.
It has been known to pass, practically un-
injured, through thirty degrees Fahren-
heit. \Vhere there is danger of the cold
becoming more severe than this it is
necessary to provide some protection.
This would be especially so in northern,
middle, and western Florida. The pro-
tection can be given by banking the soil
about the plants to a considerable height,
so that a large number of the lower buds
are underground. Then during severe
cold weather, a covering of straw mat or
with straw will tide them over the severe
weather. In central and south Florida the
plants will need protection, only rarely if
at all.
This plant begins blooming very early,
even when only a few inches high, and
from that time on it continues without in-
termission until the beds are exhausted
which may be a year, or even longer. For

this reason a bed of Angelonia Gardneri
is always a beautiful sight.
Hibiscus (Hibiscus Rona Sinenlh Linn).
There are a number of varieties belong-
ing to this species, the single flowered,
double ﬂowered, pink, magenta, salmon-
colored, and even nearly white. In some
cases the foliage is variously mottled, in
others the corolla is of varied shapes. To
the average fruit growers in Florida only
a few of these varieties are known. They
are all, however, equally decorative and
equally easily grown. Cuttings of ma-
ture wood strike very readily so that they
may be propagated in endless numbers.
I wish particularly to call attention to
one fact that is very generally overlooked
by people who live north of South Florida,
and that is that it is quite as easy to have
these beautiful blooming plants in the
dooryard during the summer months as
many of the other forms, such as
geraniums, fuchsias, etc. The difﬁculty
has been that they have not been consider-
ed pot plants, consequently after growing
during the summer, they have been allow-
ed to freeze in fall. On the other hand,
those who have considered them pot plants
have not been aware of the fact that they
may be set out of doors during the summer
time, and then taken back to cover for
protection during the winter. This is a
point I wish to bring out especially. The
Hibiscus plants should be grown in large
pots, say about eight or ten inch ones.
These pots are then set out in summer,
“plunged,” as the gardeners say, and the
pots covered with garden soil so as to pro-
tect them from being broken. and to hide
their unsightliness. The Hibiscus will
then grow and bloom profusely during
the summer. It will do no particular
harm for the roots to run through the bot-
75
tom or over the sides of the pots. In the
fall when there is danger of frost or freez-
ing weather, the pots with the plants in
them should be lifted and the plants cut
back to within a foot or two, and then
placed in a moderately dry house. Here
the plants need but little protection. They
should be watered sparingly, but not per-
mitted to dry out. Then as soon as the
danger of freezing is past, the pots can
be plunged again in the bed, and the plants
will go merrily on blooming as before.
When the next winter comes the same
operation may be repeated. ~
The Hibiscus which is usually called
the Chinese Hibiscus, that is Hibiscus
Schizopetelousjs grown to a very large
extent in pots throughout northern and
central Florida. It requires a great deal
of petting and many times as much care
as the common Hibiscus, and does not
give one-tenth of the return in bloom and
pleasure,
I would not be loyal to my home place,
Palmhurst, did I not include palms in this
paper.
Palms.
Biologically speaking, the palm trees
are among the highest of the plant crea-
tions. They are, likewise, the most beau-
tiful and aesthetic of plants. A ﬁne palm
adds more value to the selling price of a
place than any other single tree, not ex-
cepting the fruit-bearing ones. Of course
we should not expect a grove of palm trees
to sell for the same price as a grove of
grape fruit trees. A reasonable number
of palm trees, however. distributed at the
proper locations about the home place,
adds immensely to the desirability of the
location. In fact, very few palms come to _
their grandest stature before twenty-ﬁve
to ﬁfty years of age. They, however.

show off remarkably well at four or ﬁve
years old, and at ten or ﬁfteen years of
age they will cause many a passer-by to
wish that he “owned that tree.”
The difﬁculty heretofore experienced
in planting palm trees has been that we
have not known just what to select, nor
how to set them out after they have been
selected. We are apt to treat a palm tree
very much as we would a jardiniere of
ferns, that is, sticking it in some house
corner where it can get only a peep of sun-
light now and then. The palms about
which I wish to speak later are such as
can stand the full glare of the sun without
injury; they can be left out in the most
tempestuous winds that we have; they can
stand months of neglect, and come out
smiling from this course of treatment.
Like every other cultivated specimen,
they, however, take very good naturedly
to kind treatment. They differ from most
trees in that the position of their leaves
permits the free circulation of air, and
the broad leaved, fan palms afford a good
and cool shade.
With all theSe good qualities they have
the still further excellent ones of being
remarkably free from fungus and insect
attacks. In addition to this, they do not
harbor that most annoying pest with
which we have to deal at times, the Flori-
da mosquito. ‘
In setting out these trees due regard
should be had for the landscape effect.
One of these trees when once set out is
almost never transplanted. Not that they
are so exceedingly difﬁcult to transplant.
but their beauty being once realized, they
are so valued that no one has the courage
to hazard the chance of losing a ﬁne speci-
men. If the trees are planted with a view
of avenue setting, they should be placed
far enough back from the road to allow a
full development of the leaves without the
necessity of cutting back. For planting
about the door yard or open lawn due re-
gard should be had for the point of view,
so that when these have grown to be tall
trees the view may not be obstructed. The
contour of a piece of land should also be
had in mind, and the general character of
the trees and other ornamentals about the
door yard,
In discussing these trees I have conﬁned
myself to a very limited number, and
have taken those that will be perfectly
hardy in all parts of the State. A few
nice plants of hardy species, well selected,
will be found.more pleasing than a great
variety jumbled together in a sort of
horticultural museum. '
The three palms that I wish to consider
are able to withstand freezing tempera-
tures, and live out of doors on the Atlantic
coast as far north as Charleston, and on
the Gulf coast to New Orleans. Conse-
quently, every land owner in the state of
Florida should have one or more of each
of these palms in his possession.
In general it may be said that palms
need an abundance of sunshine, and an
abundance of fertile soil although they
will thrive remarkably well on sandy soils
that have been moderately fertilized.
Cabbage Palmetto (Saba! Palmetto.)
—I mention this one ﬁrst because it is a
native. And here I may be permitted to
digress a moment and preach a curtain
lecture on the fact that we do not ap-
preciate our native decorative plants sufﬁ-
ciently. We have in our ﬂora many speci-
mens which make the handsomest of
decorative specimens, but simply over-
look them and cast about us for something
that has been imported from distant and
little known lands. I see that illustrated
constantly at my own home, where many

native decorative plants grow in pro-
fusion, and our visitors pass these by
without any particular attention or com-
mendatory remark. We are growing
here, also, quite abundantly, a plant
known as Australian pine, although it is
not a pine at all. It, however, in a way
resembles that group of trees. It is a
straight, ugly, sprawling tree that scarce-
ly throws a shadow, and litters the
ground with needles, and when it is done
littering the ground with needles, it scat-
ters the cones or burrs all over the
ground. This tree, because of its want of
decorative qualities, intrudes upon our
vision constantly, and because it happens
to be from Australia, it elicits many com-
mendatory remarks.
The Cabbage Palmetto has been used to
some extent, but not at all sufﬁciently, as
a decorative plant for avenues and for the
home grounds. Sometimes transplanting
has not proved successful, in other cases
the transplanting has been uniformly so.
It is one of the handsomest trees that can
be used for avenue planting. It will stand
an unusual amount of abuse after it has
once been established, and has been put to
all sorts of purposes, such as a hitching
post for horses, stringing telephone and
telegraph wires, and various other
barbarisms that might be perpetrated
upon it. Properly cared for it casts a
very delightful shade and is always green.
Trees of this species can be obtained
everywhere in the state of Florida. The
most certain way of transplanting them is
to prepare for transplanting six months or
_ a year in advance. The tree being chosen
that is to be transplanted, the laborer is in-
structed to cut away all the roots on one
side of it, so as to sever about one-half
of them, permitting those on the other
side to remain unharmed. In the course
of six months numerous new roots will be
formed on the side where the old ones
have been cut. Those on the other side
may then be cut, and the tree transplant-
ed. At the time of transplanting it is well
to remove all of the foliage, leaving only
the bud leaves.
The best size for setting out is one with
a trunk only a few feet tall. A_great many
cities and individuals make the mistake'of
transplanting trees that have a trunk of
twelve or fourteen feet. When this is
done the tree has become pretty well set in
its habits, and it fails to produce as ﬁne a
top as a small tree would. When a small
one is planted it adapts itself to the sur-
roundings much more quickly, and large
leaves and longer petioles are produced.
In preparing the place for one of these
trees it is well to use as much well rotted
compost as your conscience will permit,
and then have some one else come and
add as much more,
George Washington Palm (Neon/ash-
ingtom'a ﬁlifera.) —This palm is known
by various common names other than the.
one given above. Among them are Cali-
fornia Thread Palm, Weeping Palm, etc.
Even scientiﬁcally it is not always call-
ed by the same name. In nurserymen’s
catalogues it is usually listed as Prichardia
ﬁlifera. Bailey’s Cyclopedia calls it
Washingtonia ﬁlifera. It is a native of
California, where it is one of the most
striking and characteristic of trees. In
Florida it grows remarkably well for an
introduced species. It is especially desir-
able from the fact that it will stand severe
cold. Fine specimens of this species may
be seen in Charleston, S. C., and in New
Orleans, La. It, therefore, goes without
questioning that it will survive any degree
of cold which may be experienced in our
state.

The photograph which I present here-
with is taken from young specimens that
are about six years old. These have been
grown under fairly favorable condi—
tions, but specimens fully as beautiful are
produced in many other places. at the
same age. From this it will be seen that
this makes a very handsome ornamental
very early in its history. When grown to
full size its trunk reaches up to ﬁfty or
more feet.
These plants can be obtained from
nurserymen at so reasonable a cost that no
one need be without several specimens.
Small seedlings can be had at ten cents
each, while large plants, showing charac-
ter of leaves, cost only thirty-ﬁve cents
each. It is, therefore, most desirable to
secure the largest sized specimens and
plant these out directly where they are to
grow, so that they may become established
and grow up with that portion of the door
yard.
They should be planted in a rich, moist
place, where the leaves can have a spread
of at least twenty-ﬁve feet. In planting
palms most of us are apt to be a little nig-
gardly about the space. This is probably
due to the fact that we have been brought
up to regard palms as conservatory plants,
where we see these specimens in a pot-
bound and dwarfed condition.
Before setting out, the place where the
plant is to stand should be dug out and a
liberal quantity of compost or rich soil
placed in the holes unless, indeed, the soil
is already very fertile, as occurs in a few
of the hammocks and along our water
courses.
When the plant has become thoroughly
established, it should be regularly and lib-
erally fertilized with a brand of good
nursery tree fertilizer. As the foliage of
these plants is the desirable portion, the
fertilizer formula should be high in am-
monia. Liberal applications of compost
continue to be advantageous after the
plant has become thoroughly, established,
and even after it has grown into a large
tree.
Cull-y Date Palm.
This palm is technically known as
Phoenix Canariensfs. I take the follow-
ing quotation from Bailey’s Cyclopedia of
Horticulture: "P. C anan'ensis is the
noblest of all Phoenixes, and one of the
most majestic palms in cultivation. Its
rate of growth is astonishing; a tree sup-
posed to be only ten years old had a trunk
four feet high, three feet in diameter at
the base, with about one hundred leaves,
forming a head twenty-ﬁve feet across.
Another specimen of about the same size
bore eight bunches of fruit, each weighing
about ﬁfty pounds.” This is one of the
very best of the palm family for planting
in the open lawn. When two or three feet
high it begins to make a very pleasing
and pleasant object, and never lessens in
attractiveness. If the plant be well cared
for and grown to its proper proportion it
will increase in beauty from year to year,
and we need have very little or no fear of
losing it from the incursion of occasional
frost or cold weather.
This plant adapts itself remarkably well
to the various locations in the state. Fine
specimens of this species are growing on
Cape Florida, open to the direct wind
from the ocean, and only a few feet above
the tide. In spite of the fact that the sea
breezes constantly sweep across these
plants they are always looking most heal-
thy and beautiful. It has been reported
that during the recent hurricane the sea
water was driven entirely around the
roots of these trees, and yet they show no

signs of injury from the inundation. 1
learn also, from trustworthy sources, that
President Taber has some ﬁne specimens
growing on his lawn. As Mr. Taber
knows a good thing when he sees it and
,always secures his share of the good
things as they come along, we should take
a hint from his example. Specimens of
this species are growing also on high,
sandy land, which is ordinarily consider-
ed to be very low in the elements necessary
to plant food. In the pineapple belt of
Florida we ﬁnd these plants very frequent-
ly used. It is probable, therefore, that
there is no portion of the state in which
they cannot be grown successfully and
beautifully.
Like all members of the palm family, it
is particularly partial to locations with
rich soil. When planted out it should be
put in such a place that it can have a
spread of at least thirty feet. Plants may
be secured from nurserymen for twenty-
ﬁve to ﬁfty cents, each. These, when well
treated, will soon be out of the way of the
ordinary dangers that are apt to be met
with on lawns or in front yards. The
roots should be given plenty of room to
spread, and if the soil is not already fer-
tile, an abundance of compost should be
put in the hole before the tree is set out.
After it has become thoroughly estab-
lished, regular applications of a brand of
good nursery fertilizer should be applied.
Report by George A. Purdy.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Having been requested to prepare a
paper on Ornamentals for Florida, I
have complied, though with some misgiv-
ing as to my adequacy for a subject so
wide in its scope and one which has al-
ready been so ably treated in previous
meetings.
My actual horticultural education in
this state having extended over but a
few years and in one location, I shall
not attempt to give any general account
of ornamentals, but will only describe my
success or failure with a few shrubs and
trees that I have experimented with on
a very poor, sandy soil at Ormond Pe-
ninsula.
To you who have had years of experi-
ence and success on fertile lands, these
notes will sound trite and commonplace,
but they may be suggestive to some
who are wrestling with the problem of
how to beautify their surroundings un-
der adverse conditions.
To begin with roses: To make these
grow with any vigor in such a location,
I dig holes about four feet in diameter
and two feet in depth. A ﬂoor of clayey,
marsh mud is put down, building up on
the sides with the same, giving the bush
what may be described as a large clayey
bowl to grow in. This is ﬁlled with a
mixture of surface soil, marsh mud and
well rotted barn or stable manure when
available, or with any good all around
fertilizer, the surrounding bowl keep-
ing within reach of the roots much of
what is apt to leach away on our light
lands. Planted in this way and with

abundant water through droughty sea-
sons, the bushes grow strongly with vig-
orous foliage and bloom.
Besides the usual insects, powerful
enemies are the roots of the Live and
Water Oaks. With some labor these
have been measurably kept out by an-
nually cutting a trench about the bowl,
but this is an onerous task and some
careless year I fear the roots will break
in and strangle the roses. Therefore,
plant roses many feet from any oak tree.
I wish to say a word here for one of the
most beautiful garden roses, one rarely
seen in our Florida gardens, Fortunes
Yellow. There has been some confusion
about its nomenclature. It is the fa-
mous rose of Pasadena, California, that
has long been the admiration of tourists,
popularly, but erroneously called, Gold
of Ophir, the true Gold of Ophir being
the Old French rose, Ophirie, a more
nearly perpetual bloomer but with com-
paratively insigniﬁcant ﬂowers.
Fortunes Yellow is perhaps better
known in California by its synonym,
Beauty of Glazenwood, but by the law
of priority the ﬁrst name is entitled to
precedence, this rose having been found
and sent home from China in 1845 by
Robert Fortune. It is of a pale yellow,
shading into delicate salmon pink and
quite unlike any other rose I am ac-
quainted with. Unfortunately it is al-
most deciduous in winter and it blossoms
once a year, just as the Cherokee is go-
ing off, but it makes such a unique and
lovely display of color—for it is a pro-
fuse bloomer—that it is worth taking
any reasonable amount of pains to pos-
sess.
Speaking of the Cherokee Rose, one
of its seedlings, originating in Europe
a few years since, is said to be a worthy
companion for it.
I only know of this novelty by hear-
say, but Rosa sinica Anemone is de-
scribed by the eminent rosarian, Edward
Mawley, as promising to be even more
beautiful than the Cherokee, being of a
bright rose pink, unlike any other climb--
er and, like its parent, 3. profuse bloom-
' er, of clean, strong foliage and a good
grower.
As to Conifers. We have had but lim-
ited experience with these. The Deodar
Cedar is said to grow well about jack-
sonville and would probably succeed at
Ormond on good soil, planted on the
usual sand, a tree lived for a few years,
tried to look well, but ﬁnally starved to
death.
Cupressus Knightiana, a Mexican
evergreen Cypress of vigorous growth
and elegant habit, with drooping, fern-
like, feathery branchlets and bluish-
green foliage, grew about twenty-ﬁve
feet high in ten years and looked well
for a long time, but when cut down to
make room for a building, showed signs
of starvation.
Cupressus excelsa, a Cypress native
of the mountains of Guatemala, grew
much the same way, but succumbed to
the winter of ’94.
Cupressus torulosa, a Himalayan Cy-
press, grew rapidly but was ﬁnally starv-
ed out.
Cupressus funebris, an elegant, droop-
ing Cypress from China, promised well,
but gave out in a few years, probable
cause, poor soil and perhaps cold snaps.
We need for landscape eﬁect in Flor-
ida, a tall fastigiate tree like a Lombardy
Poplar but evergreen, possibly Cuprese
sus sempervirens, the Cypress of the
Orient may serve our purpose. Those
who have visited Mediterranean regions.
or noticed pictures of Italian and oriental
scenery will remember the stately effect

of these trees either isolated or in
groves. A group of three, indifferently
planted in poor soil at Ormond, only
lived a few years, attaining a height of
ten feet, but Prof. Nehrling of Gotha,
Florida, informs me that he has several
beautiful young specimens, perfect col—
umns of dark green, the tallest of them
at least twenty-ﬁve feet high. They re-
quire good fertilization.
Evidently a number of the evergreen
cypress will grow well in Florida if plant-
in good ground or soil made good.
Retinosporas or Japan Cypress do not
ﬂourish, probably we are too far south.
Oriental Arborvitaes, of which hand-
some specimens may be seen in Jack-
sonville parks and elsewhere, have grown
well at Ormond on well prepared soil, es-
pecially the variety known as Aurea
Nana. Rosedale Arborvitae, said to be
a hybrid of Retinospora and Oriental
Arborvitae. Though planted in half
shade, does no better with us than the
Retinosporas. '
Some species of the genus Podocar-
pus may do well in Florida. They are
evergreen trees and shrubs, yewlike in
their appearance.
The late Edmund H. Hart, of Federal
Point, had a ﬁne specimen of the broad
leaved Podocarpus. With its dark green
foliage it was strikingly ornamental. He
reported it as very hardy against sun
and frost. Podocarpus Japonica and
Podocarpus Koraensis were planted N04
vember, 1903, at Ormond, in well pre-
pared soil and partial shade. They have
grown slowly but thriftily and look
healthy and happy.
Of evergreen shrubs, I have had ex—
perience with but few and those .quite
well known.
Pittosporum Tobira—the dark green
and the variegated varieties grow well
Q
with us as thoroughout the lower south,
making the air heavy with fragrance the
latter part of March and early April.
A strong grower, the root area of a large
bush extending ﬁfty feet from the plant.
It is perhaps our best exotic shrub,
growing rampantly on a rather poor soil
with Oaks in close proximity.
Jasminum humile or revolutum from
Northern India, puts forth its yellow
fragrant blossoms early and often and
grows well in spite of rabbits which gnaw
the bark occasionally.
Rhaphiolepis ovata. This Chinese
shrub, with almost circular coriaceous
leaves and white blossoms—not fragrant
-—blooms in March and April. It grows
slowly but surely and promises well.
Viburnum odoratissimum, makes a
dense, compact bush, with leaves of a
light, vivid green and white, fragrant
ﬂowers in April. A specimen growing
here for many years was badly scorched
in freezes of 94-5 but does not appear
to have suffered since with plenty of clay
in the soil it is one of our best ornamen-
tals.
Illicium anisatum or Anise Seed Tree,
native of Japan, makes a tall, stately
shrub with fragrant leaves of sassafras
odor, the small saffron-colored blooms
are not conspicuous. This shrub threat-
ens to become naturalized, some speci-
ments more than holding their own in the
midst of oak scrub.
Illicium Floridanum is mentioned in
English publications as the ﬁnest and
most showy of the Illiciums said to be a
native of Florida, but I have never hap-
pened to meet any one who had seen
it. Prof. Nehrling had a ﬁne specimen
planted on the shore of Lake Audubon,
but it was destroyed a few years since
by overﬂow from the lake.

Popinac. As frequently seen this is a
lanky, straggling little tree or bush, but
if carefully pruned and stimulated with
fertilizer, it may be made a very hand-
some small tree, suitable to overhang a
footpath. Looking up from under the
branches its delicate pinnate foliage, out-
lined against the blue of the sky, has a
fairylike effect. This effect is enhanced
by its yellow ﬂowerballs, which are not
only very fragrant, but are put forth
several times a year. In hard freezes
the foliage will scorch, but it rapidly re-
covers. We should make the most of
this tree as it is absolutely the only one of
the Acacias that thrives here. The long
list which appeared in Reasoner’s ﬁrst
catalogue is now reduced to two or
three. The famous Acacia dealbata of
the South France, with masses of yellow
bloom, will grow but poorly in Florida.
At Federal Point, the late Mr. E. H.
Hart had a specimen twenty-ﬁve feet
high, but it never blossomed and nev-
er seemed satisﬁed with its environment.
It was ﬁnally lost. Acacias it is said will
not grow in a calcareous soil. Lime
seems to poison them.
This paper has about reached the time
limit and yet I have only brieﬂy touched
on a very few of the ornamentals for
Florida. I have said nothing about the
herbaceous perennials, annuals or bulbs,
having had but little experience with
them. The subject of Palms and other
tropical and sub-tropical plant-life is a
large one. Something has been learned
as to the most suitable species or varie-
ties since the time years ago when those
earnest workers and pioneers in Florida
ornamental horticulture, E. H. Hart and
P. W. Reasoner, now passed on, and T.
L. Mead, still with us. gave those admira-
ble essays on Palms. Yuccas. Agaves and
Bamboos.
The interesting “message of the
woods," brought by President Taber,
emphasizes the potentiality for beauty
of our native ﬂora. Prof. Nehrling on
his estate at Gotha has demonstrated the
value of indigenous shrubs and much
mav yet be developed in this direction.
Home Grown Products for the Table.
By Mrs. H. H. Harvey.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
To one our state is a playground, to
another a workshop, and again it is a
haven of rest and recreation, where the
soft winds, unlike any other on earth,
soothe the tired nerves and give one
that feeling of—
“Nothing to do in this world of ours
Where weeds spring up with fairest flowers."
that we all get after the proverbial ten
years that entitles us to the name Crack-
er; but to the homemaker who must pre-
pare food three times a day for appetites
whetted by the health-giving ozone of
our fair state—Florida is a reality.
The tin can is sometimes a Godsend.
Let’s not condemn it entirely, but let us
see how much of a variety we can grow
here, that with some careful preparation

can be made food ﬁt for an American to
eat. Milk, butter and eggs with all
their accessories are to be had here in
abundance and the best the world af-
fords. The sweet potato is at home with
us; aside from the ordinary methods of
preparation, we have the sweet potato
pone and the sweet potato custard pie,
so nearly like the far-famed pumpkin
pie, we scarce need raise that vegetable.
Cassava has many possibilities. Wash,
peel, grate, wash in much water,
use the coarse part for pudding, prepare
the cassava the same way for griddle
cakes, using only a small amount of ﬂour,
and it is a change to use one-half a cup of
same in custard pie, using only two eggs
instead of three.
Then the starch that settles in pan,
when it is washed, can be dried and used
for starch and for ﬂour; for light bread,
one-third cassava flour and two-thirds
wheat ﬂour make a nice bread.
Arrow root I am told can be used the
same as cassava.
Both rye and oats raised in Florida are
parched and ground and used in the
place of coffee to the entire satisfaction
of many.
The Yukon plant is raised and the
leaves used for tea.
The Jamaica sorrel grows to perfec-
tion here. The calyx of the pods, when
made into jelly, gives one of the ﬁnest
products in this line.
The kumquat, after being soaked over
night in soda water, makes a delicious
preserve jelly and marmalade, and cry-
stallized it is much sought.
The orange, the still unsolved problem
in our state, is never so ﬁne in any way as
eaten fresh from the tree. Yet, there are
a few months in the year when we can
not have it fresh, hence we extract juice,
bring to a boil and can. Oranges are
nice preserved and jellied, and a marma-
lade made of the juice and pulp is nice
to eat with meats. A confection manufac-
tured from the peel of either orange or
grapefruit is relished by all. We must
not omit the orange short cake and the
orange pudding so nice in the orange
season. Slicedorangeswith pulpof grape-
fruit and sugar an hour before serving,
gives a toothsome sauce; then adding to
this sauce sliced bananas and pineapples
and grated cocoanut we have ambrosia
that truly is a dish for an honest Ameri-
can. A cup of grapefruit juice in a cus-
tard for cake-ﬁlling is ﬁne. The grape-
fruit can be used in all ways we use the
orange.
The loquats (if the freeze don’t take
them) are a great addition to the table,
dried, preserved, canned with or without
sugar they can- be used for sauce, pies,
short cake or jelly.
The peach is largely raised and all
know its possibilities.
The Kelsey plums, peeled, halved and
pitted can be canned so one can hardly
tell them from peaches.
And the sweet, wild plum is used in
many ways with us.
The ﬁg grows in luxuriance in certain
spots in our state and is much used for
canning and preserving and the ﬁnest
vinegar is made from the ﬁg. Also yeast
from the leaves.
Three months of the year we can have
the Kaki or Japan persimmon, smother-
ed in sugar and cream for breakfast.
Pineapples, we can preserve.makeinto
marmalade and with the aid of yellow
cattley guava juice make ﬁne jelly: the
peel washed and covered with slightly
sweetened water will. in a day or two,
be a refreshing drink that soothes but
does not inebriate. The guava is so com-

mon that we scarce need dwell upon its
uses—jelly, paste, marmalade, etc.
The Avocado pear for salads and again
cooked a little and made into marmalade
is highly prized by the cultivated taste.
The citron we only preserve.
Surinam cherries we can and jelly.
The LeConte pear is canned, pre-
served‘and dried here to quite an ex-
tent.
The grape grows in most healthy
luxuriance, and could we but extermi-
nate the mocking bird, bluejay and
woodpecker we could grow the ﬁnest
varieties such as Delaware, Concord,
Brighton, etc., but the thick skinned
scuppernong in several varieties gives
us a chance for preserves and jellies and
the juice of the grape brought to a
boiling and sealed will keep indeﬁnitely
as a refreshing drink.
Honey is largely produced in the
state.
Sugar and syrup from cane are manu-
factured extensively.
Bananas are raised to a limited extent
(it is jack frost who limits the extent)
but we have enough for a delicious ba-
nana pudding once in a while.
The raising of strawberries is quite an
industry in our section and who does not
enjoy a strawberry short cake?
Our subject as you see, is too far-
reaching—vegetables we have left for
some one else to write about.
We are indebted to Mrs. Chas. Lewis,
of St. Petersburg, for suggestions re-
garding fruits raised in that delightful
part of the state.
W'ith many misgivings have we pre-
pared these few notes. You know much
that I have omitted, but if you kindly
say ‘She hath done what she could,” we
will feel repaid.
DISCUSSION.
(The discussion of Ornamentals was
postponed to give way to the musicale
tendered the society by the Ladies’ Fri-
day Musicale and was taken up Thursday
morning—Secretary.)
Mr. Blackman—I was particularly
pleased with the postponement at our
last evening’s session, of the further re-
port and discussion of the report of the
committee on ornamentals. The society
is to be congratulated upon the able
papers prepared with so much care and
presented at this session on ornamentals.
“7 e have heard here a great deal on the
strenuous side of the many questions
and topics engaging our attention. It
is just and ﬁtting now that we should
turn for a moment to the amenities of
life, and to the ornamentation of our
homes. I have been around over the
state a great deal, and I am impelled
to say and it is with much regret, that
there is not enough attention paid to
ornamentals. This committe deserves
the thanks of this society for their en-
deavor and work. It is a great work, a
_lovely, beautiful theme and a woman’s
sphere. I am very much interested per-
sonally, I may be pardoned for saying,
for there is no greater pleasure at my
own home than the morning’s stroll
through my ornamental garden, where,
in company with my wife and daughter,
we gather morning after morning the
lovely ﬂowers, the mignonette for the

lapel of my coat, as I go to the busy
cares of the day at my ofﬁce, garlands
for the vases of the festal hall and per-
_ haps to the- sick chamber of the invalid,
carrying with them a fragrance and sen-
timent that can not be expressed in
words. It would be impossible for me
to enumerate all of our lovely ﬂowers
or the ones most dear to us. We love
them all, as their sweet fragrance is
wafted from waving branch or clinging
vine. Personally, however, I do not con-
sider that the vine, at least in our sec-
tion, should be encouraged near the
dwelling, as I have found them to be an
harbor for the mosquito. For this rea-
son, I have set all of my vines at a dis-
tance, ornamenting some old stump or
tree for instance, on the lawn or away
from the dwelling. Again, Mr. Presi-
dent, permit me to say that the women
of this committee are to be congratula-
ted by the society for their unceasing,
untiring work and achievement in or-
namental lawn and garden work.
Dr. Richardson—Mr. President, I can
heartily second the sentiments of the
gentleman for the lower East Coast. I
do not think we pay half enough at-
tention to the ornamentation of the
home; the home is the haven of rest. In
there we seek and enjoy the sweet com-
panionship of wife, children and all of
our loved ones. No time or money
should be spared to make the home at-
tractive, and there is no surer way of
doing this than_ the ornamentation of
the garden and the lawn. The thanks
of the society is due the women of this
committee for their noble work.
Mr, Blackman—Mr. President, this is
a topic I am extremely interested in. I
do not arise again to make any extended
remarks, merely to say that we would
very much like to hear from some of the
ladies present as this subject is one pe-
culiarly their own.
The President—The chair heartily en-
dorses the sentiments expressed on the
subject of ornamentals, and begs to assure
the committee on ornamentals that their
noble work is most heartily appreciated
and endorsed, not only by this society
but by the state at largeas well.
Mrs. Geo. S. Gates—Mr. President, on
behalf of'the women I can assure- the so-
ciety of our appreciation of the enconium
on woman’s work as also at all times of
your co-operation. I must say, how-
ever, Mr. President, that I can not agree
with the gentleman from Miami, Mr.
Blackman, in regard to the ostracism of
the vine. A vine is too near and dear
to a woman’s heart as an ornamental, to
be permitted to receive such treatment
without a protest. (Applause and
laughter.)
I ampresident ofa little villageimprove_
ment society \IVelaka, Putnam county,
and we have been for several years
very much interested in the matter of
shade trees. Our stand-by has been
the Water Oak, but experience has
shown that the Water Oak is a com-
paratively short-lived tree. It is, in my
judgment, best to transplant the Live
Oak and Water Oak alternately, the Wa-
ter Oak, which is the quickest growth, will
give the quickest shade, later resigning
in favor of the long-lived Live Oak which
in 15 to 20 years will have become a
thick spreading tree with a great gnarled
future before it, under whose grateful
shade and luxuriant foliage, festooned
with great strands of waving Spanish
moss, our great grandchildren may play
upon the village green. The prere-
quisite of the lawn is grass and shade. It
is here again that I would urge the trans-
planting of the Water Oak and the Live

Oak alternately, as suggested for the
roadside and lane. Where there is a will
there is a way. We have found the fol-
lowing wild plants to give joy and grati-
ﬁcation with small care. The Pawpaw
a small bush, with greenish, poppy-like
flowers transplanted in December and
cared for and fed just a little will make a
very showy plant especially in masses.
The coral plant (local name) a spike of
coral blossoms with beautiful ivy leaf-like
foliage.
A tall bush with blossoms like a lily of
the valley sort of a huckleberry.
Wax myrtle beautiful for an evergreen.
Shrub or a mass of greenery to shut off
some unsightly object,
The beautiful Koontie a fem-like ever- I
green and many others with the treatment
of the paw paw will at the expense of
labor, make any abode a home.
To insure this atmosphere in our towns
and villages we must urge women to take
up this question of ornamentals. Men
have never, as a man studied beauty—
it is a woman’s training to beautify and
purify. You must have irrigation or you
can not have ﬂowers, and this is partic-
ularly true of the thirsty, sandy soils of
Florida, but it has truly been said that
“Where there is a will there is a way.”
Mrs. McCarty—Mr. President, I on-
ly desire to be permitted to offer a word
or two further upon this important work.
I most heartily endorse the sentiments
of the speakers who have preceded me.
This work is (as it has truly been said)
woman’s work. It is woman’s sphere,
and (while we appreciate the strenuous
side of the question, as much as we ap-
preciate the full larder and wherewithal
to buy things) yet it is but a matter of
right that we should have an occasional
half-day of the hired man’s time to help
us in the great work of beautifying our
homes. I wish also to endorse the pro-
test of Mrs. Gates against the banish-
ment of the vine. Mr. President, the
home is not complete without a vine. As
to the objection to the vine urged by the
gentleman from Miami, Mr. Blackman,
that they harbor mosquitoes, I would
say that I do not think the vine offers
more of an abidin; place for mosquitoes
than other shrubbery of the lawn or gar-
den. They certainly do not at our home,
for I have vines, and would not think
of giving them up, and as for mosquitoes,
we have them too, plenty of them, all
sorts, sizes and conditions. Why, Mr.
President, the mosquitoes we have are
so large and so numerous that they “sit
on a log and bark, and many of them
weigh a pound." (Prolonged laughter
and applause.)
Member—How many?
Mrs. McCarty—O, I don't know; never
counted them. They are there though,
and all over the state for that matter,
but do not think they are any more par~
tial to a vine for an abiding place than
other foliage. We could never think of
giving up the vine as an ornamental.
Mr. Blackmail—Mr. President, I only
desire a word—
Dr, Richardson—Mr. President, I rise
to a point of order. The gentleman is out
of order. It is the parliamentary right
of the committee to close the debate.
Mr, Blackman—Mr. President, I only
desired to capitulate and get as good
terms as possible. The committee has
entwined the vine around me, and I am
ready to surrender. (Laughter.)

Peaches and Plums.
BY J. P. M
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I make this attempt with a feeling of
inability to say anything new or worthy
of record, after all that has been said here-'
tofore in these meetings and printed in
the transactions of the society on the sub-
ject of Peaches, Pears and Plums.
My experience with pears and plums
is very limited indeed and what little I
may have to say will apply almost entirely
to peaches. In our section pears and
plums are very uncertain, making a crop
about once in three years. The Excelsior
plum occasionally will do fairly well. I
hope other members of the committee can
give you more light on these fruits than I
am able to do.
Beginning away back in 1886, the year
in which I set my ﬁrst three hundred peach
trees, I have been growing and shipping
peaches ever since these trees began fruit_
ing—some seasons quite proﬁtably, others
a failure on account of severe freeze kill1
ing trees back to stump. or a late cold
snap or heavy frost destroying the fruit.
Peach growers have their troubles as
well as orange growers. In our section
last season, severe drought through May
and June greatly reduced the crop. Fruit
small, cutting prices much below the usual
ﬁgures on this account. Root-knot, root-
gall, borers and San Jose scale we have
had to contend with regularly for the past
few years. This season’s crop is not
regular with us—many trees full, others
enough, some light, a few none, perhaps
due to January freeze.
The warm month of March with good
rains gave fruit a good send-off and at
this writing (April 10th) prospects are
excellent for ﬁne fruit. Young peach
trees set in January of this year have start-
ed oﬂ’ remarkably well. I am of the
opinion that wider planting than is us-
ually practiced is best. Most of my trees
are set about 21x23 feet. The orchard set
this winter I decided to try closer plant-
ing, setting them 18x22 feet, always
planting the wide way of the rows, east
and west. When possible to get them,
take standard sized trees, four to six feet,
cut back to about twelve inches. Cut off
all lateral roots to not over two inches.
Set, if any change, a little deeper than
grown in nursery in land well broken, if
possible, sixty to ninety days before set-
ting time. _Frequent cultivation, with
light applications of orange tree grade, or
No. 2 Simon Pure Fertilizer from three—
fourths to one pound at a time every six
to eight weeks, or say ﬁve times for the
season. Keep all but three to ﬁve sprouts
rubbed off and, if season is favorable, you
will have trees six to eight feet high and
spread in proportion by the last of Novem-
her and these will be capable of giving
you some fruit the following summer. I
usually cut these young trees back from

twelve to thirty inches the following win-
ter, deciding by character of growth and
shape of tree how much to cut back. The
second season I usually make two applica-
tions of fertilizer, in February and June.
Cultivate land until June or beginning of
rainy season, when middles may be allow-
ed to grow beggarweed. keeping a good-
sized circle hoed clean around trees.
For the past two years I have been
using pure kerosene oil for San Jose scale,
applying with small hand or mist pumps.
As I have only an occasional tree affected,
I ﬁnd this method effective.
ing or digging out borers, the men carry
one of these pumps along with other tools
'and where a scaley tree or limb is found,
use it. So far I have seen no bad effects
from use of pure oil.
Some trees affected with root-gall, I
carefully cleaned out, cutting away badly
affected parts, and sprayed with a very
strong solution of Whale Oil Soap, just
as heavy as it would work through the
pumps, then put about two quarts un'
leached hardwood ashes right about base
of trees, where earth had been removed.
This is an experiment. Present indica-
tions look favorable, but too soon to arrive
at a conclusion.
\Vhen prun- '
I am growing principally Bidwell’s
Early, Suber, Maggie and Jewels, all early
varieties. Have lately put out about two
thousand trees of the new yellow varieties,
such as Hall’s Yellow, Dorothy, Coope’s
Golden Free and Hayward’s Rival, as an
experiment for the Florida summer
markets.
Up to this time I have shipped by ex-
press only. \‘V e hope to be able to try a
few refrigerator cars this season. For best
results much depends on careful han-
dling and packing. One of the problems is
to get careful and intelligent help for
pickers. A peach that should be picked
to-day, if left on the tree until tomorrow
will be too ripe for northern markets. Or
we may err in the other direction and pick
too green. Peaches arriving without
color, tough and but little ﬂavor. go beg-
ging and the grower will be fortunate if
he gets back expense of picking, packing
and shipping, to say nothing of the ex-
penses of growing.
I believe peach growing in Florida. if
carefully looked after, when orchards are
planted in suitable location, will prove to
be fairly proﬁtable. And I also have no
doubt that new and better varieties will
be developed in time.
Report of Mr. H. Fred Hole.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I approach the subject of Peaches,
Plums and Pears with a great deal of dif-
ﬁdence. So much has been written on
them, and as the soil on which they are
grown varies, so also vary the opinions as
to their treatment. Therefore, before
readingthis paper,I would like members to
bear in mind that my remarks are not to be
considered as an infallible guide for
others in any respect, but are merely the
results of observation taken from our own
orchards and similar lands adjoining.
We began growing peaches at Fulton
on the lower St. John’s river four miles
from the sea-coast, in the spring of 1897
on moderately high Hammock land,

where the soil is of good sandy loam and
rather dry, with a good proportion of
humus, as the land was newly cleared for
the purpose and trees were planted right
away at a distance of 13 feet by 13 feet.
An old ﬁve acre ﬁeld was also planted in
peaches—I5 feet by 15 feet, and we con-
sider this latter distance best, giving more
room for cultivation and fruit picking
than the former and still having a large
number of trees to the acre. This seems
desirable as the proﬁtable life of the peach
tree does not often exceed seven years, if
as long. \Ne would advocate pushing the
young trees along the ﬁrst two years by
thorough cultivation and careful. though
liberal, fertilization. Varieties planted in
our orchards were Jewel, Waldo, Angel,
Pallas, Oviedo and Dwarf Japan Blood.
Of these we have been most successful
with the Jewel. \Valdo and Oviedo and,
in a lesser degree the Pallas. The Japan
Blood and Angel varieties have draw-
backs which will eliminate them from any
further planting on our part. The only
recommendations to the Japan Blood are
its late blooming and early ripening, in
other respects it is unsatisfactory, being
shy bearer, of to per cent ﬂavor and
a. bad shipper. As to the Angel, it is an
early bloomer, courting disaster, without
the compensating quality of early ripen-
ing, of good ﬂavor, but rather too acid to
be a favorite on markets.
With regard to cultivation of the bear-
ing tree. our practice has been shallow
plowing during late fall and clean
cultivation during spring, and especial-
ly during dry weather to conserve
moisture, continued as long as pos-
sible without knocking off the fruit.
After that time orchards are allow-
ed to go to crab-grass for hay and
the trees rest, after picking, till fall. Of
later years we have put off fertilizing, till
safety ‘of bloom has been assured, not be-
cause we consider this the best treatment
for the tree, but because in growing peach-
es commercially one cannot afford to fer—
tilize trees which will be unproductive that
year, nor does it seem very necessary, as
the trees are relieved, for that season,
from the exhaustion consequent upon the
production of a crop of fruit. The safety
of the crop being reasonably certain, we
have been accustomed to apply from ﬁve
to ten pounds or more per tree of a well-
balanced fertilizer.
As to pruning, the young trees had a
careful and somewhat heavy pruning of,
say a quarter of a season’s growth, for
two or three years. After several
bearing seasons, we found it advantage-
ous to cut back the trees heavily, forcing
them to make almost an entire new head.
This temporarily reduces the crop of fruit,
but the following season a much ﬁner
quality is produced and the proﬁtable life
of the tree thereby lengthened.
The peach trele has about as many
insect enemies and diseases as any fruit
tree we know of and it unfortunately,
seems to have a less vigorous constitution
to resist disease than most of our com—
mercial fruit, a peach tree succumbing en-
tirely, when the orange tree will exist for
years in a more or less healthy condition.
Some of these diseases can be easily man-
aged, others are difﬁcult. I will only men-
tion three or four of the latter. San Jose
Scale—In our case this was naturally ful-
ly controlled by the orange colored
Spharostilbe Cocophila, so we did not
have to treat the trees. The crude oil
treatment was very successfully used by
Mr. Wm. Macklin of Dinsmore, nine
miles north of Jacksonville. His orchards
were on pine land. An extended report

of that treatment will be found in Bulletin
No. 61, Florida Experiment Station, Lake
City.
Curculis—For this enemy we tried
jarring—without much beneﬁt—then de-
stroyed all stung fruit for two years, but
gave that up, as not a large proportion
was stung and it did not appear to increase
or diminish, though showing more on a
light crop.,
Root knot—We have not been able to
make much headway with this and so far
it is only bad on land which has been crop—
ped for years before planting with
peaches. We have tried several remedies,
but pruning and heavier fertilizing seem-
ed to do most good, though not always ef-
fective. '
Brown Rot is perhaps the most serious
disease, interfering with commercial suc-
cess. While we have not yet treated our
trees for this disease, beyond destroying
all affected fruit, what opportunities we
have had of observing the results of the
Bordeaux Spray lead us to believe that
good results are not always to be relied
on.
A less commonly known fungus dis-
ease, called by Professor H. Harold
Hume, Clitocybe Parasitica. is worse still,
as up to the present no cure for it is
known. This disease is to be found in
wild hammock, primarily on oaks of ma-
ture growth, especially water-oaks. It is
much more rarely found in old cleared
hammock land. Its ﬁrst appearance on
peach trees might easily be mistaken for
borers, as gum is seen exuding from the
tree just above the ground. On examina-
tion no borer is to be found, but from this
point downwards dead bark and wood are
in evidence and lead to one or more roots
which are discovered to be completely
dead. The disease soon spreads to other
roots and upwards into the trunk of the
tree, the limbs being apparently the last to
die. The tree appears to bleed to death
from wounds caused by this disease. On
our applying to the Lake City Experi-
ment Station for a remedy, Professor
Hume kindly came down to investigate.
On examination of the roots of the diseas-
ed trees he found the fungus and pro-
nounced it to be Clitocybe Parasitica. He
explained that it traveled from tree to tree
underground, spreading from the ends of
the roots of one to the root tips of an-
other. He gave us no hope of successfully
ﬁghting this disease, owing to the difﬁ-
culty of treating the roots. We found
that taking the soil away from the infected
part of the root-crown and removing dead
roots, allowing the sun to dry it out, to-
gether with heavy top-pruning, was some-
times helpful, if it could be done in the
fall and when the disease was not too far
advanced. We have had instances of trees
bearing some fruit after above treatment,
which generally fails to mature and the
tree succumbs to the disease.
The peach requires very careful hand-
ling to put it on the market in good con-
dition, and too much care cannot be taken
to avoid bruises. Good grading, neat
packing and well ﬁlled crates are most es-
sential, but with these conditions fulﬁlled,
to get it to its destination in prime con-
dition, owing to its bad keeping qualities
(in some varieties more than others) also
to picking season _being often hot and
rainy. This is the time when Brown Rot
gives proof of its presence, no sign of it
showing when the crate is being packed,
yet twelve hours later under favorable
conditions, most of the fruit will be found
specked. The most careful handling of
the crate is also most important and there
is much to be desired in that respect after

the crate leaves the packing house. This
however, is practically beyond the grow-
er’s control and about all he can do is 'to
take his medicine cheerfully. We have
tried both express and refrigerator and
do not ﬁnd much difference to us. They
both generally run a close race forthe lion’s
share of the proceeds. Mr. Chas. Ed-
wards Russell’s article in the April num-
ber of “Everybody’s Magazine” gives
some interesting information on shipping
peaches in refrigerator cars, which is es-
pecially enlightening to the grower and is
well worth his reading and considering.
It does not appear that the peach crop
will be heavy in our neighborhood this
season. We account for it by the large
amount of fall bloom last year and the
presence of Thrip in the bloom this spring.
In conclusion I would remark that the
old idea of one crop of peaches in three
years paying the grower is entirely ex—
ploded and further that unless he can
put fruit on an early market and get the
best prices, he will ﬁnd it a hard task to
cover the expenses of growing and
marketing them. Perhaps the latter is the
worst to contend with, for then the fruit
passes more or less out of the ordinary
grower’s control and he must take what
he can get. The fruit is moved very quick-
ly, a good market will often go to pieces in
a few hours and the grower is lucky if
this does not happen to his heaviest and
ﬁnest shipni'ents.
Fertilizers and Irrigation.
By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson.
O .
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject of fertilizers and irrigation
are poss_ibl the two most important mat-
ters connected with horticultural pur-
suits in the State of Florida.
Some years since the writer made a visit
to California and from observations of
the ﬁeld there, reached the conclusion that
,the California grower had to pay as much
for irrigation, which was an absolute
necessity, as the Florida grower had topay
for fertilizers. Since that time it has been
found that for success and best results the
California producer must fertilize, and
the Florida producer must, in order to get
the best returns, irrigate.
It seems that the merest tyro needs only
to keep his eyes and ears open to learn all
about the subject of fertilization. The
ubiquitous fertilizer expert and agent is
ever ready and anxious to impart all and
even more than can possibly be known on
the subject. The writer has no desire
or intention to belittle or underestimate
the fertilizer man who spends all of his
time, and much of his money, to learn by
study, experience and observation all that
may be discoverable in his business, but at
the same time it may be well to discount

his enthusiasm, as well as his bills, just a
little. Any one who does not feel compe-
tent, after listening to the ever ready rep-
resentatives of the numerous fertilizing
concerns, to make the proper selection has
only to refer to the state bulletin, furnish-
ed free, and he will ﬁnd out all about it in
the tables that have been published and
republished from time immemorial, until
they are, to some of us perhaps, more
familiar than the writings brought down
from Moses.
This committee cannot and will not
undertake to lay down any rules 'of fer-
tilization: believing that every intelligent
grower, after a study of his soil and a
consideration of his stocks, can make a
proper selection for his ow'n individual
wants. It may be well, however, to say
that the committee believes it is a well
established fact that to fertilize abundant-
ly, and to fertilize frequently with the
right kind of fertilizer and at the right
time is essential to successful and proﬁta-
ble production. Fertilizers containing a
high percentage of ammOnia during the
wood and foliage growing seasons of
Spring and Summer, and fertilizers hav-
ing a high percentage of potash and phos-
phoric acid during the fruit maturing
seasons of Fall and \Vinter, are requisite
to the fruitfulness of all kinds of trees and
plants,
Some very successful growers cling to
the plan of applying fertilizers only twice
a year. but a large preponderance of evi-
dence is in favor of not less than three ap-
plications. By a judicious rotation and
alternation of the ready-make mixtures
offered by the various fertilizer concerns,
nearly all necessary requirements can be
met. Sometimes, however, there are con-
ditions arising from environment, soil,
stocks, previous neglect, starvation or
overfeeding etc., that may require special
formulas, and in such cases the combined
experience of the grower and chemical
knowledge of the manufacturer are neces-
sary to produce the best results.
Irrigation.
The matter of irrigation is not a new
one in Florida, and was practiced by many
progressive growers prior to the dis-
astrous freezes of ten years ago.
\Vith modern, up-to-date improve-
ments in pumps and power, we can now
irrigate successfully and economically.
Notwithstanding what has been done and
is now being done, irrigation is still large-
ly in the experimental stage. Exactly
what effect irrigation will have on insect
plagues is not yet known to a certainty,
but it is believed that it will be beneﬁcial.
The over-cautious, or hesitating grower
reasons that there are in Florida only six
or eight weeks in the Spring when irriga-
tion is at all necessary, overlooking, or
disregarding the fact that sometimes one
or two rains during this period saves his
crop. In the arid regions of the \Nest in-
telligent irrigation has removed all un-
certainty and the grower knows he can
always year after year have uniform re-
sults. Plant growth and fruitfulness are
so dependent on a proper supply of mois-
ture that no one can question the useful-
ness of irrigation, and the only question
in the whole matter is—will it pay? We
believe it will,

Report by Cyrus W. Butler.
In the line of irrigation my experience
amounts to nothing, and I therefore have
nothing to say.
Fertilizer: for Orange (hovel.
It is customary to approach this subject
with the remark that we “know nothing
of it,” which, though much nearer the
truth than to say that we “know all about
it," is still not in accordance with the just
laws of Nature, who, we know, yields her
secrets slowly but surely to all who seek
her earnestly and faithfully. And who
among us will deny that the orange grow-
ers of Florida have sought earnestly and
faithfully for an answer to the question as
to what my Lady Orange Tree will have
for her breakfast this spring, her lunch
this summer and dinner this fall ?——and
who among the growers,of all thatportion
of the world known to us, have been able
to produce an orange so nearly perfect as
the best of the products of our own sun-
ny skies, sandy soil and carefully blended
food, Not that we would ascribe the
peculiar excellence of our Florida oranges
to fertilizer alone. for some of our best
‘ fruit has been produced entirely without
artiﬁcial food; but to produce this fruit in
abundance and, at the same time, maintain
its quality is the question that has taxed
the brains of our orange growers for the
last ﬁfty years, with results that have
placed the better class of our fruit upon
the highest pinnacle of citrus fame. So,
theoretically, we conclude that the orange
growers of Florida should know some-
thing of an orange tree’s food require-
ments, while, practically, the orange de-
monstrates the correctness of the con-
clusion.
Without going into the theoretically
scientiﬁc, which is often more theoretical
than scientiﬁc, I will give my present
course, which is the result of twenty years
of experience. involving some midnight
oil reﬂection, but much more midday sun-
shine and observation—not to mention
sweat and sandspurs; but the latter are
forgotten as we recall the beautiful green
trees, the sweet odor of the blossoms and
the exquisite ﬂavor of the golden fruit.
While soil analysis may give us some
partial pointers, practically we may con-
sider the average pine land of Florida as
simply a lodging place for the tree, as its
meals must be furnished from outside
sources, that is, so far as the elements of
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash are
concerned; and, as these elements are
generally considered the only ones neces—
sary to purchase, the question of composi-
tion resolves itself into the best sources
and relative proportions of these elements.
Proportion.
However widely the different brands of
fertilizers varied twenty years ago, to-day
nearly all of them will run between two
to four per cent. ammonia, with six to
eight per cent. phosphoric acid and ten to
twelve per cent. potash; and ita's probable
that, within these limits, the necessities of
the average grove, in normal 'condition,
can best be supplied; but it has long been
a question with me as to whether the same
proportions of these elements should pre-
vail in the three applications that most
growers make during the year.
So I will 'give my present method,
even though it contains nothing new to
most old growers.


## p. 94 (#114) #############################################

94 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Pint Application.
Just before or about the time that the
ﬁrst blossoms appear we make a light ap-
plication or not over one-half of the usual
amount of fertilizer, containing about
six per cent. each of nitrogen, phosphoric
acid and potash—the nitrogen being from
nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia,
the phosphoric acid from acid phosphate,
and the potash from a sulphate.
The object of this heavy percentage of
nitrogen is that, while the trees need a
maximum amount of this element dur-
_ ing the spring months, owing to our usual
drought during these months, they as a
rule get less than during any other warm
months of the year; hence. I apply more
and apply it in a shape that is available at
once—the nitrate of soda ﬁrst and the sul-
phate of ammonia to last until the next
application. I ﬁnd that trees so treated
with this extra amount of nitrogen at
this time will hold their fruit better and
stand the drought better than if only the
usual amount of nitrogen was used. Nor
do I ﬁnd die-back to follow this plan, or
fear it, provided that there is no excess of
ammonia left in the ground when the
rainy season sets in.
Ioooml Application.
During May we make a liberal applica-
tion analyzing from two and one—half to
three and~ one-half per cent. ammonia,
seven to ten per cent. phosphoric acid and
twelve per cent. potash, composed of sul-
phate of ammonia, steamed bone ﬂour and
sulphate of potash. Whether the trees get
the two and one-half or the three and
one-half per cent. of ammonia depends
upon their color—the lighter in color the
more ammonia. and vice versa; also upon
variety, as a tangerine will not only
stand one-third more nitrogen than/r
‘/
round orange on the same stock, but really
requires it, in order to produce the highly
colored fruit necessary to command high
prices.
Third Application.
If trees are heavily loaded with fruit,
by July we make a light application of
equal parts of low grade potash and acid
phosphate, but use no nitrogen unless
leaves are light in color and fruit small,
and even then a very light per cent., as all
ammoniates in the ground during the
rainy season are by the heat and mois-
ture rapidly nitriﬁed and carried into the
tree. In short, the rainy months are the
die-back producing ones, and hence all
excess of nitrogen should then be guard-
ed against. If trees do not have a heavy
crop, omit this July application.
Fourth Application.
During November we use a liberal
amount of fertilizer, running three per
cent. ammonia, seven per cent phosphoric
acid and twelve per cent. potash, compos-
ed of sulphate of ammonia, acid phos-
phate and sulphate of potash, which com-
pletes the bill of fare for the year. While
the trees may not be able to use as high a
percentage of nitrogen during November
and December as during May and June,
on the other hand. owing to the cooler
weather prevailing during the former
months, nitriﬁcation of the ammoniates
also proceeds less rapidly and, therefore,
the tree gets less, even though the same
amount be applied.
Of course, the above is for healthy trees,
abnormal conditions requiring modiﬁed
formulas, and for rough lemon stock one-
third less nitrogen than for sweet seedling
stock. At all times we keep a close watch
on the condition of the tree and vary the

percentage of nitrogen accordingly, using
enough potash to combine with the nitro-
gen, which for the average of the year
would be a little over three times the
amount of the nitrogen, as all growers
soon learn that. without the necessary
percentage of potash, the wood is soft,
the orange lacks juice and what there is is
insipid, to say nothing of the probable die-
back and possible gum disease and foot
rot later on.
As to the indications for phosphoric
acid, excepting so far as the thinness or
plumpness of the seed are concerned, I
must confess to being in the dark. Judg-
ing from analysis of tree and fruit, we
are using more of this element than neces-
sary, but at least, in some cases, we have
evidences to the effect that even larger
percentages are applied with good results,
so far as amount of fruit is concerned;
and as yet we have not met with any
evidence of injury, even from its ex-
cessive use. though we think that it
hastens maturity. The good results
attending the use of more of this element
than analysis of fruit and tree would call
for, may in part be accounted for by the
fact, that much of the free phosphoric acid
applied to our soil is probably soon com-
bined with lime, iron or aluminum, thus
becoming, in the ﬁrst case, of questionable
availability, and, in the second case, non-
available to the tree.
learn. of Nitrogen.
With the exception of what nitrogen is
contained in the steamed bone and the
small amount of nitrate of soda used in
the early spring, sulphate of ammonia is
almost our only source of nitrogen.
Guano, we ﬁnd from repeated experiences,
at least when applied during warm weath-
er, will cause fruit to drop badly. Blood
and bone, cotton seed meal, etc., gives a
thick bark with large pores into which
the young scale easily get their sucking
tubes and multiply rapidly; while later on
comes die-back, to say nothing of the in-
ferior quality of fruit. The same ob-
jection holds good for stable manure; but,
as its possession has not been avoidable
with us, and not wanting to waste it, we
compost it with equal parts of low grade
sulphate of potash and acid phosphate and
allow it to thoroughly rot before using,
by which time the ammonia is probably
nitriﬁed and combined with the potash,
forming a nitrate of potash, or combined
directly with sulphur, giving a sulphate of
ammonia. When so treated, we have
used the small amount of four shovel-
fuls per tree, scattered outside of the
branches, with good results only; but care
should be exercised in its use and a watch
kept for an increase of scale.
We use at least one hundred pounds
each of the sulphate of potash and acid
phosphate per ton of manure. -
The rotting process can be greatly hur-
ried by keeping the pile moist and making
holes with a crowbar for admission of air,
As for gathering a part of the nitrogen
from the air by growing leguminoid
plants in grove, we have given it a
thorough trial, resulting only in ﬁnancial
loss and humiliation. Whenever we got a
heavy growth of beggarweed, the rapid
nitriﬁcation going on in the roots 'of the
weed among the orange tree roots, has
invariably caused the fruit to become
ammoniated and split, regardless of our
best efforts to balance the debt by use of
potash and phosphoric acid.

pensive and the muriates contain so much

salt, we have conﬁned ourselves to the
sulphates using either the high or low
grade, as percentage was indicated in the
desired mixture, but usually the low
grade.
Sous-coo of Phosphoric Acid.
While we have not made any conclusive
tests as to the relative merits of bone and
acid phosphate as a source of phosphoric
acid, we have been using and watching
others who have been using both sources,
and so far ﬁnd no difference in value be-
tween the two when made available with
acid. Moreover, we note that the preju-
dice against the use of acid phosphate is
rapidly losing ground, especially with
growers who are ﬁnding out that they
have been using it for years under the
name of “dissolved bone.”
The pretended point against acid phos-
phate made by some fertilizer catalogues,
to the effect that the sulphuric acid used in
its manufacture sours the ground, is, we.
think, simply a matter of words, used to
sell goods that contain just about the same
amount of sulphur; the truth of which is
easily demonstrated, but requires too
much space to give here..
In conclusion, as the average Florida
orange grower inﬂuences and largely
governs by fertilization, not only the
amount of oranges produced, but the size
of fruit, thickness of peeling, amount of
and character of juice, therefore, I repeat
that he has learned at least a little of a
desirable bill of fare for the orange tree;
and speed the day when he can say as
much of his own stomach.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Pettigrew—Mr. President, in the
matter of irrigation I have had consider-
able experience with artesian well water,
I had a good strong ﬂowing artesian well,
with a capacity at the well of I 50 gallons
per minute. This would cover twelve
acres an inch deep in twenty-four hours,
but upon practical application I could not
get half of it. I do consider that for prac-
tical purposes I got an inch of water on
four acres from my supply in twenty-four
hours. I have about three thousand feet
of cement irrigation pipe, with a hydrant
at about every 200 feet. I also have 100
feet of hose and with the supply of water
I can get the water tolerably quickly on the
land. This artesian water is a sulphur
water, but I consider it very good for irri-
gation purposes if you can get a sufﬁcient
supply, but in the sandy soil of Florida you
can not receive the beneﬁt of the water to
anything like near the extent you could on
hard lands, such- for instance as in Cali-
fornia. Iron piping is not best for irriga-
tion purposes in my judgment especially
down where I am it is too near the salt
water. They rust out too quickly. I have
some Giant Bamboo which would make
good irrigating pipes if I could get the
joints bored out, so the water would run
through them. My longest bamboo is
forty-nine feet after cutting off the top to
where the hole is one and one¢fourth
inches in diameter. The question of irri—
gation is quite an important subject, and
there is in some directions objections to
it on account of the cost of a plant, yet
there is no question but that a properly
equipped irrigation plant will pay in the
long run, for you are always thus sure of
your water, and the water is what makes
a sure crop. ‘

Secretary’ s Report.
I r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before reading my report, I wish to
read (and I also wish to have printed in
our minutes) the report of Mr. Aubrey
Frink, who acted as Assistant Secretary
last year and whose report was inadver-
tently omitted from last year’s Report.
which is as follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
As I had been appointed assistant secre-
tary to serve during the last meeting of
our society, at Miami, in May, 1903, I of-
fered to assist Mr. Powers with the work
in connection with the present meeting
when he became ill a short time prior to
his death. This I did by getting out a
circular to members for last year. This
circular was dated March 30th. On April
2nd, Mr. Powers died and I was then ap-
pointed by President Taber as secretary to
serve until the present meeting. On April
14th, I sent out another circular to mem-
bers for last year and also to a number of
other parties. President Taber had alsoap-
pointed Mr. E. O. Painter, of Jackson-
ville, assistant secretary.. This last cir-
cular was signed by both myself and Mr.
Painter. My account stands as follows:

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In making this my ﬁrst report I regret
to have to state that the Society has again
sustained a loss through its secretary.
We all remember what a lamentable loss
the Society suffered when our worthy
Secretary A. H. Manville ceased to meet
with us as his service had been invaluable.
\Ve considered ourselves fortunate in se-
curing the help of Mr. Stephen Powers,
whose residence was unfortunate enough
to be in the track of the resistless ﬁre
which destroyed the greater part of
Jacksonville four years ago. Part of the
Society’s effects were burned during the
ﬁre at that time but this misfortune was
small compared with the loss of Secretary
Powers who passed to his reward on April
2nd, 1904.
Your present incumbent, on the 2 3d of
last October, had the misfortune of los-
ing his oﬁice and its entire contents
through ﬁre. taking all the Society eﬁ'ects
then in my possession and leaving me
without any record as to the memberships
sent in after last year’s report had gone to
press. My cash book. however. shows that
I had to the credit of the Society $90.50 at
that time.
I am glad to report that the library be-
longing to the Society is still in existence
' as it was in the oﬁ‘ice of the Times-Union
at the time of the Jacksonville conﬂagra-
tion, and had not been removed at the time
of my ﬁre. So though we have been un-
fortunate we have some things to be
thankful for.
The membership of the Society has kept
up very well although we are somewhat
behind last year. I take pleasure in re-
porting as follows:

I would like to make a motion that the
name of Mrs. A. H. Manville be added to
the list of our Life Members. This is a
small recognition of the services ren-
dered the Society by our former Secretary.
We all appreciate the work he did and I
believe the Society will consider it a
privilege to place the name of Mrs. Man-
ville on our Life Membership list,

Report of the Executive Committee.
Meeting held at the Aragon Hotel,
Jacksonville, June 2nd, 1904. There were
present Mr. McCarty, Mr. Hubbard. Mr.
Painter and Mr. Taber, and Mr. Taber
held the proxy for Mr. Phelps.
Report-of the Auditing Committee on
settlement with Mr. Power’s heirs, was
received and Secretary Painter instructed
to make settlement with them.
The members and personnel of the
Standing Committee were decided upon.
In making up the committees we had
alphabetical lists and also county lists
showing members, to work from. It was
the idea in making up these Committees
that we should not only put on the Com-
mittees members who were acquainted
with the subjects with which they had to
deal, but that the counties and divisions of
the State should be properly represented.

Secretary Painter was authorized to
prepare special features for the next meet-
ing. The number of reports authorized
to be printed was one thousand, and Mr.
Painter was authorized to print them, pay
for the same to be based on last year’s
price per’page, number of pages not to ex-
ceed those ,in 1903 report.
President Taber was instructed to take
up the Kerr resolution with the respective
railroads, toward procuring transporta-
tion for oﬂicers connected with the Ex—
periment Station and Government in their
work of Horticulture research.
President Taber took up this matter
with the railroads of the State and was not
successful in getting the desired annual
transportation.
The Florida East Coast Railway had
furnished Prof. P. H. Rolfs annual trans-
portation for these purposes. The L. &
N. Railway replied that they were pro-
hibited from issuing this transportation;
the G. S. & F., the A. C. L., and the S.
A. L. Ry., offered to issue a limited num-
ber of trip passes on the application of the
President of the Society some days in
advance of its issuance. These latter con-
ditions largely bar the usefulness of fur-
ther pursuing this subject.
Meeting adjourned. .

Minutes of the Meeting of the Execu-
tive Committee, May 11th, 1905, 10:30

Present E. S. Hubbard, acting chair-
man. C. T. McCarty, G. L. Taber, Presi-
dent; E. O. Painter, Secretary; W. 5.

Geo. L. Taber, proxy.
Minutes of last' meeting read and ap-
proved. Secretary and Treasurer’s ac-
counts were examined and approved.
Mr. Painter reported settlement with
Mr. Powers’ heirs as follows:
I wish to report that the committee ap-
pointed to take up this matter made out a
statement as near as it could from the data
obtained, which showed a balance of
something over $80 due the Society, after
allowing Mir. Powers’ expenses for post-
age, etc. This account was sent to Dr.
Powers at Ocala and a short time ago
received $80.00 from him, which I
receipted him for in full. The records
which I had were all destroyed in the
ﬁre. The $80 check was turned over to
our Treasurer, which closes up this mat-
ter.

Moved by Mr. Taber, seconded by Mr.
McCarty that Mr. Hubbard as chairman
of the committee be instructed to audit the
secretary’s and treasurer’s reports upon
ﬁnding them correct.
Carried.

Election of Ofﬁcers.

The President—The regular order be-
ing the election of ofﬁcers for the ensuing
year, the chair will request Mr. F. D.
Waite, third vice—president, to preside.
Mr. Waite takes the chair.
Mr. Taber—Mr. President, Ladies and
Gentlemen : The hour has arrived to make
nominations for your presiding ofﬁcers
for the ensuing year. I take this occasion
to profoundly thank the Florida State
Horticultural Society for the honor it has
successively conferred upon me, in mak-
ing me your chief presiding ofﬁcer for
nine years. I desire now to say that I
believe the time has arrived when you
should make another selection for your
chief presiding ofﬁcer, I believe it will be
of beneﬁt to the society to do so, and I de-
' sire to present to you, for your considera-
tion and for your unanimous support, a
gentleman well known to you as one of the
strongest and ablest members of this so-
ciety. I refer to Mr. C. T. McCarty of
Eldred, Florida, and bespeak for him your
hearty, royal support.
Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, this so-
ciety would most reluctantly, in my judg-
ment, consider the resignation of its presi-
dent Mr. G. L. Taber, under whose guid-
ance the societyhas prospered so long, and
I desire to place in nomination the name
of Mr. Taber for re-election to that ofﬁce.
Mr. Jones—Mr. President, I wish. most
heartily to second the nomination of Mr.
Taber.
Mr. Taber—Mr. President. I beg the
gentlemen who do me the kindness to pre-
sent my name, in the best interests of the
society to withdraw it. It is my belief
that the time has arrived when you
should make another selection, and I
would ask the unanimous consent of this
society to consider the nomination of the
gentleman I have just presented to you,
Mr. C. T. McCarty.
Mr. Blackman—It appears that Mr.
Taber desires and wishes that his name be
withdrawn and in doing so I will also
move that the nomination be closed and
that the secretary be instructed to cast
the unanimous vote of the society for Mr.
C. T. McCarty of Eldred, for president.
Mr. Waite—-The nomination prevails,
the secretary will cast the vote.
Mr, Painter—The secretary casts the
unanimous vote of the society for Mr.
C. T. McCarty for president.
Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, Ladies
and Gentlemen: It is a great
honor you have conferred upon me
to succeed our worthy president,
Mr. Taber, whom we have all learned to
honor and to love for his untiring devo-
tion to the interests f this society. If there
had been an intention to urge my- name be-
fore this society for any ofﬁce in opposi-
tion to the interests of this society. If there
Mr. Taber, and you should entertain the
opinion that I would have permitted it, I
wish to assure you that it is a mistaken
idea. I could never have allowed my
name to have been presented had I not
known that the determination of Mr.
Taber not to further accept this honor at
your hands, was irrevocable. I shall en-
deavor to the best of my ability to make

you a fair and impartial presiding oﬂicer.
My chief aim shall at all times be the ad-
vancement of the interests of your wel-
fare and that of this society, at least for
the year for which I have been elected for
I wish now to assure you that I have no
ambition to serve for such a great length of
time as has been the case with our esteem-
ed ex-president. Again I thank you.
(Applause)
The names of Dr. C. W. Richardson,
G. W. Wilson and G. F. Kerr being
placed in nomination, the secretary cast
the unanimous vote of the society for
their election.
The name of Mr. E. O. Painter was
placed in nomination for secretary and the
assistant secretary was instructed to cast
the unanimous vote of the society for his
election.
The name of W. S. Hart was placed in
nomination for treasurer and the secretary
was instructed to cast the unanimous vote
of the society for his election.
The names of Rev. Lyman Phelps, E.
S. Hubbard and G. L. Taber were placed
in nomination for the executive committee
and the secretary instructed to cast the
unanimous vote of the society for their
election.
Next Place of Meeting.
Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, the
next order of business must of necessity be
the ﬁxing of the time and place of holding
our next annual session. I wish to extend
to the society a most cordial invitation to
hold its next annual session on the lower
east coast, in that magic little city Miami.
I am authorized and commissioned by the
Mayor and Board of Trade of the city
of Miami to urge upon your consideration
this invitation. We want you to come
down to Miami. We want to show you
what we have been doing down there, and
(as a measure of what you may expect)
I stand here to assure you that your mem-
bership will be increased by this selection,
and you will have more money in your
treasury than you ever did have. This
was the case when you held your session
in Miami once and it will be so again. I
am here to promise you, in addition, the
lowest railroad rates that you ever heard
of to enable you to reach Miami, and to
promise you one of the ﬁnest excursions
on our bays and rivers, and through our
deep sea channel out to the broad ex-
panse of the Atlantic, besides many other
good things too numerous to mention in
detail at this time. I want to say though,
Mr. President, that Miami wants this so—
ciety to hold its next annual session within
her hospitable gates, and I sincerely hope
you will accept her invitation.
Mr. Richardson (of Miami.)—Mr.
President, I rise to second the invitation
of Mr. Blackman, we desire this society to
hold its next annual session at Miami,
and will use our utmost endeavor to make
your session a pleasurable and proﬁtable
one.

The President—The chair would like
to announce that we have with us Capt.
Garner president of the Jacksonville
Board of Trade, who desires to oﬁer a few
remarks upon the question before the so-
ciety.
Capt Garner—Mr. President, Ladies
and Gentlemen. On behalf of the Jack-
sonville Board of Trade and business in-
terests of the city of Jacksonville, I desire
to extend to you a most cordial invitation
to hold your next annual session in the
city of Jacksonville, in the auditorium of
the Board of Trade. Jacksonville has been
in the past, as she will ever will be in the
future, your sincere friend, a friend to
your every interest. She appreciates the
great work you are doing for our fair
State, and we promise you the best and
cheapest rates of transportation that can
be offered. Jacksonville is the geographi-
cal center of the state; as in ancient days it
was said that all roads led to Rome, so
it is with Jacksonville; all roads of Florida
lead to Jacksonville. It is the most central
point you could select, we extend to you
always a hearty welcome; Jacksonville is
essentially a convention meeting city.
When the time arrives that you can con—
sider the adoption of a permanent place
for your annual meetings we would gladly
welcome you, and rejoice with you should
you determine to erect 'for yourself a
building in the city of Jacksonville and
have your own permanent home with us.
However. Mr. President,I wish to say that
your best interests should ﬁrst be consid-
ered. If (in the judgment of the society)
its interests would be enhanced by meeting
at some other of our sister cities, we
should have nought to say detrimental to
such a course, for we do not wish to ap-
pear selﬁsh. All that we desire is for you
to know and feel that we want you to
meet with us, and we will at all times use
our best endeavor to make your sojourn
with us of proﬁt as well as pleasure. Of
one thing be assured; that the latch string
of the folding doors of the auditorium
hangs on the outside, and you are always
welcome.
The President—The society begs to ex-
press its appreciation of the kind invita-
tions extended for the holding of its next
annual session. There are two candidates
before you, Jacksonville and Miami, a mo-
tion to close the nomination prevails. You
will prepare your ballots.
Mr. Painter—Mr. President, the ballots
have been prepared, cast and counted.
Jacksonville receives 41 and Miami 24.
The President—It has been decided by
ballot that our next annual session will be
held in Jacksonville. The date will be
ﬁxed by the executive committee.

in her interests.
He joined the Horticultural Society as
one of its earliest members. As member
of the Florida Agricultural Society he
took part in Farmers’ Institutes as Volun-
teer Weather Observer. He studied Frost
and Frost Protection with the same inter-
est he gave to Florida soil and the use of
lavor saving machines and possibilities of

centered in horticulture and particularly
in the opportunities that the climate and
conditions in Dade county offered for hor-
ticultural experiment and progress.
His death was the indirect result of
overwork and strain and his last illness
was the culmination of months of strug=
gle for all that life means to a courageous
young soul.
So is ended the life of one who had
always stood for pure and upright living
and who would have been a force for
good and intelligent citizenship in the
community in which he lived.

Report of Committee on Transportation.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your committee begs to submit the fol-
lowing report: '
First—Owing to absence from the state
of one of -the committee, and the inability
to locate the other, there was no advisory
action.
Second—We took up the matter of
transportation by asking all the several
roads centering here for a rate of one
cent per mile each way for actual miles
traveled. These several requests were all
referred to the General Committee on
Transportation at Atlanta and was, replied
to by Mr. Jos. Richardson, secretary.
\Ve spent two months trying to get some
concessions to the members of our so—
ciety, but all to no effect. We asked ﬁnal-
ly to make the rate available only to the
members holding certiﬁcates of 1905, but
this too was rejected. \Ve are sorry that
our efforts have not brought better re-
sults.
All of which is respectfully submitted,
T. A. CARROLL,
Chairman C ommiltnc'.

ciety’s affairs, his uniform courtesy and
aimess when presiding, his earnest labor
for the advancement of the society’s in-
terests at all times, believing that the high
position attained by the Florida Horticul-
tural Society among similar societies un-
der his administration, has been largely, if
not mainly, due to his constant efforts in
its behalf.
The resolution was adopted unanimous-
ly by a rising vote of the members of the
society,
Dr. Kerr, chairman of the Committee
of Legislation introduced the following
resolution which was adopted:
WHEREAS: The attention of the Flori-
da State Horticultural Society has been
called to the serious menace to the citrus
interests of the State by the unchecked
ravages of the White Fly in some locali-
ties and the danger of its introduction
throughout the State; Therefore, be it
RESOLVED; that the Florida State
Horticultural Society heartily endorses all
reasonable measures for the eradication
of the White Fly.
GEo. KERR,
M. E. GILLETT,
C. T. MCCARTY.
Mr. Connor—I move that the Secre-
tary be empowered to secure a copy of the
pending law in regard to the White Fly
and incorporate in his annual report of
the proceedings so that we may know
something of what this- measure is.
Carried. This law will be found printed
in full in the last pages of this report.
Mr. C. T. McCarty—Mr. President, I
have here a resolution which. I have been
requested to offer which I hope the So-
ciety will see perfectly right and proper to
adopt. The following resolutions were
then adopted;
\VHEREAs, The Cuban Reciprocity
has had the effect of increasing the price
of sugar to the American Consumer, and
and not increased the price paid the Cuban
Producer,—and
WHEREAS, The reciprocal treaty hashad
the same effect upon fruits and vege-
tables produced in Cuba, and sold in
America, and \
WHEREAs, Florida is largely engaged
in the production of similar fruits and
vegetables, and believing the Reciprocal
treaty reduces the price to the producer
of American or Cuban Agricultural or
Horticultural products, and increases the
cost of same to the American Consumer,
THEREFORE, Be it resolved: That we
request our Representatives in Congress
to use their best efforts and inﬂuence to
repeal the Cuban reciprocal treaty.
BE IT FURTHER REsoLVEn: That
a copy of these resolutions be sent to
each of our Representatives and Sena-
tors.
Mr. W. H. jones offered the following
resolutions which were adopted:
WHEREAS; Owing to the many com-
plaints made as to the rough handling
and delay caused by the employees of the
Southern Express Company in handling
the output of the shippers of this Society
and State at large, therefore, be it
RESOLVED; That this Committee as a
body do respectfully ask that The South-
ern Express Company take such steps as

For the Preservation of Our Forests.
Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, I would
like to ask the unanimous consent of the
society for permission to present out of
the regular order, a matter now in the
hands of Mr. G. W. \Vilson, our second
vice-president, pertaining to the important
matter of forestry preservation. This is
a matter that very properly comes before
this society. It is an important matter
upon which every State is seeking needed
legislation,
The President—There is no objection,
by unanimous consent the rules are
waived. The society will hear Mr, Wil-
son.
Mr. \Vilson—Mr. President. The mat-
ter of legislation upon forest preservation
has been before the various legislatures
of the several States for several years.
The time has arrived when it is almost im-
perative that some needful legislation
shall be enacted if possible in our State.
The reason that I have asked permission
to appear before you in this behalf at this
time, is because the Florida legislature is
now in session, there remaining only
about three more weeks of the session, and
it is important that this matter be pressed
as urgently as may be to the enactment
of some measure into a forestry law.
This matter is urgently pressed by the Ag-
ricultural Department at Washington in
all States where there has not been a for-
estry law enacted. Some good measure is
also called for in our State by the lumber-
man, the cattleman and the naval stores
people. I will now read you this com-
munication and proposed measure and ask
for such endorsement by the society as the
same merits.
Titusville, Fla., May 9, 1905.
Pres. Fla. Horticultural Society,
Jacksonville, Fla.
Dear Sir:
It seems to me that steps should be
taken to urge the present State Legislature
to pass laws to protect the pine trees and
other trees from foolish destruction. It
seems foolish to allow the turpentine men
from other states, who have little real in-
terests in the welfare of Florida. to come
here and put more than one box in a tree
and to box trees under 5 or 6 inches in
diameter. \Ve criticise other countries for
allowing destruction of the rubber and

chincona trees, and at the same time we
allow the destruction of our useful pines
by turpentine and lumber men who are
looking only to their present gains. All
organizations interested in the prosperity
of the state should combine in efforts to
regulate these matters and protect the
trees.
Very sincerely,
Lours A. LYMAN.
Address; -
Melbourne, Fla.
The President—Upon discussion of
this matter, it appears to be the sense of
of the society that the matter should be
referred to a special committee on legisla-
tion, to be composed of the present legis-
lative committee with two members added
thereto, with power to act. The chair will
therefore name as those additional mem-
bers, Mr. G. W. Wilson and Mr. C. T.
McCarty. The chair believes that this
special committee of ﬁve, as now con-
stituted, with Mr. Wilson as its chair-
man be able, not only to handle this meas-
ure, but any other effecting the interests of
the Florida State Horticultural Society
now before'the legislature to the best in-
terests of the society and State as well,
Grove Protection at Time of Cold Waves.
By W. S. Hart.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Can we protect our groves, crop and
trees, from injury when, as some one
has put it, “a cold wave a thousand miles
wide and ten miles deep sweeps down on
us from the far Dakotas?” Can we do
this proﬁtably?
If so, how?
Nearly every orange grower of this
state, except in the extreme southern por-
tion, has asked himself and others these
questions yet, until well within the present
decade, the answer has been uncertain and
accompanied with many “if’s.”
I believe it is now possible to cite a suf-
ﬁcient number of successful cases, under
widely varying conditions, to warrant the
assertion that the ﬁrst two can be an-
swered with a single aﬂirmative.
The third may be answered differently
by different people but I feel sure that the
method I shall advocate, though- not per-
fect, may still be made to answer our needs
until a better one is discovered. As evi-
dence best known to me I will cite some of
my own experience in support of the ﬁrst
two propositions.
During the winter of 1901-2 I saved
$2,000 worth of fruit at an expense of
not over $65.00 and during the past win-
ter, ﬁghting four nights in succession with
mercury ranging as low as 18 degrees
above, and a gale of wind from the north
all the ﬁrst night, a heavy wind from the
south much of the second night and light

northwest winds the other two, I saved
much of the fruit that still remained on
the trees in a perfectly sound condition,
to a still greater value at an expense of
about $160 as nearly as I can ﬁgure it.
Nor is this all as my trees were fully
protected from injury and now bearing
heavy crops of fruit while the unprotected
trees lost all their foliage and some of
their wood and are now but scantily cov-
ered and carying but light crops, many
trees no fruit at all.
I am satisﬁed that by ﬁring my groves
I have saved more of value in the coming
crop than in that of the past season.
But, ﬁguring on what has already been
realized, I can safely say that after all pro-
tective measures up to date have been al-
lowed for, and I still have fuel to last a
week in case of cold spells, I have cleared
at least several thousand dollars on ripe
fruit alone.
Just bear in mind that comparatively
few people save a surplus of even one or
two thousand dollars in a whole lifetime
of struggle and hardships, that the cost of
protection is no more than any energetic
man can easily wt in one, two or three
years and he may do the work of prepara-
tion himself, bear in mind that the orange
tree retains its leaves three years under
normal conditions and that even if the
wood and fruit could escape injury the
loss of all this foliage at one time is a
heavy shock that means less proﬁt for the
coming year, don’t forget the peace of
mind that comes of being prepared and the
assurance that you may safely hold at
least a portion of your fruit for the high
prices late in the season rather than take
desperate chances between the Devil of a
cold wave and the deep sea of glutted
markets that may rob the improvident of
their season’s income, or even the rewards
of years of strenuous effort, by killing
their trees to the ground while they mean
but proﬁt to you if you but act your part
vigorously at the right time. Bear in
mind that in most parts of the orange belt
of this state years may intervene between
the seasons calling for protection, even for
the fruit, giving a chance to spread the
expense of preparation over a considerable
time.
Bear in mind that the ablest and most
successful business men of the world deem
it good business prudence to take liberal
advantage of insurance opportunities both
on person and property. Bear in mind
the chagrin as well as hardship, that comes
to him who fails. while others with like
opportunities succeed about him. Bear in
mind that realty values, the prosperity of
the state and every interest in it are deeply
involved.
Yes, let us carefully consider all these
things and the many more that will sug—
gest themselves to us and then ask our-
selves if it does not promise fair returns in
any case and splendid proﬁt in Some to
prepare for the cold waves that are sure
to come sooner or later and when they
do come be ready and on the spot to put up
a good ﬁght for our own?
Twenty acres protected means a whole
lot if others lose their trees, ten acres of
good bearing trees when Florida’s crop is
mostly cut off means a good income, an
acre, or even a half acre, means much to
the man too poor or feeble to protect more.
How shall we do it?
I will not stop to describe the many
more or less effective plans that have been
tried throughout this state and California,
as even the best of them, with the ex-
ception of that of building small ﬁres in
.and about the groves possess drawbacks
that must yet be overcome to bring either

one into common use among grove own-
ers.
Let us then consider this plan of prepar-
ing to build a small ﬁre' to each tree so as
to warm all the air in the groves as the,
in my opinion, only effective one with
large trees within the reach of all growers,
though small trees I would bank with
clean earth and leave them to take their
chances without ﬁres.
At our meeting here in Jacksonville in
1896 Rev. D. 0. Davies enthusiastically
rep0rted a very good measure of success
in saving a portion of his grove at
Micanopy from destruction in the winter
of 1894-95 by building a “conﬂagration”
on the north and west sides and smaller
ﬁres here and there through it.
He named his plan “The plan of the
three P’s, Preparation, Promptness,
Perseverance.” Mr. Kinney of Pierson
carried some of his trees and fruit through
the same winter in sound condition
though the state lost ﬁfty to eighty mil-
lions of dollars’ worth of property value in
citrus groves by the cold of a few hours.
Mr. Kinney’s plan was far more economi-
cal than that of Rev. Davies as he used
smaller ﬁres but more of them. By his
request his success at that time, and dur-
ing the two following seasons, were re-
ported to this society at its meeting in
1898 they being the most notable ever
attained in this country in that line of
effort up to that date.
Both of these lamented friends and fel-
low members have passed on to their re-
ward but their work lives after them.
Prof. J. G. McKinney gave us a very
valuable paper on grove protection at our
meeting here in Jacksonville in 1900 in
which, among other good things, he gave
us his experiments with small ﬁres to the
leeward of each tree with a windbreak on
the other side so constructed as to cause
wind eddies that drew the heat through
i the tree and upward to its top.
Mr. S. C. Warner, whom I hope is here
present, has this plan in effective operation
and with marked success during the cold
spell of January last.
California has given us much of value
through her work and careful reports in
thisline and therethese small ﬁres, in what-
ever way they may be made, have proven
most effective in warding off injury from
cold.
Through results obtained from the
practice of this method of protection has
come new courage and new conﬁdence to
those who realize that only by effective
protective measures could we hope to put
orange growing on a basis of safety that
would more surely warrant theinvestment
of capital than at any time in the‘- past,
throughout the section of the old “Orange
Belt” of this state that has heretofore
produced the highest quality and the
major portion of its crop.
Through it the worthy and energetic
president of this society is making orange
culture proﬁtable within eight or ten miles
of the Georgia line.
Now, as otherwise this paper promises
to become much too long, I will give, as
brieﬂy as possible, a few suggestions on
the practical working of this method of
protection that my experience tells me are
of value, and also offer some that, though
not yet sufﬁciently tested, may on further
study, prove to be of value.
The key note of Messrs-Kinney and
Davies’ teaching was, to use the former’s
words, “Be ready when the cold comes.”
Have your fuel in place, kindlings laid,
men engaged, plan of lighting all worked
out, a surplus of fuel near by to replenish
from and as soon as this is used up rush

in more before you rest, even though the
mercury is rising, otherwise you may have
worked in vain.
If practicable it is best to have a large
supply stored in the groves iwhere it is
easily accessible.
If wood is used make it four feet long
and leave it coarse. This is a saving in
several ways. Part should be lightwood
to start with. Lay it right so that it will
not waste by burning too rapidly.
The right way is in the form of a capitol
V with its point towards the tree to the
southeast and resting on the middle of a
stick at right angles with its axis. Place
the kindlings in the acute angle of the top
sticks and cover with a dry palmetto leaf
if such is handy.
\Vhere ﬁres are to be built'banking is
not necessary and the holes are a nuisance
in the night, where it is done.
To save oranges start ﬁres when the
mercury gets down to 27 degrees above
zero. For the trees up to time of starting
growth, 25 degrees. After growth has
started make it 29 or 30 degrees.
Don’t trust to long distance weather
predictions or to the ringing of electric
bells attached to thermometers outside.
Don't trust to high—priced thermometers
after the ﬁrst year of their service.
Get a dozen or two of the 15 to 25 cent
ones, test them and mark the variations
and they will be the most reliable that you
are likely to ﬁnd. Put them about in the
groves, as far from the effects of the ﬁres
as possible, and go to them often. Put
one or two way outside to windward.
Watch the \Veather Bureau reports
closely. It seldom fails to give notice of
the worst that is likely to come, and to do
it well ahead of the arrival of the cold
wave, but don’t trust absolutely even to it
as it is possible for cold to come from a
point outside its range of observation.
When it predicts a degree of cold below
the danger point have some one watching
the mercury even after it may have gone
up a little because of the dew point hav-
ing been reached. It may go down later.
Call out the men in good time and start
a ﬁre here and there even before real dan-
ger has arrived, if mercury is steadily fall-
mg.
Pay them good wages for night work,
more than for day work unless their em-
ployment depends upon success so that
they are interested as well as their em-
ployer in preserving your property.
Hire by the hour and give them plenty
of hot coffee and a good lunch in the mid-
dle of the night.
Trees do not burn 'easily in a cold night
but better put the ﬁres in the middles as
the heat is radiated in all directions.
Be sure that mulching is kept out from
under the trees and away from the ﬁres.
Have help enough and have the ﬁres
looked to often.
Call on your friends if short of help.
You will be surprised to ﬁnd how ready
even wealthy tourists are to help a man
who shows energy and foresight in caring
for his property.
Watch the ﬁres closely on a windy
night. On calm nights the job is a de-
lightful one after you once get at it.
Windbreaks, if such there be, should not
be tight ones except they be of the Prof.
McKinney kind.
Smoke and the hot sand under the ﬁres,
both help to protect in the morning and if
the sun comes up bright throw the wood
apart so as to make all the smoke possible
if you think any of the fruit is frosted.
Chunks that have been partly burned
make good kindlings for next time or they

start up easily if left whole when the char-
red ends are put together. Don't leave the
groves alone, if there be any combustible
material in or about it, until every ﬁre
has been extinguished. Then you may go
to rest with a satisﬁed mind, so far as
your own interests are concerned; but
with a deep feeling of sympathy for those
who have trusted to luck and hoping
against hope have lost wholly or in part,
for, I know of no more vexing experience
than that of rebuilding a grove that has
been killed to the ground or even the ef-
fort to realize some return from a partly
frozen crop of fruit.
Though wood is comparativelyplentiful
in this state at present it will not always
be available in sufﬁcient quantities to allow
of its use to the extent of our needs and
considering the amount of work to pre-
pare it, place it, keep up the ﬁres, replace it
with more when that in the groves is used
up, the difﬁculty of hauling it among
closely planted, large trees and the neces-
sity of getting it out and covering it when
danger of cold is past, the difﬁculty of
getting the needed help to do all this just
when it is needed, it is,well for us to care-
fully consider the matter of the use
of other fuels that will soon be, if they are
not now, more economical for our pur-
pose.
It may be that the use of some kind of
stove would give us more economical pro-
tection, even with the use of wood, after
their ﬁrst cost was met, as they give out
more lateral heat with less upward waste.
The use of coal or coke in stoves or
baskets should be tried until we learn more
fully their protective worth.
The Grifﬁths, Munson Briquettes are
giving good results in California but there
they do not have as low extremes of tem-
perature as we experience, ~
While in that state last year I talked
with Mr. James Mills of Riverside who
has had 200 tons of them, and other users.
I met Mr. M. L. Wicks of Los Angeles
president of the company, was shown
through the works where they are made
and I am encouraged to believe that they
will answer our needs better than any-
thing else on the market if they can be
made in this state as cheaply as there and
I see no reason why this may not be done.
The plant need not be an expensive one,
the materials are not costly, the briquettes
can be moved on a low freight rate, they
are exceedingly convenient to handle, take
little room_in the grove, can be stored
there under the trees where most handy
for years with but little, if any, loss of
value, need no stove or basket when in use
and each replenishing will last from ﬁve to
six hours, so I am told by those who have
used them. ‘ 1
In size they are there made 12x6x5 in-
ches for grove use but much smallerfor
household purposes. In France where
wood is scarce, briquettes are in common
use ﬁx all heating purposes and may be
seen in great piles about the railroad sta-
tions almost as plentiful as coal in this
country.
There are yet, and always will be,
problems to work out in successful'citrus
culture and the most effective and ~
economical protection from injury by cold
is one of them. I am inclined to believe
it to be best, in the future setting of or-
ange groves, to plant the rows running
north and south far enough apart to allow
of the easy hauling of fuel and fruit and
the building of ﬁres after the trees get
large without danger of injury to them
or their crop. All this means work but
nature demands that man shall work, hap-
pily. and in afﬂuence if he will, unhappy

and in poverty if he attempts to shirk, but
by working up to Dr. Davies’ rule of the
three P’s we may never now assure our-
selves that we have gotten grove protec-
tion down to a plan of proﬁtable practice
that makes orange growing here as safe
and proﬁtable an investment of money,
time and labor as foresight and energy
may hope to ﬁnd in the whole range of
horticulture.
Agriculture.
ByT'.A.Can-oll.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Agriculture, the original, natural,
necessary, and almost universal business
of man,-was planted in the Garden of
Eden with mankind, and from this one
line of industry come all others. Every
art, trade or profession whatsoever is
secondary to this parent industry, and de-.
pendent upon it,—and is useful only when
and in such a degree as may contr'ﬁiute to
the one great universal business—agricul-
ture.
Agriculture in its great volume is the
social, political and economic salvation of
the world.
There are too many young men brought
to look upon Horticulture and Agricul-
ture as being only an earthly (or earthy)
existence, with the result that the ﬂower
of our farmers are ﬂocking to the towns
and cities—where the professions are
already overcrowded, thus creating a
social as well as economic menace. What
is to be done to obviate this? There is
no single remedy, but I do believe
that much can and may be done in a
more scientiﬁc agriculture, whereby this
most necessary calling might be made
more attractive to our young men, whose
ambitions now carry them to the univer-
sities of art and letters.
The life of theagriculturist is not so dull
as many suppose. It will not compare
with that of the clerk in the store or bank
for ennui.
He has a chance in season and out of
season for recreation, and for enjoy-
ment in the work of his own hands-—
whereas the clerk and r'nechanic are only
the human handle in the pick through
which others perform a task. What more
can he hope for but existence? What per
cent of the suicides occur upon the farm?’
(not two per cent.) What per cent from
those who left the farm for other call-
ings? (more than eighty per cent). Is it
necessary to further comment upon this
point? -
With advanced Agriculture and Horti-
culture we cannot see why they should not
be as attractive to the intelligent man as
Law or Physics, or any of the other pro~
fessions.
We have only to turn to any one of our

many Horticulturists and Agriculturists
today to prove that it is not only as proﬁ-
table but equally elevating and independ-
ent, besides more genteel. I want to
make the prediction that ﬁfty years hence
will' see more independent farme‘rs than
merchants, doctors and lawyers combined
in Florida, or in this whole South-land Of
ours.-
Someone said recently; ,
“What we need now is men of well
trained brains, who will organize and
diversify agricultural industry,” and it is
true. We have greater need of men than
plowmen.
One need only to watch the real estate
transfers to learn that all the most de-
sirable properties are being taken by the
“New Comer.” Men who know a good
thing when they see it, yet our young
men are daily leaving these identical farms
seeking to better their positions socially
morally andﬁnanciaily, with what results?
How soon do they realize their mistake,
some soon enough to get back before the
Old Home passes into new hands. Then
watch with what tenacity they cling to
that Home and farm. But then there are
those who cannot see the mistake in time,-
md to him there is nothing left but to
drift with the tide of Human Pick Hands
until his days are no more.
Then what shall we do?
There ought to be and there is a remedy,
and that remedy is at hand—teach
the Agriculturist Agriculture. Require
every public school to teach agriculture,
not only the rudiments of agriculture, but
horticulture, forestry, and all its other
kindred subjects. Let it be one of the es-
tablished studies'in all public schools, and
if necessary make the study attractive by
offering premiums for a complete course.
But do not understand me to cast a single
straw or deprecating word against the
work of our present established institu-
tions. They are doing all they can, be-
ing handicapped as they are, but they
cannot reach the element we want, we
want_the farmers’ sons. To be “like
father like son/j and we can only have this
so by making the farm life interesting to
our young men and boys, get their hearts
interested in this work, teach them the
science of horticulture, the business of
agriculture. Show them the independ-
ence, the comfort, the proﬁt, of the life
of agricultural science and you have won
a crown of glory for the noblest calling of
man,

The Diseases of the Irish Potato.

By Professor F. M. Rolfs.
(The following paper was lavishly il-
lustrated with stereopticon views of the
different forms of fungus growth and we
very much regret our inability to re-
produce these views in this report.—Sec-
retary.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Our potato industry frequently suffers
severely from the invasions of various
plant organisms which are more or less
common to the potato ﬁelds of this State.
The object of this paper is to describe the
most destructive diseases, and suggest
such methods of treatment as have been
successfully employed in holding these
diseases in check. It is often difﬁcult to
distinguish some of these diseases without
the aid of a miscroscope, still it is well to
know the symptoms of the principal
ones so as to be able to use rational
methods of treatment. Doubtful cases
may be referred to the Experiment
Station.
Altenarla eolani (E. and M.) Boron.
Early Blight—This is a wide-spread
disease. It attacks both leaves and stems.
Plants usually show no signs of the dis-
ease until they are’ six inches high. The
ﬁrst indication of its presence is the ap-
pearance of small circular, brown spots on
the older leaves. The spots gradually ex-
tend and form large areas of dead tissue.
The younger leaves soon show signs of
invasion, and unless the plants are spray-
ed at once the entire foliage soon becomes
involved. In the advance stage the tips
and margin of the leaves roll up. The
large spots frequently show concentric
markings. Because of its slow progress it
is usually mistaken for the natural ripen-
ing of the plants. The development of the
tubers stop as soon as the leaves become
thoroughly involved, and the yield is often
cut short as much as 20 barrels per acre.
Plants which are weakened from any
cause are liable to be invaded by this fun-
gus. Bordeaux mixture will hold this
disease in check. Applications of this mix_
ture should be made when the plants are
four inches high, and repeated at inter-
vals of about ten days until six applica-
tions have been made.
Phytophthora Melton; (De By.)
Late Blight—This disease invades all
parts of the plants and tubers. The ﬁrst
sign of its presence is the appearance of
small brownish or black areas on the leav-
es. These areas which rapidly increase in
size followed by the curling of the leaves.
If a spell of warm, moist weather follows,
the leaves and stems turn black and decay
within a few days, giving off a disagree-
able odor. Badly infected plants have only
small tufts of green leaves at tips of stalks.
Many of the leaves hang shriveled as if
scorched by ﬁre. The under surface of the
diseased leaves are covered with mildew.
This mildew is composed of minute, tree-
like, branching structures which support a

117
minute, egg-shaped spore (seed) at the tip
of each branch. ' When a spore falls on
the moist surface of a leaf it pushes out a
slender, colorless thread which soon enters
the leaf, and if the weather conditions are
favorable, it soon completely penetrates
and kills the leaf. It usually takes about ﬁve
days from the time the spores germinate
untila new cropof spores are formed. This
explains why the disease spreads so rapid-
ly. The tubers of infected ﬁelds may, or
may not, rot. This depends largely upon
soil and weather conditions. This rot is
' worst on heavy soils. The fungus has
no winter spores. It is believed to pass
the winter in the tissue of the tubers, con-
sequently too much care cannot be ex-
ercised in selecting clean, healthy seed.
Thorough-1y sprayng the plants with Bor-
deaux mixture will hold the disease in
check.
Mum Oz-ylporinm (Sehlechtendal).
Dry Rot—Attacks all parts of the po-
tato plant below ground. The ﬁrst in-
dication of the disease is a change in the
appearance of the leaves, which take on a
lighter green color and roll up, followed
by a gradual drying up and premature
death of the plant. However, if the plants
are not attacked until they have about com-
pleted their growth these early symptoms
are often lacking. The upper part of the
shoots become _ﬁabby, droop and die,
usually taking on a dark brown color.
When infected tubers are ﬁrst dug they
appear sound, but while they are stored
the fungus gradually works inward, fol—
lowing the vascular ring. (This ring
soon takes on a brown or black color).
The fungus usually gains entrance at the
stem end. Black streaks extending from
the stem into the ﬂesh is a reliable
symptom of this disease. Infected ends
rot and shrivel, and because of this pecu-
liarity the disease is often spoken of as dry
end rot. The hyphae (feeding threads)
which occur abundantly in the diseased
tissue, often appear on\ the surface of
the tubers in dense, white tufts. These
soon bear small oval spores (seeds) and
later a larger, curved, septate form. If
these spores fall on the moist, injured sur-
face of tubers and plants, they germinate
and develop new points of infection.
This is a wide-spread and destructive
disease. It is a difﬁcult matter to ﬁnd a
lot of seed which is not more or less in-
fected with it, and it is not uncommon to
ﬁnd as high as 2 5 per cent of our seedcom-
pletely rotted by it. Frequently tubers
which are healthy when they are cut, are
completely rotted by this fungus beforethe
plants reach the surface of the ground.
This is especially noticeable when the ger-
mination of the seed is checked by un-
favorable weather conditions. In such
cases the fungus gains entrance through
the cut surface. The rotting of the seed
in various sections of the State during the
past winter was due largely to the work of
this organism. In a number of ﬁelds which
came under our observation, as much as
60 per cent of the seed was rotted by this
fungus after it had been cut for planting.
The infection in most cases was largely
due to carelessness in mixing diseased
seed pieces with healthy ones. The spores
falling on the cut, moist surface soon ger-
minated and invaded the tuber. The
planting was followed by a spell of cold
weather which retarded the germination of
the seed, thus enabling the fungus to
consume the tuber before the young plants
reached the surface of the ground. In
ﬁelds where the planting was followed by
more favorable weather conditions, the
stand was much better, still many of the

seed tubers were sooner or later complete-
ly destroyed by the fungus. but the plants
were fairly well established before the
destruction of the seed. \Vhen the diseaSe
is once introduced in the ﬁeld it is apt to
remain in the soil for a number of years,
hence it is desirable to practice a syste-
matic rotation of crops.
Carefully selecting clear smooth seed
and rejecting from time to time all tubers
showingany sign of rot, also aidsmaterial-
ly in checking the spread of the disease.
Exposing the seed to the light from four
to ﬁve weeks before planting is an ex-
cellent practice. Ths treatment tends to
hasten the germination of the tubers after
planting and enables the plant to become
established before the seed tuber is en-
tirely destroyed.
Bacillus Sollnacernm (Smith)
Bacterial Wilt—A very common and
destructive disease. This disease causes
the foliage to wilt, and later, the stems and
branches become discolored and die. In-
fection may occur either above or below
the ground. The disease also produces a
brown or black rot of the tubers. This
organism also attacks egg plants and to-
matoes.
Select clean, smooth seed, rejecting all
those showing black end vascular bundles.
Expose the seed to the light four or ﬁve
weeks before planting.
Corticlum Vagum Var. Solani (Burt).
Rhisoclouia—A wide-spread disease.
It is usually most troublesome on low
lands but during excessive wet weather it
also causes more or less loss on the higher
lands. The young plants suffer most, and
many of the young shoots are completely
cut off before they reach the surface of
the ground. This disease also frequently
produces injuries which bring about an
abnormal development of small tubers. It
is also injurious to the surface of growing
tubers and freguently produces a rough
surface known as scab.
This fungus forms a white felt-like
fruiting membrane on the green stems
just above the surface of the ground, often
covering the stems for a distance of three
inches. This membrane is composed of a
network of hyphae which produce many
short, club-shaped branches (basidae) on
which small stalks (strigmata) develop.
At the end of each strigmata a single,
brown spore (seed) develops. These
spores fall as soon as they mature. If
they fall on a moist surface they ger-
minate in a few hours and thus may start
new areas of infection. It is also pro-
pagated by black scale-like bodies called
sclerotia. These form freely on the
stems and tubers below the surface of the
ground. The sclerotia are composed of
large, closely packed cells. When dry,
the sclerotia are hard to detect, but when
wet, they are dark brown and easily seen.
Tubers which are more or less covered
with these bodies ought not to be used for
seed. since the cells of these sclerotia de-
velop into long, feeding threads, which,
under favorable conditions, soon invade
and frequently destroy the young shoots.
A diseased tuber in a sack of clean ones
under favorable conditions of heat and
moisture, may spread the disease to ad-
joining tubers and in time infect the entire
lot. Carefully selecting clean, smooth
tubers and exposing them to the light
from four to ﬁve weeks before planting,
gives excellent results. When the fungus
is once introduced into a ﬁeld it remains
in the soil a number of years. Good
drainage and careful cultivation aids ma-

terially in checking the progress of the
disease. Burning all old stems and tubers,
after the harvest, is an excellent practice.
A systematic rotation of crops is strongly
recommended.
Oolporl scabies (Thuter).
Scab—Attacks only the tubers. The
skin of the tubers becomes pitted and fre-
quently cracks. These injuries form a
gateway for an invasion of various fungi
and insects, which in many cases extend
the injury. Beets are also attacked by
this organism. Infected tubers are the
principal means of spreading this disease.
When once introduced into a ﬁeld it re-
mains in the soil for years.
Treating infested-seed with a solution
of one ounce of corrosive sublimate to
eight gallons of water for one and one-
half hours, and one week before planting,
gives good results, provided the treated
seed are planted in soil free from the
organism. A systematic rotation of crops
gives good results,
Vomlculnrin.
Anthracnose—Quite destructive to our
summer crop. The ﬁrst account.of this
fungus ,was given by Dr. Halstead. It
attacks the stems and may cause pre-
mature death of the plant. Spraying with
Bordeaux mixture would probably hold
this disease in check. Burning all of the
diseased vines as soon as the crop is har-
vested is strongly recommended.
Bordeaux M inure—Has proved the
most efﬁcient spray for both Early and
Late. Blight, but it is simply a preventive,
and not a cure for these diseases. It is
yery essential that the spraying be done
at the right time. If the treatment is de-
layed until signs of damage appear, very
little good will result. Spraying, to be ef-
fective must be done before any signs of
disease appear, and it must be done
thoroughly, for unless the entire surface
of the plant is covered by the mixture
some of the spores of the fungus will fall
on the unprotected spots and gain entrance
to the plants. Frequent applications are
necessary, especially if sufﬁcient rain falls
to wash off the mixture. The following
is the standard formula for Bordeaux
mixture:

Potato vines require from 2 to 6 barrels
of this mixture per acre, according to the
size of the plants. When spraying is
done on an extensive scale it is usually
convenient to make up a stock solution of
copper sulphate. Suspend a coarse sack
containing 45 pounds of copper sulphate
into a barrel containing 45 gallons of
water. The copper sulphate should be plac-
ed near the surface of the water a day or
two before it is to be used. Stir this solu-
tion thoroughly before using, and one gal-
lon of it will contain one pound of copper
sulphate.
A quantity of fresh lime may also be
slackened and placed in a barrel, and if it
is covered with a few inches of water it
can be kept in an excellent condition for
some time.
To prepare a mixture from these solu-
tions, take six gallons of copper sulphate
and place it in the spray barrel, and add 19
gallons of water, From the slackened
lime take four pounds of the paste, dilute
it with 2 5 gallonsof water and addit to the
copper sulphate solution. All the ma-
terials ought to be passed throhgh a sieve
so as to exclude the particles which might
clog the nozzles.

If the “bugs” are plentiful add one
pound of Paris Green to 50 gallons of the
above mixture. A paste should be made
of the Paris Green by mixing it with a
small amount of water before putting it
into the sprayer.
Potassium farm-cyanide, is used to de-
termine if enough lime has been added to
combine with all the copper sulphate. It
is a yellow poisonous salt which dissolves
readily in water. Ten cents‘ worth dis-
solved in about ten times its bulk of water
will ordinarily be enough for one season.
In using this test, pour into your spray
barrel 25 gallons of the milk of lime. Stir
the mixture thoroughly and add a drop of
the potassium ferro—cyanide. If enough
lime has been added the drop will not
change color when it strikes the mixture;
however, if sufﬁcient lime has not been
added it will immediately change to a dark
reddish brown color and more lime must
be added. Even after the test shows no
color it is best to add a little more lime.
Corrosive Sublimatc Treatment for
Scab—Corrosive Sublimate or bichloride
of mercury is sold in form of white crys-
tals. It may be bought at any drug store
for about ﬁfteen cents an ounce. The
cost of material for treating the seed for
an acre will not exceed ﬁfty cents. The
solution is made by placing one ounce of
this chemical in an earthern or wooden
dish containing one gallon of hot water.
As soon as it is_ all dissolved pour the con-
tents of the dish into a wooden vessel con-
taining seven gallons of water. Put the
potatoes into this solution, and let them
remain an hour and a half. The solution
may be used a number of times. The
disinfection may be done at any time. Ex-
periments indicate, however, that treating
the tubers about a week before planting,
and spreading them on the ﬂoor or ground
where they will be fully exposed to the
light, greatly facilitates their growth after
planting. Corrosive sublimate is a deadly
poison to both man and animal when tak-
en internally. but the solution and treated
potatoes may be handled freely without
experiencing any ill results.

Commercial Stock Food Law.

By R. E. Rose.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The necessity for a “Commercial Stock
Food Law” similar to our fertilizer law
in this State, has been recognized by re-
tail dealers and consumers for years.
The fact that other States have enacted
such laws, requiring the analysis, inspec-
tion, and guarantee, of commercial feed
stuffs, while Florida has not,4has caused
this State to become the dumping ground
of large quantities of material which
could not ﬁnd a market in other States.
During the past four years, while I have
had the honor to serve the State as State
Chemist, numerous samples of feed stuff,
good, bad, and indiﬂ‘ierent, have been sent
to the State Laboratory for examination.
My predecessor informs me. and the rec-
ords of the ofﬁce show, that for years,
complaints have been made as to the
quality of commercial feed stuﬁ sold in
the State; while at all times the informa-
tion required, as to quality and value of
samples sent in has been given. it has
been simply as personal information. no
relief could be given ofﬁcially, and the
party defrauded had no resource, except
a suit at common law for damages. Ad-
ulterated or inferior commercial feed not
being prohibited, no penalty for false
statements or misrepresentations be-
ing provided, the retail dealer and con-
sumer were at the mercy of the manufac-
turers, brokers, importers. or wholesale
dealers. To such an extent had this evil
grown. that a general protest fr0m the
retail dealer and consumer, created a de-
mand for a law regulating the sale of com-
mercial feeding stuffs in this State. While
the State chemist has received and ex-
amined numerous samples of inferior
feeding stqu from various parts of the
State, there has also been analyzed by the
chemist of the State Experiment Station,
a number of samples taken from various
parts of the State, with results conﬁrming
those made by the State Chemist, showing
the general inferiority of the stock feed
sold throughout the State. This inves-
tigation made the State Experimental Sta-
tion, and the State Agricultural Depart-
ment, while along the same lines, and
caused by the same general protest and
popular demand, was entirely independ—
ent; in fact, neither Department knew of
the other’s work, until the bill now before
the Legislature had been presented. I It is
gratifying to myself, and certainly must
also be to Prof. A. \V. Blair. to know that
the labors of each, for the beneﬁt of the
feeder and other citizen of the State, has
lead to a concerted effort to remedy the
evil, borne long and patiently by the peo-
ple of the State.
Special Bulletin number 30, of the
Florida Experiment Station, by A. W.
Blair, M. A., Assistant Chemist. “The
composition aof some of the concentrated
feeding stuffs on sale in Florida,” so ably
and logically states the general conditions,
and so fully conﬁrms my opinion. and

position, on this most important subject,
that I take the liberty of quoting largely
therefrom, and suggest to all consumers
of feeding stuffs in the State, to send to
the Experiment Station at Lake City, for
a copy of this “Special Bulletin, No. 30.”
Professor Blair says, “The fact that
Florida is largely a vegetable and fruit
growing State, has seemed to render
necessary the importation, from other
States, of large quantities of concentrated
feeding stuffs. I have no means of veri-
fying the statement, but I believe that I
am safe in saying that in proportion to the
population and the number of farm ani-
mals, no other State in the Union imports
such large quantities of these materials
for home consumption.
The Necessity for I Feeding Stnﬂl Imp”-
tlon Law.
The question as to the quality of these
goods seems never to have troubled us
seriously. We have been content to take
what the manufacturer is pleased to send
us, and if the quality has been poor, either
the animals have suffered or we have been
compelled to buy an additional quantity to
compensate for the inferior quality, or
both, On the other hand we have not been
content thus to accept what the manu-
facturers of fertilizers were sending us,
but have required them to state the in-
gredients used in the manufacture of the
goods, and guarantee that they will, on
analysis, show a certain percentage of the
fertilizing constituents—plant food; and
we have further clothed the State Chemist
with power to collect and analyse samples
and publish. to the State the results of his
work, in order that the farmer and fruit-
grower may be protected from the sale of
adulterated goods.
But a large quantity of commercial fer-
tilizers used in the State is manufactured
here, and to say to the fertilizer manufac-
turers of this State, “You must make your
fertilizers, which you furnish us for grow-
ing our crops, come up to a deﬁnite
guarantee,” while we say to the manufac-
turers of concentrated feeding stuffs in
other States (for practically all the
ground products on the market come
from other States.) “You may send to us
for feeding our stock whatever grade
of goods you choose,” does not seem en-
tirely just to the manufacturers of fer-
tilizers.
It is perhaps, true that greater loss
would result from the use of inferior fer-
tilizers than from the use of inferior feed-
ing stuffs, and that it is easier to practice
deception with the former than with the
latter, still this does not make it less im-F
portant that he who buys feeding stuffs
should be protected from inferior and
fraudulent goods. The great variety of
mixed feeds, and proprietary feeds makes
it comparatively easy to deceive even
those who have had considerable ex-
perience in handling such goods. How
many of those who buy feeding stuffs can
say that they do not contain ground corn
cobs, rice hulls, corn bran, etc., any more
than the farmer can say that his fertilizers
do not contain low grade materials worth
but little more than half the price asked
for them? The fact that the following
State viz.: Maine Vermont, Massa-
ch-usetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut.
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Maryland, Tennessee, Indiana, W iscon-
sin, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Ohio,
now have feeding stuff laws in operation,
would seem to indicate pretty clearly that
there is need to guard against adulteration
and fraudulent practice. This fact in it-
self ought to be sufficient to bring us to

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTUKAL SOCIETY.
our senses; for we need not think for one
moment that the manufacturers will stop
placing upon the market inferior goods,
so long as there are places like South
Carolina, Gegrgia, Florida and Alabama
to be used as dumping grounds for what
more than half the States east of the Mis-
sissippi will not have.
Believing that this condition existed,
the Chemical Department of the Experi-
ment Station began, last November, an in-
vestigation with a view to ascertaining the
exact extent to which low grade and adul-
terated feeding stuffs are being placed up-
on the market.
Samples were secured from the various
sections of the State, largely through
students of the University who went to
their homes at the Thanksgiving and
Christmas vacations.
They were instructed to secure samples
of the different concentrated feeds, which
should, so far as possible, represent the
whole lot from which they were taken,
and also to secure the trade name, name
and location of the manufacturer, and the
selling price per sack of 100 pounds, or
per ton, in the case of wholesale dealers.
The names of dealers are reserved, since
it is not intended to work any hardship to
the wholesaler or retailer, so long as there
is no law requiring them to maintain a
certain standard.
As a result of this, forty-three samples,
representing a considerable variety of
feeding stuffs, and collected from differ-
ent parts of the State, have been analyzed.
It would have been much better could the
number of samples and localities rep-
resented been greater, but the limited time
and pressure of other work did not permit
this.
It is believed, however, that the work
represents, fairly well, the feeding stuffs
123
on sale throughout the State.
Taking up ﬁrst the brans and compar-
ing their protein and fat content with the
standard we ﬁnd that all of the
samples examined fail to come up to the
minimum standard requith in pro-
tein—IS per cent.
Number I 799 is very low in protein and
fat, while the ﬁbre—indigestible part—is
over I 7 per cent, whereas, in good wheat
bran it should not much exceed 9 per
cent. This sample was highly adulterated
with ground corn cobs and screenings.
Number 1714 contained wheat chaff,
corn bran, and various pieces of foreign
matter, indicating mill sweepings. Num-
bers I726, I730, and 1731 contained corn
bran; 1807, dirt and oat chaff, and 1831,
chaff, corn bran, and other foreign matter,
probably mill sweepings. The average '
retail price for eight of the twelve samples
is $1.38 per sack of 100 pounds, (27.60
per ton,) which is undoubtedly excessive
when it is remembered that not one of the
samples comes up to the minimum stand-
ard for pure wheat bran.
Six samples of Purina, four of Victor
and one each of Boss, Parcell and Mack’s
Mule Feed, are com and oat feeds, and
are composed of cracked corn, ground or
crushed oats and oat hulls, the oat hulls in
most cases predominating. These are no
doubt, the product of cereal food mills,
and furnish a means of disposing of the
oat hull at a good proﬁt. They have a
fair feeding value, though in most cases
this is not in proportion to the price asked
for them. Certainly this can be said of
those obtained at Dania and Hallandale.
The average protein content of the four
samples of Victor Feed is only 7.62 per
cent, while the fat is 3.05 per cent. and in
this connection it is interesting to note
that ﬁve samples of Victor Corn and oats

feed manufactured by the American
Cereal Company and analyzed at the New
Jersey Station, have an average of 8.64
per cent of protein and 4.50 per cent offat,
and ﬁve samples analyzed at the Con-
necticut Station gave 8.26 per cent protein
and 3.93 per cent of fat, and sold at an
average price of $25.40 per ton. Both
New Jersey and Connecticut have inspec-
tion laws.
The sample of Mack’s Mule Feed is
very low in protein and fat, and high in
crude ﬁber and ash, indicating clearly the
predominance of oat hulls. ‘
Number 1805, sold under the name of
Yellow Meal, is cotton seed meal adulter-
ated with hulls, making the protein con-
tent about 13 per cent lower than it should
be, for the price asked—$27.00 per ton.
Atlas Dairy Feed, number 1738, is a
product of the sugar factories, and is
made by drying and grinding the bagasse,
soaking in molasses, and again drying.
Its value as a feeding material, is probably
not yet well established in this State.
Marsden Food, number 1829, is ground
straw, probably oat straw, and has about
the feeding value of oat straw.
The wiregrass hay which grows abun-
dantly in the pine woods of Florida. con-
tains more protein, and more than twice
as much fat. as does this material, and
would no doubt be about as easily digest-
ed. But either beggarweed, cow pea, or
velvet bean hay contains anywhere from
two to ﬁve times as much protein, and
would certainly not cost any more, if as
much, as does this high-sounding “Mars-
den Food.” Judged by the samples ex-
amined, a large proportion of the concen-
trated feeling stuffs on the Florida market
is of an inferior quality.
All of the samples of wheat bran ex-
amined are below the minimum standard
for good wheat bran.
Some materials, as “Marsden Food,”
are sold at unreasonably high prices.
The adulterants found were rice chaff,
wheat chaff, oat hulls, ground corn cobs,
corn bran, screenings, weed seeds, dirt and
other foreign matter, indicating mill
sweepings.
Practically all the concentrated feed-
ing stuffs used in this State are imported,
and this constitutes a constant drain upon
the wealth of the State.
Florida can and should produce much
more of her feeding materials than she is
producing, and thus save to the State
thousands of dollars, \Vhere the farm
crops furnish sufﬁcient carbohydrates,
only feed stuffs rich in protein should be
purchased. The mixtures of corn and
oats, containing as they do, large quanti-
ties of oat bulls are not economical pro-
tein feeds.
There is so much proﬁt in selling
ground corn cobs, wheat chaff, oat hulls,
corn bran, rice hulls, etc., and at the price
of wheat bran, that the consumer must
ever be on the watch. A careful examina-
tion with the eye or with the help of a
small magnifying glass will often reveal
these adulterants.
Those who buy feeding stuffs should
have the same protection as those who buy
fertilizers. Such protection would pro-
mote the interests of the honest manufac-
turer and dealer, diminish the sale of
worthless materials, and instruct the peo-
ple in regard to the composition of feed-
ing stuﬂs and their comparative value.”
While Professor Blair’s samples were
average samples, those examined by the
State Chemist were generally inferior
samples, naturally the purchaser ﬁnding
an unusually poor result, or evident adul-

125
teration, sends his sample to the State
Chemist; which he would not do were the
goods at all satisfactory. The conse-
quence has been that all the samples ex-
amined by the State Chemist have been of
inferior value'as compared to those taken
generally throughout the State.
As an example. I quote the analysis of a
popular feed sent for examination by a
Jacksonville wholesale dealer. whose cus-
tomers had complained of the quality of
the feed, and suspecting it of causing the
death of his live stock, which is possibly
did, an account of the large amount of in-
digestible ﬁbre:
“Number 332 Stock Feed
Protein .. .. . ..Io.5o per cent.
Fats .. .. .. .. .. .. 1.31 per cent.
Starch and Sugar .. ..31 .95 per cent.
Fibre .. . .. .. ..53.25 per cent.”
More than half this feed was ﬁbre,
largely indigestible. The commercial
value of this sample compared to standard
feeds is not to exceed $17.15 per ton, while
it is quoted in Jacksonville to-day at $26.-
00 per ton.
[The law advocated above was passed
by the last legislature. A law similar to
and with same provisions as to guarantee
of valuable ingredients, as our fertilizer
law, with similar penalty and method of
execution, drawing of samples and analy-
sis by State Chemist—Secretary]
Some Invitations.

The Florida State Horticultural Society
is always the recipient of numerous invi-
tations, some of which it cannot accept on
account of time, and others are accepted
because time is so arranged that the meet-
ings are not interfered with, and the in-
terest, instruction and social functions of
the society are thus broadened and en-
joyed by all.
H. O. Painter Fertilizer CO." Invitation.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Knowing that many of the horticultur-
ists have never had the opportunity of
inspecting an acid-making plant, and be-

lieving it would be of interest to them, I,
therefore, invite your honorable body to
visit our plant, in South Jacksonville, on
Wednesday, May Ioth, at noon. I have
arranged with the ferryboat, which leaves
at the foot of Main street at 12 o’clock
sharp, to take over all members. It will
be necessary for the meeting to adjourn at
ten or ﬁfteen minutes to 12 o’clock to give
the members ample time to reach the ferry-
boat, which will take them across to the
plant. -
_ I will add, that somewhere on the route
a lunch will be served so that the members
can return in plenty of time to open the

afternoon session at 2 o’clock. Ladies are
especially invited.
Yours respectfully,
E. O. PAINTER,
President E. O. Painter Fertilizer Co.
Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, I move
that the society accept Mr. Painter’s kind
' invitation, under the provision, however,
that he fumigate the acid chambers, throw
a tarpaulin over his blood and bone, and
will agree not to give us any dissertations
upon fertilizers, for we should all I am
sure like to visit this large establishment,
and see for ourselves where and how the
fertilizer manufacturers get such euphon-
ions and sweet-sounding if not fragrant
names as “Simon Pure,” “Gem” and
“Ideal” as applied to some of these goods
we pay the handsome price of $40 to $45
per ton for.
Mr. E. O. Painter—Mr. President, I
can assure Mr. McCarty that the bad odors
will be kept under subjection, and the most
fastidious will have no cause for offense,
but whether he will enjoy the ammonia,
potash and phosphoric acid that he will
partake of during the lunch remains to be
seen.
The invitation was unanimously ac-
cepted.

Captain Gmer’l Invitation.
The President—The chair desires to an-
nounce to the society that Captain C. E.
Garner is with us, and desires to extend
personally an invitation for some enter-
tainment of the society. _
Captain Garner—Mr. President, Ladies
and Gentlemen: The Jacksonville Board
of Trade has arranged, as a portion of
your entertainment during your delibera-
tions, an ,excursion on the St. Johns river
on the Steamer May Garner. The steamer
will leave her docks at 10:30 A. M., and I
wish to attend to you one and all a cordial
invitation to go on this little river trip,
which I trust 'you will ﬁnd pleasant and
refresh you for your afternoon’s session.
The President—The chair, for the so-
ciety, extends to Captain Garner and the
Jacksonville Board of Trade the heartfelt
thanks of the society for his kind invita-
tion, which is accepted.

Wilson k Toomor’l Invitation.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The excursion planned by the Board of
Trade to-morrow on the St. Johns river
does not provide for any objective point,
and if it should meet your pleasure we
should like very much indeed to have you
stop at “Idealia,” and look over our new
modern fertilizer factory, which we believe
would prove instructive as well as interest-
ing to a great many members. And while
you are in that locality you would also see
the new improvements being made along
the river front, the large export yards of
the Atlantic Coast Line and also the Flor-
ida Naval Stores Co., as well as other
industries that are being started in that
section.
Trusting we may have the pleasure of
showing you through our factory, we are,
Yours respectfully,
LORENZO A. WILSON.
President Wilson & Toomer
Fertilizer Co.
Mr. Painter—As the excursion has no
objective point to which to take the mem-
bers, I move that the society accept Mr.
Wilson’s invitation so that the members
can see the improvements made in that
section.

From the Elks.
The President—The chair desires to
anounce that we have with us his Honor
Mayor Nolan, who wishes to extend to
the society an invitation.
Mayor Nolan—Mr. President, Ladies
and Gentlemen: The Jacksonville Elks
Lodge has arranged for an illustrated lec-l
ture to-night at the Windsor Hotel Audi-
torium, and I am commissioned by the
Jacksonville Lodge of B. O. E. to extend
to you one and all an invitation to attend
the lecture. Mr. President, should I not
have the pleasure of meeting with you
again during the deliberations of this ses-
sion, I trust I may have that pleasure at
your next annual session. Jacksonville, as
she has always in the past, desires to ex-
tend to you at all times a most cordial
invitation to hold your annual sessions in
this city, the metropolis of your State.
Mayor Nolan’s remarks and invitations
were received with applause.
The President—The Florida State Hor-
ticultural Society, through its Presidenf'
and presiding ofﬁcer, desires to tender the
heartfelt thanks of the society for the kind
invitations just extended, and particularly
to the invitation touching the holding of
the next annual session of this society in
the city of Jacksonville.
For Betterment of Report.
Mr. Hart—Mr. President, before we
proceed to the reading and discussion of
papers, I desire to call the attention of the
society to the unsatisfactory steno-
graphic report of the proceedings of
the last annual meeting of the society.
I assume it is unsatisfactory, it is very
much so to myself, as I have been
very incorrectly reported, and will not
stand for anything in the last report under
my name except the Treasurer’s account.
I note similar complaints from other mem-
bers. I have been an ofﬁcer of the society
for a good many years, and was Secre-
tary, either by election or as assistant, for
seven years, and know that a stenogra-
pher’s report is a strange and wonderful
thing to deal with. I have always found
it very difﬁcult to get a satisfactory report
of our proceedings, and one that is mis-
leading .I consider very hurtful to the
society. I would like to have some sug-
gestion from other members as to the bet-
terment of the service we have heretofore
had in this very important matter.
Sending proof to each one for correc-
tion who takes part in the discussions
seems to be the surest means of improve-
ment, and I‘would recommend it.
The President—The chair concurs in
the remarks of Mr. Hart; it is the opinion
of the chair, however, that the Secretary
has had the matter of betterment of this
very important service under consideration
for some time. It seems to be a very dif-
ﬁcult matter to secure competent service.
While I believe the society has at all times
availed itself of the very best assistance in

~FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
this direction that could be secured for the
money we have paid for it, I believe proper
steps have been taken by the Secretary in
conjunction with the Executive Committee
to secure the future betterment of this very
important work. At a later hour during
the session, the Secretary will bring the
matter of his action in the premises before
the society, which the chair believes will
meet with the approval of the society.
Mr. Painter—Reverting to the matter
of reports of our annual meeting, I believe
I have been able to arrange for a report
that will be satisfactory to the society. I
ﬁnd it to be a hard matter to get anyone to
take these proceedings at any price,
or at least at a price the society could af-
ford to pay. The gentleman, Mr. \V. G.
Powell, now with us, who undertakes this
important work for the society, at .this
session was reported to me to be one
of the most experienced men in the State,
and upon careful investigation I was con-
vinced that if he would undertake the
report for the society he was able to give
us a good, comprehensive report. Mr.
Powell at ﬁrst declined to accept this work,
knowing, as he put it, what he would be
up against, but reconsidered and accepted
it. I am assured that this report of our
annual proceedings will be the best that
can be had. I would therefore move that
the Secretary be empowered to pay for this
service as per contract agreed upon with
him by and with the approval of the
Executive Committee.
The President—The society would be
pleased to have any suggestion that Mr.
Powell may be able to offer for the better-
ment of this important service.
Mr. Powell—Mr. President, I have had
a long experience in reporting the proceed-
ings of deliberative bodies and assemblies
in this State, during which time I have
handled the annual proceedings and report
of a great many deliberative societies, in-
cluding our legislative proceedings from
time to time, and I beg to assure you that
the most arduous duties devolving upon
any member of your society is the work of
your secretaries and scribes. It has ever
been and ever will be from the notes of
the scribe that history is written. An old
Egyptian proverb says: “The scribe gets
everything.” He does, but he can't use
it, (and an afterthought also reminds me
that recent investigations reveal a literal
translation from ancient cuniform tables
that “scape-goat” could easily be rendered
“scribe!") Seriously, though, Mr. Presi-
dent, it is impossible for a reporter single-
handed to make a verbatim report of a
large deliberative body. Such a service
would cost a great deal of money. It
would take a corps of three reporters and
three scribes, therefore the best that can
be done is to take as full note of the pro-
ceedings as may be. From such. full data
a competent scribe may with facility tran-
scribe and compile a very comprehensive
and satisfactory report. Indeed this is the
way the history of all deliberative bodies
is written. To be able to do this even the
reporter must have at his ﬁngers’ ends a
fund of general encyclopedic knowledge.
To be able to perfectly report the proceed-
ings of a society of this character he
should know the faintest sound of every
technical term in Bailey’s work; he should
be a botanist, a chemist, and know Cush-
ing by heart. If he would report the pro-
ceedings of a medical society, he must
know medical jurisprudence and the gen-
eral history of hygiene. If he would
report legislative proceedings. he must
know political economy and the history of
the world. If he would report a bankers'
association, he ought to be the composite

of a John Law, a Lawson and a national
bank examiner. As a rule, Mr. President,
he is rarely, if ever, any of them. If he
were he would not be a scribe, but he must
at least have some intuition of what he is
to report, some general knowledge of the
work undertaken. This alone, Mr. Presi-
dent, is all th'at I possess, which, with my
long experience and the assistance of the
ofﬁcers of your societies, has enabled us to
write the history of many of the delibera-
tive bodies of our great and growing State,
and gives me the assurance to say that the
report of this session of your society will
be one of the best it has ever had.
129
The President—The society has had
considerable trouble in the matter of its
reports, but the chair believes that the ar-
rangement now made by the Secretary and
Executive Committee has been for the bet-
terment of that service, and that the report
of the present session will be all that could
be desired. The question comes upon the
motion of the Secretary that he be em-
powered to pay .for this service as per
contract for same made by and with the
consent of the Executive Committee. All
in favor of the motion will say aye; those
opposed, no; the ayes have it. It is so
ordered.

The White Fly Act.

The following act was passed by the

and fruit trees in Orange county:
Chapter 5551—(No. 180).
AN ACT for the Protection of the Groves,
Orchards and Fruit Trees of Orange
County from Injurious Insects. and
Providing for a Horticultural Commis-

Be it Enacted by the Legislature of the
State of Florida:
SECTION 1. That if there shall be pre-
sented to the Board of County Commis-
sioners of Orange county a petition signed
by at least twenty-ﬁve freeholders of citrus
grove property situate in said county, and
setting forth that citrus groves, orchards,
nursery stock, or fruit trees in said county
are infested with white ﬂy, and praying
for the appointment of a horticultural
commission, the Board of County Com-
missioners, if it has reason to believe the
allegations of the petition to be true, shall
appoint a horticultural commission for
said county within thirty days after the
presenting of the petition.
The horticultural commission shall con-
sist of three commissioners who shall be
citizens of the State, resident in Orange
county, and men well skilled and expe-
rienced in the care and management of
orange and other citrus fruit groves.
They shall hold ofﬁce for the term of two
years from the date of their appointment
unless the Board of County Commission-
ers shall determine that no reason exists
for the further continuance of the com-
mission. The Board of County Commis-
sioners may ﬁll any vacancy of the com-
mission by appointment for the unexpired

chairman, and thereupon it shall become
its duty to supervise the methods and
means taken for the abatement and de-
struction of the white ﬁy. It shall, as
soon as possible, with the approval of the
proper ofﬁcials in charge of the Agricul-
tural Experiment Station in the Univer-
sity of Florida and of the Board of County
Commissioners of Orange county, make
rules prescribing formulas and methods
for the treatment of citrus groves, or-
chards, yards, nursery stock, trees of any
kind, shrubs, plants or fruit infested with
the white ﬂy, and also prescribing the
methods, time and frequency of applica-
tion, and shall have said rules published
for free distribution.
SEC. 4. The commission or any one of
its members shall have power to examine
any citrus grove, orchard, yard, nursery
stock trees of any kind, shrubs, plants or
fruit for the purpose of determining
whether the white ﬂy exists therein or
thereon, and if the same shall be found
infested, the commission shall notify the
owner, agent or person in charge, in writ-
ing that the same is infested, and shall
serve him with a copy of the said rules
and shall require him to treat the same
according to said rules beginning at a
speciﬁed time, which notice may be signed
by any member of the commission and
shall be served by any commissioner or by
any person appointed by the commis-
sion for that purpose in the manner di-
rected for the service of a writ of sum-
mons. The commission shall keep a
record of all such notices and of the name
of the person upon whom and by whom
and when the notice was served. If any
owner or agent of any vacant property
cannot be found in the county, the com-
mission may enter for the purpose herein-
after provided without such notice. If the
owner, agent or person in charge neglects
or refuses to comply with the notice for
one week after the expiration of the time
named therein, the commission or any
commissioner may enter the property de~
scribed in the notice and proceed to make
treatment at actual cost for the white ﬂy
according to the commission’s published
rules. In such case the commission shall,
when the treatment at that time is com-
pleted, render to the owner, agent or per-
son in charge an itemized bill of the actual
cost of the treatment aforesaid, including
the necessary per diem of one commis-
sioner and a statement of the time when
the said bill will be presented to the Board
of County Commissioners. At the speci-
ﬁed time a duplicate of the bill veriﬁed by
afﬁdavit of at least one of the horticultural
commissioners shall be presented to the
Board of County Commissioners, and
upon a hearing the Board of County Com-
missioners shall allow the said bill or such
part of it as shall appear to them to be
proper and just, and if the said bill be not
paid by the owner, agent or person in
charge, it shall be paid out of the general
revenue fund of the county, and such pay—
ment by the county shall be a lien upon the
property treated, and notice of such lien
shall be ﬁled and recorded in the ofﬁce of
the clerk of the Circuit Court of Orange
county within sixty days after the warrant
for the payment aforesaid has been drawn
in like manner as notices of lien of me-
chanics and material men are ﬁled. Such
lien may be foreclosed in chancery, but no
bill for foreclosure shallbe ﬁled until one
year has elapsed from the recording of the
lien.
SEC. 5. The Board of County Commis-
sioners shall purchase the necessary ap-v

paratus and materials for making the
treatment and carrying out the rules afore-
said, and upon the request of any owner,
agent or person in charge of any infested
place as aforesaid, shall treat same as
aforesaid at actual cost: Provided, That
the cost, if required, be ﬁrst paid or se-
cured. Whenever the horticultural com-
mission shall report to the board that any
wild or uncultivated land is infested with
the white ﬂy, the said board may order the
same treated at the expense of the county.
SEC. 6. The members of the horticul-
tural commission shall be paid $2.50 for
each day they are actually engaged in the
discharge of the work of the commission,
and this compensation shall be paid by the
Board of County Commissioners out of
the general revenue fund: Provided, That
the per diem of one commissioner shall be
included as part of the amount for which
any lien is ﬁled. The Board of County
Commissioners is hereby authorized and
directed to pay such sums as may be neces-
sary out of the general revenue fund to
carry out the provisions of this act.
SEC. 7, The horticultural commission
shall make full quarterly reports to the
Board of County Commissioners showing
what work, if any, has been done, and the
character and kind of insect pests found
and the remedies applied and the result of
such remedies. In case any San Jose scale
is found within the county the proceedings
shall be the same as hereinbefore provided
for the white ﬂy, except that only one
board of horticultural commissioners shall
at any one time exist in Orange county.
If the Board of County Commissioners
should at any time abolish the horticul-
tural commission as hereinbefore provided,
and a new petition as prescribed by Section
I shall be presented, the Board of County
Commissioners may appoint another hor-
ticultural commission, if it thinks proper
so to do.
SEC. 8. This act shall take effect imme-
diately upon its approval by the Governor.
Approved May 27, 1905.

CATALOGUE OF FRUITS.
ADOPTED BY THE SOCIETY AT THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL
MEETING.
In making a complete Catalogue of the Fruits of Florida, indicating intelligi-
bly, in summarized and tabular form, the relative value of varieties for different
sections, the wide-stretching territory, diversity of soil and climate, and the lim-
ited range of each of the numerous fruits, render it essential that the State be divid-
ed, so that regions allied throughout in their adaptability to fruits may be desig-
nated and referrred to. _
To this end, four districts have been formed, as described below. Geographi-
cal lines cannot be made to indicate pomological conditions with accuracy. More
than approximate correctness could not be expected from an arbitrary division of
this kind, especially where local conditions vary so greatly as in Florida. Work-
ing by general averages, some sections are unavoidably left in the wrong districts,
judging by the standard of local conditions. The divisions, however, will be
found to answer their purpose better, than any that could be made without fur-
ther sub-divisions, which would be impracticable. ,
WESTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State west of the Au-
eilla river.
EASTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State between the Au-
eilla river and a straight line drawn across the State from the mouth of the St.
Johns river to Cedar Keys.
CENTRAL FLORIDA—That part of the State between the line above re—
ferred to and the counties constituting South Florida.
SOUTH FLORIDA—The counties of Brevard, Dade, Monroe, Lee, De-
Soto and Manatee.

CITRUS FRUITS.
SWEET ORA HG ES—Citrus aurantium.

Norm—The development of orange culture in this State has given rise to a multiplicity of
varieties. man of which, while meritorious, have no distinctive qualities. or superiority. as compared
with others. It has been deemed advisable to omit the names of many varieties which have disap-
peared from cultivation. The list, however, is still large.
The names in heavy type are designed to constitute a complete list for the State. embracing
varieties of the highest excellence in all the desired characteristics of season, quality. distinctiveness,
productiveness. etc The names in light type are those whose characteristics are possessed in an
equal or superior degree by other varieties which appear in heavy type. Some varieties in light type
equal others in heavy type having the same characteristics but where there is a. difference it is in
favor of the varieties in heavy type. In cases of equal excellence, the best known has the preference.'
Sothat the varieties in heavy type, as a whole, and without disparagement to other excellent sorts,
may be said to embrace the leading kinds for general culture
New. or comparatively unknown varieties also appear in light type; but for this distinction see
"Adaptability" column.

Norm—In referring to the time of ripeningv in the column headed "Season", “very early" ap-
plies to varieties marketed in September and October; “earl ”. to October and November varieties;
“early medium", November and December; "medium", ecember. January and February; “late
medium", February and March; "late". March and April; “very late". April, May and later.

Nona—The region of orange production proper extends southward from Central Florida.
overlapping the upper portion of Southern Florida. Therefore. under “Adaptability” below theva-
rietics have been starred for “Southern Florida"; here. however, the starring applies more particu-
larly to the upper portion of the district.

Tim NAVBL VAan'rms are much esteemed on account of the delicatetexture and superior
quallty of their fruit. They are usually shy bearers, although experience indicates that they are much
more proliﬁc upon "rough" lemon and trifoliata stock: than,as generally grown, upon orange stocks.

TKI Bacon VARIle are sweet, and therefore marketable, early in season, as indicated by
the abbreviations in the “Season” column. At this time their distinctive character is not apparent,
and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts. As the season advances, their ruby
tints develop, until-quite apparent on the exterior,and their qualitycontinues to improve until, at full
ripeness, they are equaled by few and surpassed by none. In locations sufficiently exempt from frost
t9_p,ermittheir being held on the trees until they reach perfection, they bring high prices and are
exceptional] y proﬁtable. '
OTHER leTras.—Excluding the Navels, Bloods and Satsuma, noted above, and without dis-
paragement to other sorts of equal merit, the following are suggested as a desirable list for general
planting, arranged in order of succession: Very Early, Boone, Sweet Seville; Early, Enter rise Seed-
less, Parson Brown; Early Medium, Nonpareil, Centennial; Medium, Pineapple, Jaffa, omosassa;
Late Medium. Majorca, Du Roi; Late, Bessie, Maltese Oval; Very Late, Hart
Varieties distinctly marked in their exterior appearance, like the Navels, Bloods, Du Roi, etc.,
are, other things being equal, most desirable for market. ,

0v SWEIT Omnwls. the leading fruit crop of theState, and great staple of the Central region,
over ﬁve million boxes were produced in the season of 1894-95.
Tax NAVEL Vanm'rms are much esteemed on account of the delicate texture and superior
quality of their fruit. They are usually shy bearers, although experience indicates that they are much
more proliﬁc upon "rough" lemon and trifoliata stocks than,as generally grown, upon orange stocks.

Tn! Bnoon erthn are sweet, and therefore marketable, early in season, as indicated by
the abbreviations in the “Season” column. At this time their distinctive character is not apparent,
and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts. As the season advances, their ruby
tints develop, until quite apparent on the exterior,s.nd their qualityoontlnues to improve until, at full
ripeness, they are equaled by few and surpassed by none. In locations suﬂlciently exempt from frost
toppermittheir being held on the trees until they reach perfection, they bring high prices and are
exceptionally proﬁtable. '
OTHER Vultures—Excluding the Navels, Bloods and Satsums, noted above, and without dis-
psrsgement to other sorts of' equal merit, the following are suggested as a desirable list for general
planting, arranged in order of succession: Very Early, Boone, Sweet Seville; Early, Enter rise Seed—
less, Parson Brown; Early Medium. Nonpsreil, Centennial; Medium, Pineapple, Jaﬂa, omosassn;
Late Medium. Majorca, Du Roi; Late, Bessie, Maltese Oval; Very Late, Hart
Varieties distinctly marked in their exterior appearance, like the Navels, Bloods, Du Roi, etc.,
are, other things being equal, most desirable for market.

TI Penman—Growing the Pomelo for market is a development of the past ﬁfteen or twenty
years; but large quantities of this fruit are now shipped from the State and its culture is rapidly ex
tending. It has proved popular in the general market and its culture is very proﬁtable. Its range of
adaptability is about the same as that of the orange. Most of the older trees were planted before

Rhianna—The Peach is successfully grown in localities throughout the ﬁreater part of
the State, and in some districts is extensively produced for shipment to orthern mar-
Kets. As a rule, for this purpose, only those varieties are grown which are marked “earl ” and
“very early” in the above table, and which come in before the general crop farther north. 0 this
there are some exceptions, notabl in Western North Florida, where some mid-season varieties, like
Elberta, are successfully grown or shipment.
While the list of peaches grown in the State embraces many varieties, the various sections,
covering a wide range of latitude and longitude,diﬂer to such an extent in soil,climate and conditions
of local environment, that the varieties adapted to a particular region are comparatively limited in
number. A ﬁrst and vital essential to successful peach production is the adaptability of variety to
llolcality; in general this is true of peaches to a greater extent than other fruits, and especially so in
orida. ‘
No. 21 is of peculiar shape, being elongated, with deep suture, and sharp recurved point. It is
very sweet as its name “Honey” indicates: This variety comes from China and is the progenitor of a
race of peaches well suited to the central and northern sections'of the State. No. 38, the Peen-to, is
also possessed of marked individual characteristics; its shape being ﬂat like a tomato. and unless
grown with fertilizers rich in phosphoric acid and potash is apt to he possessed of a bitter almond or
noyau ﬂavor. It comes from Southern China or Java and the varieties that have originated from it
have given us a sub-tropical race of peaches well adapted to Southern and Central Florida. It is safe
to say that nine-tenths of the commercial peach culture of peninsular Florida is conﬁned to the
varieties that have been originated from the above two introductions from the Orient. It should be
mentioned, however, that neither the varieties that have originated from the Honey or from the Pew-
to retain to such amarked extent the shape of the parent. Those that have originated from the Honey
show a tendency to the recurved point but in a less marked degree. Those that have originated from
the Peen-to are of regular peach shape. ‘

Reruns—2, 9, 11, almost tree from iungous diseases: 1, 8, 4, 5, 10; 13, subject to fungous dis-
eases in wet seasons; 7, 12, 14, subject to fungous diseases: 7, stars apply especially to the East Coast.
Ghana's—In many locations throughout the State varieties (as indicated by the starring above)
succeed well, and are grown for shipment to Northern markets as well as for local consumption and
the manufacture of wine.
Fon Marmara—Delaware, Niagara, and lves (only) have proved a success as shipping grapes for
distant markets (when properly packed). Diamond, on account of its compactness and tendency to
crack, does not stand long shipment.
Fon Ran an.—Cynthiana, Norton and Ives are the red-wine grapes of Florida, as they are
the red-wine grapes of the United States. Especially is this true of the ﬁrst two named; their juice is
dark and rich in saccharine matter, and the wine made from these two grapes is said to possess great
medicinal properties, owing to its large percentage of tannin.
F01! Wm]; Wm.—Elvira, Delaware and Niagara are, among the varieties above named, the
best grapes for white wine—especially dry wine. It is from Elvira that the famous San Luis Sau-
ternes are made, which have established the reputation of Florida wines. Delaware is better adapted
to the manufacture of sweet wine, and from Niagara a good dr wine can be made—much superior to

grown. For market this delicious fruit has the merit of shipping Well and keeping long.
While new markets are often reluctant to take hold of it, wherever known it~sells well.
Nomenclature—While there has been much confusion in regard to the names of vari-
eties, the above kinds are now as well known as the leading varieties of other fruit; they
embrace the most valuable kinds, and the names as given are correctly applied.
Characteristics—Some of the varieties have dark ﬂesh, others light ﬂesh, still others
a mixture of the two. The light and dark ﬂesh differ radically in texture and consistency
as well as appearance, and when found in the same fruit are never blended, but always dis-
tinct. The dark ﬂesh is never astringent; the light ﬂesh is astringent until it softens. The
dark-ﬂeshed fruit is crisp and meaty, like an apple, and ls edible before it matures. Some
of the entirely dark-ﬂeshed kinds improve as they soften, like Hyakume and Yeddolchi; oth-
ers are best when still hard, like Zengi and Tab ers No. 129. As they are good to eat before they
are ripe, it is not so important that the dark-ﬂeshed kinds be allowed to reach a certain
stage before being offered to consumers unfamiliar with the fruit. The light‘ﬂeshed kinds,
and those with mixed light and dark ﬂesh, are very delicious when they reach the custard-
like consistency of full ripeness. In some the stringency disappears as the fruit begins to
soften, as the Yemon, and in a less degree with Okame and Tanenashi; in others it persists
until the fruit is full ripe, as with Tsuru. The light-ﬂeshed kinds should not be otfered to con-
sumers unacqualnted with the fruit until in condition to be eaten. A person who has attempted
to eat one of them when green and “puckery” will not be quick to repeat the experiment.
Seeds accompany the dark ﬂesh. The light-ﬂeshed kinds are seedless. The kind with mixed
ﬂesh have seeds in proportion to the quantity of dark ﬂesh. Hyakume, Zengi and Hachiya
are usually overspread at the blossom end with penciling or net-work of dark lines, and this
sometimes occurs in other kinds. , -
Varieties.—Tanenashi, Okame, Yemon and Yeddoichi excel in quality, perhaps in the
order named. Okame (on account of the dliﬂculty of getting the fruits all in the same stage
of ripeness) and Hachiya are not as good shippers as the others; the latter is valued for its
immense size and showiness. Okame, on account of its long season, exquisite beauty, and
superior quality, is the best for home use and local market Zengi and Tabers No. 129 are val-
ued for their earllness, as are Tsuru and Costata for their lateness. Oostata is very distinct
and handsome in both tree and fruit. Hyakume is most generally grown of the dark-
ﬂeshed kinds. Tanenashi is, perhaps, most highly esteemedin the market
Stock—The Kaki should be grafted on the native persimmon, on which it is much
more satisfactory than upon its own or imported stocks.

Vanrs'rms.—The Baracoa is the ordinary Red Banana of commerce The Cavendish (M.
Cavendishii) is a dwarf species, also known as “Dwarf,” “Dwarf Jamaica," "Chinese."
Except the Orinoco, Hart's Choice has a more northern range than the other sorts. The Orinoco
matures further north than any other variety, it is an ordinary plantain (M. paradisaica sapientumi as
distinguished from the Banana or Sweet Plantain (of which Baracoa and Golden' are varieties); when
allowed to ripen on the plant, it is of good quality, and desirable for home use, in sections too far
north for other kinds.

Nuta.—The pecan has long been grown in the State in a small way; it ﬂourishes in many
localities and its culture is proﬁtable. In addition to the four varieties above listed, other
good varieties as yet only of local repute, will undoubtedly become prominent in the near
future. The Japan chestnut, ot comparativer recent introduction, has proved fairly well
adapted, but hardly worthy of extensive commercial culture. The Japan walnut, 01' still
more recent introduction, bears well and makes a remarkably handaome tree, but is not up
to the standard or the beat English walnuts in quality.
Extensive Cocoanut plantations are to be found on the southern coast. Little or no
attention has been paid to varieties.

Bananas—Since 1895 strawberry culture has been largely extended, especially on the Western
slope-of the peninsula. The Newnan has been allowed to degenerate and the fruit is now rather
small for shipment. The Hoffman does better on clay than on sandy lands and needs high fertilizing.
The Cloud is vigorous in North Florida and stands drouth well; proliﬁc early in the season. Not
liked so well in South Florida. Rising is very vigorous and proliﬁc. a ﬁrm berry and an ex-

PROCEEDINGS
OF THE
NINETEENTH ANNUAL MEETING
OF THE
Florida State Horticultural Society.
The Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the
Florida State Horticultural Society was
held in the Auditorium of the Windsor
Hotel commencing on the evening of
May Ist 1906.
Theopening meeting was unusually well
attended and the different addresses were
greatly appreciated by the audience. N or—
withstanding the weather during the
three days was intensely hot the sessions
were fairly well attended.
The latest introduction into the Society‘
was the “Question Box,” and it proved
quite interesting. as will be seen by the
printed questions and answers in this
report. This is a feature that the mem-
bers can take advantage of, even if they
are not in attendance, by sending their
questions to the president by mail. which
will be opened. and answered during the
sessions.
The Board of Trade delighted the
members with another one of its famous
musicales, rendered by the “Ladies
Friday Musicale." So very popular are
these musicales that the commodious hall
of the Board of Trade building was
packed to standing room.
There was a spirited contest when the
question of the next place of meeting
came up. between those who wanted to
come again to Jacksonville and those who
preferred to visit other parts of the State.
St. Petersburg was well represented. and
won the day. so that the Twentieth An-
nual Meeting will he held in the “Gem
City of the \\'est Coast."

Addresses of Welcome.
BY HON. D. U. FLETCHER.
Mr. Fletcher spoke extemporaneously
and rather rapidly, so we are only able to
give more than an outline of his happy
and well received address.
Among other things he said: A day or
two ago I received a letter from Secretary
Painter informing me that he had called
me up over the telephone and requested
me to perform tonight, that he had print-
ed the programs, putting my name on
them and enclosed one, hoping I would
be present. I told him that. under the
circumstances, I would be here although
the notice gave me no chance for any pre-
paration. I approve of the Secretary’s
way. however. He accomplishes what he
wants and in the easiest, most satisfactory
manner. He gets his speaker and the lat-
ter has no time to make excuses or get
nervous.
There is nothing the Horticultural So-
ciety could ask of me that I would not
make an effort to grant. \V e give you a
warm welcome. but the weather seems in-
clined to over-do the thing. It is un-
necessary for me to emphasize the
warmth of our greeting. and I assure
you that is equally true of its sincerity.
I would feel very much more at home
probably discussing some other subject
than Horticulture. If our friend Painter
should sell a lot of fertilizer and accept
a four months note in payment. which he
negotiated at the bank. and the parties re-
fused to pay on the ground the fertilizer
was not beneﬁcial. I could say whether or
not he would have it to pay; or if Mr.
Taber should send out nursery stock to
be paid for at a certain time. reserving the
title to the trees, I might answer as to
whether or not the purchaser could keep
the trees without paying the price as
agreed.
If this were an agricultural gathering
I would be much more at home. I have
had some experience raising nubbin corn
and bumble bee cotton- Nubbin corn
is that kind too poor to shuck. and
the cotton referred to is the kind
which a bumble bee can suck the
top blossom off while sitting on the
ground. You have heard of the Doc-
tor who had a patient with fever, and after
doing all he could for him. he gave him
some medicine at last that threw the pa-
tient into convulsions and when asked
why he did so. he stated that he had
treated him for days and days for fever
and he did not know how to cure the fever,
but he did know how to cure ﬁts and so
was giving him something to throw him
into ﬁts. If I could change this Conven—
tion into an Agricultural Convention
there are many things I could speak of
from experience.
Horticulture is a kind of high toned
agriculture. or the elite of agricultural
pursuits. I imagine this thing of stand-
ing on the shady side of an orange tree
and watching its beautiful leaves and en-
joying its odoriferous ﬂowers while culti-
vating it. following it as the sun moves

from one side to the other, is very much
better and more pleasant than chopping
cotton or plowing corn out in the open,
where the unobstructed rays of the sun
beat upon you, and no prospect pleases.
There can be few things more impor-
tant than this great industry you are de-
veloping and fostering. As we recall'in
1899. the value of the fruit products of
the United States was $1 31.000.000 and
the vegetable products. not including p0—
tatoes was $131,000,000, and we exported
over $9,000,000 worth during that year.
The life of the Horticulturist is one of
the most joyous and free allotted to man.
If we did not have any freezes. or if we
could avoid the consequences of them;
or if we were not troubled with foot rot,
and if the white ﬂy would leave us alone.
and if it rained when it should and ceased
when it ought. and if we had satisfactory
transportation. and if we could hit the
market right, and if we were given proper
treatment by consignees, and if a few
other things happened, or didn’t happen,
your meetings would partake more of the
nature of an annual celebration and you
would be touring the country in automo-
biles. _ '
Now, this is the reason you are here;
the purpose of this organization is to sur-
mount the obstacles of this little .word.
“if.” There can be no better or higher
purpose of any organization- To solve
the questions how to preserve for the
human race the necessary food products is
a work worthy the brightest minds. the
greatest skill. the most persistent industry.
It demands the highest and best activities
of the most gifted men and women. It
calls for the exercise of judgment. It
proceeds upon investigation and study.
It must have the knowledge born of ex-
perience.
We read of the great scientists and
statesmen who have won distinction and
whose names will be known as long as we
have history. but I would ask you wheth—
er Copernicus. Gallileo, Michael Angelo,
or Isaac Newton accomplished more for
the world than the men who have made,
developed. and placed on our tables our
fruits, ﬂowers and vegetables in their
perfection. Of these great scientists who
have won distinction, is there any one
more entitled to fame than the man who
introduced and developed the potato, ap-
ple. peach. rose. or made the white black-
berry and the spineless cactus. Is there one
more entitled to fame or to whom man-
kind is more indebted than to Luther
Burbank, the American naturalist?
Our Legislature meets every two years'
and passes laws affecting the welfare of
the people of this State; there is no more
important matter which can command the
attention of our law makers and oFﬁcials
than the requests of this Society. I can
conceive that you might be aided in your
eﬁ‘orts by legislation along certain lines
and surely there will be found patriotism
and public spirit suﬁicient to give a hearty
response to your appeal and a generous
support to your work. There is no more
important organization in this State than
yours. and your work for the industrial
development of Florida and for the
material welfare of her people should
meet with every encouragment from
every quarter. ’
It is a great pleasure to welcome you
here—peculiarly wholesome and joyous
and an honor to come in touch with the
noble men and women from all portions
of the State. who live nearest the fountain
of life in the Divine Economy!
Jacksonville recognizes that whatever
makes for the prosperity of any portion

of the State is a thing to be desired. She
has no prejudices—she reaches out to all
sections and would promote the good of
each. She loves all the people of the
whole State and would have them pros—
per and their various undertakings and
enterprises succeed. In this spirit she
wishes your meeting here may be proﬁt~
able, and again bids you welcome.

ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.

BY CAPT. C. E. GARNER.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In behalf of the Board of Trade and
representing the business interests of our
city, it is again my pleasure to extend to
you Mr. President, the ofﬁcers, and to
every member of the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society, a most hearty and sin-
cere welcome.
I had in mind telling you a great many
things. I had conceived of a magniﬁcent
oration, expressing my personal senti-
ments of the Horticultural Society, of its
splendid work in behalf of our beloved
State, and I also had in mind telling you
something of the progress and prosperity
of our city; but, to use the yachting
phrase, “my little craft has had the wind
taken out of its sails” by the eloquence of
the gentleman who has just preceded me.
If any one in this audience thinks they
can follow the Hon. D. U. Fletcher along
the same lines, and especially in the mat-
ter of delivering an address of welcome,
and say anything original, or anything
appropriate to the occasion which has not
already been said, I would like for him
to step up on this platform and take my
place because I feel utterly unable to con-
ceive of anything that is appropriate that
would not be a reiteration of what had
been stated.
I wish, therefore, to simply express my
high appreciation not only of the Horti—
cultural Society as an organization but of
the Horticulturists of the State of Florida.
Probably no man within the bounds of
the State has been brought in closer con-
tact with them than myself. It is not an
acquaintance of a few days or a few years
but for a quarter of a century I have
known them, and know them intimately,
and I wish on this occasion to say that
they are in my judgment the bravest.
most heroic class of people in this country.
I know of their struggles, I have seen
them under all circumstances, of pros-
perity and adversity, chieﬂy the latter.
and if you wish to measure the heroism
of people you must be acquainted with
them under all conditions. and I know of
no people who have withstood adversit}
with a braver spirit than have the Horti-
culturists of this State.
You talk about the rebuilding of your
city, the rebuilding of Baltimore, the re-
habilitation of San Francisco from the ter-
rible disaster that has just befallen that
fair city, I have in mind the struggles of
your horticulturists against all sorts of
unfavorable conditions and disasters.
They have been attacked by the white fly.
that threatened their industry; the red

ant, foot-rot, blight, drought, and in some
instances too much moisture. They have
seen the result of the labor of years level—
ed to the ground and have surmounted all
these and have never appealed, received
aid, nor had any insurance, but have gone
bravely to work replanting, and today it
can be truthfully said that never in the
history of the State have the horticul-
tural interests been in as good condition.
I am reminded of an old friend of mine
who came to Florida in the early eighties,
bought a piece of land on the banks of
the St. Johns River, planted a grove and
expected it to support him the balance of
his days without any further effort on his
part. He used to conﬁde his troubles in
me, and he was of an optimistic turn of
mind. If his crop was a partial failure
he would say “Well, that is not altogether
bad because I will get better prices.”
When he lost the entire crop he said,
“\Vell, it is not altogether bad because
I can bud better varieties in the stumps.
I am learning every day.” Said he was
going to protect his grove against frost in
the future. There was never any disaster
so great but in his mind it might have
been worse. He was really typical of the
average horticulturists of Florida as I
have observed them, and he reminds me
somewhat of a story that I heard about
a man who went out West and engaged
in the growing of stock. After being
away about ten years he came back and
one day walked into the store of an old
friend who said “Well, John, where have
you been ?” John replied “out \Nest.”
“How have you been getting along?”
“Well,” he said, “not so very good and
not so very bad.”
“What have you been doing,’
the friend.
“I went into the sheep business”
“Well,” said the friend, “that is good.”
“Well,” said John, “not so very good-
because the sheep all died.”
His friend said, “Well that is bad.”
“Not so very bad,” said John, “because
a rich widow sympathized with me in my
misfortune and I married her.”
“Well,” his friend said, “that’s good."
John said, “Well, 'not so. very good be—
cause she was a regular virago and had- a
terrible temper.”
“Well,” his friend said, “that’s bad.”
“Well,” said John, “not very bad be-
cause she built a great big ﬁne house.”
The friend remarked, “Well, that cer—
tainly was good.”
“No,” said John, “not so very good
because the house burned down.”
The friend said, “Well,” that certainly
was bad.”
“No,” said John, “that was not so very
bad because the woman was consumed
with the house.”
So it is with my friend. He says now
that he sees a great many good things
that have grown out of the freeze. He
had diversiﬁed his crops; is more prosper-
ous possibly than if the freeze had not
occurred. and he and the other horticul-
turists of the State, who are a people that
adversity cannot overcome, and that no
amount of prosperity can spoil, are en—
titled to all the success that should come
to intelligence, industry, perseverance, and
courage.

Response to Addresses of Welcome.
BY G. L. TABER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In a Society like ours there are some-
times pleasant duties to perform and
the task you have assigned me, of re-
plying to these generous words of wel-
come, is amongst these pleasant ones.
During our annual meeting some of our
members are called upon to speak on cer-
tain well deﬁned subjects, assigned them
in advance that have to do with the dif-
ferent phases of Horticulture; and while
these duties, never considered onerous, are
generally cheerfully complied with, the
members who make these Committee Re-
ports, as well as others that follow in dis-
cussion, are supposed to conﬁne them-
selves, rather closely, to the subject in
hand. In my case, however, Mr. Presi-
dent, it is different, for custom has de-
creed, wisely or unwisely, that more than
the three words “We thank you” is ex-
pected of him who makes response to an
Address of Welcome; and this, notwith-
standing all the heart-felt sincerity with
which those words can be imbued, or the
emphasis with which they can be spoken.
And now, Mr. President, having deﬁn-
ed my independent position, permitted to
touch on few or many things, and these in
a light or serious vein as my fancy dictat-
es—I wish to tell a story. My story ori-
ginated in a State some distance remov-
ed from Florida, namely, North Dakota.
An automobilist traveling through that
untropical country found himself with a
disabled machine and without proper
tools to repair it.
He called at a near by farm house and
asked the owner, a Swede. for a monkey
wrench. The Swede replied that he had
none. “Do you know of anyone in the
vicinity who has a monkey wrench”? ask-
ed the traveler. “Nay” replied the
Swede, “may bradder, ’bout eigh miles
from hayer ban got cattle ranch, may
bradder-law, Ole Olson, ’bout sex miles.
ban got shape ranch; but Nort’ Dakota
too blame cauld for anybody keep monkey
ranch." Now Mr. President notwith-
standing the more favorable climatic con-
ditions that exists here. I have never
heard of a monkey ranch in Florida, and,
even if there were, I take it that you
would rule its discussion out of order un-
less introduced in some Horticultural con-
nection, such as “Anima(la)ted Lad-
ders,” “monkeys as orange pickers” or
“The horticultural possibilities of our
friend and one time relative. the mon-
key.” Mr. President upon mature consid-
eration I am convinced that even under
any such horticultural disguises as those
mentioned. further consideration of the
subject would be bootless. I therefore re-
quest you that all future allusion to the
subject be barred and particularly that no
monkey business be allowed to enter the
question box—which will be opened later.
Mr. President, there is one danger that
always besets a man who is tempted to
make humourous remarks and that is that
having made them (provided always that
his hearers interpret them as such) h¢
ﬁnds it rather hard work to get back on

to serious ground; or at least to convince
his audience that the lighter vein has been
abandoned. I wish to assure you, how-
ever, that the remaining words I have to
say are strictly and sincerely serious-
Eighteen years ago the Florida State
Horticultural Society was organized at
Ocala. By aycoincidence the ﬁgures eigh~
teen also represent the number of our
charter members. Of these just one-half
have since passed into the Great Beyond.
Of the remainder some have removed
from the State. others are incapacitated
by sickness, and a survey of this audience
fails to reveal the presence at this meet-
ing of a single conferee who assisted me
at the birthv of this Society. Looked at
from the standpoint of losses of illustrious
members, both of those who were with us
at the beginning and others who joined
afterwards, retrospection carries with it
so much of sadness that I hasten to turn
to the brighter side. That lthere is a
brighter side is plainly evinced by the fact
that notwithstanding our heavy losses by
death and otherwise our last annual re-
port showed a membership of 5 19. While
the majority of these are located in the
State, yet a review of the addresses shows
that in addition to Florida, seventeen Stat—
es and nine foreign countries are repre-
sented in our membership,_as follows:
States: Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Texas and Vermont.
Foreign Countries: Australia, Asia,
Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Mexico, New
Zealand, Porto Rico and South Africa.
Now, Mr. President. it is not my pur-
pose to go into detail of what this So-
ciety has accomplished. Our comprehen-
sive annual reports, published for many
consecutive years past, contain full re-
cords of our, ei'fogts and our accomplish-
ments. But I make the broad assertion
that no other State Horticultural Society
in America has done more toward further-
ing the horticultural progress of a State
and that none other can show such an in-
terest in its work as evinced by a world—
wide membership. I wish also, Mr. Pres-
ident, to call the attention of these gentle-
men, who have so kindly welcomed us. to
the fact that what we have accomplished
we have done within ourselves, without
outside help. The only exception to this
statement is that a dozen years ago, for
two years in succession, 1893 and 1894.
our proceedings were published by the
State Department of Agriculture. through
Hon. L. B. Wombwell, Commissioner.
While many State Societies have looked
to liberal legislatures to assist thermin
their eitorts toward upbuilding the Hor-
ticultural interest of their States, we have
looked only to our own membership;
whatever assistance has been necessary
has, with the exception already cited,
come from within our ranks.
Now, Mr. President, I believe this is
all wrong. The fault may have been with
ourselves in not having sufiiciently appre-
ciated or urged our claims, but I believe
the time has come when we should ask.
and should receive, from the Florida Leg-
islature appropriations which shall in
some measure relieve the, approximately,
ﬁve hundred members of this Society
from carrying on at their own expense a
work that is of so much beneﬁt to every
one of the more than 500,000 people that
comprise our population. For, Mr. Pre-
ident, it is so true as to be axiomatic that
back of the lasting commercial prosperity
of a country stands the producer, the one
who evolves from Mother Earth her ﬁn-

ished products; and just to the extent that
he can throw safeguards around these
productions, increase their quantity and
improve their quality, just to that extent
is the commercial prosperity of that Coun-
try conﬁrmed and enchanced.
I hold in my hand, Mr. President, a
copy of the “Transactions of the Florida
State Horticultural Society for 1905”—a
fair sample of many that have preceded it.
We have been issuing them annually ever
since I892. This copy of our transac-
tions covers 132 pages of revised Horti-
cultural advice obtained from experience
-—and' experience that has to do with
Florida conditions. It contains more
than that. It contains 22 additional pages
of catalogue, in which all the different
fruits that are grown in Florida are listed
in such a way as to give the comparative
vallie of each variety to any given sec-
tion of the State; whether it be Western
North Florida, Eastern North Florida,
Central Florida, or South Florida. The
work entailed in getting out this annual
edition in the creditable manner in which
it is presented is unknowable except to
someone who has had experience in this
direction.
The price of the book, which also in-
cludes membership in the Society is $1.00.
If we have 500 annual, and say ten new
life members (life memberships are $10.-
00) our income for the year would be
$600.00, out of which we have to pay for
stenography, secretary’s salary, printing of
the book. stationery, stamps and all minor
expenses. The secretary’s salary has in
time past been, of necessity, so absurdly
small, as compared with the work, that it
has been repeatedly turned back into ".he
Treasury by past secretaries, as a gift.
Not that we want or expect the secretary
to do this; on the contrary we want suf-
ﬁcient funds provided from the source
from which it should be provided. the
State, to enable us to meet proper ex-
penses in a manner that shall comport
with our own dignity and that of the
great Commonwealth we are trying to
serve.
Mr. President, I think that you will par-
don me if I say that I have had an almost.
or quite, unequalled opportunity to know
the amount of work performed by this So—
ciety. This from the double fact that l
have been a member from the beginning.
and that, since then, I have ﬁlled every
ofﬁce but one that it was in the society’s
power to confer. I was its ﬁrst Sec-
retary, then, successively, Vice-Presi-
dent, President, and now, a member of
the Executive Committee. I have never
yet been elected Treasurer, and know but
one reason—or possibly two—why I have
been overlooked in this connection. The
ﬁrst is that the handling of the society’s
funds is too easy a job, and the second
—but perhaps I had better not allude to
the second one.
Mr. President, our work has to do with
the aiding, up-building and uplifting 0f
Horticultural pursuits throughout our
State. It is gratifying to know that we.
as a society, are held in esteem both at
home and abroad; and it is doubly grati-
fying to know that in this city of Jack-
sonville. where so many pleasant meetings
have been held in the past, we are still re
ceived with open arms. To you gentle-
men who in behalf of the City and the
City’s Board of Trade, have so cordially
welcomed us, we feel profoundly grateful
and again say with heart-felt sincerity
and with emphasis, we thank you.

President’s Annual Address.
BY C. T. MC CARTY.
Members of the Florida State H articul-
tural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen:
This audience will forgive me while
I indulge in some retrospection. It is
worth while sometimes to lift the veil of
the pastand behold the achievements of
the then actors. That picture reveals to
us lessons which suggest progress, hope
and advancement. At the outset of this
address, it is well for me to take my bear—
ings and to see what is the duty I have as-
signed myself. To see and to study the
standards that have been set for me in
the similar efforts of the past; to study
the men and the times that have produced
the annual addresses of the past eighteen
years.
Our Society came forth almost full-
ﬂedged from its birth. In response to
the demands of the times, it immediately
took its place among the great Horticult-
ural Societies of the age. Fortunately,
it had as its ﬁrst president, one of those
rugged, fearless and intrepid characters
' that were transplanted, decades ago, from
the great prairies of the Northwest to the
tropical and subtropical conditions of our
state. With the accumulated wisdom and
experience of a life-time, he led the van
in the early years of the society’s history
and led them with unvarying satisfaction
and success. In its ﬁrst decade it had be-
come so prominent that it received and
entertained with. success some of the fore-
most scientists of this and other lands.
The energy and persistence, the skill and
faith, the merit and the accomplishment
of its ﬁrst president, Dudley W. Adams,
are now matters of history. After all it
is acts not words, that count in the life
impression one leaves upon his age and
generation. Judge by this standard what
a splendid life was his. It is my duty as
well as my pleasure, to put on record the
high appreciation this society feels today
for its ﬁrst president after he has for well
nigh a decade, felt upon his face the
breath of the Eternal morning.
Good foundations, like good principles
and good practices, never fail to bequeath
to subsequent generations their manifold
blessings.
In studying the history of our Society
during this period of eighteen years, I
ﬁnd impressed upon this latter half, the
large-heartedI good-natured, genial per-
sonality and natural ability of its last pres—
ident, George L Taber.
How fortunate our Society was when
called upon to bear a sudden vacancy in
its Chief Executive, that one so able, so
thoroughly equipped for its duties, so
willing to bear and forbear, should be
ready trained at hand. The annual ad-
dresses of President Taber always con-
tained a message of importance to the So-
ciety. In times of progress and prosperi-
ty it brought congratulations and good-
cheer. In times of adversity, it brought
hope, courage and manhood, and faith
in skill and science to overcome difﬁcul-
ties or adverse climatic conditions. His

cheery tones were ever on the side of 0p-
timism, were ever turning towards the
bright side of the picture of horticultural
struggle and endeavor in this state, were
ever pointing to new means of combatting
the elements, of overcoming the natural
enemies of our chosen industries and
bolstering up those of less faith and cour-
age. Through all these annual addresses
runs the constant tone of enlargement
and improvement, constantlv increasing
in power, thought and literary ﬁnish,
his last annual address became a ﬁtting
climax to the long series of addresses with
which he has enriched the literature of
our Society. I can well imagine his feel-
ings when preparing his “Message from
the Woods.” Like that felt by Bryant
when he wrote his Thanatopsis, when he
gave to his age, in poetry, his conception
of -a proper appreciation of nature and
natural surroundings. Like him feels
John Burroughs, the nature lover, the
poet and admirer of the brook, the ﬁeld,
the orchard and the forest. How much
of beauty and poetic feeling and love of
nature and nature’s God are embodied
in the president’s last annual address~ on-
ly future generations shall fully appreci-
ate.
Of retrospection this is sufﬁcient. The
past at least is secure. Our Society hav-
ing passed safely the rapids of its up-
per course and glided successfully along
into its middle course, now moves for-
ward in the direction of its lower and
broader course. It has met the questions
of the past. It has accumulated wisdom
by experience. It should be, and doubt-
less it is today, well equipped to meet the
questions of the present, to maintain the
reputation of the past and to lay broad
and deep foundations for the achieve-
ments of the future. The problems of to-
day are not more difficult than in the
past, but they are more complex and di-
verse. There are in them a greater num-
ber of factors even if each factor is of
less vitality. What message does the pres-
ent bring to us?
\V hat duty do we owe the today? \Vhat
accomplishments can the tomorrow claim
logically founded upon today? Are there
messages that the horticultural conditions
of the state at this moment require bring-
ing to your attention? Fortunately we
stand in the presence of no calamity. We
do not surround, as we have sometimes
done in the past, those conditions that
buried the hopes of thousands of our peo-
ple. But even those clouds had their
silver lining, unseen then, but plainly vis-
ible now. We are in the midst of pros-
perity long continued and pronounced.
Our industries have been enlarged both
in number and in volume. Our output
is greatly increased in every department
of horticulture. Our sources of know-
ledge, our ability to handle the drawbacks
the pests and the evils of our diversiﬁed
industries have been largely increased.
What then is there to consider? It fre-
quently happens that the most danger-
ous periods are those of greatest prosperi-
ty. It has been well said that, “Security
is mortal’s chiefest enemy.”
In the line of thought I shall take to-
night, I may be straying from the beaten
path, may be leading the way into battle
ﬁelds where the valiant, the sagacious
and the steadfast of purpose alone can be
found at the front. The commercial bat-
tles of the present dwarf into insigniﬁ-
cance the battles with insects, with cli-
matic conditions, with all our other 0b—
stacles combined. The struggle for new
markets, for cheaper production, for fair-
er treatment by our agents in the markets.

for fair rates and rapid transit, do not
these demand our attention and challenge
the best brains among us? Of what avail
is it that we devote our time and capital
to the problems of production if the other
and more complex problems of economy,
distribution, transportation, receive not
their proper attention? These things are
as much a part of our legitimate business
as the cultivation of the soil, the ferti-
lizer we shall use or the various matters
of every day occurrence. What man is
there before me who has not felt like this?
The season has been a good one, I have
fertilized judiciously and wisely, I have
cultivated, I have sprayed, I have spared
no pains to produce a ﬁne crop. How
shall I market it to the best advantage?
Have you not realized that you were then
confronted with harder conditions than
those of production and ones less within
your control or management?
The original scope of our Society be-
ing much narrower than its present one
curtailed the range of topics considered
at our meetings to a very narrow margin.
The original thought of the founders of
this Society was to make it apply almost
exclusively .to orange growing, to citrus
fruits and their allied subjects. As the
years have come and gone its scope has
been widened so that it now covers, not
only semi-tropical, but also tropical fruits,
vegetables and many of the fruits of the
temperate zone. This enlargement of its
sphere has injected into it new relations
and new problems for annual considera-
tion. Let us brieﬂy discuss a few of the
important items worthy of thought. This
is an age of organization, co—operation
and consolidation. It is not sufﬁcient that
the horticulturist of today knows how to
produce the fruits and the products of
the soil but that he knows as well how to
successfully transport, distribute and mar-
ket them. Perhaps the largest ﬁeld for
present and future investigation is the One
covering the problem of marketing. This
problem involves the element of business
experience and study of the relations of
the cost of production and transportation
to the market value of our products; the
study of the laws of Supply and demand
as applied to each particular product; a
study of the value of organization in the
securing of reasonable and satisfactOry
rates of transportation; of the proper
commissions to be paid our selling agents;
and the proper distribution of the crop
so as to prevent surplus in one portion of
the country and deﬁciency in another.
Were there no such thing as organized ef-
fort among those whose ﬁnancial interests
are opposed to ours there should be no
necessity for organization on our part.
The value of farmers and fruit growers’
organizations is in direct proportion to the
tenacity with which they adhere to them
and the vigor with which they enforce
the principles involved. I do not deem
it necessary to go into arguments sup-
porting the needs for compactly united
organizations in each of our principal in-
dustries. The need for organization must
be apparent to all. For greatest efﬁciency
consolidation of all for the handling of
problems common to all is only common
sense. Questions like transportation, tar-
iffs for protection, rates of commission
and kindred broad matters can only be
handled powerfully and conclusivelyv in
the hands of one central organization. The
methods and direction taken by each. in-
terest must be dictated by themselves.
It can do no harm to crystallize among
them, into some deﬁnite form the best
ideas of the most intelligent and-ener—
getic of the growers, nor need it be be-

‘lieved that the only value in horticultural
organization is that of the maintenance
of the price or cheapening the cost of the
production and the proper regulation of
‘the matter of transportation. In numer-
ous other ways organized effort is super-
ior 'to individual effort. The tendency of
the times is to the enlarged costs of the
'material used for the packing and pack-
age purposes, the costs of living and in-
deed, increased cost in everything that
the horticulturist purchases. The only
fair method of safeguarding the growers
and producers’ interests is to see that in-
creased revenue accrues to him suﬁicient-
'ly ‘to meet the increased cost of produc-
tion as well as the cost of living and the
necessaries and luxuries of life.
Concurrent with this comes the thought
of the reduced cost of production by bet—
ter management, more intensive cultiva-
tion, decreased cost of fertilizing by tak-
ing advantage of cheaper sources of nitro-
gen and other kindred economies. All
of these are well and should never be for-
gotten. The opening up of new ﬁelds of
production have helped swell the volume
of material in our markets and should set
us to thinking of how to overcome this
new competition.
The solution of these problems will call
for the best thought, the best persistent
effort and the most constant watchful-
ness of the thoughtful classes in our
midst. Among the hopeful signs of the
present are the cordial relations existing
‘between the country and the city; between
the producer and the carrier; between the
producer and the consumer. In these bet-
ter understandings of each others’ rela-
tions we see the future solution of these
problems. So long as the different class-
es understand and appreciate each other,
realize their mutual inter-dependence on
each other, maintain their mutual respect
for each other, that long will harmony
and material prosperity exist. In passing,
it might be said that the accentuation of
the self-interests of the horticultural class-
es does not necessarily mean war upon or
antagonism of any other interest.
The recent report of the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture calls attenltion to
the enormous resources of American agri-
culture and horticulture. In comparison,
all other interests combined sink into in-
signiﬁcance. The sums are so stupendous
that we can scarcely realize their mag-
nitude. Of this grand total we are a con-
siderable part. It is just cause for con-
gratulation that the importance, vitality
and dignity of the horticultural classes is
being recognized.
Do our horticultural classes sufficient-
ly appreciate the value of and the necess-
ity for diversiﬁcation? Do we realize
the full meaning of living at home? Is
it not a fact that too great a proportion
of the income from our products goes for
that which. can and should be grown in
our own state and possibly in our own
neighborhood? We hear it discussed on
all hands, but have not acted on it vig-
orously. \IVhile this thought is trite, I
risk once more calling the attention of
our people to its vital importance.
I have felt strongly impelled at this
meeting to press upon your attention these
important matters. To give vent to the
thought that has been growing in my
mind for some years, that the most vital
and far-reaching questions now calling
for' solution by Florida producers were
not cultural questions but commercial
ones; not planting but marketing; not fer-
tilizing but transportation. Let us think
about these things, talk about them, study
them, conquer them. If this thought.

talk and study take not the form of action
then have we labored in vain.
During the past few months, I address-
ed a circular letter to every member of
the society, in which I asked for an ex-
pression of opinion on many matters of
importance, and asked for suggestions.
The replies have been numerous and my
reward ample for the trouble I took. Much
to enlighten and cheer the Society has
come to me. Encouragement for the fu-
ture, and splendid appreciation for the
past of the Society has breathed from
many of the much—valued letters received.
I desire to thank you, most sincerely for
these expressions of your better selves.
In the quiet of your homes, you have said
things that you would not say on the ﬂoor
of this house. You have my promise to
use the good suggestionsin so far as I
shall be able. These heart-to-heart let-
ters shall bear fruit.
Among the weighty subjects discussed
in those letters, was that of “State Aid”
in the printing of our annual reports. A
careful tabulation of the replies show
about an equal number favoring and op-
posing the acceptance of such aid. Among
those favoring, are some of our oldest and
most thoughtful and experienced mem-
bers. On the other side, can be found
those of equal experience and wisdom.
Some have cited other states in which
State Aid is supposed to be the cause of
their ruin as a society, while others point
out other states in which it has had the
opposite effect. The array of arguments
pro. and con. is formidable and shows
the ability and reasoning resources of our
members. It is not my province or wish
to discuss the question or to express an
opinion on it. If the matter comes up,
all the reasoning, on all its sides and phas-
es, will be developed and the society can
then pass upon it intelligently. \Nithout
taking the time to discuss them here, I
will say that many of the suggestions
made by members will be carried out
during the progress of the meeting, as
they shall ﬁt into our work.
\Ve are to be favored by a number of
eminent persons, with addresses and pap-
ers, during the progress of the meeting,
as a glance at the program will show.
Will these friends of the Society allow
me to express, if ever so feebly, our sin-
cere thanks for their kindness and our
high appreciation of their valued efforts.
But, what of the work? We have six
sessions before us, occupying two full
days. \Ve shall have seven formal ad-
dresses and papers. We shall listen to
the reports of sixteen committees, and
these reports will be ably and exhaustively
discussed. In the course of these discus-
sions will come out much of the real value
of our gathering. Don’t hesitate to stuff
our “Question Box.” Show me by your
patronage of this box that you appreciate
a chance 'to ask questions. Work, fast
and furious, is our portion for the next
few days. At the close of the meeting
may we feel that we never had a better
one. Amidst the friends of many years,
in the city of hustle and progress, with
words of welcome to inspire our efforts,
with the social feasts before us, our tasks
shall be light and their accomplishment
assured.

Nematode Diseases of Plants.
BY PROF. EARNEST A. BESSEY.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I wish to speak to you today about
nematodes. In the ﬁrst place, it may be
well to attempt to explain to you just what
a nematode is, although most of you are
familiar enough with the work of one of
them, the root-knot. Nematodes or ell-
worms as they are sometimes called, are
low animals, slender and worm-like, at
least when young. Like the true worms
they have no legs nor wings at any stage
of their development. They differ from
the latter in not being segmented and in
having no jaws. They consist essential—
ly of a tube-like skin lined with muscles;
inside this is another tube, the alimentary
canal. with various modiﬁcations along its
course to act as gizzard, stomach, etc.
Add a very simple nervous system and
you have nearly all the essential features
of a nematode. They should never be
confused with the segmented earth-worms
nor with the larvae of various insects,
also, but erroneously, called worms.
Many species of nematodes are par-
asitic in animals, as, for example, the
roundworm of the horse, the hookworm
and trichina of man; many others live
in various locations, both in the earth
or in fresh or salt water, on decaying or-
ganic matter, a wellknown example being
the harmless vinegar-eel; while still
others attack living plants. The latter are
entirely harmless to animal life. so that
we need not fear their presence on that
score. They are bad enough as it is, how-
ever.
With the exception of some that are
parasitic in higher animals, nematodes
are mostly minute. Those that attack
plants are rarely over one-eighth of an
inch in length, while some are many times
smaller. Were it not for their great num-
bers they would scarcely require serious
attention.
The principal disease of plants due to
nematodes, at least in this country, is root-
knot, in which the nematodes live within
the root, causing it to enlarge, forming
the characteristic knots. In addition to
this disease, other species of nematodes
cause abortion of the ﬂowers of grasses,
distortion of leaves and ﬂowers through
their presence within the stem, stunting
and malformation of plants through
nematodes living within the stern, killing
out of spots in leaves through nematodes
in the tissues at these points, and injured
canker—like spots on the roots. The lat-
ter are caused by nematodes attacking the
roots from the outside without entering
them.
The life history of the root-knot nema-
tode is in short as follows: The eggS,
which are about 1-300 inch long, hatch
into little larvea about I-IOO inch longv
and about 1-2000 inch thick. These pos—
sess at the anterior end, a stout spear.
Crawling around in the soil they ﬁnally
ﬁnd roots, perhaps not for weeks after

they are hatched. A larvae seeks out the
root tip and bores into it by means of
its spear, taking its place near the center,
parallel to the axis of the root, with the
anterior end directed away from the root
tip. The necessary nourishment is sucked
out of the surrounding .tissue through
the spear which is hollow. Growth is
rapid now, and soon the nematode begins
to increase in thickness more rapidly than
in length. The tip of the root continues
to grow. The tissue about the nematode
owing to some stimulus, due to its pres-
ence increases rapidly in amount, forming
a knot of soft watery cells. If but one
nematode has entered, the knot remains
small, usually, but often the infections
are not single and several to many nema-
todes come to lie close together or at short
intervals causing a large knot or a succes-
sion of smaller one to be formed. The
nematode’s increase in thickness contin-
ues until it is ﬂask-shaped. At this stage
the male and female begin to become dif-
ferentiated in shape; the former perform-
ing a moult and again becoming a slender
creature about 1—25 inch long and I-500
inch thick. The female, on the other
hand, continues to enlarge until she is as
thick as long, and only at the anterior
end shows any worm-like portion. At
this stage the egg laying begins, and con-
tinues until 400-506 eggs have been laid.
As these hatch they must bore their way
out of the root tissue into the soil, and
seek other roots or they simply ﬁnd con—
genial places to develop in the same knot
so that in one large knot can be found
nematodes of all stages of development.
The time required for the development
from the egg to the mature egg-laying
individual depends to a great extent upon
the temperature and upon the plant affect-
ed, being more rapid in warm weather.
It probably never is less than four weeks,
and sometimes requires eight weeks.
The injury to the plant is of two kinds,
direct and indirect. As direct injury may
be considered that due to the reduction or
stoppage of the passage from the roots
of water and dissolved mineral food—
stuffs, due to the tangling and interrup-
tion of the water conducting vessels in
the knotted roots, also the injury to the
plant due to the diversion of food-stuffs
to build up the tissue of the knot instead
of building up the rest of the plant.
Then direct injuries, although undoubt-
edly harmful. rarely cause the death of
the affected plants. The indirect injuries
are due to the fact that the soft abnormal
tissue of the knot is attacked by various
organisms of both fungous and animal
nature, causing decay to set in which may
involve the whole root system and thereby
kill the plant. Many fungi ﬁnd easy en-
trance in this way. So, for example, the
fungus causing wilt of cotton attacks
plants suffering with root-knot much
more vigorously and destructively than
those that are not so infested.
Many plants are attacked so slightly
that the injury is very slight or not even
apparent. Such plants, however, owing
to the large number of eggs laid by a
single worm, serve the purpose of keeping
the soil well stocked with nematodes.
I have been making a list of all plants
on which I have seen- root-knot or on
which it has been reported to occur. This
list now contains about 300 species of
plants. including most of those commonly
cultivated. Among those that may be
seriously injured, may be mentioned the
following: ﬁg. peach, European grape.
roselle. banana, pawpaw, tomato, egg-
plant. rose. carnation, tuberose, violet,
jasmine. cowpea, soy-bean, cotton. and

most of the garden vegetables, especially
cucumber, squash, pumpkin, water and
muskmelon. On the other hand, the in-
jury has been but slight in those cases
where I have observed it on the follow-
ing: various grasses, as Bermuda, crow-
foot, fescue, orchard grass, German millet,
persimmon, sawbrier, wormseed, chufa,
bush-clover, etc. I have yet to see a case
of true root-knot on any of the citrus
trees, velvet-bean, Florida beggar-weed,
oats, rye, barley, sorgum, hog-millet, etc.
Many ideas have been advanced as to
how this pest should be combated but
many of them are based on experiments
made with the closely related sugarbeet
nematode of Germany. But little actual
experimental work has been done. One
method is that of soil sterilization, i. e.
freeing the soil of the noxious organism
by direct means. I shall mention various
suggested means of doing this.
Chemical Means—The most efﬁcient
of these is the use of carbon bisulphide in-
jected into the soil to a depth of several
inches at close intervals and allowed to
diffuse there throughout the soil- If
enough is used this is effective. It has
several serious objections; it is expensive,
so expensive in fact, that it would proba—
bly take several hundred dollars worth
to treat one acre, not to speak of the labor
of applying it. It is also poisonous to
roots. A large ﬁg tree will stand it some-
times, but the cheek to the growth is great.
It is highly inflammable. It does not
mix with water, and so cannot be used in
wet soil. Formalin in dilute solution is
equally effective if applied in sufﬁcient
quantity. However. to wet dry soil to
the depth of a foot would require about
ﬁve gallons of solution to a square yard
c0sting $150 to $200 per acre. My ex-
periments to determine whether a lesser
quantity will be suﬁicient are now under
way. This solution is also harmful to
vegetation, but if kept from the growing
part of the plant is not as injurious as
carbonbisulphide. Lime, gas—lime, gas
liquor, oils, etc., have been tried on the
sugar-beet nematode without effect. I
am now trying some of them on the root-
knot
Heat is the most efﬁcient means yet
found for killing out all kinds of pests.
including the root-knot nematode.
Thanks to Stone and Smith in Massachu~
setts, the problem has been settled as far
as nematodes in green-houses are con-
cerned. Steam is passed at high pressure
through tiles or perforated iron pipes run-
ning through the soil. This effectually
kills all animal and fungous parasites.
It seems doubtful whether that method
will ever become of use in the open, unless
it be for seed—beds or for truck farms
where the income is very high. It would
probably cost not less than $2,000 per
acre to establish such a ster‘lizing appara-
tus. The often recommend :d building of
large ﬁres upon the spot to be sterilized
is to be discouraged. for the injury to the
soil is too great.
Freezing, formerly supposed to be fatal
to the root-knot nematode, is considered
so by me no longer since I obtained
authentic record of peonv plants going
through a winter temperature of 35 de—
grees below zero without even a mulch
protection and showing root-knot again
that summer. That was not in Florida
In Java where the dry season is well
marked and is really dry, it has been
found possible to exterminate the root-
knot nematode by drying out the soil.
This is done by keeping it in ﬁne tilth
during the whole dry season by means
of repeated plowings, and harrowings.


## p. 29 (#207) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 29
Strange to say, the root-knot nematode is
easily killed by drying out, although many
of its close relatives are dried without
injury, and can remain alive for years
in that condition, reviving again upon
being moistened up. Paradoxical as it
may seem, moisture will also kill the root—
knot nematode. It has often been found
that wet lands are free from nematode
injury while dryer lands adjacent suffered
badly. In one case I learned of some
very badly infected land flooded by a
spring freshet for several days. Always
thereafter it bore crops showing no sign
of root-knot. In Java this method had
also been tried and found to be successful.
The land must be submerged at least ﬁve
to eight days.
Besides these direct means for freeing
the soil of nematodes several indirect ones
have been suggested, and it is by some
of these that I believe our main salvation
can be attained. The ﬁrst to be mention-
ed is the starvation method: i. e. growing
nothing on the land that can serve as food
for the nematodes until all has perished.
How long this would require for the
root-knot nematode has not been determ-
ined; for its close relative, the sugar-beet
nematode, it is not under two years. To
keep the land entirely fallow this length
of time is, of course, not to be thought of,
but the same results can be attained by
cultivating only plants not attacked by
root-knot even in the slightest degree.
Hence comes the great importance of
numerous experiments to determine which
plants are and which are not susceptible.
Of those which so far I have found to be
free from root-knot. are crabgrass. the
small grains, velvet bean, Florida beggar-
weed and but few others. Such infor-
mation bearing on the subject as I can
obtain from you will be gratefully receiv-
ed. In view of the facts known the prac-
tise of many of allowing the land to grow
up thickly to crabgrass in the summer,
is one that ought to tend to keep the
root-knot nematode in check. If that
could be combined with the use of velvet
bean for a season or two, or if small
grains were sown as winter crops for
two years followed in the summer by vel-
vet beans it looks to me as if favorable
results should be obtained. I have such
experiments already under way.
Another method of combating the pest,
which promises very good results for cer-
tain annual crops, is‘that of breeding up
resistant races. Thus the Iron cowpea, if
obtained pure, is not attacked by root-
knot. Unfortunately, however, most of
that obtainable in the markets or even
some of that sent out from other sources,
contained some admixture of other va-
rieties vitiating the results. Mr. W. A.
Orton has demonstrated that this quality
of resistance is transmissable to crosses
with other sorts. Doubtless some results
of value can be obtained by selecting seed
from plants least affected in a ﬁeld known
to be full of root-knot. Such plants, when
in ﬂower, should be crossed, if possible,
with similar resistant plants in same ﬁeld.
In this way a nematode resistant sugar-
beet has been obtained.
The influence of increased amounts of
certain elements of fertilizers on the
amount of injury caused by root-knot has
received. I ﬁnd, practically no attention.
It has been investigated very carefully in
Germany in connection with the sugar—
beet nematode. There it has been found
that by greatly increasing the potash the
injury is to a large extent, decreased. I
am now beginning similar experiments
with the root—knot.
The method, however, that has perhaps

been most successful of all against the
sugar-beet nematode is the use of Trap-
erops. Strange to say. although this has
often been recommended for root-knot,
I have yet to ﬁnd a single case where it
has ever been tried even as an experiment.
I am making some experiments this sea-
son. The method consists essentially, in
planting thickly in close rows, some crop
known to be very susceptible to the nema-
tode, allowing the nematodes to enter it
and before they have developed far
enough to lay eggs, and so increase the
number in the soil, to destory the crop.
This is repeated several times during the
season, and so reduces the number of
nematodes still left in the soil that it re-
quires several years before they become
very destructive again. Certain cautions
must be carefully observed, however, or
the use of this method will increase in—
stead of decrease the number of nema-
todes. It is necessary to remove or entire-
ly turn under and kill the plants about
four weeks after they come up. If left
too long the nematodes will have develop-
ed too far and will have begun laying, if
not long enough they will still be in the
motile stage and will crawl out again and
reinfect the soil.
What to do with a peach orchard, for
example, where the root-knot is bad is a
serious question. In the ﬁrst place we
will take it for granted that the orchard,
even in its diseased state, represents too
much money to permit it to be cut down.
It might be well, then, to try watering the
trees heavily before the buds open, either
early in the spring or 'late in the fall, with
a dilute solution of formalin, so as to kill
the nematodes in the knots. For
such I would prefer the cowpea (not
the Iron.) But unless they are re-
moved in time these trap crops will
do more harm than good. When the
orchard is cut down the land should
be freed from nematodes by some
of the means above mentioned, before
setting again to peaches. Avoid cow-
peas, except possibly Iron, as they propa-
gate the nematode rapidly. Use velvet
beans or beggar-weed instead. These are
but suggestions, please understand, not
from the result of actual personal exper-
ience, but as a result of fair acquaintance
with the habits of the nematode. I trust
some of you may have the courage to try
these in a corner of your orchard and
report to me the result.

Report on the Manatee Snail and White Fly.
BY F. D. WAITE.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Our President recently asked me to get
up a paper on the white ﬂy and Manatee
snail, the latter having been brought to the
notice of the fruit growers within the past
six months, and several descriptive articles
have been published and copied into the
leading papers of the State. I have
brought a few specimens with me. also
another specie of snail which may play a
part in the cleaning up of the sooty mould,
as we have found it feeding on the lichens
several feet high on the trunks of old seed-
lings.
Messrs Butler and Heathcote of St.
Petersburg sent me several dozen snail
found feeding on the Mangrove at Passe-
a-Grille, these were put around a tree dur-
ing early winter and protected with sacks,
but all died, I hope this summer to make
another trial with them.
I am sorry to say that parties have
visited the grove where the Manatee snail
was ﬁrst discovered and stolen so many
that we can hardly ﬁnd any left, and our
neighbors who afterwards discovered
them in their groves, have been treated
in like manner.
From observations already made I be-
lieve the snail is not active during cold
or dry weather, neither do I think they
increase until the rainy season, and dur-
ing the foggy weather in early fall and
winter, when they become most active in
ridding the trees and fruit of the sooty
mould. Those wishing to become famil-
iar with the white ﬂy and its enemies
should procure Press Bulletin No. 4. is-
sued May Ist, 1901, Press Bulletin No.
59 of January 15th, 1906, Bulletin No.
67 of June, 1903, and Bulletin No. 13
issued by the U. S. Department of Agri-
culture June 17th, I897. There is another
report of the Entomologist Prof. H. A.
Gossard from July 1st, 1900 to July Ist,
1901.
All of the above reports cover the
ground completely. I have a copy of Press
Bulletin No. 59 with me, and if it is'the
pleasure of this Society I will read the
same.
THE MANATEE SNAIL, BULIMULUS
DORMANI.
(Press Bulletin No. 59, Florida Agri-
cultural Experiment Station. Depart-
ment of Entomology.)
The sooty mold of orange, Meliola, is
one of the most serious results of white fly
infestation of citrus groves, and is an
element in the injury to various plants
from aphids and from some of the scale
insects especiallythe Lecaniums, mealy
bugs, wax scales, and cottony cushion
scale. The fungus is not itself a parasite
on the plant, but a saprophyte, deriving its
sustenance from the sweet honey dew
secreted by these insects. The injury to
the plant results from the smothering
action of the fungus, the heavy coating of

fungal threads interfering with the
healthful action of sunlight on the leaves.
The appearance of the various ornamen-
tal and hedge plants is also disﬁgured by
the dark fungus. The sooty mold is es-
pecially bad following the white fly at—
tack owing to the large amount of honey
dew secreted by these insects. As the
white ﬁy larvae attach themselves to the
under side 'of the leaves the honey dew
exuded by them falls to the top side of
the leaves beneath, thus affording favor-
able opportunity for the growth of the
fungus. So constant is the association of
the fungus and the white fly that badly
infested groves and hedges may be recog-
nized at some distance by the heavily
coated dark foliage. The fungus develops
on the fruit as well as on the leaves and
stem and washing becomes necessary, re—
sulting not only in an added expense. but
also in increased danger of decay in ship-
ping. In this connection the habits of the
tree snail, Bulimulus Dormam', are of the
greatest interest. This snail has been
found in the orange groves in Manatee
county feeding upon the sooty mould.
Just how long the snail has been present
on orange trees in this county it is im-
possible to say. It was observed as long
as two years ago by Mr. F. D. Waite, at
Palmetto. It seems to have been present
in small number in other groves at this
time, but attracted no further attention
until the present summer. The snail is
now widely distributed in Manatee coun-
ty, occurring in many groves on both
sides of the Manatee river. The work of
'the snails is very characteristic. When
well started they occur in great numbers
on the tree spreading over it from base to
top. Its favorite food seems to be the
sooty mold. The fungus is cleaned from
the leaves, stems. and fruit. The leaves
thus cleaned have a glossy, shiny appear-
ance as though free from white fly. The
fruit thus cleaned has a better color and
probably ripens earlier. In addition to
the fungus, the snail takes algae and
some lichens from the stem and trunk,
giving the trunk a much cleaner and
fresher look. The trees that are cleaned
stand out conspicuously from the sur-
rounding trees by their bright foliage and
clean trunks. The snails increase rapidly
under favorable conditions. The eggs are
probably deposited in protected places
about the trunks of the trees, possibly also
about the base of the tree under leaves
and other rubbish. That the snails are
capable of doing effective work when
present in suFﬁcient numbers has been
shown in numerous groves in Manatee
county during the present summer. Such
trees in these groves as are well stocked
with the snails have been thoroughly
cleaned, the fruit not requiring washing.
The snails are of medium size, measur-
ing. when full grown, three-fourths to one
inch in length. The shells are smooth,
white, or corneous white, and with about
four bands of brown spots. Old shells
have often a somewhat corroded surface.
the bands becoming indistinct or absent.
When the conditions are unfavorable, eith-
er cold or dry, the snails take refuge in the
hollows of the trees or under leaves ac-
cumulated in the forks, or elsewhere, or
under sacks at the base of the trees when
these are provided. It thus becomes an
easy matter to transfer them from tree to
tree- A few snails placed by Mr. Wade
Harrison in one of his trees in March, in-
creased in such numbers as to free the tree
of sooty mold by mid-summer of the same
year. The snails are known to range
with' some variation from the mouth of
the St. johns river on the north. to the

Caloosahatchie river on the south. The
species is probably native to Florida as
specimens in small numbers were observ-
ed about the hammocks and elsewhere as
long as ﬁfty years ago. Its habit of feed-
ing on the sooty mold of the orange, how-
ever, was not known until within the
past two years.
In view of the fondness of the snails
for the injurious sooty mold fungus, it
becomes of ﬁrst importance to_ observe
their treatment of the beneﬁcial fungi.
Among the fungi parasitic on orange in-
sects there are four species of inestimable
value to orange growers. These are, the
brown fungus well known as an effective
parasite on the white ﬂy larvae; the
red-pink fungus also parasitic on the
white ﬂy; the red fungus, and the gray
headed fungus, both parasitic on the
common scales. The brown fungus so
effective in control of the white ﬂy, as is
well-known, throws out spreading hyphae
for some distance around the body of the
dead leaves. It seems that the snails oc-
casionally feed to a limited extent on
these, spreading hyphae but evidently not
enough to interfere with the spread of the
fungus, since this fungus is doing particu-
larly effective work in the groves in the
Manatee region where the snails occur.
The red-pink fungus is also abundant
in the groves where the snails occur
and is untouched by them. The snails
have not been observed to feed on either
the red or the gray fungi parasitic on the
common orange scales, and it is probable
that they have no taste for these parasitic
fungi. Colonies of the snails are being
started in part of the State where the
white ﬂy injury is severe and where condi-
tions seem favorable for the growth of
the snail. It is desirable that close atten-
tion be given to the habits of the snail,
as well as to means of protecting colonies
against unfavorable conditions. A few
sacks thrown around the tree seem to
afford a needed protection against unus—
ual cold. It is probable that sprays can
not be used on trees stocked with the
snails without injury to the colony, for,
although protected by the shell from the
immediate effect, sufﬁcient spray probably
clings to the sooty mold on which they
feed to destroy them. The beneﬁcial par-
asitic fungi and the snails may be allowed
to work together on unsprayed trees.
The snail is here spoken of as the Mana-
tee snail since while recorded as occurring
in other parts of the State it was found
working on the orange groves ﬁrst in the
Manatee region.

Report of Committee on Diseases, Insects and
Method of Control.
[There was no regular report made by
any member of the committee, but the
question was opened for discussion, and
this proved very interesting. The fol-
lowing is as full a report as the stenog—
rapher was able to make—See]
Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I regret to
say that I have been unable to make any
report owing to the fact that I have been
in a dark room for some weeks, unable to
read or write and have had to depend
upon some one else to do my writing for
me. After the President had notiﬁed me
I was on this committee I communicated
with other members telling them of my
disability and urging them to attend to
the work necessary to a good report.
Mr. Hubbard—I have no formal re—
' port on this subject. I have had no ex-
perience with the white ﬂy, not even
like our friend Mr. Hart. I have a small
joke at Mr. Hart’s expense. One of our
neighbors sent him a specimen and asked
if it was the white ﬂy, he also wrote Mr.
Hart, but Mr. Hart was so afraid
of the white ﬂy that he immediately burn-
ed it without examination. I do not
believe this gentleman had the white ﬂy,
but he did have the white wax scale.
The red fungus is now attacking this
scale and I think he will soon be rid of
it.
I practically do no spraying. In cases
of small trees I use a small atomizer,
using pure kerosense and treating them
on a warm, dry day. putting it on care-
fully. The kerosene will evaporate in
about an hour and one application will
remove most of the scale and will not
hurt the foliage. Kerosene has practi-
cally the same chemical composition as
turpentine and the essential oil of the
orange, so that when it evaporates it
has very little effect on the tree. If you
should saturate the tree with the kero-
sene, of course it might do some damage.
(Question) Have you used whale oil
soap?
Mr. Hubbard—I used to do this. but
am now depending on Lady bugs and
fungus- Orange trees may have some
scale the ﬁrst season, but the next year the
lady bug and fungus will clean them out
pretty thoroughly. If a man sprays for
red spider etc., he kills the fungus and
has to keep up the spraying continually.
Maj. Healy.—Mr Waite seems to be
the only one who has had any experience
with the white ﬂy.
Mr. \Vaite.—One 0f the oldest groves
we have, contains 600 large trees, so
large we cannot get in between them to
spray. This grove has been infested with
the ﬂy for ten or ﬁfteen years. The fungi
is very abundant. also about one hundred
trees are inhabited by the snail, specimens
of which I have brought with me. We
commenced picking this crop of 4000
boxes during Christmas week and ﬁnish-
ed about the twentieth of January we

had a great deal of rainy weather at the
time. Every box was washed except that
which had been beautifully cleaned by
the snail. The fruit carried well, and
sold for $3.00 per box in Providence
R. I. The trees cleaned by the snail gave
us a uniform bloom this spring, while the
balance of the grove bloomed only in the
tops of the trees.
Saturday night I went over to the
grove to get specimens of the snail but
could only ﬁnd a'few, and concluded that
our neighbors had gathered the greater
portion of them, but Sunday it rained
during the night, and the next morning
my foreman found plenty of them crawl-
ing up and down the trunks, and over the
foilage, and he said that many of the
snails had particles of sand still sticking
to them. We are not certain that they
do not burrow in the earth during the
cool winter weather, coming out when
the weather is warm, and the atmosphere
moist. They do not move around or
feed, only when the sooty mold is wet,
which I presume enables them to eat it
more readily, and in doing so they clean
up the eggs of the ﬂy.
Mr. Hart—Mr. President, I wish to
ask Mr. \Vaite if in spraying he would
risk clear water.
Mr. Waite—This would assist the
snails and after two or three sprayings
the fungi would make their appearance,
for this reason I would reccommend to
those who do not wish to use insecticides‘
and fungucides, spraying with clear wa-
ter, and if done toward night, it would
keep the sooty mold moist all night.
Mr. Hart.—What kind of a nozzle
would you use?
Mr. VVaite.—We use the Big Boston
in a solid spray on the tall trees. and the
Vermoel for small trees and where we
wish to throw a mist over the fruit for the
rust mite.
Mr. Bell—I would like to know wheth—
er or not the result of the fungi mention-
ed is a remedy for the white ﬂy.
Mr. Waite—After the white ﬂy has
been in a grove a few years, this fungi
seems to be a natural parasite following
it, and will unaided, in time clean up the
trees so they will produce one ﬁne crop in
three years, and a medium one year, and
comparatively nothing the next, but by
assisting the fungi to spread more rapidly
we may get fewer oﬁ' years.
Mr. Bell—Do I understand that when
the -white ﬂy gets into a grove that it
will bear probably once in three years?
Mr. \\"aite.—Yes sir, but it is my opin-
ion that if we assist the fungi and snail
to spread more rapidly, we will soon lose
all fear of the white ﬂy.
Mr. Bell—Is the damage done by
white ﬂy as much as one hundred dollars
per acre?
Mr. Waite—I should say that was a
small estimate but if the fungi and snail
have your assistance they will keep out
the ﬂy, if you will take the pains. and use
the time you would consume in spraying,
distributing fungi and snails, it would
not lessen the value of your grove one
dollar. As I have stated the fruit ship—
ped from the grove mentioned was as
ﬁne as any I ever saw, while that ad-
joining this grove was not near as ﬁne
ﬂavored, it was covered with sooty mold,
which excluded the air and sunlight, nec—
essary to make a ﬁne quality of fruit.
The trees stocked with the snail were
quite clean by the last of Sept, so they
had plenty of sunlight (and fully a month
before gathering the fruit.) therefore I
think the snail the best friend we have
with which to ﬁght the white ﬂy.

36 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. McClung—Is this mould respon-
sible for the damage that is attributed to
the white ﬂy?
Mr. Waite—Yes sir.
Mr. Bed—How many oranges did you
wash and what was the expense of wash-
ing them?
Mr. \‘V aite.—VV e have cleaned as many
as ﬁfty boxes in ﬁfteen minutes. with
three men at $1.25 per day. We washed
our entire crop of grape fruit and oranges
not cleaned by the snail.
Mr. Longley.——I would like to ask
about the scale and white ﬂy: Is the
white ﬂy more destructive to one kind
of fruit than to another?
Mr. \Vaite.—.-It is more destructive to
oranges than grapefruit, but is worse on
tangerine, mandarin and lemon, than any
of the others.
Mr. Gist—I would like to ask what
steps I should take if the white ﬂy should
appear on my grove. Should I spray or
use fungi and snail?
Mr. \Vaite.—I would advise spraying
the ﬁrst trees showing any sign of the
ﬂy, in this way you may be able to hold
it in check for several years, but it would
pay to introduce the fungi and snail as
soon as you see that you have the ﬂy well
started in your grove, but not before. for
foilage partially covered with the fungi
may contain plenty of pupa which may
mature in a few days and ﬂy to other
trees not stocked with the fungi.
Maj. Healey-—I have sought infor-
mation on the origin of the white ﬂy and
am told that it was brought to this coun-
try from China. It might be we could
gather some information from there that
would aid us in its extermination.
Mr. Sampson—I would ask if the ex-
termination of the white ﬂy is dependent
on fungi, snails, or spraying, and if there
would be a full crop the third year.
Mr. Hart.——I would like Mr. Waite’s
opinion as to how the spraying can be
done on bearing trees, and whether or
not it would give us a good full crop the
third year or a normal one each year.
Mr. Waite—Six years ago I took
charge of the Manatee Lemon Co’s groves
in Manatee county. The young grove
of 225 acres joined another grove that
was badly infested with white ﬂy. Our
trees were very small, from one to two
feet high, we sprayed that portion near-
est that grove the ﬁrst winter, and as we
noticed specimens of the ﬂy farther out
in our grove, from year to year, so we
increased the area. For the ﬁrst four
years we kept the ﬂy down to such an
extent that our trees were always glossy,
and only an occasional tree would be
black from the sooty mould. As the trees
became larger it was more difﬁcult to
wet the entire foilage, and the Fly would
become numerous by October, and por-
tions of the fruit would be black, but
these winter sprayings seemed to clean
the trees enough so that they would bloom
and set a very nice crop of fruit. Our
success was fully as good with old seed-
lings. We did not spray during the past
winter, wishing to see what results
would follow the introduction of the
brown and red fungi, these only work
during the rainy season or foggy weath-
er during the fall and winter. By spray-
ing we have increased our crop of fruit
each year. It requires more intelligent
labor than the ordinary “Darkey” to do
successful spraying as one leaf missed
may have hundreds of eggs.
Mr. Brown—\IVhat are the surround-
ing dangers of the white ﬂy? Upon
what does it feed?


## p. 37 (#215) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 37
Mr. Waite—It feeds upon the orange,
lemon, grapefruit and lime, I have also
seen it in all stages from the egg to the
adult ﬂy, on the chinaberry, persimmon,
cape jasmine and prickly ash. \Nhile I
have never found the larva or pupa on the
palmetto and gall berry, I have seen the
adult flies quite abundant. The sooty
mold attacks the honey dew, following
the attacks of many kind of wax scale
and mealy bug. Many have sent me speci-
mens of plants or shrubbery covered with
this deposit of sooty mold, and asked if
it was not white ﬂy. On examination I
found only the wax scale, or mealy bug.
Mr. Taber.—I would like to hear from
.Prof. Rolfs on this question.
Prof Rolfs—I was getting more infor-
mation out of this than I could possibly
give, but some people are never satisﬁed
until they get things stirred up.
The damage done by the white ﬂy, and
the smut which follows it, does consider-
able damage to the grove that is ordi-
narily not taken into consideration. The
honey dew, which is excreted by the white
ﬂy. falls upon the fruit and the upper side
of the leaves, this makes a medium in
which the smut or sooty mold grows
luxuriantly. By its extensive growth it
forms a velvety covering over the leaves
and fruit and on account of its black
color it keeps the sun from penetrating to
the leaves and fruit or in a large measure
obstructs it. Sunlight as we all know is
absolutely necessary for the welfare of
our orchard trees, and is also absolutely
necessary for the maturing of the fruit,
consequently, when the sunlight is cut off
almost completely, as is often the case
with this sooty mold covering, the fruits
cannot mature properly. This is brought
out very strikingly when the fruit is
run through a washer. The fruit as it
hangs on the tree appears to be perfectly
ripe but when it comes out of the washer
it is half green, the green area extending
as far as the fruit is covered with the
sooty mold.
The Manatee snail does not destroy the
white ﬂy as a number of people have as-
serted. No one who has studied the
work of this snail with a hand lens, which
is the proper way to study it, will contend
for a moment that the snail does any
harm to the white ﬂy. It merely feeds on
the sooty mold cleaning it off completely
from the leaves and from the fruit, doing
the work much more perfectly than any
> washer yet invented.
The good work of the Manatee snail
in clearing off the sooty mold was strik-
ineg apparent in a number of cases. The
trees that had been cleared of the sooty
mold a year before produced an abun-
dant bloom and set a heavy crop of fruit,
while the adjoining trees bloomed rather
sparsely and set, probably, a half crop of
fruit. So far as the natural conditions sur-
rounding these trees was concerned they
seemed to be alike, there was every rea-
son for believing that the beneﬁcial effect
was attributable to the work of the snail.
Maj. Fairbanks—I would like to
know about the white ﬂy on younger
growth, as it did not seem to be on the
older growth.
Professor Rolfs—The females deposit
their eggs on the younger foliage, as
young trees are usually making a vigor-
ous growth, these are apt to have more
eggs deposited upon them proportionally
than the large trees. It sometimes hap—
pens that a tree will send up a water
sprout while the rest of it is practically
dormant, if this occurs during the' ﬂight
of the white ﬂy, the water sprout will be

found to have received myriads of eggs
on the lower side of the leaves.
Mr. Henderson—I want to touch on
one point about the white ﬂy. I am not
properly in the orange belt, but I have
about one hundred trees. In the fall of
1904 the white ﬂy appeared on one tree.
I was told if I would cut all the leaves off
the one tree I would be free of the white
ﬂy, which I did. This is good. I had
them only on the one tree.
Prof. Rolfs.—In the matter of keeping
the white ﬂy restricted to the area already
inhabited. I may cite one instance that
occurred among a number, in which we
succeeded in eradicating the ﬂy after it
had become pretty well established, I am
referring to the case that happened at
West Palm Beach. A wealthy gentle-
man who had a ﬁne house at Orlando,
decided to build a ﬁner one at \Vest Palm
Beach, and after the house was built he
,carried with him some trees and shrubs.
After these had been set out, probably
some six months, it was discovered that
they were infested with white ﬂy. Per-
mission was obtained to destroy every
thing to which the white ﬂy had spread,
all the shrubbery, including citrus planted
out, were grubbed up and burned, some
of the stuff such as the stems of banana
plants that would not burn were thrown
into the lake.
Later investigations failed to bring to
light any white ﬂy, we think therefore,
that the pest was stopped and eradicated
at the point of infection. If the infection
is checked before migration of the white
ﬂy takes place, I think it entirely possible
to eradicate it.
Mr. Cook—How did you destroy the
white ﬂy? If he is in the air, is he
killed, or will he propagate a second
year?
Prof. Rolfs.—The white ﬂy in its com-
plete development goes through the egg
stage; the larval stage, during the ﬁrst
part of which it crawls about and during
the latter part it remains stationary; the
pupa stage which to the unaided eye is
not very different from the larval stage,
but can be distinguished from it by the
use of a hand lens; and the last stage or
adult state. During the last stage is the
insect able to ﬂy and only during this
stage does it reproduce itself.
During the summer season the eggs
hatch in about three days. The larval
stage lasts for about twenty ﬁve days, the
third stage or pupa stage lasts for about
ten days- The adult insect lives only a
very short time, the females lay about all
of their eggs during the ﬁrst twenty four?
hours, the adult ﬂies live only about three
or four days. The time required for an
entire generation during the summer
time, according to Professor Gossard, is
about forty or ﬁfty days, while during the
winter portion of the year it may be
nearly six months.
Mr. Cook—Does the white ﬂy only
live long enough to propagate the ﬁrst
time? Does it lay more than one crop
of eggs?
Prof. Rolfs.-—The white ﬂy appears to
lay only about twenty ﬁve eggs and
when this hatch is laid off she does not
appear to lay a second batch.
Mr. Cook.—I can spray my trees, but
the white ﬂy commences laying her eggs
the next night. I have not been able to
destroy the eggs.
Prof. Rolfs.—During the summertime
there is almost a continuous appearance
of adult ﬂies, there are, however. periods
during which only few are on the wing. at
such a time the work of combatting this
pest can be carried on to best advantage.
Mr. Cook—Do I understand that they
disappear after laying?

Prof. Rolfs.—There are three or four
periods during which the adults appear in
countless numbers. During this time it
is probably not best, to spray, excepting
where it is done for special purposes,
spraying can be done most effectively be-
tween the broods.
Mr. Grifﬁng.—Prof- Rolfs mentions
that a large portion of the State is now
free from the white fly. \Vhile this dis-
cussion has been conﬁned to Manatee,
I would ask if it can be determined just
where the territories are that are now
affected.
Prof. Rolfs.—\Ve can not give you the
deﬁnite data as to what portions of the
State are infested with' white ﬂy and
what portions are not. Prof. Gossard
had this pretty thoroughly worked out,
but we know that every year the insect
is spreading to new districts and we know
how reluctant people are especially if he
happens to be a Nurseryman to admit that
white ﬂy is present on his premises. A
man might not hesitate to state the fact
privately but he would not like to have it
advertised.
Mr. .—I have specimens of fun-
gus which I presume the citrus growers
are familiar with. Last year the State
was full of this particular fungus. The
damage is not known as yet, but we hope
to know about it soon. Last year we had
scarcely any scab at all, but this year we
have an abundance of it. Some one
found that by spraying the scab with
Bordeaux mixture that it could be con-
trolled. This scab will develop on the
sweet trees also. Also on grape fruit it is
very severe. [The fungus referred to is
the sour orange scab. Cladosporium ele-
ganus. Sec.]
Mr. Longley.—Is it more prevalent on
grapefruit or oranges?


Mr. .—On lemon it is more severe
than on any citrus stock.
Mr. Longley.—Is the fungus shown on
vigorous growing trees?
Mr. .—The fungus attacks trees
when they are very small, and it seems
to make very little difference whether the
tree is growing thriftily or not. I believe,
however, we see it more frequently on'-
thrifty trees.
Mr. Longley.—-VV ill the fungus spread
during the summer?
Mr. .—-Very little growth appears
during that time, but if we have a dry
season we are not apt to get much of it.
It requires a rainy season for this to
grow.
Mr. Longley.-—Did that same fungus
attack lemon trees prior to the freeze.
Mr. .—Yes.
Mr. Beers—W ill inoculation of blue-
stone be beneﬁcial?
Mr. .—I should say, no.
would have no preventative effect.
Mr. T aber.—To what extent have you
found this scab affecting trees?
Mr. ———.-—Some sweet oranges are
sometimes affected slightly; the satsuma,
very badly. Ordinary oranges we have
no trouble with at all after the buds begin
to grow- The scab I referred to was
that on tall bearing trees, and so differs
in that respect.
Mr. \Vaite.—-Referring to the sour scab
on the grapefruit, I will say that in the
last few days I have received a letter
from a gentleman who says his trees are
all more or less effected with fungi. with
the exception of about two acres where
the trees are located on a shell mound,
there they seem to be free from it, is it
lime the trees require?
Dr. Rolfs—I cannot answer as to this
question as we have made no experiment



This

on this line. It may be due to location,
soil, or the shell.
Mr. Fairbanks—Is there any way of
producing and developing non-resisting
trees?
Mr. Brown.—It may be possible that
there are some varieties of grapefruit
that are more resistent than others.
President McCarty.—This is a matter
worthy of study. I hope something may
be attempted along this line. I think it
probable that something can be done, but
I cannot tell how long it will take.
Mr. Brown—There is one other dis-
ease, that is withertip: I do not know
how many here are familiar with it. If
there are those here who know anything
about the withertip, I will beg to hear
from them.
Prof. Rolfs—I have been studying the
disease (withertip) for the last four
years, and have also treated groves vary—
. ing in size from a few trees up to over
twenty acres in extent. The methods of
procedure are pretty thoroughly worked
out. A bulletin on this subject was pub-
lished from the Department of Agricul-
ture, Wasington, D. C., and a revised
edition of this bulletin is now being pre-
pared.
In addition to my own experience in
treating this disease, I have given advice
to many grove owners and have watched
the application of this advice. Where the
work is done thoroughly and followed
up conscientiously the results have always
been satisfactory. A number of groves
that were treated according to advice, and
were very badly infected with the disease,
are now practically free. As there are a
number of men present who have had
practical experience in combating with
this disease, I should like to hear from
them.
Mr. Phelps—I have several groves
that have been badly effected by this
withertip; my fruit dropped badly and I
wrote to Professor Rolfs but did not hear
from him promptly, so I wrote to a spray-
er and asked about inoculating with blue-
stone. I asked him if it would not have
the same effect as spraying. I urged
inoculating, mixing equal parts of blue
stone and air slacked lime. I have been
doing this and ﬁnd that after it has been
in about ten days or two weeks there is a
great deal of gum coming out- That is
as far as I have gotten and I do not know
what the effects will be.
Mr. Hart—Before we leave the mat—
ter of diseases and insects there is a very
important matter. I am losing trees
brieﬂy. A year ago I introduced a reso-
lution asking that we get more assistance
from the Agricultural Department in the
study of blight. I took it up with Mr.
\Vilson who promised to help us if we
could get in shape to receive it. I want to
put in the same resolution. This is an
important matter. I am losing trees
now that would bear ten or twelve boxes
each year, and I am putting in new trees
in each place and have a tree growing
wherever there is a place for it, but my
grove is uneven. I am not alone in this
experience; this disease is all over the
State but we do not know much about it
yet and it is something we should look
after.
Mr. Painter.—Your Secretary present-
ed the resolution to Secretary Wilson in
person, Mr. Wilson said he would be
glad to do more than they were doing if
he could but that all of their appropria-
tion for this class of work had been used
up. I am conﬁdent the only way we can
get an appropriation for this work is to
take it up with our Senators and Repre-
sentatives and get them to ask for an ap-
propriation.

The Experiment Station Co-operative Work.
BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS,
DII-BCTOR FLORIDA EXPIIIIINT STATION.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen."
-In beginning my talk on the Experi-
ment Station co-operative work I can—
not do better than to show how the pur-
poses for which the Experiment Station
was founded is frequently misjudged,
and in many quarters not understood.
So much work has been done with the
Horticultural Society, as a society, and
with the different members of the Society,
personally, that nearly everyone in my
hearing is probably better informed than
the best informed outside the Horticul-
tural Society. In I887 Congress pro-
vided for the Experiment Station by pas-
sing the Hatch Act. To show concisely
what was intended by the Hatch Act I
will quote you Section 2 verbatim:
“Section 2. That it shall be the object
and duty of said Experiment Stations to
conduct original researches or experi-
ments on the physiology of plants and
animals; the diseases to which they are
severally subject, with the remedies for
the same; the chemical composition of
plants at their different stages of growth;
the comparative advantages of rotative
cropping as, pursued under a varying
series of crops; the capacity of new plants
or trees for acclimation; the analysis of
soils and water; the chemical composition
of manures, natural or artiﬁcial, with ex-
periments designed to test their compara-
tive effects on crops of different kinds;
the adaptation and value of grasses and
forage plants; the composition and diges-
tibility of the different kinds of food for
domestic animals; scientiﬁc and economic
questions involved in the production of
butter and cheese; and such other re-
searches of experiments bearing directly
on the agricultural industry of the United
States as may in each case be deemed
advisable, having due regard to the vary-
ing conditions and needs of the respective
States and Territories.”
This, as you will see, makes a very
clear cut statement of what the funds are
to be used for. Thus, things which are
not provided for in this Act are necessari—
ly not contemplated and not permissi—
ble under it. The Congress, previous
to the one in session at the present time,
passed a law requiring the Secretary of
Agriculture to supervise the experiments
much more closely, and also co-ordinate
the experiments in different States.
During the past year Congress has
passed the Adams Act which will prove
of great beneﬁt to the Experiment Sta-
tion, and directly. to the people of Flori-
da. In this Act an additional $5000 are
appropriated, which is increased by $2000
annually, until it shall reach $15000-
'This fund is more closely guarded even
than that of the Hatch Fund. I quote you
from this Act which appropriates the
fund. -
* * * “to be applied only to paying
the necessary expenses of conducting

original researches or experiments bear-
ing directly on the agricultural industry
of the United States, having due regard
to the varying conditions and needs of the
respective States and Territories."
The term, “original research," might
be a very general one were it not for the
fact that the Director of the Oﬂice of
Experiment Stations is held responsible
for the interpretation of the expenditure
of this fund. The Director of the Oﬂice
of Experiment Stations has probably had
more experience in Experiment Station
work than any other living man, and con-
sequently is able to tell at a glance wheth-
er a proposed piece of work is original
research, or whether it is a piece of
demonstration work, or, what not.
In interpreting this law the Secretary
of Agriculture has issued a circular letter
in which he states:
* * * “Accordingly, expenses for ad
ministration, care of buildings and
grounds, insurance, ofﬁce furniture and
ﬁttings, general maintenance of the sta-
tion farm and animals, veriﬁcation and
demonstration experiments, compilations,
farmers’ institute work, travelling, except
as is immediately connected with original
researches in progress under this Act,
and other general expenses for the main-
tenance of the experiment stations, are
not to be charged to this fund. The Act
makes no provision for printing or for
the distribution of publications, which
should be charged to other funds.”
I have thus taken considerable time to
show you exactly what are the essential
parts of the laws founding the Experi—
ment Stations, and also what limitations
are placed upon us. I do this from the
fact that there seems to be a general mis-
information as to what the ofﬁce and
privilege of the Experiment Station is.
Even our legislators who assemble at
Tallahassee bi-ennially and even people
higher in authority have had erroneous
impressions in regard to the essential parts
of the law.
The Hatch Act was passed in 1888 and
became operative in the same year. This
makes the experiment station a little over
seventeen years old. During this time it
has published 84 bulletins and several
annual reports. Of the 84 bulletins 46
are devoted to horticultural work directly.
and portions of the remaining 38 are also
devoted to horticultural work; and also
a large part of many of the annual re‘
ports. From this you will see that the
horticultural interests of the State have
been well looked after. This is especially
so in more recent years. Taking the
last ten years we ﬁnd that 36 of the bul-
letins are devoted to horticultural matters.
Most of these being fully illustrated. In
the last ﬁve years 22 bulletins have been
published on horticultural matters. Some
of these have been profusely illus-
trated. If no other bulletins had been
published from the Experiment Station
within the last ﬁve years than those pub-
lished on Horticultural subjects, the re-
quirements of the law, so far as publica-
tions were concerned, would have been
more than met-
The matter contained in these bulletins
in the most cases, has received world-
wide attention. ’
The pineapple growers of Florida have
at their disposal the most thoroughly
reliable scientiﬁc publications on their
special subject that has been published
anywhere in the world. \Vithin the pres-
ent ﬁscal year two new bulletins on this
subject have been issued which many of
you will ﬁnd on your tables when you
reach home from this meeting.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 43
From the beginning the Experiment
Station has had an appropriation of
$15000 a year. During the seventeen
years of its life the State of Florida has
not appropriated anything toward equip-
ment and maintenance of this institution.
Consequently what it has done has been
accomplished entirely on Federal appro-
priation. This, of course. is much to be
regretted, especially from the fact that,
if. additional funds from the State had
been accessible it would have been pos-
sible to have erected very suitable build-
ings and to undertake much more elabor-
ate and useful experiments than it-has
been possible in the present conditions.
Frequently in planning experiments these
have had to be altered in such a way as
to make it possible to meet the expendi-
tures under the conditions imposed by the
Hatch Act. Another serious condition
that has arisen is the fact that the amount
of appropriation has not been increased
since the inauguration of the experiment
stations and yet the living expenses and
supplies have nearly doubled in prices.
In some cases these have more than
doubled in price. This is especially true
of labor-in the vicinity of the Experiment
Station.
CO-OPERATION.
Our most successful experiments that
have been carried out by the Florida
Experiment Station the State has co-
operated with the Experiment Station.
Among the ﬁrst of these co-operative ex-
periments was the one conducted in the
fertilization of pineapples on the ﬁeld be-
longing to Mr. T. V. Moore, at Jensen,
Florida. In this experiment Mr. Moore
furnished the ﬁeld and took care of it;
while the Experiment Station furnished
the fertilizer and made the application.
The crop was the property of Mr. Moore,
excepting that the Experiment Station
made use of as many of the ripened pine-
apples as might be needed for scientiﬁc
work. This piece of work proved to be
so thoroughly successful, that in spite of
the fact that the writer was roundly criti—
cised by members of the Board of Trus-
tees. they found themselves in a position
where his successor was permitted to car-
ry out the exact line of work after a year
or two of interruption.
In this connection allow me to say that
the members of the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society have always given the
Experiment Station their generous sym-
pathy. and in every way pointed out to
them. have co-operated and helped us
along in the most cordial way. This
generous co—operation has not been
merely that of words of encouragement.
but in actual help in the ﬁeld. Our sci-
entiﬁc staff is not only welcome but re-
quests and importunities are constantly
coming for expert help and advice in the
ﬁeld. Whenever possible we respond
promptly and cheerfully. There are
times however when the conditions at
the Experiment Station will not permit
us to be absent. It shows that a very
great interest is being taken at the pres-
ent time in scientiﬁc information, and
that the latest and most improved meth-
ods are sought.
NEEDS OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION.
The ﬁrst requisite of the Experiment
Station is to have your hearty sympathy
and support. These you have given very
generously, though, possibly, not always
in the most effective way. We have at
times lost some of our most active and
energetic men, that could have been saved
to us if every member of the horticultural

Society had demanded of the Trustees
that the resignation be not accepted.
That we have no support from the
Legislature to supplement the funds of
the Experiment Station has already been
indicated. There is however, a very
general misconception on this point, not
only by the Legislators, but also by the
Agricultural constituents in the State.
The Experiment Station is frequently
importuned by the Agricultural people to
hold farmers institutes. From the read-
ing of the law which I have quoted it is
clear that it was not contemplated by
Congress when this act was passed to use
the funds of the Experiment Station for
Farmer’s Institutes nor for demonstra-
tion work. The following paragraph is
taken from a letter of instruction sent out
by the Secretary of Agriculture to the
Directors of Experiment Stations:
“The increased liberality of the Federal
Government in providing for the endow-
ment of research and experimentation in
agriculture should be a further incentive
to the States and local communities to
supplement these funds for the extension
of demonstration experiments, farmers’
institutes, agricultural colleges, schools,
and courses of instruction, and the gen-
eral education of the rural communities
along industrial lines, in order that the
masses of our farmers may be so edu-
cated from early youth that they will ap-
preciate the beneﬁts of original research
and experimentation as applied to agri-
cultural problems and be able to appro-
priate in the most effective manner for
their own beneﬁt and the general weﬁare
of the nation whatever practical results
are obtained from the work of the agri—
cultural experiment stations.”
From this you will see that it is very
clear that the expenses of organizing and
running farmer’s institutes and other
similar institutions in the State of Florida
must be met from funds provided by the
Legislature.
SEPARATION OF THE EXPERIMENT STA-
TION FROM THE UNIVERSITY.
The Board of Control of the Florida
educational institutions as soon as they
came into power decided to make a more
sharply deﬁned segregation between the
University and the Experiment Station.
Through their President Dr. Sledd of the
University, they have promLsed us that
the workers in the Experiment Station
should not be required to do University
work.
This segregation has its advantages
and also its disadvantages. It has its
disadvantages in losing the services of, at
least, two very able men, Dr. Flint and
Dr. Sellards; on the other hand, it has
its advantages in securing the undivided
efforts of a number of the best workers
that we have in the South. During the
present ﬁscal year: i. e., until June 30, the
connection between the University and
Experiment Station will continue as it
has been for the past fourteen years. At
the beginning of the next ﬁscal year,
which is july Ist, the Experiment Station
staff will be entirely free from teaching
work. This will make it possible for this
corp of scientists to devote their entire
time to the working out of experiments
that have been inaugurated. It will also
enable them to visit various portions of
the State of Florida at such a time, and
for such a length of time, as their experi-
ment work will permit. During the
coming year it will be possible to deliver
lectures from time to time at other points
and at more frequent intervals.

REMOVAL T0 GAINESVILLE.
Every member of the Horticultural So—
ciety is familiar with the fact that the
University of Florida is to be transferred
to a new site at Gainesville during the
coming year. At the same time when
the University is transferred the Experi-
ment Station will also be moved to its
new location. The Board of Control are
providing at Gainesville commodious
buildings for every department in the
Experiment Station; _ also propagating
house, grounds, and other equipments
necessary for beginning work at once.
The plans have been made and are being
carried out successfully so that there will
be no interruption in the experiments that
are already in progress and also make
it possible to carry forward any new pro-
jects that may be found desirable.

Report of the Standing Committee on Peaches,
Plums and Pears.
BY G. M. GRIFFING.
.ll r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I as chairman of the committee, ad-
dressed a letter to the two other mem-
bers of the committee, Mr. E. H. Hay-
ward, of DeLand and Mr. J. Y. McKin-
ney of Candler, asking if it was their
wish that the report be made jointly, or
if they wished to make a separate report
and asked for suggestions, as neither of-
fered any suggestions or assistance, I pro-
ceed to prepare the following report.
Was quite in hope of getting some valu-
able assistance from these gentlemen as
each are from sections where there is in-
terest taken in peach growing.
“In no line of business is there more
need of Enterprise, and more problems to
answer than in the growing and market-
ing of fancy peaches.” These were the
words of Prof. M. B. \Vaite of the De-
partment of Agriculture, in opening his
Address before the Georgia Horticultural
Society at Dublin, Ga. in 1900. a man who
has not only studied peach growing from
a scientiﬁc standpoint, but from a practi-
cal as well, he owning large orchard in-
terests. Never was there a statement
truer. Yet, where in all this vast country
of ours can we ﬁnd a people better ﬁtted.
better qualiﬁed to master this branch of
horticulture, and reach the maximum of
results, than we ﬁnd in the Ranks of the
Florida Horticultural Society. Men who
have withstood the adversities and the
disappointments that they have, yet who
have come out victorous over all; certain—
ly will not acknowledge defeat and aban-
don an enterprise that has made our big
sister States, Georgia and Texas famous.
It is true that we are farther from mar-
ket than our Georgia Brothers and that
we do not have the famous Elberta va-
riety. These are slight disadvantages we
will admit, but we have advantages that
outweigh these many times. What are
they? Well, I should not think that any
true Floridian would ask that question.
It is some thing you all brag of and talk
about. \Nhy just simply Florida climate
that enables us to grow and market the
ﬁrst good peaches of the season offered
to the American people, and we have this
market all our own for from two to
four weeks. Not only this, but in point
of ﬂavor and carrying quality it is the best
of the year, whether from Georgia. Tex-
as or Michigan. This is rather a broad
statement, but before I am through I
hope to prove it to your entire satisfac-
tion.
I do not mean that every neglected,
gnarly and diseased tree or orchard ot
Jewell, Waldo, Imperial and other Flori-
da varieties is going to produce this su-
perb peach if left in that neglected un-

healthy condition. No most certainly
not. What I do mean is that the orchard
planted in soil adapted to the growth of
peaches, that is well cultivated and cared
for from the day it is planted, that is
rightly fertilized and fruit properly thin-
ned, picked at the right stage of maturi-
ty, carefully handled, packed and ship-
ped under refrigeration, will vindicate
the statement that I have made. It has
done it for the Griﬁing Florida Orchard
Company and will do it for others. If
the same careful pains-taking attention is
given to the growing and marketing that
is given by our successful Horticulturist
and trucker to the growing and market-
ing of oranges and the tender vegetable
crops, that has proved the backbone and
the chief support of our State. In the
brief time allotted for the reading of this
paper I am not going to attempt touching
on the details of planting, pruning and
cultivation, these are primary points
known to all horticulturists.
What we want is to interest more peo-
ple in peach growing, then a few words
about the selection of the orchard site,
the treating of the diseases, and last but
not least, the harvesting and shipping.
We need ﬁve hundred carloads of
Florida peaches a year to sufﬁciently in-
troduce them in the great markets of our
country~ so that even a small percentage
of the fruit eating, fruit loving people
will learn to know, remember, and recog-
nize them and call for them from their
fruiters so long as they are to be had in
the markets. How many markets know
them this way now? One! Just one!
Philadelphia is the only city that it can
be said any perceptible number of the con-
sumers recognize the merits of our Flori-
da peach, and last year over forty cars of
our Florida peaches were marketed there.
Each day leading the market. Many of
these cars were held in storage from two
to three weeks. I was on the market one
morning when there was over thirty cars
of Elbertas displayed and sold, and that
morning two carloads of The Griﬁing
Florida Orchard Company pack of Imper-
ial peaches were sold from the cold sto-
rage without the buyers even examining
or looking at a crate at a price 25 cents
above the price paid for the Elbertas on
the dock. Why? Because these buyers
knew that they had customers that would
have no others so long as these lasted.
It is not my object to pit our Florida
peaches against the famous Elberta or
to encroach upon the season of the Elber-
ta in Georgia, Alabama or Texas, but I
do want to condemn to everlasting doom,
that miserable class known as the Per-
sian type. comprising such varieties as
Amsden, Alexander, Early Beatrice, and
of the later introductions, Greensboro,
Triumph, Sneed, etc. As Downing once
said of this class of peach “a peach quick
to ripen and quick to rot.” In fact, they
are green, ripe and rotten at one and the
same time, the under or shaded side will
be green. the side next to the sun and
light will be ripe, and the blossom end
rotten. Delightful conditions to ﬁnd in
a fruit ‘to create and build up a demand
for it. Yet, hundreds of carloads of this
class of peaches are shipped from Georgia,
Alabama and Texas yearly. So soon as
Florida produces sufﬁcient peaches to be
really felt and known upon the market,
the demand for this class of peaches will
cease and good Florida peaches will bring
good prices with a strong demand. Ful-
ly ninety per cent. of the fruit eating peo-
ple supplied from our great markets do

48 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. ,
not know that there are any good peaches
until in July and August when the Elber-
tas and the later, better class of fruit is
being marketed, and for that reaSon there
is no strong demand in May and June.
A burned child dreads the ﬁre and will
give it a wide birth after suffering from
its effects. So also the careful housewife
who after buying one or two lots of in-
ferior peaches with no quality, hesitates
about trying another lot. Restaurants
and Hotels will not put peaches on the
menues until the Stewards know that
there is a sufﬁcient supply of good fruit
so that they can be sure to get it daily and
in sufﬁcient quantities for their needs.
As the situation now exists. Florida
peaches only reach the Cheap Dago fruit
stand trade. There is no real life in most
markets for our peaches and there will
not be until sufficient quantities are pro-
duced for them to become an item in the
markets.
If Florida produced from twelve to ﬁf-
teen hundred carloads of peaches a year
the average price per crate would be fully
25 cents higher than has been realized.
The Secretary has a few account sales
realized by the Grifﬁng Florida Orchard
Company the past three years, which he

random, out of three years sales, we of
course omitting those, that owing to de-
lays in transit, insufﬁcient or improper re-

Cars selling in July came in direct compe-
tition with the Georgia movement and in near-
ly every case sold from 25 to 50 cents per crate
higher than the average Georgia stock. Sev-
eral cars were held in cold storage all of
which came out in ﬁne condition.
We give the account sales of the last one
taken out which sold on July 28th.
None of the Jewell variety is included
in these cars. The Jewell would have
commenced ripening about two weeks ear-
lier and would have prolonged the season
that much. The Grilling Florida Orchard
Company now has about 100 acres of
Jewell at Komoko, all of which were
killed by frost, and a hundred acres at
Richland Pasco county planted this past
winter. Another year we hope to move
our ﬁrst cars by 10th to 15th of May.
As further evidence of the impression
good Florida peaches make upon the mar-
ket will read the following extracts from
letters from our Commission Men, the
originals of which can be seen at the Sec-
retary’s desk.
PHILADELPHIA, PA., June 22nd, 1903.
GENTLEMEN: Car of peaches arrived
last night, found them good color, but no
larger in size than previous lot, selling
fancies $2.25, choice $1.85, expect to ﬁnish
the car at these prices. Very good demand
and outlook favorable. Wired you situa—
tion. Sorry to know you have no more
for immediate shipment, just got our cus-
tomers nicely started on this fruit, and
could handle three cars a week to advan-
tage. Quite a good many Georgia peach—
es in today, mostly Carmen, W addells and
Early River, fruit much larger than the
Florida stock but not as good color or
ﬂavor, fancies selling $1.75 to $2.00 and
choice $1.25 to $1.50. So you see your
Florida peaches are bringing more than
the best Georgias.
H. B. WILLIAMS, INC.
The following is copy of a letter H.
B. Williams wrote Mr. Frank Lindsey,
their representative, with reference to
Florida peaches:
DEAR SIR: Have telegraphed you on
peaches, Grifﬁngs car arrived. took out a
portion. sold fancies $2.25 choice $1.85.
Good color but small compared with
Georgia fruit. Had car from Hale Geor-
gia Orchard Co. their smallest grade
much larger than the Florida fancies and
selling at a lower price. Selling Hales
Extra Fancies $1.75 to $2.00, fancies
$1.50, choice $1.25, so you see Florida
fruit is bringing high prices compared
with Georgia.

GENTS: Have no letter or wire from
you today in reference to shipment of
peaches; fear you did not get car off.
This is unfortunate as market continues
active for your peaches. No trouble to
get $2.50 for fancies and $2.25 for choice.
Outlook favorable. Our customers will
want more of the Florida stock, while
Georgias are larger they are not as good
ﬂavor as the Floridas.
H. B. WILLIAMS, INc.

JULY 21sr, 1904.
GENTS: We took one crate of the Im-
perial peaches out of Cold Storage to-
day, which had been put in there July
2nd, and it came out sound as a dollar.
If we had a car of them today could get
two dollars for them. With a big crop
of Imperial peaches, and a short crop in
Georgia, twenty or twenty ﬁve cars of
these peaches in storage they would sell
like gold dollars. Their keeping qualities
are excellent.
H. B. WILLIAMS, INc.

NEW YORK, JUNE 17TH, 1905.
GENTLEMEN : I want to state that it is
a pleasure to handle goods put up in the
style and careful manner which you ship
in. The trade here recognizes that your
brand of Florida peaches, is by far the
best that comes from Florida. There will
be no trouble in the future. of obtaining
top of the market.
LYON BROS. C0.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., MAY II, 1905.
DEAR 51115: We are enclosing you a
letter received from Mr. J. H. Hale on the
conditions of the crop in Georgia.
One of our customers called on us and
wanted to know if your crop was secured
this year from the cold weather. When
we assured him it was he has gone to the
expense of twenty to twenty-ﬁve dollars
in having a large sign painted across the
front of his store “Headquarters for Grif-
ﬁng Peaches.” He has given us instruc-
tions that he wants IOO crates every day
as long as you ship, so you see we feel
very much encouraged over the inquiry
we are having for your peaches.
H. B. WILLIAMS.

NEw YORK, JULY 25TH .1004.
GENTLEMEN: We have your several
communications and it is very satisfac-
tory to us to have you express yourselves
as being satisﬁed with the results, but,
we wish to state that a great deal of cred-
it for the results we obtained for your
peaches is due to yourselves, for by the
style of your packing and the delicious
ﬂavor of your peaches, caused the buy-
ers to seek for more and buy liberally.
They were at the top of the market
every day we had them to offer. We can
say honestly that the eating quality of
your peaches were superior in ﬂavor and
lacked that bitter taste from the skin that
many of the Florida peaches had, that
were on the market, and we can assure
you that you can look forward to always
having New York take your peaches at
the top prices and as many as you can
place on this market.
THE LYON Baos. Co.

PHILADELPHIA, JULY 8, 1905.
DEAR 51125: We wired you today to
ship all peaches possible here. I enclose
you a letter received from Mr. Hale today
in which you will note he says about the
peach crop there. This is contrary to

what he wrote us a few days ago in re-
gard to the situation, so they must have
gone to rot very suddenly. You will no-
tice he says they are rotting green on the
trees.
If your peaches arriving here Monday
are in good shape and the Elbertas begin
to show any rot here, we are going to
put them in the cold room, because the
last few cars of peaches you shipped us
have been the ﬁnest you have ever shipped
in the last few years and the trade are
more than pleased with them. I could have
sold tens cars today as easily 'as one at
these prices. I never saw them any bet-
ter size and better color.
H. B. WILLIAMS.
I hope that I have now impressed upon
your mind three things. First, that there
is a good demand for Florida peaches,
Second, that if properly grown we have-
the best ﬂavored and best keeping peach
of the year. Third, that there is money
in it.
Now for the troubles and vexations.
And I assure you that the path of the
peach grower is not strewn with roses.
Neither can he lay on beds of ease and
wait for nature and our climate to bring
forth fruit in abundance. Nature and
climate if yoked together, and intelligent—
ly worked will produce wonders. But
it wont answer to let them run loose.
Oh yes! they will continue to work. But
as if vexed at your presumption in yoking
, them together, and working them for
your beneﬁt’ they voluntarily enlist in the
enemies forces. Nature has created an
insect or a form of plant life to prey on
and feed off of every other form of in—
sect or plant life in existence, and our cli-
matic conditions are such as to rapidly
develop these forms of insect and plant
growth which could be justly termed ene-
mies of mankind. Therefore if we would
succeed in the cultivation of peaches,
plums and pears all of which are especial-
ly subject to these enemies, we must eith-
er stir ourselves and ﬁnd nature’s way of
controlling them, either by parasitic or
predacious insects or fungus, or ﬁnd arti-
ﬁcial means of combating them.
As the peach is the ﬁrst and most im-
portant of the fruits under consideration,
will dwell more at length on the troubles
of the peach grower. It commences with
the nurseryman at the time the pit is
planted for no sooner is the little seedling
fairly taken root, than an enemy is ready
to devour it. This enemy is the Nema-
tode Angoulula, commonly called :root
knot. For a remedy or a preventative
from this nematode, we are forced to
appeal to nature for no artiﬁcial means
for controlling or eradicating praticable
for the orchardist, has been discovered.
The preventative nature provides is the
planting of the nursery or the orchard on
virgin soil, not subject to washes from
old ﬁeld land. This nematode, the An-
goulula, is present in all our light south-
ern soils, and only needs the presence of
plant roots pleasing to his majesty’s pal-
ate for him to feed upon to multiply in
myriads and so infest the land that a
young peach tree, however healthy when
placed there, cannot thrive. The only
known means of eradicating this pest
from the soil is heating it to a high de-
gree. or the saturation of the earth
with bi—sulphide- of carbon as sugges-
ted by Mr. Bessey in his valuable pa-
per on Nematodes. This is sometimes
practiced for potting earth for green-
house or bedding plants, but not practical

52 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
for the orchardist. Therefore the sim-
ple and effective preventative is to plant
on virgin soils, free from washes from old
ﬁelds. \Vith this simple precaution, and
planting trees free from the disease, no
serious annoyance should be experienced
from this source.
The next trouble likely to attract
the peach grower’s attention, will
probably be the borer. Many are the
devices that have been invented and reme—
dies tried all of which have proven more
or less a failure. Of these remediesl
believe the Porter system of treatment
the best and most practical. This system
of treatment as invited by Mr. C. M.
Porter of Douglas, Ga. and offered by
him in farm rights, consists of a series
of mounding, worming and applying a
caustic wash. We have tried it on our
own orchards, and from present obser-
vation and status of experiment believe
it of some value. The method of treat-
ment employed most largely in our own
orchards and by many of the largest and
most successful orchardists of the south,
is the banking around the trees to a
height of eight to ﬁfteen inches in July
and August, before the ﬂy deposits the
egg on the body of the trees. This forces
him to deposit the egg well up on the
body. In the fall or early winter this dirt
is removed,leaving the young larva in the
body of the tree well up in the air, where
the bark will harden as soon as the earth
is removed causing many to perish.
Would also recommend after removing
the earth, the scraping the body of the
tree from the crown roots up to 12 or 15
inches in height with a sharpedged instru-
ment, this will disturb and kill many more
of the young larva. The painting of the
bodies from the crown to the limbs after
the earth has been removed, with a strong
caustic solution, will also be beneﬁcial in
killing many of the larva and preventing
others that hatch higher up or that have
been knocked off from entering the bark.
After these precautions have been taken,
a few will likely have escaped, dig them
out with the point of pruning knife, as
soon as they show themselves by their
signs, an excretion of a half gummy half
sawdusty matter from the point where
the young larva entered and commenced
to feed, With these precautions no serious
trouble or loss should be experienced
from the borer.
The next annoyance noticed is likely to
be Gall knots on the roots and crowns
and which is generally accepted as Crown
Gall and if it is the true Crown Gall, I
consider that it has been much over-rated,
and especially so by some of the entomo-
'logists and pittiologists in some sections.
Mr. A. C. \Veiting Commissioner of
Agriculture, Albany, N. Y. in an article
in the National Nurserymen, in discuss-
ing Crown Gall said, “All Galls on the
roots are not Crown Galls, a distinction
between them may be made.” He fur-
ther said “the galls caused by aphids are
usally knotty and very 'hard, while the
Crown Gall is rather soft and as easily
cut as a turnip. Its tissues being brain
like in formation.” As the knots usually
found on the peach trees are usually hard
woody substance covered with- thick pul-
py bark and wart-like formation. I am
very doubtful about the most of it be-
ing the true Crown Gall. This Gall knot
has by some been confused with the root-
knot Angoulul'a, and by others with the
black-knot of the cherry and plum of the
states farther north. It is entirely dis-
tinct and different from the former, but

somewhat similar yet different from the
latter. It seems to be caused from a fun—
gus which I believe is either always pres-
ent or develops spontaneously in much
of our southern soil. This may be a lit-
tle radical and not in accordance with
some of my professional friends’ views,
but I will give one of my reasons for the
assertion and I believe the experience of
those present, who may have had occasion
to note same will sustain me. Natural
peach seed can be gathered, and I believe
if test wanted to be carried far enough,
sterilized sufﬁcient to kill any possible
germs on the exterior of the pits, and
planted in virgin soil, and a percent. will
develop these gall knots. In some piec-
es of ground not one tree in 5000 will
develop a knot, while in another plat,
or possibly in a different section of the
same ﬁeld, one or even two per cent. may
show it. The Marianna plum roots are
especially subject to the attack of Gall
knots. Cuttings from apparently healthy
trees can be planted in any ordinary ﬁeld,
grown one year, and grafted the follow-
ing winter with scions of the desired
variety taken from an equally healthy
tree, and by digging time, one to ten,
sometimes as high as ﬁfteen percent. will
develop gall knot. Now where did these
knots come from if, the fungus causing
same, was not either already present in
the soil simply waiting for a suitable
plant to establish itself upon or de-
veloped spontaneously. The loss from
these Gall knots is usually small. As a
remedy would advise removing the knots
if they appear on the body or crown of
the tree where they can be detected and
the cut place moistened with a saturated
solution of Blue stone water. They will
never appear again at the place. If you
get too much of the Sulphate of Copper
(Blue Stone) in the wound it may cause
a dead place in the wood. I have seen
these gall knots for twenty years, or ever
since the ﬁrst work I did in a nursery,
even before our own nursery was found-
ed. I have seen the same in all portions
of this State, in Georgia, Alabama and
my brother reports the same in Texas.
I cannot see that it is any worse now than
twenty years ago and do not believe that
it will be any more serious in twenty
years hence.
Will next consider the part in Florida
peach growing played by the most wide-
ly known and widely disseminated scale
insect of my knowledge. The San Jose
Scale. The rapid spread and dissemina—
tion of this scale insect caused more ac-
tivity and discussion by Entomologists
than all other scale insects and has caused
many very stringent State and Foreign
National laws to be enacted, some of
which are now proving a menace to
American fruit commerce. This scale
pest while bad if allowed to run its own
course, is easily controlled, either by
natural enemies, the Red or Brown
Fungus a native Florida Fungus dis—
covered by Prof P. H. Rolfs, now
Director Florida Experiment Station,
Lake City, Fla., and the other the
Chinese Lady Bird (Chilocorus Similis)
the Natural enemy of the San jose scale
in China, or by artiﬁcial means. The
most practical and successful artiﬁ-
cial means is the spraying of the
trees once or twice during the winter
months with lime, sulphur and salt
mixture. Two applications during the
dormant period is sufﬁcient to keep
the scale under perfect control if not
eradicating it until introduced again from

other infected trees. The following is
the formula for the lime, sulphur and
salt mixture and our method of prepar-
ing and applying it.
LIME, SULPHUR AND SALT MLXTURE.
Rock Lime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .21 pounds.
Flour of Sulphur . . . . . . . . . .15 pounds.
Salt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 5 pounds.
Water to make ﬁfty gallons.
The lime is placed in the cooking bar-
rel with about 10 or 12 gallons of water.
The steam is turned on, which agitates
the lime while slacking preventing it from
burning, and renders the slacking more
perfect. After lime is thoroughly slack—
ed ﬁll barrel about one-half full of water.
Mix the sulphur into a paste, after lime
is slacked add the sulphur paste and salt
and boil vigorously for forty minutes.
The arranging of cooking plant I will
be glad to explain to any one sufﬁciently
interested to write or ask about it.
In spray machinery we have used
everything from a knapsack sprayer to a
traction engine and steam pump, the lat-
ter carrying 20 to 30 nozzles, except the
gasoline power sprayer. The gasoline
power sprayers have never appealed to us
for two reasons, ﬁrst: The weight of en-
gine, pump and tank of water for cooling
engine, neccessary to haul around, and
second, the intricacy of the little engines
and a scarcity of a class of help with a
knowledge of gasoline engines that would
care to work in as disagreeable work as
spraying. When you have a days weath-
er, right for spraying you want the most
reliable machine possible. The most prac-
tical we have yet found is the Wallace
Sprayer, manufactured by Wallace Ma-
chinery Company. Champaign, Ill. The
pump is driven by a gear from the wheel,
one extra mule or horse will pull the ex-
tra load occasioned by this gearing and
maintain a pressure of from 90 to 120
pounds. For effective spraying a high
pressure must be maintained. The trac-
tion engine outﬁt did good service, though
do not know as it is an economical outﬁt,
the trouble came from the little annoy-
ances such as two or three of the nozzles
out of a cluster of four or six becoming
clogged, necessitating the stopping of the
remainder of the twenty or thirty noz-
zles for these two or three to be cleaned.
With this steam outﬁt, an engineer, ﬁre-
man and six men could spray thoroughly
one side of three rows of trees ranging
from I2 to I 5 feet in height, about one
half as fast as a man would natUrally
walk up and down the rows, covering
about ten acres a day. With the Wallace
outﬁt three mules and three men would
spray one side of one row at a little fas-
ter pace than the engine moved, in fact
the team was kept moving slowly and
steadily. \Vhile I do not know that the
Wallace Sprayers would be practical in
an orange grove, where a great amount
of leaf surface is to be covered but for
spraying peaches, while in a dormant con-
dition they are practical.
The curculio, curculio stung or wormy
peaches and plums are found in every old
peach growing section and in fact in near-
ly every plum thicket. Cures or remedies
for this little rascal are few and difﬁcult,
preventatives are about our only hope.
Here are a few of them.
Plant your trees in a place as far dis-
tant from other peach and plum trees
where you ﬁnd worms in the fruit, as
possible. Keep all brush heaps, old rot-
ten logs. and such trash cleaned out

55,
from the orchard, and away from around
it. Have if possible, a cleared and culti-
vated strip of ground from 150 to 200
feet between your orchard and uncleared
woodland. Trash'and rough woodland
harbors the curculio; in a large orchard
you will invariably ﬁnd worms worse next
to woods or near a pile of trash.
Jar the trees and pick up all fruit
that drops off and also stung fruit
found on the trees. This should be
repeated every two weeks from the time
that peaches are the size of a marble until
lthey are ready to ship. Never allow a
drop peach to be plowed under or decay
in the orchard for in 99 cases out of 100,
it has a worm in it that will develop in-
to a beetle that will ruin a thousand peach-
es next spring. Jarring the trees and
catching in a sheet or bug catcher the
peaches that fall and also the beetles .(cur-
culio) that may play o’possum and drop
off is an old method practiced by success-
ful plum growers in nearly all parts of
the country, and by peach growers in
many places. All the drop peaches that
may have dropped the night or day or so
before should also be picked up and de-
stroyed.
If these precautions are taken it will
be years before sufﬁcient worms will de-
velop in an orchard to be a menace to
the fruit. This year we are trying some
spray experiments for curculio and next
‘year hope to be able to report the results.
Brown Rot Fungus (Moniha Fructig-
ina) is another pest that must be com-
bated by preventatives rather than reme-
dies, for by the time it makes its appear-
ance and you commence applying your
remedy, the mischief is done. The pre-
cautions recommended forthe curculio
are the principal ones in preventing Brown
Rot. The removal of all decaying peaches
is important. Especially the mummied
peaches, that you may occasionally see
hanging in the trees. Plow the orchard
by blooming time every spring and be
sure to stir the entire surface. This will
disturb any mummied and decayed peach-
es that may have accidently been left in
the orchard and prevent them from
throwing up a lot of larger fungus growth
in the form of toad stools that will throw
off sufﬁcient brown rot fungus spores
from a single mummied peach to in'-
fest the trees of a ﬁve acre orchard.
All caustic spray solutions are ‘good
as fungicides, the lime sulphur and
salt mixture is equal to almost any
fungicide known and one or two
sprayings during the winter to kill-
scale, will rid the trees of all fungus
spores that may be carrying over on the
trees, again if these trees are well spray—
ed and well covered with this caustic so-
lution, at blooming time the spores that
may be thrown off from the toad stools
in the spring cannot get a foot hold on
the trees. Another precaution is to so
fertilize and cultivate the trees as not to
produce a heavy foliage, also trim all the
trees so as to be open in the middle when
carrying a load of fruit so as to admit
as much air and light as possible.
This I believe covers a list of insects.
and fungus pests that cause the worst,
trouble to the peach grower. The
same ones that we have here, trou-
ble them in the north also Georgia.
Alabama and Texas. Besides in the
north and in portions of the other statesv
mentioned they have peach yellows and
rosette neither of which have ever‘been
known within the state and either one of
which is more serious that all of the pests

we have. Ours can be combated, peach
yellow and rosette cannot. If they can
make a success of peach growing in other
less favored sections, are we to give it up
and acknowledge that we are not as skil-
full horticulturalists as they.
Now for the harvesting and shipping.
First, you should plant sufﬁcient acre-
age yourself or organize an association
in your neighborhood who would plant
sufﬁcient acreage to load and ship in car-
load lots, about thirty acres of a variety
is sufﬁcient for this, forty or ﬁfty would
be better. Grade and pack all the fruit
uniformly, being sure to have every
crate so full that you could not get anoth-
er peach in the baskets. Separate the fruit
' and don’t put any cull fruit in the bottom
of the baskets, let the bottom be as good
or better fruit than the top. Use nothing
to ﬁll up baskets but peaches. Excelsior
either in top or bottom, paper used in
any manner prevents ventilation, de—
ceives the buyer and makes a bad repu-
tation for your pack and brand. Have
the fruit graded and packed by pro-
fessional fruit packers, it will cost you
but little more and your pack is right.
Care in packing peaches is more im-
portant than any other fruit. In load-
ing your refrigerator cars, see that
the ear is clean and that nothing ob-
structs the ventilators between the ice
diests and the body of the car at each-
end both next to floor and at the ceiling.
This is necessary for circulation. Re-
member without circulation there will be
no refrigeration. Load peaches as soon
af-ter picking as possible and if you have
to detaincar more than one day, arrange
to get a ton and a half of ice to put in
bunkers, so as to have them as full as pos-
sible when car leaves the orchards. Ar-
range with the railroad to have car re-
ice-d as soon after leaving the orchard as
possible. Remember that the ﬁrst 24
hours after the fruit is placed in the car
is the critical time. The fruit continues
to ripen and mature until cooled and re—
frigerated to the pit. If car is poorly
iced and it takes 36 or 48 hours for this
refrigeration, the fruit has had that many
hours of ripening process going on with-
in it. and it matters not how well the car
is iced during the latter part of journey,
the damage is done and your fruit melts
down almost as soon as it comes from
the car. If good refrigeration can be
had at ﬁrst and the fruit cooled to refrig-
eration point in from 6 to 12 hours, the
iceing for the last part of the journey is
not so important.
Experiments are being made in quick
cooling of the fruit before the cars move,
by artiﬁcally circulating the cold air in
the car, and by this means bring the fruit
to a refrigeration point in from four to
six hours. Fruit quickly cooled this way,
is claimed to hold up, an almost indeﬁnite
time if temperature is kept reasonably
low, and when taken of? the ice holds up
almost as long as when picked direct
from the tree.
I will not attempt to tell a Florida Hor-
ticulturalist how to market his fruit.
But would say that of all fruit, you should
try to establish a reputation for your
pack of peaches and I would say put
enough of 'thern on one market so that
your commission house at least knows
that you are in the peach business.
Do not scatter your shipments a few crates
in a place, on such shipments is where
you are robbed by both express company
and questionable commission men.

as plums and pears are not generally
enough grown for commercial purposes,
I will not attempt to say anything with
reference to them. If however any mem-
ber knows of any plums of any special
merit, it would be of interest to myself
and dare say to others of the society, to
hear about them. The same for pears.
Supplementary to regular report would
say that a few days ago I sent out a cir-
cular letter, asking for information re-
lative. to present conditions of peaches in
several sections of the state with refer-
ence to damage by frosts of March Ist
and 22nd. Also about varieties grown in
the several sections. The following is
the essence of the replies received bear-
ing on these two points. Some mention
was made in some of the replies relative
to scale, gall knots and other troubles
all of which I think have been covered by

I estimate that the frost of March
20th and ZISt killed 75 per cent. of the

70 to 80 per cent. The Imperial and
other medium late varieties suffered very
little, practically full crop. In the Baker
county orchards near Macclenny, no Jew-
ells were planted. Waldos damages 60 to
75 per cent. Later varieties not hurt.
By studying the map of Florida you
can see that the setion in which damage
was done is comparatively small.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Henderson—As I have had a
good deal of experience in peach grow-
ing, I think I can give some points that
may be interesting. I used to think I
could not raise peaches without spraying.
1 have an orchard of about 100 acres and
last year we sprayed until I discovered
what has proven to be a red fungus. At
ﬁrst I did not know what it was. I sent
to the Experiment Station and found that
I had this red fungus and I stopped spray-
ing. I wrote and asked some questions.
I asked if I could trust my orchard in
the hands of this fungus if it was very
slightly affected. The answer was that I
could. The scale had practically killed
25 per cent. of my trees, but today I can-
not ﬁnd a single scale anywhere. The

scale is off and it was left in the hands of
this fungus alone. Today I am very
much more encouraged.
The San Jose scale is worse than any
other scale, but there is no let up of the
fungus until this scale is all off. I think
this is one of the greatest things for the
peach growers, in the State of Florida.
Take a limb with this fungus on it and
it will spread in moist weather in twenty-
four hours and little orange colored pim-
ples show over the trees. As soon as it
kills all the scale these become black spots
on the tree, hence the name black fungus.
Mr. Griﬂ'ing.—I would like to ask if
the trees were not pufting on new growth
after this fungus had been on it.
Mr. Henderson—They are, after hav-
ing been cut back. All the trees that
were affected with this scale have put on
beautiful new growth and some branches
are from ﬁve to eight feet long.
Mr. Wood—Should we cut back
healthy trees?
Mr. Henderson—By all means. Those
from ﬁve to six years old-
Mr. Wood—I cut back some of my
trees, but those I did not cut back had
more dense foilage.
Mr. Henderson—The fruit will be
better next year. The best time to cut it
back is just after the fruit is gathered.
say in July:
Mr. Ellis—What is the probable life
of the peach orchard from the time it is
planted.
Mr. Henderson—That depends on the
class of land and the kind of tree planted.
If- planted with yellow subsoil, the
orchard will be very poor and probably die
after it has borne three or four crops.
If the tops were cut off and a new crop
allowed to come on, it would probably
bear from twelve to fourteen crops of
fruit. The average crop is only from
seven.t0 eight crops.
Mr. Wood—Would you advise clean
culture.
Mr. Grifﬁng.—I would not, but would
advise plowing each spring. Be sure to
turn over every inch of the surface, then
let it grow up in beggar-weed. The beg-
gar-weed will save fertilizer bills.
Mr. Ellis—On a‘ land naturally salt,
would it do for peaches?
Mr. Grifﬁng.——I would‘not think so.
If old land is to be used for planting
a peach orchard, plant and grow velvet
beans and beggar weed on it for two or
three years before planting the peach
trees, letting nothing else but these grow
on the land. This will not only build up
'and fertilize the land, but will reduce the
nematodes in the soil to such an extent
that the young trees will become estab-
lished before the nematode sufﬁciently
increases in numbers to injure the tree.
The nematode, may cause some of the
trees to be short lived, yet fairly satis-
factory results may be expected.

Report of Standing Committee on Grapes, Figs
' and Kaki.
BY B. M. HAMPTON.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Fellow Members of the State Horti-
cultural Society of Florida:
For some reason beyond my ken, I have
been appointed as chairman of the stand-
ing committee on grapes, ﬁgs and kaki.
While I have had Some experience with
all of these fruits, I do not want you to
think for one moment, that I consider
myself as expert authority on any of
them; but I suppose you expect something
said on the subject, and so I will try and
add my mite.
The grape and the ﬁg, as you all know.
are among the oldest fruits of which his-
tory gives us any record. “Under your
own vine and ﬁg tree,” is as old as time
itself. The vine especially is almost
world-wide. Take, for instance, our own
country. You will ﬁnd it ﬂourishing on
the bleak and rocky hills of New England,
and ’mid the sunny glades of Florida,
as well as on the coral rocks of her thou-
sand keys or islands. One of the most
valuable fruits known to man is the grape,
and no home, however humble, should be
without its vine or more of the health-
ful grape.
Starting from the shores of the Cas-
pian Sea, you will ﬁnd it ﬂourishing in
many lands and under many conditions of
soil and climate. As I have already told
you, it grows from New England to the
southern extremity of the United States
with more or less proﬁt; but up to the
present time with less proﬁt in Florida
than in most other sections where it ﬂour-
ishes. And as I said before, everyone
should have a vine or two at least, for
their own use. When you have a near-
by market, other things being equal, you
can grow them with proﬁt in Florida; but
as a bread-winner to be shipped to a dis—
tant market, I do not think it has proven
a success.
I have known a number of vineyards to
be planted in Florida, but for some reason
they are soon dug up or alrandoned alto-
gether, thus intimating that commercial-
ly speaking, they were not a success. I
myself planted about two acres some ten
years ago. All went well until I came to
sell them. For some reason the fabulous
prices so often noted in the papers of
Florida, did not pan out.
I planted a number of kinds of the
Labrusca species or common grape grown
in the North for wine or the table mostly
—all seemed to do well—also quite a
number of different kinds of the Vini-
fera or raisin grape. Of the former spec-
ies, the White Niagara seemed to get the
closest to ﬁlling the bill; thrifty. proliﬁc
and a good quality, it is one of the most
satisfactory grapes for Florida. Like the
old speckled hen, it will give good returns
with lots of neglect. Then the Vinifera

species or raisin grapes that are so ex-
tensively grown on the western coast, in
California, for wine and raisins, whilst I
have given them, that is, most of those
grown on a large scale there, and some
that are not, a trial, I have never found
any that gave much promise of proﬁt;
though you can grow a few for home use,
and they are quite enticing for the novice
to experiment with. You see glowing ac-
counts in the papers of this one or that one
having phenomenal success with these
choice varieties and promising to revolu-
tionize grape culture in Florida. You
hear the report quite distinctly, but listen
in vain for the echo.
There are two kinds of the Vinifera
varieties that seem to be worthy of more
extensive notice and also a trial. The
one that I am acquainted with is the one
known as the St. Augustine grape. It is
thin of skin and of a good ﬂavor, quite
thrifty and proliﬁc, ripening in July, bun-
ches are large, berries resembling the Ca-
tawba; but the bunches are not so compact.
It thrives in and around St. Augustine,
and is supposed to have been brought from
NIarleria hv the Spanish in the early settle-
ment of the place. It seems to ﬂourish
and fruit with as little care as the Scup-
pernong, but ripening so much earlier than
the Scuppernong helps to extend the sea-
son for this fruit. Then at St. Augustine
thev have a blackish-purple grape, pretty
much the same as the above, and of the
same family, but having larger berries
and ripening when the other is about
gone. It is quite proliﬁc. Both of
them are supposed to come from Spain.
I traced their ancestry back for about one
hundred years, and then it seemed to end;
but all agree that it was brought from
Spain with the earliest settlement of St.
Augustine.
There is still another grape. said to
grow on the Keys in and around Key
West. I wrote to the board of trade of
Key West about the grape, but failed to
get any deﬁnite information.
From all I could learn, the grape is of
the Vinifera species, and without a doubt
came from Spain, though some say Eng-
land; but this I doubt. The vine is said to
be quite a thrifty grower and quite a pro-
liﬁc bearer. The grape is as large or larg-
er than the Niagara. The fruit itself is
reported to resemble the famed Malaga,
in color a reddish-purple, bunches large,
said to weigh from ﬁve to seven pounds.
Indeed, I have been told some of them
have been known to weigh as much as
twenty pounds; but I would advise taking
quite a liberal pinch of salt with the state-
ment about the size and weight of these
bunches. In fact, it would be well, per-
haps, to take a grain or so with the whole
story. Mr. E. V. Blackman is the only
one I have ever met that claims to have
seen the grape, and he says he has seen
the bunches that would weigh from ﬁve
to twelve pounds each. Some years ago
I had a talk with James Mott about this
grape. He took a trip to the Keys par—
ticularly to ﬁnd this grape, and if I re-
member rightly, failed to do so. The vine
is said to be quite tender, but in time
this might be overcome. I think perhaps
Mr. E. V. Blackman could give us some
deﬁnite information, he being so close to
where it is said to grow. I think it well
worth further investigation than I have
been able to give it.
Now as to the ﬁg. This is another
fruit, if you will allow me to call it a fruit;
for really it is not a true fruit. That
which we call fruit being the ﬂeshy recep-
tacle, of a conical form attached to the
branch by the narrow end, the broad end

or apex having a small opening. This ex-
pands somewhat, as the true ﬂowers open,
and the seeds mature within this ﬂeshy 1e-
ceptacle.
Be it ﬂower or fruit, it is of great value
to man wherever the climate will permit
of its growth—one of the most whole-
some and nourishing of the long list of
fruits given to man, either fresh, canned
or dried. I believe several kinds could be
grown proﬁtable in Florida, both for
home use and for canning and preserving
I have grown various kinds with more or
less success for the last twelve or ﬁfteen
years on high pine land. I ﬁnd the White
Marseilles, Brown Turkey, and the Bruns-
wick among the best for home use in
Florida. By having these three you will
always have ﬁgs in their Feason; but if
you have a choice spot of ground, rich and
moist; not wet, and feel willing to give
the tree a little extra care, then plant a
\Vhite Adriatic, and it will abundantly
pay you for all of your trouble; but it
must have moisture and plenty of fertiliz-
er in some form. Plenty of good cow-pen
manure is about. as good as anything
Then you can supplement this with some
good commercial fertilizer.
The ﬁg, like the grape,will grow readily
from cuttings taken at any time when the
tree is dormant and has shed its leaves.
November or December, I have found
about the best time to clip the cuttings.
Either plant these at once or bury them
until the beginning of February. then
plant in good, rich soil, just leaving one
or two buds above the ground and keep
the ground moist until well-rooted—not
wet, mind.
In writing these few lines on ﬁgs, I
have taken it for granted that all of you
know about them_ their culture and use.
I will just add that all of the kinds I have
mentioned are good for all home purposes
or for canning, preserving or drying. I
have made ﬁne dried ﬁgs out of each kind;
but I prefer the White Adriatic. I have
had this ﬁg to cure right on the tree. It
is larger than the others when properly
grown, and to my way of thinking, much
better. It is greenish-white in color and
has a thin, but exceedingly tough skin.
with a rich crimson sweet pulp, a ﬁne
ﬂavor, and is especially sweet—well worth
the extra care you have given it. Every
home in Florida should have at least a
few trees for home use.
N 0w a few words on the Kaki or jap-
anese Persimmon, and I am done. This
fruit, I think, will in time be of more pro-
ﬁt to Florida commercially speaking than
either of the others. But in the ﬁrst place,
one should give them names, good Eng-
lish names, that all can pronounce without
giving them the lockjaw. There is much
in an attractive name. Give a fruit a pret-
ty sounding name, and the battle is about
half won. This fruit is just in its infancy
in this country; so that we have much to
learn as to what varieties to grow and cul-
ture of same. Some say to give thorough g
culture; others tell you just to fertilize and
let alone. I have known them to do well
under both culture and non-culture. I
planted quite a grove of this fruit some
years ago and gave it clean culture. The
trees grew nicely, but I sold the grove be-
fore they came into bearing. and now I
have but a few trees just coming into hear-
ing. These are on high pine land, with
the usual grayish top-soil, yellowish or
‘ reddish sub-soil, underlaid with red clay.
at Lakemont, Polk county, Florida.
In some sections of Florida, particularly
where I speak of, the japanese persimmon,
so far as I know, has been a shy bearer. I
_ have tried a number of years to get the
Tannenashi to fruit, but to no purpose;
so ﬁnally I dug it up. This is a ﬁne fruit

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 63
-one of the best, and in many places
fruits abundantly. It is a very large fruit, _
conical in shape, skin reddish-yellow, with
few seeds—many fruit none at all—and
a good shipper when not allowed to get
too ripe before shipping. This variety is
very attractive to the eye and as good as
it is attractive; but for some reason I
could never get it to fruit to amount to
anything, though the wild persimmon
fruited in abundance all around me; but
because the Tannenashi would not fruit
for me, I did not give it up, for some had
trees in bearing of other varieties, but all
had a good many seeds and all were of
medium size—good to be sure—but not
extra. But, at last in an obscure corner,
I noticed a tree that bore full crops every
year. The fruit was large, tomato-shaped
and of the deepest red in color, covered
with a rich bloom like a plum, seedless
and less astringent than most varieties,
and was of a ﬁner, richer ﬂavor than any
fruit of the kind I had ever eaten, and I
think that I have sampled all of the choice
varieties around St. Augustine, the home
of this fruit; for at this place they all seem
to fruit without any trouble. I further
noticed when a bud was taken from this
particular tree, which for want of a better
name, I shall call “Hampton’s Choice,”
simply to designate it from others (I have '
tried in most of the catalogues to locate
this variety, but so far have failed,) and
budded on a Tannenashi that refused to
hold its fruit, that branch would be full of
fruit while the rest of the tree would have
but few or none. It will thus appear that
the “Hampton’s Choice” was immune to
that which caused the Tannenashi to drop
its fruit.
()11 the high, sandy land at Lakemont.
as yet I have but two or three trees in
bearing. They were grafted on the wild,
small stock three years ago the past season
and bore full crops of fruit last season
and this; however, the trees are but from
four to six feet high and had but little
care. I have been away from my grove
most of the time for the past two years
I have gathered this fruit when fully
colored and kept it in the house for even
four weeks, and at the end of that time it
was sound and as ﬁne in quality as a per.
simmon ever gets. The past fall of 1905
I gathered among others, one fruit that
was quite hard and only partly colored.
This was early in November, and this
fruit was kept until Christmas without
showing any signs of decay. Then it was
in good condition to eat and was good as
one could ask it to be, thus proving its
keeping and shipping qualities. The
fruit is large, fr0m two to three inches in
diameter and of the deepest red and en—
tirely seedless, never having found a sin-
gle seed in a fruit. Yet I do not know of
any persimmon so highly colored that can
be eaten when as solid as a good, ripe ap-
ple, and then lacking in the astringent
qualities that other persimmons would
have at that stage of ripeness.
While this persimmon may have been
grown by some for years, certainly I
have never been able to locate it among
others on the fruit stands in Floridaf I
sometimes think, however, it is simply
the section it is grown in that makes it
appear different from some of the listed
varieties. But one thing is sure, it is the
persimmon par excellence for the high,
pine land, and the one of all others I
could plant on such land for proﬁt or
home use.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Grifﬁng.——I would like to hear
'from Mr. Macklin who has had some ex-
perience in growing persimmons.
Mr. Macklin.—As I read a paper before


## p. 64 (#244) #############################################

64 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
this society last year on this subject I did
not expect to say anything at this meet-
ing. Nevertheless there are a few re-
marks I would like to make.
I most heartily endorse the remarks
of Mr. Hampton, in the paper just read,
on the use of the word “kaki.” \Ve do
not call an orange a peach, or a pineapple
by its botanical name and I see no reason
why we should do so with the persimmon.
We have a good English name for the
fruit so why not use it. I would very
much like to see that the word “kaki”
discontinued in the reports of this society.
I have been at considerable pains for
several years past to introduce this fruit
into northern markets as the Japanese
persimmon and if I have to begin all
over again with “‘kaki” I shall despair
of success.
Up till this season I was under the im-
pression that the persimmon was so late
blooming as to be immune from frost but
this spring a frost on March 21st damag-
ed the crop considerably.
As regards markets, some places will
have them while others will not. In New
York they sell fairly well, yet Boston
which is only a short distance away, will
not give a paying price for them. It
looks as though the Bostonians were too
conservative and would not eat anything
that is new. Since reading a paper on
persimmons here last year my orchard of
the Haycheya variety shows signs of in-
creasing its crop with the increased age
of the trees.
Mr. Griﬁing.-—Is the Yemon variety
holding its fruit as well as the others.
Mr. Macklin.—-I have only three varie-
ties in commercial quantities, the Hya-
kume, Tannenashi, and Haycheya, the
Tannenashi I ﬁnd to be the best.
Mr. Henderson—We can have the per-
_simmon so long that I think there are
few fruits better. We can have them
from the ﬁrst of August until March. I
have only six varieties- The Tannenashi
is the best I have. They are of a large
beautiful shape and carry well, better
than any I have. I kept some of them
until after Christmas and they were per-
fect. I think we should have more Japan-
ese persimmions and grapes.
Mr. Grilling—I would call attention
to the fact that we may use the persim-
mon to good advantage in diversifying
our products. The Japanese persimmon
is the very best food for hogs. There is
one variety the Zengi that ripens and
commences dropping in August and con-
tinues until December. Hogs are very
fond of these and will fatten on them.
Mr. Steele—In their report on ﬁgs.
there are two varieties left out that have
proven to be very good with me. The
Celeste. the little sugar ﬁg, as it is called
is always to be desired. The Poulette ﬁg
is one of the best that I ever tasted.
Mr. Blackman—Some four or ﬁve
years ago there was quite a stir about the
Key grape. At several different times
there were brought to my ofﬁce, bunches
that weighed from 3 to 5 pounds each.
and much larger bunches have been
known to be produced. So far as we
know they are a very good grape; but will
not compare with some of the ﬁner va-
rieties. There is one diﬂiculty regard-
ing this grape, the berries do not ripen
evenly and the vines are short lived. I
know one party who secured a good many
cuttings, all of which grew for a time
and then died. Rev. Bolton of Cocoanut
Grove at one time had a number of vines
in fruiting; but they have since died out.

Report of Standing Committee on Pineapples and
Other Tropical Fruits.

MANGOES.
BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Among the tropical fruits that are be-
ing introduced into Florida, no one is
more certain to make a deﬁnite impres-
sion upon the market than the new man-
gos. The fruit produced by the mulgoba
exhibits such a character that it will push
its way into the market were it to com-
pete with peaches; but fortunately it rip-
ens just ahead of that crop, and so we
will not be thrown into actual competi—
tion with this luscious fruit. The mul-
goba budwood can now be had in almost
any quantity that any one desires in Flor-
ida. There is still some difﬁculty ex—
perienced in propagating and setting out
the trees. From my experience in this
matter I am inclined to believe that we
shall have to adopt methods for the pro-
pagation and setting out of these trees
that are radically different from those
practiced in setting out citrus trees. As
citrus growers we are apt to make this
our standard, and anything that does not
conform to the methods of procedure that
we have adopted for growing citrus trees
is considered to be extra difﬁcult, or else
not worthy of attention. We are also
apt to draw a long breath when the nur-
seryman confronts us with a price for
these trees that is probably ten times as
high as that of citrus trees. Here again
we allow our standard to interfere with
our business methods. We should re-
member that mulgoba trees are really rari-
ties.
PROPAGATING.
Budding of mangos is not only pos-
sible but may be done proﬁtably. The
mango nursery, however, must be radi-
cally different from that of the citrus
nursery. For general purposes I think
the methods advised by Mr- John 'B.
Beach, and which he has published re-
peatedly in the agricultural papers, and
also in addresses to the Horticultural So-
ciety, are probably familiar to every one
here, so I will not take them up again at
this point.
AREAS ADAPTED TO MANGOS.
If we will examine the map of Florida
we will see that all of that area on the
East Coast south from Mangonia and on
the West Coast south from Caloosahat-
chee River, is adapted to mango growing.
In addition to this general area there are
isolated areas to the north of this in which
mangos can be grown with a fair degree
of assurance that crops will be obtained.
Several years ago a considerable number
of mango trees were fruited in the vici-
nity of St. Petersburg. In this region
there are trees sufﬁciently large to pro-
duce a considerable quantity of fruit.
Various places on the Manatee River are
also quite certain to produce paying quan-

nties of mangos. I will not attempt to
enumerate further the isolated localities
where mangos may be yrcwn. To :1
large extent this will have to be deter-
mined by actual experiments. In a gen-
eral way we may say, however, that
wherever citrus fruits may hang on the
free all the winter and never become frost-
ed it will be possible to grow the mango.
This deﬁnition for a region in which
mangos can be grown should not be taken
too strictly as we know that under cer-
tain peculiar conditions a few citrus fruits
pass winter in orchards where the greater
bulk of the fruit is frosted.
We are hopefully looking forward this
year to the fruiting of Alphonse mangos.
This variety is said to be very much bet-
ter than the mulgoba. To us who have
eaten the mulgoba, however, this sounds
like sweetening honey or perfuming the
rose.
MANGO RACES.
The mango. so far as I have examin-
ed the fruits critically. seem to group
themselves into the following races: 1st,
The Number Eleven; and, The Pineapple;
3rd, The Manilla; 4th, The Apricot-Ap-
ple; and 5th. The Bombay.
First. The Number Eleven group,
which is composed of seedlings running
to well-marked varieties, is early ripen-
ing, ﬁat fruit, and long tapering fruit,
weak ﬁbre. but profuse; color. pinkish
or reddish. Tree tall upright growing.
The leaves medium smooth and veining
not prominent. Stigmatic area even.
Skin medium and not tough.
Second. The Pineapple group, is early
ripening. Leaves medium, smooth and
veining not prominent. Stigmatic area
prominent early ripening. The fruit
medium size, tapering to obtuse point at
stigmatic area; ﬁbres medium, profuse;
color light orange with strawberry cheeks:
skin medium and rather strong.
Third. The Manila, which is said to
be the same as the Philippine of Cuba,
ripens early; ﬁat fruit; tapering; long;
ﬁbres very weak and scanty. Color, lem-
on or a little darker. It ripens about the
same time as the pineapple, and many hy-
brids. and all intergradations were seen,
but the two types are very distinct. Skin
very thin but tough.
Fourth. The Apple-apricot group con-
tains a number of named varieties. The
tree is of a low, spreading growth.
Leaves rather short. Fruit ripens late
Very full at side. Very short. Stigmatic
area well up on ventral side. Color uni-
form yellow; between orange and lemon.
Fibres very coarse and strong, though
scattered. Skin thick and tough.
Fifth. Bombay, including mulgoba.
Late ripening; fruit short for its diame-
ter; sides very full; stigmatic surface
well up on ventral surface; frequently
grooved along lower portion of ventral
surface; ﬁbres scant and very weak; con-
ﬁned mostly to ventral and dorsal sides:
skin very thick; not leathery; ground
color, green turning to yellow with rosy
check. The tree is a vigorous grower
and is between upright and spreading.
and the leaves are rather small and rigid
with the veins prominent.
AVOCADOS.
For a money crop in the sub-tropical
region of Florida. this has a very prom-
ising outlook. During the last ﬁve
years a very great amount of work
has been done in systematizing the vari-
eties and in working up the methods of
propagation. In connection with this
work, I may be allowed to say that among

the avocados as among the citrus vari-
_eties, we strike some that are particularly
difﬁcult to bud, and others that take very
readily. Buds of the Chapellow avocado
live with the greatest ease. The Trapp
avocado does so somewhat less readily;
the Pollock buds fairly easily. and the
Baldwin requires considerable attention
to work well. The family avocado is
one which begins to ripen in July, and
continues to ripen its fruit until late in
October and November. It should not
be planted for commercial purposes, but
is one well worth having at the home
place.
TRANSPLANTING.
Lately a great deal has been said
about the difﬁculty of transplanting
avacados. Just why this should occur,
I do not know. I know that a certain
disease occurs upon the young trees,
which is especially apt to strike in at
the point where the stock is cut off.
This difficulty can be avoided to a con-
siderable extent by waxing over the stock
at this point when it is cut off, or by
painting it over. Then the shock of trans-
planting is apt to prove somewhat severe
and the tree apt tO die back to the bud.
In my own ﬁeld there seems to have been
no difficulty in planting avocado seed-
lings. As a matter of fact, I have turned
this work over to colored labor, and the
success met with has been somewhat bet—
ter than the experiences in having col-
ored labor set out citrus trees. From my
experience in this matter I am inclined to
believe that there is no greater difﬁculty
in having avocados set out than in having
citrus trees set out. '
SA PODILLOS.
This is one of the fruits that origi-
nated in the Western Hemisphere. In
fact, it has not been domesticated in the
true sense of the word. A few seedling
trees have been planted out in the Antil-
lian region, which includes the West In-
dies, the eastern portion Of Mexico, the
eastern coast of Yucatan, and in the
southern portion of Florida. They also
occur as native trees down through the
central portion of Mexico, and I believe
in South America.
This species adapts itself to cultiva-
tion very readily. The number Of vari~
eties, however, are about as great as the
number of seedlings that come into bear-
ing. In the Miami and Key West market
a very careful distinction is made between
the better and the inferior fruits. In
Miami some of the largest and ﬁnest of
this fruit sell for high as ten cents apiece,
and the smaller varieties one can fre-
quently buy at ten cents a dozen. Syste-
matic work at propagating and improving
sapodillos has already begun at the Sub-
tropical Laboratory.
The region through which sapodillos
may be grown successfully, is practical-
ly coincident with. the region where the
mango may be grown.
CERIMAN.
(Monstera deliciosus). This plant be—
longs to the peculiar family of aroids
which includes the calla lily, the tania
and various other tropical species the
roots Of which are used for food.
This plant has been grown for a
number of years and fruited in the vicini—
ty of Miami; also at Mangonia. In the
conservatories of the North, it has also
been fruited repeatedly. In the regions
where only a little frost occurs, and freez-
es are never known, this plant can be
grown successfully under a pineapple shed.
It produces a creeping trunk that is about
four inches in diameter, and if permitted,

will grow on the wall to the top of the
highest conservatories. In such positions
the trunk is rarely more than one and
one-half to two inches in diameter. For
fruiting purposes, however, it is better
to prevent the vine from climbing at all.
Under pineapple sheds it blooms profuse-
ly, and it fruits rather abundantly. Every
bloom is almost certain to make a fruit.
PROPAGATION.
For propagating purposes the trunks
are cut into segments in such a way as to
leave an eye on each segment. These
segments are planted out and struck with
a fair degree of success. In the course of
two or three years, if these plants are well
cared for; they will produce fruit. It is
about I4 months from the time of bloom-
ing for the fruits to ripen.
TYESS.
This is also sometimes called egg-fruit.
N o systematic effort has yet been made to
bring this fruit into the best state of cul-
tivation. Only seedling trees have fruit
and the product of these is exceedingly
variable—good, indifferent, and bad, I
think the extreme of inconsistency was
met in this fruit in the tree which was
fruited by Prof. Gale, at Mangonia. This
tree fruited abundantly and gave a ﬁne-
looking specimen. Some of them were
sweet and delicious, other fruits from the
same tree were only indifferent, and some
of the fruits growing on the same tree.
and taken from among the good fruits
were extremely bitter. Even the same
fruits were somewhat variable; one side
being quite palatable while the other side
would be distinctly bitter.
THE LOSS OF PLANT FOOD IN PINEAPPLE AND OTHER
COARSE SANDY SOILS.
BY A. \V. BLAIR.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
A very interesting point which has been
brought out by the pineapple fertilizer ex-
periment, is the great discrepancy be-
tween the amount of plant food applied
to an acre of pineapples and the amount
that is acutally removed by the crop
taken from an acre, inculding fruit. slips
and suckers.
AN UNBALANCED ACCOUNT
To illustrate, we may ﬁrst take one of
the plots from the experiment, which has
been fertilized at the rate of 3750 pounds
per acre. This plot received annually one
pound of actual phosphoric acid, one and
one fourth pounds nitrogen and two and
one half pounds of actual potash. Multi-
plying these ﬁgures by 150 (the plots be-
ing 1-150 of an acre in size) gives to one
acre I50 pounds of actual phosphoric acid.
187 I-2 pounds of nitrogen and 375
pounds of actual potash, or 712 1-2
pounds of actual plant food in one year.
Now, if we allow that this acre pro-
duces 500 crates of pineapples, each
weighing 70 pounds net, the amount of
plant food removed by this 35,000 pounds
of fruit would be, as calculated from the


## p. 69 (#249) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. @
average of a number of analyses, 15
pounds actual phosphoric acid, 25 pounds
nitrogen and 79 pounds of actual potash,
or a total of 119 pounds of actual plant
food.
This does not take into account that
which is removed with slips and suckers,
which unfortunately has not yet been de-
termined, but allowing that these would
remove as much as the fruit, which is,
I believe, an exceedingly liberal allow-
ance, there would be removed from the
acre a total of 238 pounds of plant food
against 712 1-2 applied, a loss somewhere
amounting to 474 1-2 pounds—66.6 per
cent.
To take a more familiar instance, the
grower who puts on 3000 pounds per acre
of a fertilizer which would analyze 4 per
cent. available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent.
ammonia, and 7 1-2 per cent. potash, ap-
plies 120 pounds actual phosphoric acid,
123 pounds nitrogen and 225 pounds ac-
tual potash, or a total of 468 pounds of
actual plant food, and if he gathers 350
crates of pineapples per acre, which would
be a good average yield, he removes from
his soil 10.36 pounds actual phosphoric
acid, 17.32 pounds nitrogen, and 55.26
pounds actual potash or a total of about
83 pounds of plant food from the acre.
If here, as before, we allow that slips
and suckers taken off, remove an amount
equal to the fruit, the total amount re-
moved in this case would be 166 pounds
against 486 applied, a loss somewhere of
302 pounds—64. 5 per cent. But this pro-
bably does not represent the entire loss,
for in many instances there is added, over
and above what has been counted, some
phOsphoric acid which is not reckoned as
available, but which, nevertheless, does
become slowly available, and undoubted-
ly some of this would be lost.
WHERE THE BALANCE GOES.
Now what becomes of this lost plant
food? If it remained in the soil within
reach of the plant, the soil would increase
in fertility more rapidly than it does. We
are driven to the conclusion that the
greater part of it is carried down by the
rains and is ﬁnally lost in the water table
below. Perhaps a small amount of the
nitrogen escapes into the air.
A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION.
In an effort to explain this unprecedent-
ed loss, for certainly in no other ﬁeld
crop is the percentage of loss so great,
I have recently conducted some experi-
ments to show the rate at which water
percolates through different types of soils,
and the consequent loss of plant food.
And while it is true that the conditions
in the laboratory were not the conditions
that exist in the ﬁeld, still the results are
relative, and serve in a way, to illustrate
what takes place in the soil.
Four glass tubes of equal size were
taken and one end closed with perforated
disc and ﬁlter paper, thus retaining the
soil but allowing a solution to pass
through. Into each was placed air dried
soil as follows: No. I, 150 grams (be-
tween ﬁve and six ounces) of South Car-
olina clay soil; No. 2, 150 grams Colum-
bia Co. virgin soil; No. 3, 150 grams of
typical pineapple soil, and No. 4, 150
grams of muck soil. Into each was pour-
ed 100 cubic centimeters (a little less
than a gill) of water containing one
gram of sulphate of ammonia, and the
following observations made:
1) Time required for the solution to
begin dropping through. '
(2) Time of completion.

This emphasizes very forcibly the fact
that the coarser the soil, the more rapidly
the water and plant food get away, and
it perhaps gives us a clearer idea of the
conditions which exist in the pineapple
belt. There we have a very coarse soil.
composed of almost pure sand, through
which water runs almost as it would run
through a pile of stones, carrying much
of the soluble plant food with it. The
question then arises. what is there about
clay soils, and other ﬁne soils, to hold
plant food and moisture, that is wanting
in the pineapple soils?
THE WORK OF OTHER INVESTIGATORS.
The researches of Way and other emi-
nent investigators have shown that most
soils have an absorptive power with re-
ference to plant food.
In the case of phosphoric acid this is
not difficult to explain, as the acid forms
insoluble compounds with the iron, lime.
and magnesium. which are present in
most soils, and is in turn rendered slowly
available by the action of the solutions
contained in the roots of the plants.
As to the absorption of the alkalies,the
explanation is more difﬁcult, since nearly
all their‘compounds are readily soluble in
water; the potash salts for example. Since
most soils consist of sand, clay, and or-
ganic matter, Way went to work to de~
termine which of these constituents ex-
ercised the absorptive power. Without
describing in detail his methods it will
sufﬁce to say that he showed that clay
alone is capable of absorption phenomena.
(It should be borne in mind that the
term absorptive power as used here re-
fers to a chemical change, and not to phy-
sical absorption as when a sponge absorbs
water).
Having shown that clay was the main
constituent in a soil which caused the
absorption of alkalies, Way next tried to
trace out the particular compound which
caused the absorption, and ﬁnally suc-
ceeded in producing a hydrated silicate of
aluminum and soda which exhibted dis—
placement and absorptive properties very
similar to those shown by the soil.
Then Eichorn hit upon the idea of try-
ing natural hydrated silicates, or zeolites


## p. 71 (#251) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 71
and found that they exhibited the same
power as Way’s artiﬁcial ones. Other
investigators have shown that the absorp-
tive power bears a close relation to the
amount of soluble silicates present. That
is to say the absorption of salts of the
alkalies, accompanied by the change of
base, is due chiefly to the presence of
zeolitic materials in the soil.
There is besides this purely chemical
absorption of salts by the soil, a physical
absorption, which is illustrated by the ab—
sorption of water containing dissolved
salts, by the organic matter of a muck
soil; even sand will hold back a limited
amount of dissolved salts. but the amount
is in proportion to the ﬁneness of the
soil, and that it is held in a merely me-
chanical way can be‘demonstrated from
the ease with which it is washed out.
IMPORTANCE OF THE ABSORPTIVE POWER
OF THE SOIL.
The importance of this absorptive pow-
er can scarcely be estimated. Houston and
Goss formerly of the Indiana Station,
have pointed out that by means of this
power those mineral ingredients of plant
food of which most soils contain but lit--
tle, referring more especially to phosphor-
ic acid and potash, are held in a form too
insoluble to allow of rapid loss by drain-
age, and still soluble enough to answer
the needs of vegetation, provided the
store is large enough. This cannot, how-
ever, be said to apply to nitrogen in the
form of salts of nitric acid, but here na-
ture has made. a wise provision for this
element by binding it in the form of or-
ganic bodies which nitrify ‘but slowly,
and by supplying each year a small
amount from the atmosphere. Houston
and Goss concludetheir discussion of the
importance of soil absorption with the fol-
lowing statements: “By means of the ab-
sorptive power of soils, the farmer if he
puts on an excess of potash and phos-
phoric acids as a fertilizer, does not lose
it, but is able to reap the beneﬁts from it
in the next year’s crop: If it were not
for this power the best method for apply-
ing fertilizers would be a much more
complicated problem than it is at present,
' as it would be necessary to apply them at
just the proper season and in nicely re-
gulated amounts to insure against loss.”
PINEAPPLE SOILS LACKING IN ABSORPTIVE
POWERS.
Of course Houston and Gross did not
have in mind such soils as the East Coast
pineapple soils when they wrote this, for
we have there just the conditions which
they say would make the problem of fer-
tilizer application much more complicated
than it is, and make it necessary to apply
them at just the proper season and in
nicely regulated amounts to insure against
loss. ‘
We have there a soil which is practi—
cally devoid of clay and therefore of sol-
uble silicates; which contains only traces
of iron, lime and magnesia, and a com-
paratively small amount of organic mat~
ter but which is, on the other hand,
98 to 99.5 per cent. sand—much of it
being very coarse sand—hence there are
wanting nearly all thgse properties which
in ordinary soils would effect the absorp-
tion of soluble plant food, and instead of
being held there in a form suitable for uti-
lization by the plant roots, it is there in
quite soluble forms, and as the rains come
it goes down and down into the soil' wa-
ters below. Only that portion is stored

72 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
up which the roots actually get hold of,
and that which is mechanically held, and
in such coarse sand, the amount mechani-
cally held is quite small as has been dem-
onstrated by leaching tests.
Even organic fertilizers such as bone
meal, cottonseed meal, dried blood and
castor pomace are slowly converted into
soluble forms in the soil, and on account
of the almost entire absence of those
substances which produce absorption phe—
nomena (a binding of soluble plant food)
a large part of this soluble plant food, if
not used at once by the plants, goes down
with the ﬁrst rain that comes.
VALUE OF SLOWLY AVAILABLE MATERIALS.
However, there is a great advantage in
using these slowly available forms over
the readily soluble forms, for all the while
that they are thus being made available,
the plants are being beneﬁted, and the ex-
cess to be carried away by percolation is
not so great.
I believe one of the merits of slag phos-
phate lies in its somewhat insoluble, but
nevertheless slowly available form of
phosphoric acid. When applied from
year to year, a small amount is being ren-
dered available all the time, and at the
same time no very great amount is lost
by percolation. I further believe that if
we could get a more slowly available form
of potash for such soils, the problem of
fertilizing pineapples would be simpliﬁed
and the expense reduced. The good re-
sults obtained with tobacco stems might
possibly be attributed to the fact that the
potash becomes slowly available, and thus
in the end is nearly all taken up by the
plant.
PLANT FOOD AND CAPILLARY ACTION.
But some one asks, may not much of
this lost plant food be recovered and
brought within reach of the plant roots
by the capillary action of the soil mois-
ture?
If the soil were a clay or a clay loam
the answer would certainly be in the at-
ﬁrmative, but in such coarse sandy soils
the conditions are very different. It is a
well-know physical fact that when three
tubes of different internal diameters are
placed open end in water, the water will
rise highest in the smallest tube, that is
the smaller the tube the greater the capil-
lary action. So with the soil, the ﬁner the
particles the greater the capillary action,
and as the particles of sand composing
the pineapple soils are very large in com-
parison with the particles that make up.
clay soil, so the amount of water_ and
hence of plant food, brought up from a
deep soil by capillary action is correspond-
ingly smaller. Hence it is that plant food
when once lost in 'the waters of the sub-
soil, are recovered but slowly and with
great difﬁculty by capillary action. This
was well illustrated by another experi-
ment conducted in our laboratory.
Over the end of a glass tube of about
3-4 in. internal diameter, was tied a piece
of muslin cloth, and into the tube was
placed the pineapple soil to a depth of 12
in. The tube was then suspended so that
the end over which the cloth was tied just
touched the surface of distilled water con-
tained in a beaker. At the end of three
days the highest point at which the soil
had been moistened by capillary water
was 3 3-8 in. The same experiment was
tried with the Columbia Co. soil, and the
S. C. clay soil with the result that at the


## p. 73 (#253) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 73
end of the three days the Columbia Co.
soil was moistened to a height of 8 3-8 in.,
and the S. C. clay soil 10 7-8 in. In each
case the tube was weighed with the dry
soil, and again at the expiration of the
three days. The pineapple soil retained
8.9 grams of water, the Columbia C0.
soil 23.4 grams. and the S. C. clay 27.2
grams or a little more than three times
as much as the pineapple soil. This indi-
cates very clearly the difference in cap-
illary action. In the pineapple soils the
grains are large and as a consequence
many of the spaces between them are too
large for capillary spaces.
To illustrate in another way, if you
could put these grains of sand together
into the form of a lamp wick, you would
still have a very poor medium for lifting
oil, but if the wick be made of ﬁne par-
ticles of asbestos, which is also a mineral,
the oil is raised without difficulty and a
good ﬂame is the result.
SOME REMEDIES SUGGESTED.
Then is it possible to do anything to
prevent this great loss of plant food?
Certainly it is not possible and perhaps
not desirable to convert the sandy soils
into clay soils, nor even to mix with the
sand a small percentage of clay.
I will mention a few ways that have
suggested themselves to me.
(1) By increasing the amount of or-
ganic matter in the soil.
It is a well established fact that organic
matter acts as a sponge to hold moisture,
and in holding water it will hold plant
food. This was well illustrated in the
experiment with the soil. 150 grams of
an air dry muck soil retained over 100
grams of water, and 90.9 per cent. of
the sulphate of ammOnia. Whereas the
same weight of the pineapple soil retain-
ed only 30 grams of water and 5.77 per
cent. of the sulphate of ammonia. Old
pineapple plants and other organic matter
might be allowed to decay on the ﬁelds in-
stead of being burnt. In some cases it
might be possible to increase the organic
mat-ter by spreading seaweed and muck
soil over the ﬁelds. Other ways will doubt-
less suggest themselves to those interest-
ed. O-f course the pineapple grower can-
not resort to cover crops such as velvet
beans, cow peas, beggar weed etc., as can
the man who grows ordinary ﬁeld crops.
(2) By the use of wind breaks.
Currents of dry hot air passing over
the ﬁelds cause the surface moisture to
evaporate rapidly, thus to a certain de-
gree breaking the chain of capillary mois-
ture.
(3) By the addition of lime to the soil.
Lime coagulates the soluble nitrogen-
ous matter of manures and fertilizers, and
this coagulated nitrogenous matter tends
to make the soil more retentive of mois-
ture; moreover lime, before it is carried
very far down would probably begin to
bind the grains of sand together and thus
form a layer somewhat impervious to
the downward movement of the water.
In the use of lime, however. care must
be exercised that it be not applied in such
a way as to cause the loss of ammonia
from other materials,
(4) By using materials which become
slowly available.
For such a crop as pineapples where
the plants remain in the ground from year
to year, there would seem little reason for
using quickly available materials except
say for the ﬁrst 18 months to get the
plants started, even had we a soil that
was capable of absorbing and holding the
plant food.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
After a certain amount of these slowly
available materials have been added to
the soil, some plant food is being rendered
available all the time, and as the roots
are there ready to utilize it——perhaps al-
most as rapidly as it becomes available—
not so much is lost by seepage to the soil
waters below. It seems to me, too that
this might apply to the fertilization of
orange trees.
(5) By shading.
Shading undoubtedly conserves soil
moisture, and if we can retain the soil
moisture near the surface, it not only
means more water for the plant, but it
also means more water, and with it more
plant food, brought up from the deep sub-
soil by capillary action.
In the light of the evidence before us
I am strongly inclined to the belief that
it would be economy to fertilize pineap-
ples from four to six. instead of two to
three times a year. I am aware that this
is not in accord with recommendations
made in the recent bulletin on fertilizer
experiments with pineapples, but at the
time those recommendations were made
we had not discovered that the loss of
plant food on pineapple soils was so great

week, you would expect much of it to be
wasted; so, if you give to your pineapples
at one time, plant food enough to sustain
them six months, and there is nothing in
the soil to bind or absorb this plant food,
so that it may be given out again gradu-
ally, there must necessarily be much loss.
At present I know of no experimental
evidence on which to base such a state-
ment. but reasoning along the lines indi-.
cated, I am of the opinion that 2000
pounds of fertilizer applied at intervals
of two or three months would be as ef-
fective as 3500 pounds of the same
material in two applications.
There is, however, the difﬁculty that
the extra expense of frequent applications
might outweigh the cost of the extra fer-
tilizer required in the case of two applica-
tions. This of course could be determin-
ed by experiment, and as the Chairman of
the Committee on Fertilizers and Irriga-
tion points out in his paper, it would no
doubt be a proﬁtable ﬁeld for investiga-
tion along other lines than pineapple
growmg.
SOME NOTES ON THE PINEAPPLE EXPERIMENT
AT JENSEN.
BY A. W.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
A bulletin giving full account of this
experiment up to and including the crop
for last year has recently been published
by the Experiment Station, and will very
soon be distributed, but I trust that I may

the object and plan of the experiment,
mention some of the more important re-
sults obtained, and perhaps raise some
questions which it may be proﬁtable for
pineapple growers and others to consider.

In the beginning, I wish to accord to
Prof. H. K. Miller full credit for the
part he has had in this work. He plan-
ned the experiment and had immediate
supervision of it for three years, and on
his retiring from Station work, the writer,
who was associated with him during
this time, was placed in charge, and has
endeavored to carry to lcompletion the
plans which Prof. Miller projected. Much
credit is also due Mr. W. R. Hardee,
whose hearty co-operation, and sincere
interest in solving the problems which
confront the pineapple grower, have
made it possible to continue the experi-
ment over so long a period.
Credit is also due a number of others
whose names I need not mention, but
who, nevertheless, lent eﬁicient aid, and
acknowledgment is hereby made to all
such.
OBJECT OF THE EXPERIMENT.
The object of the experiment, as stat-
ed in the bulletin referred to above, is to
ﬁnd out from what source or sources it is
best ‘to obtain fertilizing materials for
pineapples; the right amount to use; best
method of applying; ratio for phosphoric
acid. nitrogen and potash; the effect of
shading, and to determine any other con-
ditions which will prove of advantage to
the grower.
Certainly not all of these questions have
been answered to our satisfaction, per—
haps none of them have been fully ans- '
wered. However. we had not hoped to
be able to make two pineapples grow
where one grew before, nor to produce
two at the cost of what had formerly been
the cost of producing one, but we did
hope to throw some light on some or all
of these questions, and we leave it for
those who study the results obtained, to
say with what success we have accom-
plished our task. That there is much yet
to be learned, there is no doubt.
GENERAL PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENT.
The experiment was commenced in the
spring of 1901, arrangements having been
made with Hardee Bros. of Jensen to con-
duct it as a co—operative experiment, they
furnishing the land, work, etc., and the
Experiment Station to plan and direct
it, and furnish fertilizers and shed, and
have samples of the fruit for analysis
when required.
In accordance with this plan. Hardee
Bros. set aside for the experiment about
one acre of virgin spruce pine land. It
was cleared and put into thorough con-
dition, laid off into 96 plots, 24 sections
of four plots each, as shown on diagram.
'and in August of that year, planted to
slips of the Red Spanish variety.
The plots are 1-150 of an acre in size,
and contained, in the beginning, just 100
plants each, making a total of 9600 plants.
On account of a border around the out-
er edge, and extra space required for al-
ley-ways only about 2—3 of an acre was ac-
tually required for the experiment.
PLAN FOR FERTILIZER APPLICATION.
As mentioned above. the plots are in
sections of four, all the plots in a section
receiving the same kind of fertilizers, but
in gradually increasing amounts, begin-
ning with the ﬁrst in the section.
The second plot in the sections is taken
as the standard, and received annually
.8 pound phosphoric acid, 1.0 pound ni—
trogen and 2.00 pounds potash, or to put
it in terms of pounds per acre, it received
at the rate of 3000 pounds per acre of a
fertilizer which would analyze 4 per cent.


## p. 76 (#256) #############################################

available phosphoric acid. 5 per cent. ni-
trogen and 10 per cent. potash. this stan-
dard being based upon the analysis of the
plants and fruit, and the experience of the
more successful growers. Plot one re-
ceived one fourth less than the standard,
plot three one fourth more, and plot four
one-half more or twice as much as plot
one.
That is, plot one received at the rate
of 2250 pounds per acre of such a fertili-
zer, plot two 3000 pounds, plot three
3750 pounds, and plot four 4500 pounds.
With the exception of a few sections
introduced for special purposes, this plan
was followed throughout the entire plot,
different sources of plant food, of course.
being used in the different sections.
It will thus be seen that all the plots
in a given horizontal line received the
same amount of plant food, the difference
being in the sources from which they are
derived. _
To illustrate, the 2nd plot of sec. H
received 0.8 pound phosphoric acid deriv-
ed from slag phosphate, 1.00 pound ni-
trogen derived from dried blood and 2.00
pounds potash derived from muriate,
while the second plot of sectiom M; for
example, received the same amount of
phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash de-
rived from bone meal, cotton seed
meal, and high grade sulphate. Sev—
eral sections were introduced for spec-
ial purposes; for example, section K was
introduced with the idea of ﬁnding out
the effects of lime when used with acid
phosphate; isection L to determine the
proper ratio for phosphoric acid, nitrogen
and potash; section V to determine the
number of applications giving the best
results, etc. _
After the ﬁrst 18 months the fertilizers
were applied twice a year, except in the
case of one or two sepcial sections, accord
ing to the plan mentioned above. One ap-
plication in February or March as the
conditions seemed to require, and one soon
after the removal of the summer crop.
THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST YEAR.
Beginning with the ﬁrst crop which
came off in 1903, careful count was kept
of the number of the different sizes of
pines taken from each plot. This record
is published in full so that in one
table may be found the amount and
kind of fertilizers applied to each plot,
and in another the number of the different
sizes of pines produced by these plots for
the three years 1903, 1904 and 1905.
They cannot be given in detail here.
The crop of 1903 was about 88 per
cent. of a total possibility; that is, each
plot had a possible yield of 100 pines,
and actually yielded, on the average 88.
This must be considered a good yield
when it is remembered that in an ex—
periment of this nature, it is almost a
foregone conclusion that some of the plots
receive a treatment which will, to a great-
er or less extent, injure the crop.
As a matter of fact there was a wide
difference in the yield of the various plots,
some yielding little more than half a crop,
while several yielded 97, 98 and 99 out
of a possible 100 and one, at least, yielded
100.
The results are interesting, but can best
be studied from the published tables. I
will, however, undertake, in a general
way, to point out some of them.
COMMENT ON FERTILIZERS.
The experiment has emphasized the
fact, which had already been pretty gen-

erally accepted, viz: that acid phosphate
and kainit are injurious to pineapple
plants; it has shown that nitrate of soda
has some good qualities and some bad
ones; it is good as a source of nitrogen
to start young plants, but used liberally
on bearing ﬁelds 'it ﬁnally injuires the
plants and produces a fruit which has
poor carrying qualities; the results ob-
tained with the sulphates of potash, low
and high grade, were slightly better than
those obtained with the muriate. As
sources of phosphoric acid bone meal and
slag phosphate have given very good re-
sults, slag apparently giving slightly bet-
ter results than bone meal
Dried blood, cotton seed meal and cas-
tor pomace have all given good results as
sources of nitrogen, and it would be rath-
er diﬂicult to say which is the best. One
grower may use dried blood with success,
and perhaps another may use cottonseed
meal or castor pomace with equally good
or even better success. The price of the
goods, the requirements of the individual
etc. will necessarily come in here as deter-
mining factors. And I may stop here to
say that in this work it has been our en-
deavor to show just what results the dif-
ferent amounts and different kinds of fer-
tilizers will give, rather than to calculate
to a nicety which is the most economical,
thus leaving it with the grower who is,
in almost every instance, competent to de
termine which is the most economical in
his individual case.
A THEORY FOR THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS
OF ACID PHOSPHATE.
Before leaving this point it may be well
to state that the beds which received acid
phosphate without lime have been almost
entirely ruined, while those which receiv-
ed acid phosphate and lime in addition.
have remained in good condition and have
given almost as good results as some
which have been considered among the
best. It is not an easy matter to explain
this. However, one theory at least has
been advanced, which is, that acid phos-
phate contains sulphates of iron and alu-
mina which are astringent salts, the pres-
ence of which might be injurious to the
tender rootlets of the pineapple plant.
With the addition of lime these astringent
salts would be neutralized with the for-
mation of the harmless insoluble oxides
of iron and alumina: This explanation
would seem to be strengthened by the fact
that the plots which received geniune dis-
solved bone black, which does not contain
salts of iron and alumina, were not injur-
ed.
It may be objected that if the tender
rootlets of the pineapple plant are injured
by these astringent salts, then would not
the rootlets of corn, cotton, wheat, etc.
be injured in the same way? To this ques-
tion I would answer no, not necessarily,
since in the soils where these crops grow.
there is much more lime than there is in
the pineapple soils, probably all that is
needed to neutralize these astringent salts.
However I would not recommend the
use of acid phosphate on pineapples, even
with lime, at least until the subject has
been further investigated.
, The excellent results obtained by the
use of slag phosphate might possibly be
taken as an indication that there is some
eﬂicacy in lime, since this material con—
tains a goodly percentage of free lime.
THE LIMIT OF PROFITABLE FERTILTZING.
One very interesting part of the experi-
ment has been the determining of the lim-
it to which it is proﬁtable to fertilize pine—
apples.

As has already been pointed out, the
ﬁrst line of plots received at the rate of
2250 lbs. per acre, the second 3000, the
third 3750 and the fourth 4500.
Now by actual count there was, for the
crop of 1903 an increase, in a number of
the sections from the ﬁrst to the third
plot, though seldom were there materially
more on the fourth than on the third,
some times less. This seemed to point to
the fact that with the third plot of the
section, that is, the one that received its
fertilizer at the rate of 3750 lbs. per acre,
we had reached the limit of proﬁtable fer-
tilization. However, when we came to sum
up the totals of these four lines, we found
them to be so near the same that we
would hardly have felt justiﬁed in draw-
ing such a conclusion on this evidence
alone
But when we came to take into consid-
eration the number of the different sizes,
there was a marked difference.
To take the 24’s for example it may
be seen by reference to the table that there
is a decided increase in the number from
the ﬁrst to the third plot of nearly all the
sections, while from the third to the fourth
there is seldom a very great increase and
indeed sometimes a decrease. Reference
to the totals emphasizes this fact. These
are in the upper half for No. 1, 45, No-
2, I05; No. 3, 277 and No. 4, 277, and
for the lower half, No. I, 124; No. 2,
165; No. 3, I62 and No. 4, 269. a very
decided increase from No. 2 to No. 3 but
practicably no increase from No. 3 to No.
4 and yet No. 4 received at the rate of
750 lbs. per acre more fertilizer than No.
3. Likewise there was an increase, though
not so pronounced, in the 30’s and a some-
what corresponding decrease in 36’s and
42’s; but if by the addition of some-
thing like 1—2 to 3-4 of a ton of fertili-
zer per acre up to a certain limit we can
grow 24’s and 30’s where before we
grew 36’s and 42’s I think the grow-
ers will bear me out in the statement that
we are still engaged in a fairly proﬁtable
business.
Plot 19, the third in sec. E and which
received its fertilizer at the rate of 3750
lbs per acre, yielded in 1903 an increase
over plot one, of this section, apparently
due to thus increasing the fertilizers
an amount equivalent to over $339
per acre above the expense of the fertili-
zers. Other plots showed an increase
nearly as great. The plot which gave the
largest total returns for that year was also
the third plot in a section and received
3750 lbs. 'per acre, plot 35 sec. I. This
yielded at the rate of 537 1-2 crates per
acre while plot 36, the fourth‘in the same
section, and which received at the rate of
750 lbs. per acre more fertilizer. yielded
about one crate less.
Putting together all these facts and
some others which I cannot now take time
to mention, I think we are safe in saying
that for shedded pines and under present
conditions, there is proﬁt in applying as
high as 3500 to 3750 lbs. per acre, of a fer-
tilizer which will analyze 4 per cent.
available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent. nit-
rogen and IO per cent. potash. beyond this
is money lost.
The proﬁt comes chieﬂy in very
materially increasing the number of the
larger sizes.
THE CROPS FOR 1904 AND 1905.
No such decisive conclusions can be
drawn from the crops for 1904 and 1905,
but this is undoubtedly due to causes other
than fertilizers. The crop from the ex-
periment plot for both these years was
less than one third of a total possibility


## p. 80 (#260) #############################################

80 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
and it would seem hardly fair to under-
take to draw many conclusions from such
a diminished crop. Certainly the fact
that in several instances, at least, the plot
receiving the least fertilizer gave the lar-
gest yield of fruit would indicate that it
was not want of plant food that caused
the short crops. Possibly the shortness
of the crop for 1904 may be attributed
partly, at lease. to the heavy yield of the
previous year, the plants being somewhat
exhausted temporarily; the shortness of
the crop of 1905 is explained by the freeze
of that year. However, there is in the re-
sults from this year. further evidence
tending to show that with 3750 lbs. per
acre of a fertilizer analyzingas stated,
we have reached the limit of proﬁtable
fertilizing. We shall await with much
interest the results from the crop of 1906.
For a full discussion of the results of
the experiment up to and including the
crop for 1905 those interested are refer-
red to bulletin No. 83, Florida Experi-
ment Station.

DISCUSSION.
Prof. Stockbridge—I have forgotten
from your statement, whether or not in
your different fertilizer applications
nitrate of potash was used.
Prof. B1air.—It was not used.
Prof. Stockbridge.—Mr. President,
the thought was suggested to me that
capillary action might be increased by
changing the character of soil. If we could
add clay to pineapple soil the capillary
action would be increased; the point I
wish to bring out is to know whether
chemical salts are put on in addition to
the other properties with a view of in-
creasing the capillary action. Some of
the salts used in fertilizers such as kainit
is known to increase the capillary action.
but it could not be used in pineapple, but
there is one, the nitrate 0f potash, com-
monly known as salt peter. Experiments
have shown that the nitrate of potash will
increase the capillary action to 25 per cent.
or to a very great extent. I believe the
best experiments shows an increase of
22 per cent., therefore it seems to me
that it is quite feasable, at least there is a
ﬁeld for experiment with nitrate of pot-
ash in growing pineapples and this might
increase 20 per cent. the amount of water
consumed. I think this suggestion worth
consideration. What is the contents of
Nitrogen in nitrate of potash?
Mr. Wilson—Sixteen per cent. nitr0~
gen. 44 per cent. potash. 96 per cent. of
pure salt peter.
Prof. Blair.-—I think that reasoning
very good, but it seems to me that nitrate
of potash is so very expensive that the
loss by solution and going down deep into
the soil, outweighs the capillary action he
speaks of.
_ Mr. Blackman.—Mr. President. have
you or others ever made any experiments
in Dade county with surface soil in
regard to loss of fertilizers?
Mr. Blair.—Our experience so far has
only been carried on in Jensen. which is
not the type of soil you refer to. it is the
sandy soil.
Mr. Blackman.—-I wish there could
be experiments made in the rocky lands
of Dade county along this line. I
am of the opinion that there is little
or no loss of fertilizers in our rocky
soils. The rock is very porous and
we believe that a great amount of fertil-
izing properties which in sandy soils
would be lost. are retained in the rocks
and held there. The rock being so porous
that the roots penetrate it gathering up

the stored fertilizer and appropriating it.
Another reason why we do not believe
that the fertilizer in solution percolates
through the rocks and is lost, is that our
pine lands are lower than the glades, and
there is an ever ﬂowing underground
current of water, forcing its way upward
through the rock, which would have a
tendency to force back to the surface
what soluable matter that had penetrated
the rock, making it available at all times.
A well may be put down any where in
the rocky lands from eight to ten feet
deep which can never be pumped dry,
furnishing an unlimited amount of fresh,
sweet, pure water. During the past three
or four years I have put down a number
of these wells and have not had a failure
in any of them. The ﬂow of water is as
great today as it was the day they were
put down.
The thought came to me while Profes-
sor Blair was talking, that in some way,
down in our country nature had provided
us a pocket in which to hold these fertil-
izers. It is held largely in solution in
these rocks and the roots go down and
penetrate them, thus throughout the
severest droughts we have, does not tend
to yellow the trees, to dry up the foliage,
or check the growth. I call attention to
this hoping that the professor will some-
time make an experiment to see whether
a portion of our fertilizers are lost in
percolating through the soil and rocks, or
whether they are stored underneath the
ground in the rocks and are ready for
future use.

Report of Standing Committee on Fertilizers
and Irrigation.
BY PROF. E. R. FLINT.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I take it that it is the province of this
committee to present any progress that
has been made during the year, in regard
to fertilization 'and irrigation, in so far
as it is of interest to the horticulturist,
particularly of the State of Florida.
While I cannot announce amv start-
ling discoveries for the year in the mat-
ter of fertilization, nevertheless there is
undoubtedly a constant and steady ac-
cumulation of experience and experimen-
tal data which is gradually leading to the
point of making plant fertilization more
nearly an exact science than it has been,
or perhaps it would be nearer the truth
to say, to a point where we begin to real-
ize that, as it varies so with every varying
condition, it never can be an exact sci-
ence.
In regard to practical results and pro-
gress in our own State, the Florida Ex-
periment Station has just published the
results of an extensive experiment on the
fertilization of the pineapple and has
reached some interesting and valuable re-
sults, which are to be presented in another
paper. Fertilizer experiments are also in
progress on the orange, cotton and pota-
tOCS.
If we review the work done by the var-
ious experiment Stations on fertilization,
for the past year, it seems to me that we
must be lead to the belief that not only
every State, but every county, every
farm and indeed every portion of that
farm requires more or less special or in-
dividual treatment to get the best results.
A universal formula for any particular
crop is not possible, Such a formula may
serve as a basis, but no intelligent plant
grower should rest content with this, but
should constantly seek to so modify it
that it will best meet his own individual
conditions, and the more intelligently and
conscientiously he does this, the more
economically and proﬁtably he will be able
to fertilize his land. It is for this reason
that Stations and Agricultural papers are
always advocating home mixing, and
that fertilizer dealers are advertising,
more and more, the various plant food
ingredients rather than mixed fertilizers.
A mixed fertilizer will always ﬁnd some
sale because there are many that will not
take the trouble to do their own mixing,
and I would not in any way imply that
they are not of value, as every reputable
dealer aims to supply what is needed and
in the best form, as it is in the results ob-
tained that he gets his best advertising,
and I think we have no reason to com-
plain of the dealers in our own State.
I believe, in the past that we have be
come accustomed to place too much reli-

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 83
ance on published formulas which have
been made-up from the analysis of the
soil and the crop, and have contented our-
selves with these data. The subject of
animal nutrition and feeding is naturally
one of considerable complication and dif-
ﬁculty, as compared with plant feeding,
but I think that we shall eventually come
to believe that the more intimate ques-
tions of plant nutrition, approach it in
this respect. To be sure we are concern-
ed in furnishing only a very small
percent of the total plant food that is re-
quired, as by far the larger part is ob-
tained from the air, but that part is just
as essential to the growth of the plant as
the other. If the problem was merely
one of determining just how much pot-
ash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen was re-
moved in the crop and was required for
the additional growth for the year, it
would be easily solved. But in practice,
this is found to be wholly inadequate for
crops like the orange and from eight to
ten times as much as the amount so indi-
cated by the above ﬁgures seem to be re-
quired to keep the plant up to the best
condition of quality and quantity of fruit.
Where does this excess go to, and how
can we economize by reducing this dis-
crepancy to a minimum without lower-
ing the results we wish to obtain ?. To
answer this question, I think we must
turn from the chemical side of the ques-
tion to the physical one, or. in other
words, study the physical and mechani-
cal conditions of our soils to ﬁnd a solu-
tion.
There are various sources of loss of
plant food in the soil, and reasons why
the plant does not get all that we apply,
with which we are acquainted. One of
the most evident of these is the leaching
of the material through the soil and car-
rying it away from the area of the root
system of the plant. The rapidity of this
leaching increases markedly as we pass
from a clay to a sandy soil. Now, on
our Florida soils there is no question but
that leaching goes on to a very great ex-
tent. It is of course desirable that we
have our plant food in a soluble form as
it is only in this condition that the plants
can make use of it. If we apply it in
this condition, or in such compounds that
it rapidly becomes so, it is conceivable
and no doubt to a large extent true, that
with the ﬁrst soaking of the soil with rain
it is carried away to a large extent be-
yond the reach of the plant (speaking
particularly of our loose, sandy Florida
soils). Now can we prevent this serious
and expensive loss? At present the meth-
od of overcoming this seems to be to sup-
ply suﬁicient to allow for this loss and to
feed the plant too, which is one reason
why we have to apply from eight to ten
times the amount removed by the crop, and
that would seem, from all rational and
scientiﬁc standpoints, to be necessary. In
other words, we apply say from one to
two tons to the acre, expecting and know-
ing that we shall lose a large part of it,
when perhaps 200 to 300 pounds is all
the crop needs and makes use of. If such
conditions held in any technical line. you
may be sure the manufacturer would
take immediate steps to prevent this loss.
If the'farmer can stand this constant
drain and still make a proﬁt, there must
indeed be money in farming. I believe,
however, that we can control this loss to
a considerable extent. According to the
usual practice, we make one or two appli-
cations of fertilizers a year to the
crop and expect it to save and make use

of what it can out of this, for the next
six months more or less, although its food
is being rapidly carried out of its reach,
and I have no doubt but that the amount
of available plant food within access of
the plant roots, during the last few
months of such a period, is exceedingly
small. In other words, we give it a sur-
feit of food in one meal and then starve it
for some months. Does not the remedy
in this lie in our dividing up our appli-
cations, making several of them Illl'Ui‘Hil.
the season, keeping our plants supplied
with avaliable food in small amounts, as
required. I believe that such a practice
would result in a considerable saving and
that a smaller amount of fertilizer so ap-
plied, would produce the results of one
or two large applications. To get the best
results such a system of applying fertili-
zers should be accompanied with means
of irrigating, so that, with each small ap-
plication, if there were not sufficient rain-
fall, just enough water could be applied
to bring the food into solution, but not
enough to leach through the soil. It is
true that the proper carrying out of such
a system would involve some initial ex-
pense, but to the progressive farmer of
today, who aims to get the best results at
the least expense, and can look ahead on
his balance sheet, it will eventually save
money.
Another source of loss, which however
is largely temporary, and with the pres-
ent system of applying fertilizers perhaps
more beneﬁcial than otherwise, 'is the
chemical changes that the fertilizing ma-
terial undergoes in the soil, tending in
general, to pass from a soluble to a less
soluble form. This would be obviated,
to a considerable extent, by the system
just suggested.
The belief in the value of a chemical
soil analysis as an indication of what is
necessary to add to that soil in order to
make it fertile, is rapidly loosing ground,
and attention is being turned more par-
ticularly to the bacteriology of the soil,
the various conditions of acidity and alka-
linity, the changes of the humus in the
soil etc., and when the present lines of in
vestigations shall have advanced further.
we may hope for a more practical and in-
timate knowledge of the relation existing
between the chemistry of the soil and the
fertilization of plants.
Present methods of soil analysis are
aiming to determine the plant food that
is actually available to the plant, rather
than the total amount of such material
in the soil. These methods should give
a much better idea of what is needed
than the methods formerly employed.
The farmer has two valuable and in-
expensive means of improving his soil
and thereby cutting down his fertilizer
expenses, which I do not think are prac-
tised nearly to the extent that they should
be, and these are, the plowing under of
green crops and the growing of legumin-
ous crops as a source of nitrogen. As
the natural sources of fertilizing material
become less abundant and more expen-
sive, in the future, these means will be
more appreciated and used. It is a strik-
ing fact that is noticeable as we review
the developement and advancement of
civilization, with its ever increasing neces-
sities and requirements, that no sooner
does an urgent emergency arise for any-
thing that may contribute ‘to the comfort
and welfare of mankind, than some dis-
covery is made that supplies that demand.
Up to the present time. we have lived in
a time when nature, by the exploration

and opening up of new countries'and the
discoveries of great deposits of valuable
mineral material, has supplied everything
needed with a lavish hand. Nor has man
been at all backward in using, with the
greatest freedom and often times with
the most inexcusable wastefulness, the
resources which have been so bountifully
given to him. The time has already ar-
rived, however, when we begin to look
into the future and speculate as to what
is going to happen to posterity when we
shall have exhausted the resources which
we are now drawing on with ever-increas-
ing freedom to supply the constantly
growing demands. That the crude ma-
terial stored in the earth, which has
grown to be so indispensable to our wel-
fare, will eventually be exhausted, no one
can doubt, and in fact it is possible to
calculate approximately, with the present
rate of use, when many of our natural
resources will be exhausted, a period in
many instances surprisingly and almost
alarmingly short. We must then, con—
sole ourselves with the above mentioned
fact, that some discovery will be made
which will enable us to get along as well
or better without them.
Let us consider for a moment, the sit-
uation in regard to the future supply of
fertilizing materials and see what is being
done to provide for the time when we
shall have exhausted the great deposits
that have proved of such inestimable val-
ue to agriculture. , First in regard to pot-
ash. It is calculated that the present con-
sumption. of potash, for all purposes, is
over three, million tons. a year and that it
is constantly growing. Practicallv all of
this comes fromthe great Stassfurt de-
posits in Germany. As minor sources of
supply we have wood ashes and cotton
seed hull ashes, which are limited. About
2000 tons of muriate of potash are an-
nually made in the south of France from
sea water and the Scottish manufacture
of kelp yields perhaps 1000 to 1200 tons
yearly as a by-product. There are a few
other minor sources of supply, such as ni-
trate of potash, wool washings and beet
sugar residues. Leaving out these minor
sources, which supply but a very small
part of the total demand, we have as prac-
tically the sole source, the great potash
deposits at Strassfurt, Germany. Al-
though the yearly output of this great
collection of mines is now nearly four
million tons a year and is steadily in-
creasing, the supply seems almost inex-
haustible, so that it will at least be many,
many years before mankind will ﬁnd it-
Self face to face with. the problem of its
potash supply, which has become so es-
sential to successful agriculture, and the
necessity for which will grow greater as
the population increases, virgin soils are
robbed of their natural fertility, and in-
tensive farming becomes more and more
a necessity. Let us hope that when that
times comes, some means will have been
found or new discoveries made, which
will supply the deﬁciency.
In regard to phosphoric acid the natur-
al supplies may be summed up in general,
in the deposits of phosphate rock, phos-
phatic guanos, bones and slag. The great
guano deposits which have been drawn
upon so heavily in the past will be ex-
hausted before a great many years, and
although smaller gauno islands may from
time to time be discovered, the supply
from this source must gradually diminish.
The conditions which allow the accumu-
lation of such deposits, which require
many years to form will probably never

86 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
be repeated to the extent they have been,
so that this source, when exhausted, will
probably never be replaced. The phos-
phatic deposits, as those through the
southeastern portions of the United
States are large and will give an abund-
ant supply for a long time, but they are
not inexhaustible. The source of supply
from bones etc, which however, is insuf-
ﬁcient to supply the demand, can be count-
ed upon as a steady source, and the same
applies to slag, a by~product in iron smelt-
ing. Viewed as a whole, there is noth-
ing alarming in the present situation of
the potash and phosphoric acid supply.
In regard to nitrogen, the fact con-
fronts us that we are continually using
up this element of plant food without an
adequate return to the soil. The constant
cropping of the land, combined with our
present system of sewerage disposal,
which prevents the return to the soil of
such a large and legitimate nitrogen sup-
ply, the fact that so many crops are sold
away from the land, are suﬁicient to in-
dicate the loss, without considering the
destruction of nitrogen compounds by de-
nitrifying bacteria, the leaching of the
soil and other sources of loss. The
world’s supply of the two richest sources
of nitrogen, guano and saltpeter, is being
rapidly exhausted. At the present rate
of consumption of the latter, one billion
tons a year, it will be exhausted, as claim-
ed by some, in 30 years. New methods
for the production of nitrogen compounds
available for fertilizing purposes may be
discovered, and some efforts have already
been made in that, direction with electrici-
ty, but this does not promise sufﬁcient as
yet to count on it to any extent to relieve
the situation.
Nature has provided, to a certain ex-
tent, for the return of nitrogen to the soil.
Arising from the chemical changes going
on, on the surface, there are always traces
of ammonia compounds and compounds of
nitrous and nitric acids in the air, which
are washed down by rains. Electrical dis-
charges in the air bring small amounts
of the free nitrogen into combination so
that it may be returned to the soil by the
rain. In 1891 it was discovered that
there were certain micro-organisms in the
soil which could bring the free nitrogen
of the air into combination without the
aid of any other plant life. Experimen-
tation on this line has been undertaken
to make practical use of these organisms
but so far without result.
The fact that leguminous plants had a
very beneﬁcial effect on the soil is a very
old observation and they have been used
for this purpose without the knowledge
of the reason for this. It was demon-
strated in 1895 that there was actually
an increase in nitrogen after such a crop.
It was also noticed that these plants would
grow in a soil that contained practically
no nitrogen. Hellriegel, in 1886 an-
nounced that leguminous plants derived
their nitrogen from the atmosphere and
in 1888 Wilfarth and Hellriegel demon-
strated that the growth of such plants in
a nitrogen-free soil, occured after the de-
velopment of nodules on the roots. Pre-
vious to this time, although these nodules
had been noticed, they had been con-
sidered as a diseased condition of the
roots. When the true solution of
the question began to appear, it was
easily demonstrated that a leguminous
plant, grown in a soil absolutely free
from nitrogen, as in pure quartz sand that
had been heated to redness, and watered
with a solution devoid of nitrogen in any

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 87
form, would produce a normal growth
when the nodules were present, but if they
were not present they would quickly die.
It was indeed proved that a legume grow-
ing in a poor sandy soil provided with no-
dule-forming bacteria, will be even more
vigorous and produce a better crop than
plants growing in a moderately rich soil
devoid of the bacteria. A great many re-
cent ﬁeld experiments in all parts of the
country have proved this beyond a doubt.
One of the most striking experiments
was that of Prof. J. F. Duggar at the
Alabama Experiment Station in 1895 and
1897. On one ﬁeld where hairy vetch
had not been grown previously and the
fertilizer used contained phosphoric acid
and potash without any nitrogen, the
yield was but 235 pounds of hay per acre.
On a similar plot, treated in a similar
manner with the exception of the addi-
tion of some soil from an old ﬁeld con-
taining the proper bacteria, the yield of
hay was 2540 pounds per acre. or an in-
crease of over 2000 pounds. This beneﬁ-
cial effect is not conﬁned to the legumin-
ous crop itself, but is imparted to the
crops following such plants and this has
become so universally accepted' and so
many times proved, that every recogniz-
ed system of rotation includes some legu-
minous crop in its course. The fact is
tersely stated by T. E. Neal, from results
of experiments at the Deleware Experi-
ment Station, that $100 invested in clo—
ver seed returned four times as much as
the same amount invested in nitrate of 50-
da. It is estimated in this country that
the average amount of nitrogen added to
the soil by legums is 122 pounds per acre.
When it is remembered that a high grade
nitrate of soda contains only about 15 per
cent. of nitrogen, while much that is on
the market often contains considerable
less, it will be seen that a crop of legumes
is equal to from 800 to 1000 pounds of
nitrate of soda per acre, which at the pres-
ent price of this fertilizer, is equal in
value to from $20 to $25.
We thus see a possible future solution
of the question of the nitrogen supply, at
least. The horticulturist of Florida, as
well as in other states, in order to meet
the gradually extending competition, has
got to take advantage of every possible
means of furnishing the fertilization
necessary to secure the best results, at the
lowest price consistent with efﬁciency,
but in doing this he must be careful that
he does not deteriorate the quality of his
fruit. Every poorly fertilized grove
means poor fruit which in turn is a men—
ace to the reputation of the whole crop,
which up to the present time at least, has
justly and easily held ﬁrst place. We
must however, seek always to improve our
fruit, so that we may not only meet, but
keep ahead of the competition that is
bound to develope from the West Indies
etc. The geographical position of Flori-
da is such, that I believe she can and will
meet this competition, especially in the
quality of her fruit.

THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF FIXED NITROGEN.
BY L. HEIMBURGER, M.5.,
I
FIRST ASSISTANT STATE CHEMIST.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Of the three natural elements so often
deﬁcient in our soils combined nitrogen
is the one most easily exhausted, the most
costly and the most rare.
Every crop removes its aloquent por-
tion of combined nitrogen from the soil,
and if not returned by the grower leaves
the soil proportionally poorer. Everv bat-
tle results in the waste of hundreds even
thousands of tons of nitrogen that could
be used in supporting instead of destroy-
ing human life.
Again our sewers are delivering un-
told millions of dollars of nitrogen an-
nually into the sea.
Every pound of coal or wood as or-
dinarily burned, results in the return to
the atmosphere of a deﬁnite amount of
nitrogen.
The problem is to replace this annual
loss 'of combined nitrogen and as our
two chief sources at present are neither
inexhaustible, it becomes a serious mat-
ter. These two chief sources are our ooal
beds and nitrate deposits. Of the coal
burned only a comparatively small
amount of the nitrogen content is saved
and our visible supply of Nitrate is be-
ing rapidly exhausted.
At the present increasing rate of ex-
portation, now one and a half million
tons annually, the Chili nitrate deposits
cannot last more than another twenty
years.
Nitrogen is one of the least active
chemically of all the elements, and far
this reason, it is found in nature principal-
ly in its free uncombined or elementary
form. It is only by the most drastic of
chemical or physical methods that elemen-
tary nitrogen can be made to combine
with other elements. The ultimate
source of all our nitrogen combined and
uncombined is the atmosphere where it is
present in its elementary form to the ex-
tent of about 79 per cent. by volume. The
remaining 21 per cent, is principally oxy-
gen.
The greatest direct economic value of
elementary nitrogen in the atmosphere
is to act as a delutant to the oxygen. In-
cidentally it is the source of all combined
nitrogen.
Elementary or uncombined nitrogen
has no neutrant value to the higher or-
ganisms and therefore is of no direct
value to the plants and animals we are
most interested in.
In its combined forms nitrogen is one
of the bases of life among higher organ-
isms being a principal constitutent of pro-
toplasm; the others being Carbon, Hy-
drogen, Oxygen, Sulphur and Phospho-
rus.
If it were not for combined nitrogen,
life as we now know it would be impos-
sible.
Here the question may be asked, how
is the free or elementary nitrogen which
is so inactive chemically, made to combine
in nature with other elements so that
higher life may be possible?

This is a most difﬁcult question to an-
swer, and at present can only be answer-
' ed in part by Science. It is along this line
that bacteriology together with chemistry
and physics have accomplished great
work in recent years.
Bacteriology, the youngest of all the
sciences has shed the greatest amount of
light upon this question. During the last
two decades this science through its many
researches tells us of a great number of
micro-organisms that have the power of
ﬁxing nitrogen; that is, they are capable
through unknown processes to cause ele-
mentary nitrogen to combine with cer-
tain other elements present to form com-
pounds of Nitrogen which are available
as food for higher plants.
These nitrogen ﬁxing micro—organisms
may be divided into two classes, symbio-
tic and non-symbiotic.
The greater amount of research has
been devoted to the former, and therefore
they are best known at present.
These symbiotic micro-organisms are
always found intimately associated with
certain higher plants especially the papil-
lionaccae or leguminosae (beans, peas,
clover, etc.) in whose roots they reside.
The amount of nitrogen that may be ﬁx-
ed by these micro-organisms is large and
the cultivation of legumes should always
be encouraged.
Of late years our National Department
of Agriculture has been making great ef-
forts to devise a reliable method by means
of which the micro-organisms above men¢
tioned may be readily distributed in a
commercial way.
The method of drying the cultures on
cotton, recommended so highly not longer
than a couple of years ago, has recently
been shown to be but at best partially suc-
cessful. Still a reliable method will un-
doubtedly be forthcoming before long.
To the second class or non-symbiotic
nitrogen ﬁxing micro-organisms belong
those of bacteria that have the power of
ﬁxing elementary atmospheric nitrogen
unaided by any host. These organisms
have not as yet been studied extensively,
still a large number of forms have been
discovered.
Besides the nitrogen ﬁxing bacteria
just discovered, there are forms of micro-
organisms that have an opposite function,
that is, they have the power of breaking
up nitrogenous compounds with the lib-
eration of elementary nitrogen. There-
fore the action of these bacteria result in
the loss of ﬁxed nitrogen in the soil.
These organisms can, however, be readily
controlled by the proper drainage and cul-
tivation of the soil, for they are as a rule
anarobic, (not capable of existing in the
presence of air) or at best but slightly
facultative (capable of existing in or not
in the presence of air.)
Another natural agency by means of
which atmospheric elementary nitrogen
is ﬁxed is through electrical discharges.
For many years it has been known that
lightning discharges cause atmospheric
nitrogen to combine with oxygen to
from oxides: These in turn unite with
aqueous vapour to form nitric and ni-
trous acids, which are washed out of the
air into the soil by the rain.
It must be borne in mind that but a very
limited amount of atmospheric nitrogen
is ﬁxed in this way.
As far back as 180 years ago Caven-
dish, one of the founders of modern chem-
istry, predicted the commercial ﬁxation of
atmospheric nitrogen and a few years la—
ter contemporaneously with Priestly

showed that electric sparks undercertain
conditions oxidized atmospheric nitro-
gen.
Later the noted chemist Bunsen did
more valuable work in the electro-ther-
mic ﬁxation of atmospheric nitrogen.
Until very recently the yield of oxides
of nitrogen has been very poor by elec-
tro-thermic methods being only in the
experimental stage. The principles upon
which are based all electro-thermic meth-
ods for the ﬁxation of free nitrogen are
in general as follows:
When air is subjected to silent electri-
cal discharges of high potential, the oxy-
gen is ozonized and the nitrogen is oxi-
dized most largely into nitric and dinitric
oxides (N0, Now) the former can be fur-
ther oxidized to dinitric oxide.
Dinitric oxide or nitrogen preoxide in
the presence of water forms nitric (HN
0-) nitrous acid (HN 01) as well as ni-
tric oxide (NO) depending on the relative
proportions of peroxide and water pres-
ent.
These acids, nitric and nitrous, com-
bine with bases to form nitrates and ni-
trites.
To oxidize nitrogen requires a very
high temperature. It has been shown in
recent years, that the percentage of ni-
trogen oxidized is very largely depend-
ant upon the temperature the gases are
exposed to. Nernst determined that at
1,811 degrees C. only .37 per cent. of the
Nitrogen supplied was oxidized, while at
3,200 degrees C. 5 per cent. of the nitro-
gen was oxidized.
If the oxides fromed are not rapidly re-
moved, this high temperature causes their
decomposition.
Electricity is the best source of heat
for obtaining the high temperature re-
quired for the oxidization of atmospheric
nitrogen.
Of the large number of electro-thermic
methods for the ﬁxing of free nitrogen,
but one, the Birkeland-Eyde process, has
proven a complete commercial success.
In the Birkeland-Eyde process the in-
ventors use magnetic blow-pipe electrodes
with an alternating current, this gives a
ﬂame disk of large surface.
The air enters from both sides of the
ﬂame disk and is drawn off from below
in such a manner that it has passed direct-
ly through the plane of the ﬂame.
Only about two percent. of the nitro—
gen is oxidized in the ﬂame. After pas-
sing through the ﬂame, the air is cooled
in a suitable chamber where the nitric
oxide (NO) is further oxidized to per-
oxide, (NO'-) From the cooling chamber
the gases are conducted through absorp-
tion towers, eight in number, where they
come in contact with water. The dilute
nitric acid is drawn off from below, rais-
ed again, and allowed to trickle down
again from tower to tower, until upon
ﬂowing from tower number eight the
formerly very dilute acid has been raised
to about 50 per cent.
The last traces of acid are removed in
towers irrigated with lime water and
ﬁnally in a dry lime chamber.
The nitric acid thus obtained is neu-
tralized with calcium carbonate (lime-
stone) Ca CO" and the resulting calcium
nitrate (Ca N0») is evaporated and fused
using the waste heat from the electric
furnace.
The factory at Nottodden, Sweden
using the Birkeland-Eyde process, obtains
a yield of from II to 13 hundred pounds
of nitric acid per killowatt year, equiva-
lent to about X 1-3 horse power year.


## p. 91 (#271) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 91
At these N ottodden works cheap water
power is to be had, and in many places in
Sweden power may be produced for the
very low rate of $3.00 per horse power
year.
With the above ﬁgures in mind i. e.
$3.00 worth of power for the production
of one half ton of nitric acid, it is proven
that the nitrate of lime as produced at
Nottodden can successfully compete with
Chili nitrate of soda at current prices.
The Birkeland-Eyde process being
new, is susceptible to material improve—
ment.
A new improved plant, recently put up,
turns out over ﬁfteen hundred pounds of
nitric acid per killowatt year.
The much dreaded nitrogen famine so
often predicted of late years, may in the
very near future be entirely eliminated
by electro-thermic methods for the direct
ﬁxation of atmospheric nitrogen.
FERTILIZING MATERIALS.

BY LORENZO A. WILSON
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The fertilizer question has been so ably
handled before this Association during its
nineteen meetings it would appear there
was very little left to be said regarding it.
My friend, Mr. Painter has told you some
of the things he knows on several occa-
sions and has also issued some very intel-
ligent books that nearly all of you have
read. During the past twelve years I have
written articles myself, sending them
broadcast over the State to nearly every
one of you I think, and there is only left
for me now the rehashing of the same
matter.
There are so many growers in the State
who have made such a close study of the
question of plant foods and are so well-
posted on it that I ﬁnd it a very difﬁcult
matter to-day to get a traveling salesman
to work for me, who knows as much on
this subject as many members of this As-
sociation do. I have always said it was
a bad plan to put a fertilizer manufactur-
er on this Committee as it is almost im—
possible for him at times to leave out
some of the good things he might say of
his own brands when he writes or talks
on fertilizers. In the following article I
have tried to write with the idea before
me all the time, that I was a fertilizer
broker in New York, selling materials to
the manufacturers of Florida.
First I would like to say that the fer-
tilizer industry has been very thoroughly
developed in Jacksonville during the past
two years. To-day the fertilizer factories
of this city have a capacity for making
approximately two hundred thousand
tons of complete goods, if they had the
market for them the year round, and the
equipment to move them with.
PRICES.
The small growers of Florida buy their
fertilizers cheaper to-day in this State
than many of the larger buyers do on
Long Island, New Jersey or Connecticut
or Massachusetts. All of this has been
made possible by the development of the
fertilizer business in Jacksonville; the

fact that the market has grown as it has;
that the materials are imported direct to
this port from their points of production
and the fact that the State of Florida it-
self produces practically the Phosphate
supplies for the world. I have heard many
growers say they were raising orange
groves, pineapple patches and vegetable
crops for the fertilizer manufacturer, as
they get all the money. The question
must necessarily then be of all-absorbing
interest to the horticulturalists of the
State.
The greater proportion of the groves
and pineries are on high pine lands. which
are composed of from 95 to 98 per cent.
sand. The rest are mostly on hammocks
that were quite rich to start on but under
the draft of heavy crops of oranges their
fertility was soon reduced to the same
degree of poverty as the high pine lands
so that the fertilizer question began to ap-
peal to all alike and the whole country
set in to study this subject.
In this article I will only take up the
question of fertilizing materials, princi-
pally those that are used by the orange
grower.
Under the inﬂuence of the German
Kaili Works the ﬁrst article that seems to
interest the orange grower the most is
Potash. In the modest opinion of the
writer they have worked Potash rather
strong on the grower, claiming for its ex—
cessive use a great many things that can-
not be sustained.
The ﬁrst or crude produce of the Ger~
man mines is K‘ainit, which gives 26 per
cent. of Sulphate Potash, Salt, Magnesia,
etc. This is puriﬁed and the Double Man-
ure Salts of Potash, Magnesia was form-
ed, which gives 50 to 52 per cent. Sulphate
of Potash or 26 per cent. ‘90 and about
35 per cent. Sulphate of Magnesia, with
2.50 per cent. of salt. This is still further
puriﬁed and the chemist obtains the al-
most chemically High Grade Sulphate of
Potash, 90 to 96 per cent Sulphate of
Potash or 49 to 52 per cent K10-
On account of the supposed good effect
of the Sulphate of Magnesia on the soil
and the fruit a great many orange grow-
ers prefer to buy Double Manure Salts,
paying the difference in price and freights
over the High Grade. I do not know
whether they are justiﬁed or not in this
belief,
I will pass over the Murate of Potash
because it is so little used by the grower,
its high content of chlorine or salt mak-
ing it objectionable to the orange tree.
Nitrate of potash or salt petre is used
to a limited extent. There are several
grades, the highest 16 per cent. ammonia
and 44 per cent of potash K=O- giving the
ammonia a valuation of $3 per unit per
cent. we ﬁnd this a little cheaper source
of potash than the sulphate. At a selling
price of $92 per ton at Jacksonville the
44 per cent. of Potash is worth $42 or
less than $1 for each per cent. It is very
quick in its action and does not seem to
combine readily with the soil elements
and is in great danger of being washed
out by heavy rains.
The next important element in a fertili-
zer is the phosphoric acid, without it no
blossom or seed is perfect. It is derived
from a great many sources. Animal
bone gives 4 to 5 per cent. ammonia and
about 24 per cent. phosphoric acid of
which from 6 to IO per cent. is available
to the plants, the rest gradually under-
goes decomposition in the soil and it will
take from three to ﬁve years for it all to
become used up. Steamed bone gives

about 3 per cent. ammonia and 25 per
cent. phosphoric acid and on account of
its ﬁneness is more readily available to
the plants. The spent bone from the
sugar reﬁneries is treated with sulphuric
acid to make its phosphoric acid availa-
ble at once, and is used and sold under the
name of dissolved bone black. It con-
tains then from 16 to .18 per cent, availa-
ble phosphoric acid.
Florida phosphates or fossil bone is the
greatest source of phosphoric acid. This
is mined in the central and southern parts
of the State and immense quantities are
exported to Europe. This phosphoric
acid in our Florida phosphates is entirely
insoluble. If it had been soluble it would
not have remained, but would have been
dissolved by the soil water and long since
have disappeared from our country into
the Gulf of Mexico. Chemistry has come
to our relief in making this and other
phosphatic materials available to the
plant. Sulphuric acid is used in render-
ing water soluble the insoluble phosphor-
ic acid in animal bone and the fossil bone
in Florida. Each contains phosphoric
acid and lime combined in the same pro-
portion; one part of phosphoric acid and
three parts lime which is called bone phos-
phate of lime, which is insoluble. Now
to make the material, either bone or the
Florida phosphates soluble and available
to the plants it is ground and combined
with sulphuric acid diluted with water to
52 per cent beaumae. The sulphuric
acid has more affinity for the lime than
the phosphoric acid has and combined
with two parts forming sulphate of lime
or land plaster, leaving the phosphoric
acid combined with one part of lime
which is soluble in soil water and availa-
ble to the plants. The sulphuric acid
combining chemically with the lime is no
more sulphuric acid and there is no more
danger of your getting free sulphuric
acid in this preparation than you
would in sulphate of potash or sul-
phate of ammonia. This idea of
danger from free sulphuric acid is a
humbug and not worthy of the slightest
attention by the intelligent horticultural-
ists of this State, an idea advanced by a
northern manufacturer. Soluble phos-
phoric acid is identical no matter from
what source it is derived, and when some
growers realize this they will save money.
One of the northern ﬁrms for the last
twenty years has been trying to make the
Florida grower believe that all other com-
plete fertilizers have free sulphuric acid
in them_ claiming that through a secret
process by steaming he makes bone, Peru-
vian guano and other phosphatic mater-
ials all available. This statement has
been made to many growers in the State
but would never be made before a fertili-
zer manufacturer or some one who knew
because the party making this claim
knows only too well there are no elements
in water or steam to combine with the
lime in bone or phosphate to make it
available even though he should put it
through a secret Lsteaming process for
seventeen years.
Peruvian Guano is another ﬁne source
of phosphoric acid. High grade will give
9 to 10 per cent. ammonia, 9 to 12 phos~
phoric acid partly available and three to
four per cent. potash. Lower grades will
give 3 to 4 per cent. ammonia, 18 to 20
per cent. Phosphoric Acid and 3 to 4 per
cent. Potash. All of its phosphoric acid
sooner or later becomes available in the
soil. They are not susceptible of treat-
ment with sulphuric acid.


## p. 94 (#274) #############################################

94 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
The by-products of the slaughter hous-
es, tankage or blood and bone furnish
variable quantities of phosphoric acid and
ammonia.
The next and most important element
of all fertilizers is ammonia or nitrogen.
it is the-life, the growth of all plants. It
is derived from a great many sources,
which are divided into non-organic or
chemical and organic. Of chemical am-
moniates sulphate of ammonia heads the
list, giving 25 per cent ammonia. This
is one of the slowest of all, gradually
changing into nitric acid in the soil. Ni-
trate of soda or Chili salt peter gives 17
to 19 per cent ammonia in its most availa-
ble form, the nitric acid separating from
thesoda at once,being immediately availa-
ble to the plants. As it does not readily
combine with the soil elements it is in dan-
ger of being washed down below the reach
of some plants by heavy rains. Nitrate of
potash mentioned before has the same
tendency.
In the list of organic ammoniates we
have dried blood, giving I7 per cent.
This changes quite quickly into nitrate
with a reasonable amount of soil water.
Blood and bone or tankage contains from
10 per cent. to 6 per cent. ammonia ac-
cording to grade and changes rather slow-
ly in the soil into Nitrate.
Cotton seed meal furnishes 7 1-2 to 8
per cent ammonia. Castor pomace con-
' tains from 6 to 6 1-2 per cent. ammonia.
Tobacco stems furnish a small amount of
ammonia from I to 3 per cent. and some
potash, one grade giving 3 ammonia and
10 potash which is in a very available
form.
You will see from the above list of am-
moniates that you have quite a lot from
which to choose but the intelligent hor-
ticulturalist knows that the chemical am-
moniates give the best results on orange
trees and I will conclude by giving an ex-
tract from an article by Mr. Herbert Webber, Assistant in Division of Vegeta-
ble Pathology at Washington, and who is
well known to most orange growers.
“Probably no element of plant food
used in the fertilization of orange trees
should be more carefully considered with
respect to both form and quantity than
nitrogen. It is the most costly and at the
same time the most dangerous element to
use, as excessive applications are liable
to result in extensive splitting and drop-
ping of the fruit or in the production of
the serious disease known as die-back.”
“The mineral nitrogen manures, nitrate
of soda and sulphate of ammonia appar-
ently stimulate the production of fruit
more than organic manures, and yet pro-
duce a fair general growth. The fruit
produced by fertilization with these salts
used in correct proportions with the other
elements. which it is necessary to apply,
is usually of good quality, being solid,
rich and juicy, with thin skins and little
rag. Sulphate of ammonia has the effect.
growers testify, 0f sweetening fruit to a
great extent.
“Sulphate of Ammonia has been very
widely used among orange growers. Ni-
trate of soda has been but little used thus
far, but is apparently in favor. Its insec-
ticide and water attracting properties are
probably much greater than those of sul-
phate of ammonia.
“Organic manures are of doubtful util-
ity. Barn manure is largely used by
many growers who still hold to the tra-
dition that chemical manures are injuri-
ous to the plants. The beneﬁts of barn
manure in an orange grove are a serious

question. The fruits produced from ni-
trogen from this source are usually large,
coarse, thick skinned, with abundant rag
and inferior ﬂavor. If barn manure is
used and most growers have a limited
quantity and desire to use what they have,
it should be spread over the grove lightly
so that each tree receives only a small
amount. When such manure is depended
upon as the main element of fertilization,
liberal dressings of sulphate of potash
should be occasionally applied. This will
tend to correct the evils of an overbal-
anced nitrogenous fertilizer. What has
been said as to the effects of barn manure
on the quality of the fruit applies equally
to the effects produced by muck. cotton
seed meal, blood and bone, tankage etc.
In general, organic fertilizers do not stim-
ulate fruiting to the same extent as the
mineral fertilizers. It is probably better
to apply such fertilizers to annual crops,
garden truck, etc.
“In fertilizing the orange, potash is
most frequently used either in the form
of sulphate or wood ashes.
“The noticeable effect of the potash on
orange trees appears to be its aid in com-
pleting and maturing the wood; appar-
ently an insufﬁciency of potash is shown
by an excessive growth of weak, imma-
ture wood, which does not harden up as
winter approaches and is liable to be in-
jured by frost.”
“The phosphoric acid, which is a very
Florida orange lands, is mostly used in
the form of dissolved bone, superphos-
phate, bone, bone black, raw bone, guano
etc. The immediate effect of phosphoric
acid on the orange tree and its fruit is
little understood. Several intelligent
growers claim to be able to recognize the
necessary element of fertilization on
effect of phosphorus starvation by the ap-
pearance of the new growth of leaves. If
these, when they ﬁrst push out, or while
they are young and tender, present a
slightly variegated appearance, mottled
with light and dark green it is claimed
that they are suffering from a lack of
phosphorus and if a liberal application of
some soluble phosphoric acid is applied
this appearance may be checked. If this
can be shown to be the case it will prove
a valuable index to the available quality
of phosphorus in the soil. A similar ap-
pearance may, however, appear in light
cases of so-called frenching, a disease, or
more properly a symptom of disease
which is not uncommon. Phosphorus
starvation may have some effect in in-
ducing this disease.”
Having watched the irrigation ques- _
tion since the dry Spring of 1890 I can
say that not one plant in a hundred has
paid a dividend on orange groves. If
the trees are properly fertilized early in
the season and kept cultivated until the
rainy season sets in, I do not think that
irrigation need be resorted to.

FER TILIZERS AND IRRIGATION.

BY F. D. WAITE.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
My report on Fertilizers and Irrigation
will not take up much time, but I trust
we shall have a full discussion as to the
merits of chemical fertilizers. In my
mind there is nothing that is so necessary
as the right kind of fertilizers, when, and
how they should be applied, in order to
grow the very be5t fruit and vegetables.
Thinking it necessary that I should
give to this Society something new along
' these lines, I reviewed my ﬁle of this so-
ciety's reports for the past twelve years,
and after I had ﬁnished, it seemed that the
ground had been completely covered, and
that it would be a waste of time to re-
hash them all. Not that they are -not
valuable for they are, and I recommend
that the members of this Society that have
not a complete list of these books, apply
to the Secretary for copies of as many as
he can furnish, commencing way back in
1893, when Major Healy and others were
discussing the merits of muck and stable
manure (being a complete fertilizer for
orange trees) up to the present time when
the question arises, whether we shall (tr
get the best results) experiment with our
individual soils, using pure chemicals, or
purchase ready mixed fertilizers of stand-
ard formulas from reputable manufac-
turers.
Some well known growers have recent-
ly remarked that ten and ﬁfteen years
ago when blood and bone was used with
a balanced ration of potash, we experienc-
ed less trouble with our groves, and new
diseases were not developing as rapidly as
they are today, and the question arises:
Are we pursuing the right course?
Some tell us we should not use acid phos-
phate, that it contains so much free acid,
that our soils will become poisoned. Yet
our State Chemist tells us that availa-
ble phosphoric acid is just as good from
one source as another, and that when we
buy the so-called dissolved bone black it is
just as liable to be acid phosphate color-
ed with lamp black, and we pay about
seven dollars extra for the coloring.
Prof. Rose also says that efforts have been
made by agricultural chemists to distin-
guish them, so far without results.
As the situation exists to-day, we may
buy a complete fertilizer which has on its
tag, dissolved bone or dissolved bone black
as its source of phosphoric acid. All our
State chemist can do is to determine by
samples sent him the true analysis as to
its content, of ammonia, phosphoric acid.
and potash.
The manufacturers that w; deal with
may be honest, and believe that which
they sell us is the true article, as they
have a guarantee from the dealers that
sold them, and have no way themselves
of telling one from the other. Some as-
sert that the supply of bone does not equal
the demand, then we had better buy acid
phosphate and save seven dollars per ton,
or buy steamed and raw ground bone, if
we are afraid of ﬁlling our soils with
acid.
I have recently corresponded with deal-
ers who handle nitrate of potash and basic
slag. With these two chemicals we can
secure a fertilizer well balanced and abso-
lutely free of all acids, and the slag con-
tains 50 per cent. of lime.


## p. 97 (#277) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

At present I think all the basic slag is
imported, and is a by-product in manu-
facturing steel from an iron ore contain-
ing a high percentage of phosphorous.
To one ton of iron ore, 1000 pounds of
rock lime is added, and this material hav-
ing a great aﬂinity for phosphorous, takes
up this element from the iron, and when
drawn from the converter, the slag is at
the top and usually runs about ﬁfty per
cent. of the original charge.
At the steel works in this country I un-
derstand the slag is cooled with water
which cracks it into small pieces, it is
then used to balast railroads. We pay
from $20 to $22 per ton in large lots
for the imported product which runs
about 17 per cent. available phosphoric
acid, and 50 per cent. of lime. If the Ala-
bama slag is of the same quality is seems
to me that our jacksonville manufactur-
ers could give us a pure form of phos-
phoric acid, and at less expense than the
high grade acid phosphate is now costing
us.
During our meeting at St. Augustine
Mr. C. G. White gave us the results of
some very interesting tests made in
growing Irish potatoes with slag phos-
phate, and says, “Slag phosphate does sur-
prisingly well and as far as one test
goes, sustains the European experiments
as to its value on sour soils, also the re-
sults at the Ohio Experimental Station.”
Why is it we have so little exchange of
thought in regard to fertilizer? Is it be-
cause we are ashamed to admit a lack of
knowledge, or that we are perfectly satis-
ﬁed with our own mixtures or manufac-
tured goods? Even if we are, I believe
we should express ourselves more fully,
thereby saving the Novice much time and
expense.
This subject has been discussed in the
meetings for several years and many
plans have been given in recent reports
for surface and sub-irrigations. Proba-
bly the best plan for sub-irrigation is that
in use at Sanford among the vegetable
growers, and fully discribed in Year Book
for 1903, page 60. It is just as necessa-
ry to have drainage, as irrigation, and if
I could have only the one, I would
choose drainage, but with this plan at
Sanford it acts for both. Water from
artesian wells being the source of supply.
These wells are less than half the depth
of those in the Manatee section, I have
never heard that the water from the San-
ford wells has an injurious effect.
We, on the Manatee use surface irriga-
tion from artesian wells, carrying the wa-
ter either through cement pipes under
ground, in ditches, or canvas hose to all
parts of the grove.
Some assert that artesian water has kill-
ed a great many trees, we admit that in
some cases this is true, but largely due to
the lack of drainage. An excess of rain
fall would probably have the same effect.
We should be cautious as we approach the
rainy season and not ﬁll our soil too full
of water, for if we do we shall certainly
suffer from the result.
The following is a discription of the ir-
rigating plant of the Wills grove at Suth-
erland Florida, as given me by Mr. Wills.
The plant is supplied from a pond or
small lake, with this as you will see, he
can spray his trees with clear water for
the red spider and purple mite.
SUTHERLAND, FLA., APRIL 24, 1906.
MY DEAR MR. WAITE: Our Irrigating
Plant is equipped with a White—Blakleslee

ary pump, with a ﬁve-inch suction and a
four-inch discharge maximum capacity
of which, is 335 gallons per minute, with
a guaranteed capacity of 250 gallons per
minute. We have a four-inch main run-
ning through the center of the 30 acres
under Irrigation and from this main are
laterals every 150 feet, starting out with
two-inch pipe and running down to one
inch, with three—fourths inch stand pipes
I 50 feet apart over the entire 30 acres, so
that a 75 foot piece of three—fourth inch
hose connected with two opposite hydrants
will meet each other. The spray rods
are made of three-fourth inch pipe, six
feet long tapered down to a point at the
lower end to stick into the ground, with
a T about 18 inches from the lower end
for connecting the hose and on top of the
spray rod is a McGowan sprayer.. We
run twenty sprays at a time with three-
fourth inch hose moving them from cen-
ter to center, when the ground is sufﬁci-
ently moistened. Last year I found that
our twenty spray rods were giving twelve
gallons per minute all over the grove, it
took us six days last May to spray the en-
tire grove, with an amount of water equal
to one inch of rain fall, according to ﬁg-
ures given to me by Prof. Rolfs. that is,
it will take about four or ﬁve hundred
gallons to every 30 square feet to equal
one inch of rain fall. The engine that we
are using is made by the White-Blakleslee
Manufacturing Company, of Birming—
ham, Alabama. We have a three-thou-
sand gallon Tank thirty feet from the
ground, connected with our Irrigating
Plant, this gives us pressure enough to
wash d0wn our budded trees through one-
hundred feet of three-fourth inch hose
with a nozzle on same without using the
Engine, two men working at a time.
With the Engine running we can easily
wash down trees from thirty to thirty-
ﬁve feet through ten or twelve lines of
hose at a time. We are now trying to
wash the spider off the grape fruit trees
with the tank pressure, as we cannot get
suﬁicient labor to work many nozzles at
a time.

DISCUSSION.
Dr. Bessey.—Mr. President, I would
like to ask whether any one present is
familiar with the recent work that has
been done with the processes invented in
Germany for combining calcium with
nitrogen of the air; it has been shown
that this compound can be produced very
cheaply and very satisfactory results have
been claimed for it.
No response.
Maj. Healey.—In the old days we used
to ﬁght this fertilizer business to a ﬁnish.
We did not have quite so much science
then as we have now. It strikes me that
if these fertilizer men would give us an
“electro-magnate" that would turn us out
ten hours work for $1.00, it would be of
interest to us. The time was when this
society was the best posted of any in the
United States but that was the time be-
fore it fell into the hands of the fertilizer
men. We thrashed out our own compost
pile and I think we were capable of know—
ing how to combine the necessary ele-
ments to make up the necessary fertilizer
for a large grove.
It is a curious proposition that of all
the members here on the fertilizer com-
mittee that not a man has a word to say
as to where the cheapest source of am-
monia can be found. He says, if you
will use my fertilizer you will get a cer-

tain percent. of ammonia and a certain
percent. of nitrate. I know there are
growers here who have been making
nitrate with beggarweeds. The reason
I do not use the cow pen is because I
have not the cows.
Now we are here to get at the manner
of producing a crop from the ground.
We are the ones who produce it and the
oth'er fellow is the man who lives on the
producer (applause)._ He sells us the
stuff, we give him our check, it is placed
in the bank and we have to pay it. You
can make your soil just as rich with one
tenth of the money if you choose to do it.
I have land on which I have raised three
crops of corn. When I ﬁrst began to
use it, it would not produce more than
ﬁve bushels of corn to the acre, but now
I am getting at least twenty bushels to
the acre without one pound of fertilizer.
If you can do this in a corn ﬁeld, it can
be done in any other ﬁeld. I know, no
man can gainsay the fact that this is a
true statement.
Professor Blair.—-I would like to see
Maj. Healey raise velvet beans on pine-
apple land.
Maj. Healey.—If I were raising pine-
apples, I would raise them the same way
I do velvet beans. I have no wish to say
what a gentleman should do with his
soil, but I wish to say that if you will
raise three crops of velvet beans on it,
you will have better success with your
pineapples.
Now as stated before, we were not so
poor in the old days, we found how much
of the chemical fertilizer to put on the
soil without knowing its use. I say to
this audience that I have land that I wish
I did not own, for just as long as it is
there I am fool enough to do something
with it. It was one time what was called
when I was young, an orange grove. It
is a sad sight now and I presume it will
always be a sad sight to my pocket book.
I own it under the “homestead act” and
you understand how that is- I said that
it was really a good looking grove and
since 1895 I have never put one pound
of fertilizer on it, it has been made on vel-
vet beans and beggar weeds. There is
potash enough in that to make a grove.
Much to my surprise one of my men
said to me last year that there were some
oranges on my grove, I went over and
looked through the grove and sure
enough there was a good crop of fruit
and I concluded to ship them and am
sorry. for they brought me some money
and that was an inducement for me to go
to work ahd make another orange grove.
This proves to you that while you can
put the enormous sum of eighty pounds
of fertilizer to the tree, yet you can get
good results from the velvet bean and
beggar weed. _
Now Mr. Chairman, I hope this fertili-
zer question will be taken up by this
audience and let us see _if we can get
down to absolute facts, and see if the old
time fool orange grower cannot thrash
this down to $50 per year for oranges.
Mr. W ood.—Mr. President, I note that
on the ﬁrst paper on this subject the
writer recommended the plowing under
of green crops. My opinion is that it is
much better to let the crop (lie on the
ground.
Prof. Stockbridge.-—I am quite sure
that the author of that paper through an
oversight inadvertantly used the word
“green” when he should not have done
so. In the country from whence he came
they term green crop what we call cover
crop, and that is what he meant to say.
Professor Blain—just one word. I

want to say that the value of both the
beggarweed and velvet bean was especial-
ly pointed out in a previous paper.
Mr. Hart—I just want to say that ac-
cording to my knowledge of things, it is
easy to make land rich by growing velvet
beans or beggarweed, though I would not
advise the former in orange' groves.
Beggarweed is a proﬁtable crop when
the trees are small but when they get
larger and shade the ground it will make
little growth. In previous years the poli-
cy of growing velvet beans for orange
trees has been discussed; the beggarweed
I indorse fully wherever it may grow,
whether in orange groves or any where
else, but we have to use commercial fer-
tilizers with it to properly balance the
ration. I do not believe we can get the
nitrogen we want from beggarweed or
velvet beans, after the orange trees inter-
lock their limbs. '
Mr. Hubbard—At the risk of repeat—
ing what may already be known by
the members, I will relate the experience
of Mr. Butler in the raising of beggar-
weed for nitrogen. He had good trees
but no fruit. He had an analysis of the
soil made and also for 100 boxes of orang-
es to the acre. The top foot of soil con-
tained about enough ammonia for one
to two crops, phosphoric acid for 3 ﬂops
and potash for only I 1-2 crops. He
then began to use commercial fertilizers,
He studied this question and decided
to use beggarweed to gather nitrogen
for the reason that it did not
produce any soldier bugs to work on the
fruit, the consequence was that after
three or four years using only phosphoric
acid and potash he gathered so much ni-
trogen that he had to take a mower and
mow down the beggar weed to prevent
die back taking his trees.

Report of the Committee on Nut Culture.
BY H. K. MILLER.
:11); President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject that has been assigned us
is rapidly becoming a very live one
throughout the South, owing to the great
interest now being manifested in the com-
mercial development of the pecan indus-
try. The consumption of nuts in the
United States is steadily increasing and
we are importing approximately six mil-
lions of dollars worth of nuts, in addition
to consuming virtually all the home sup-
ply. In as much as nuts have been, until
recent years, regarded as a luxury rather
than a staple article of food, and since the
reform movement now existing through-
out the country in the matter of more
rational foods is strongly advocating the
liberal use of nuts as a partial substitute
for meats, it may conﬁdently be expected
that the demand will rapidly increase.
Already the prices have been steadily ad-
vancing and the ordinary pecans, which
a few years since were marketed at ﬁve
and six cents a pound are now command-
ing eight to twelve cents, while the fancy
pecans readily sell at twenty cents to one
dollar per pound.
A health food company in New York,
of about two years standing, is making a
specialty of nut food products and here-
tofore have imported the nuts of the edi-
ble pine to be used as a basis for their
preparations. However, the demand for
their output has increased to such an ex-
tent that the company is already consider-
ing means by which this constantly in-
creasing demand is to be met. Naturally
it has under consideration the pecan and
is endeavoring to perfect machinery that
will enable the substitution being made.
The Persian or English walnut indus-
try has been ﬁrmly established in Califor-
nia and such renumerative prices obtain-
ed that land in that state suitable for wal-
nut culture has increased in value ﬁve
fold. Some of the reported incomes from
well established orchards are almost in-
credible. Not only is nut growing wor-
thy of our most serious consideration and
earnest efforts because of its commercial
possibilities, but like fruit trees in proper
assortment, a few nut trees merely for
home use adds materially to the pleasure
and interest of the home. Besides sup-
plying a wholesome and palatable food,
the trees themselves add much in the way
of making attractive surroundings. It is
difﬁcult to estimate the value that a few
nut trees will add to the home.
In presenting this subject brief consid-
eration will be given some of the more
important nut bearing trees that are adap-
ted to this state. giving greater attention
to the pecan, which so far as known is
capable of forming the basis of an indus-
try of considerable magnitude.
COCOANUTS.
In the southern part of the state along
the Atlantic Coast is to be found cocoa-
nuts growing wild. These have been es-
tablished there by nuts being' washed

ashore. By selecting choice strains of nuts
for seeds, the cultivation of the cocoanut
may be attempted near the shore where
only light frosts occur, however, it is
questionable if proﬁtable returns can be
expected. The nuts may be planted in
place ﬁfteen to twenty feet apart or bet-
ter planted in trenches in moist soil and
transplanted after the seed leaf is well
developed.
Little is to be done in way of cultiva-
tion except to prevent other plants from
encroaching on the young palms for a
few years. Mulching is advantageous as
also is the use of fertilizer, however, the
returns will not admit of much outlay.
Our supply of these nuts is derived, for
the most part, from the wild groves of
the tropics. The palm is an attractive
plant and ﬁnds considerable use as an or—
namental.
THE CHESTNUTS.
Three species of the chestnut are culti-
vated in America: The native American
chestnut, the European chestnut, and the
Japanese chestnut, besides we have the
chinquapin, a dwarf and small fruited
Castaneas. though occasionally the chin-
quapin is found to be a tree of considera-
ble size. A few chinquapins of large size
are being propagated which apparently
will succeed here. yet it is rather too
early to say they will prove of sufﬁcient
merit to deserve extensive planting.
These are supposed to be hybrids com-
bining the size of the chestnut with the
good ﬂavor of the chinquapin. Trees
may be set twenty feet and thinned after
crowding begins, thus securing several
crops on land otherwise unoccupied, else
they may be given greater distance and
ﬁeld crops grown between the trees until
the land is given up to them entirely.
Clean culture is to be recommended du—
ring the spring. Spraying with Bordeaux
will hold in check the fungus diseases,
but for the weevils, which are the most
serious pests, there apparently has been
no satisfactory remedy proposed.
WALNUTS.
The commercial growing of the walnut
in this country is conﬁned to the English
or Persian walnut and while this species
is hardy in the east as far north as New
York, and trees known to bear frequent-
ly in the southern and eastern states. no
attempt is made to grow this nut on a
large scale in these localities. In south-
ern California. however. the production
of walnuts has assumed important pro-
portions and perhaps ranks only second
to the citrus production of the state. Lit-
tle encouragement for growing the En-
glish walnut in a commercial way in
Florida can be given, but in as much as
bearing trees are reported to exist in the
state it is worthy of trial in a limited way.
A rather open alluvial soil seems best for
this species. One disadvantage here is
root-knot, but this may be avoided by
using the black walnut as a stock. Trees
bear in four to six years.
The Japanese walnuts will thrive in our
state and should have a place in every
nut growers collection. The cordifor-
mis is the most desirable variety and may
be grown from seed. This tree is attrac-
tive and is being used as a shade tree.
Some towns and cities in the south are
now planting them on their streets. The
Black or native walnut of the east does
well here and while the nut is exceedingly
rich the thickness of the shell is against
it as a commercial nut. It is held in
greater favor in the north than in the
south and there commands'a price, but
one that is too low to make the cultiva-

tion of this variety for its fruit proﬁtable.
The cheif value of the black walnut lies
in the character of its wood which is
useful for furniture. The high price of
this timber it seems would induce a liberal
planting for timber purposes on much of
our waste land. The chief obstacle seems
to be the long time necessary to grow
salable trees. Little attempt has been
made to improve the Black walnut or to
made to improve the black walnut or to
seems to be an inviting ﬁeld for the plant
breeder.
HICKORY NUT.
There are a number of species of this nut
other than the pecan, which is by far the
most important, and some are prized for
their delicate ﬂavor, yet, excluding the pe-
can, very little has been accomplished in
cultivating these native trees. The hicko-
ries are for the most part of slow growth
and the wood is useul on account of its
toughness for manufacturing purposes.
Some effort has been made at cultivating
the shellbark and shagbark, but the trees
are difﬁcult to propegate and are slow
growers, however, the nuts are of deli-
cate ﬂavor and the shells comparatively
thin. Of all the species of hickory the
pecan is easily the most important from a
horticultural standpoint; indeed it may
well rank ﬁrst in cultural value of all our
native nuts. Possessing as it does so
many desirable qualities such as rapid
growth, productiveness, hardiness, long
life and comparative freedom' from dis-
ease and insect pests, and yielding a nut
with thin shell having a plump, nutri-
tive and delicately ﬂavored kernel, it
seems strange its possibilities were not
earlier recognized. Only within the past
thirty years has any systematic eﬂ‘ort been
made to establish commercial orchards,
and even now, by far the greater part of
our supply is derived from the wild trees
of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Be-
sides ﬁnding the pecan native in these
states, it is also indigenous to the low—
lands of the Mississippi river and its chief
tributaries extending as far north as Indi-
ana and Iowa. It has been introduced in
the southern states east of the Mississippi
and in general, where proper soil condi—
tions prevail has been found to succeed
throughout the cotton area. The tree
under favorable conditions attains a
height of one hundred to one hundred
and seventy ﬁve feet with spreading
branches so as to produce a majestic
dome-like appearance. The foliage is
bright and pleasing, thus making the
in many of the southern states. These
were set with seedling trees, and in many
cases, the soil was not wisely selected.
This with the prevailing notion that the
trees required no attention, and hence
neglected, resulted in disappointment in a
majority of instances, and interest in
planting almost died out. Still a few
pioneers persisted in their efforts to mas—
ter the situation. Grafted trees were sub—
stituted for seedlings, which had prover:
so unsatisfactory, and greater care given
to cultivation and selection of soil. 'So
much better results followed that interest
began to slowly manifest itself once more
and has been steadily increasing. A num-
ber of growers in different sections have
been making special study of the pecan
within the past decade with a view to solv-
pecan one of our most valuable shade
trees. The planting of orchards was
undertaken some thirty years ago and
rather extensive proportions were reached
ing the problems involved, with such
happy results that many of the barriers
to success have been removed and reliable

infomntion is now available. Previously
little that was authentic was to be found.
Only in recent years has it been possible
to secure trees of good varieties in quanti-
ty and still the supply is short of the de-
mand, on account of the scarcity of graft—
ing scions and the difﬁculty of successful
propagation.
By means of improved methods of
grafting and budding the output has in-
creased very much in the past four years.
In the attempts to grow trees from seeds
the greatest variations were met with,
few if any producing nuts like the one
planted. In most cases the nuts were in-
ferior to the original, the trees were of
different character, some growing rapid-
ly, others making ordinary growth, and
still others very slow growers. On this
account the seedling orchards present a
very irregular and unsatisfactory appear-
ance, with trees of same age ranging
from a few feet to thirty feet in height.
Equal variation exists in the time of bear-
ing, some bearing at the age of ﬁve years
and others still barren at twenty. Very
different the results from varietal stock.
With budded or grafted trees growth is
more uniform and even faster than that
of the parent tree. Bearing begins much
earlier, generally at from three to six
years from planting, and the nuts are
uniformly like those from the original
tree. Attention is here called to the fact
that an opinion prevails, that nuts from
an isolated tree will produce trees which
bear nuts identical with the one planted.
This is partly due to parties owning such
trees advertising the‘ nuts for seed, per-
haps ignorant of the well established prin-
cipfe that a self pollenat'ed tree is the
surest one to yield inferior seeds. The
range for pecan pfanting in this state ex-
tends southward to the lake region.
Planting south of this region should not
be attempted, except in a small way, until
a more thorough trial has been given. In
selecting a soil for a pecan orchard pre—
ference should be given to a sandy loam
with a sand mixed clay subsoil, the richer
the better. Success may be had on a great
variety of soils, ranging from almost
pure sand to rather stiﬁ clay. A thirsty
soil or one that is always wet is to be
avoided. A soil that will admit easy pene-
tration by the roots and retain moisture
in liberal degree is to be desired. Plant-
ing, care, cultivation and methods of pro-
pagation will be discussed in papers by
the other members of the committee.
The parent trees of the named varieties
of pecans were of course seedlings and
it is rather strange that among the vast
number of seedlings that exist through-
out the south, such a small number have
been found of suﬁicient merit to be given
a name and be propagated. Among the
older varieties Stuart, Van Deman and
Frostcher represent the best. Van De-
man is superior to the others for table
use but for commercial purposes in the
ordinary sense Stuart and Frostcher are
in the lead. Among the varieties more
recently introduced Schley, Success. Rus-
sell, Dewey, Delmas, Georgia, Curtis and
a number of others may be mentioned. It
is beyond the scope of this paper to de-
scribe the different varieties but among
the ten above mentioned can be found
varieties that are adapted to all require-
ments. Proper appreciation for the dif-
ferences existing between varieties is
lacking, and the prospective planter might
consider' this subject thoroughly, with
proﬁt to himself. There are varieties
that are worthless and it will be a happy
day when all these are discarded.
There are other varieties which are ex-

cellent in some localities and worthless in
others. In this state, however, most any
variety that has merit may be expected to
succeed. It is good policy to plant at least
three varieties in an orchard; what these
are to be can only be best determined from
a knowledge of the object in view and the
location of the land. Some of the more
recently introduced varieties are much
superior to any of the older standards,
especially in quality of the nuts. Each
of the good varieties has its disadvant-
ages, as well as points of merit and it can
be said the perfect variety is yet to be
' found.
Successful pecan culture like all other
remunerative enterprises is not to be had
without effort. The same problems are
to be met as in other lines of horticulture,
the only difference being that at present
there is prospectively smoother sailing
ahead than in other lines. Cultivation,
care, fertilizing and warfare on insects
will demand attention. Fortunately the
list of insects is not so large nor are these
so serious as those which affect the apple,
yet there is sufﬁcient injury to warrant a
declaration of war on our part. In con-
nection with this paper a Spray Calendar
by Prof. H. A. Gossard will be presented.
In conclusion, it is to be remembered
the pecan industry is young, in fact, very
young, considering the possibilities that
have been lying dormant so long. With
many of the difﬁculties removed by a bet-
ter knowledge of the requirements for
successful] culture, we may expect rapid
progress in the next few years; Young
orchards now coming into bearing yield-
ing nuts of superior quality that command
a fancy price is giving impetus to the
movement. The returns to he expected
have largely been a matter of speculation
and single trees have been made the basis
of estimates. Sufﬁcient progress has been
made t'o furnish reliable information and
in a few more years exact data may be
expected. The expectation of enormous
proﬁts is not to be indulged in, yet, com-
pared with other lines of a horticultural
nature, very proﬁtable returns may safely
be expected and after the trees are large
enough to occupy the land, a few acres
should yield a good income with small
annual outlay.
The question of overproduction seems
to cause some concern, however, when we
consider the time that must elapse before
any very great increase can be expected,
the rapidity with which the demand is in-
creasing and remembering that we have
the world for a market, with exportation
not yet begun, there need be little fear
from this source in our day. Besides, the
millions of pounds of common pecans
must ﬁrst give place to the improved va-
rieties.
There are many features of nut cul-
ture that might be dwelt upon but it is
beyond the scope of this paper. From a
careful. review of the subject there seems
to be no more inviting ﬁeld of endeavor
awaiting the young horticulturist than
the culture of nut trees in the south

NUT CULTURE.
BY J. H., WYLIE’ INTERLACHEN, FLA.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Chairman of our Committee on
Nut Culture, some time ago requested
that I make a short report at this meeting
as to planting and cultivating Pecan trees.
I regret to state that this subject has
been neglected by our Society for the past
two years, we receive a great many in-
quires regarding the setting out, care and
cultivation of Pecan groves in this State,
and it is now considered “an important
industry.” Increasing and more intelli-
gent attention is being given each year to
the planting and cultivation of the Pecan.
The permanent and increasing value of
the tree is realized. We believe the out—
look for the industry is brighter than ever.
The demand for ﬁne nuts for table and
confectionery purposes is constant, and
the supply of ﬁne nuts is entirely inade-
quate.
WHEN AND HOW TO PLANT.
In this State Pecan trees may be set
any time after the leaves drop in the fall
varying with the season, but nearly al-
ways by the ﬁrst of December until the
end of March. It is essential however
that the trees be dormant. As to distance
apart we prefer to set the trees 40x40 or
50x50 feet. -
In setting out a Pecan tree, a hole twen-
ty-four inches in diameter and deep
enough to accomodate length of tap root
is usually large enough although larger
holes and wider may be dug with advan-
tage, more especially where any fertilizer
is used in planting the trees. Well-rotted
manure or good commercial fertilizer
may be put in outer sides of hole, an inch
or two beyond the lateral roots when the
hole is being ﬁlled, but not in direct con-
tact with the roots, work and ﬁrmly press
the soil among the roots, laying each root
in its natural position, no holes or cavities
should be left and the soil should be in
close contact with the tap root after wa-
tering and it is also very important that
no part of the crown or root be left ex-
posed to the air. It is better to plant them
an inch or two deeper than they stood in
the nursersy than to have the crown roots
exposed.
In Pecan groves low growing crops
such as peas, melons potatoes, peanuts,
cotton, truck etc. may be planted proﬁt-
ably.
BUDDED AND GRAFTED TREES COMPARED
\VITH SEEDLINGS.
This covers an important feature of the
Pecan Industry. Grafted and budded
trees have advantage over seedlings be-
cause they usually begin to bear much ear-
lier than seedlings they reproduce the va-
riety from which buds and grafts were
taken; perpetuation of the-early~ heavy
and anual bearing of the parent tree is ob-
tained; also greater care and attention
usually given them on account of their
greater cost.
' As a result of the variable success at-
tending the propogation of Pecans by
budding and grafting and the compara-

107
tive slowness of the precesses as com-
pared with the simpler propagation of
peaches and plums oranges etc., the trees
must necessarily sell at a price which al-
lows a margin to cover great losses in
budding and grafting from unfavorable
weather such as droughts or excessive
rains, another'consideration the cost of
grafting and budwood, which is a sacri-
ﬁce of nuts from choice bearing trees by
the cutting therefrom of scions or bud-
ding wood. Again the disﬁgurement of
seedling trees where buds or grafts fail
to take the ﬁrst season.
DISAPPOINTMENT.
There will be many disappointments in
Pecans to those who have planted the
“cheapest” trees fliey could buy without
investigating source of variety of trees or
reliability of party who follows the busi-
ness of selling them.
Now is it not very plain to all that it
is folly for anyone to risk the use of land
for years expense of cultivating etc., to
save a few cents on a tree, when for a
triﬂing increase in the price he can get
the very best warranted stock?
Most of the worthless stock is worked
off by strange agents, who sell on their
own account and are not authorized by
any responsible ﬁrm to take orders for
them. Such men buy up refused stock
from large nurseries for almost nothing
and ﬁll their orders with it claiming it to
be good. They also frequently warrant
the stock, but as they the unknown or ir-
responsible, their warranty is absolutely
worthless. If people would consider this
fact, and buy only from agents who can
show a certiﬁcate authorizing them to rep-
resent a responsible ﬁrm, there would be
less danger of being cheated.
Our attention has been called to cer-
tain tree peddlers in this State buying
seedling Pecan trees that had been graf-
ted but grafts having failed to take new
sprouts would naturally come out and
make a nice healthy top; such trees being
worth about ten to twenty cents, have
been sold for grafted stock at $1.00 to
$1.50 each.
It will be heart-breaking to' those who
have planted such trees relying upon them
to support them in their old age to ﬁnd
they have been cheated and swindled and
all hope of rest and peace in their declin-
ing years vanished. Men will die and
leave “Pecan Groves” of this kind to their
widows and children—with what result?
Hoods MONU M ENT
The accompanying clipping from the
daily press dispatches is very signiﬁcant
and means much, not only for Texas, but
for the entire country. It shows an ap-
preciation of the value of nut trees by a
prominent man who had the welfare of
the masses at heart and who chose the
time of his departure from earth to im-
press the injunction upon his family and,
through them, on the public at large.
“I want no monument of stone,"
he said, “but let my children plant at the
head of my grave a pecan tree and at the
foot of my grave a walnut tree, and when
theSe trees shall bear let the pecans and
the walnuts be given out among the plain
people of Texas, so that they may plant
them and make Texas a land of trees.”
Such a monument will not only perpet-
uate the memory of Gov. Hogg—gener-
ations to come will share in the beneﬁcial
results which will follow the stimulus thus
given to the nut growing industry, which
is only now beginning to attract the at-

tention it merits from every one who owns
a farm or village home.
Gov. Hogg was a man of wide exper-
ience, a close observer of cause and effect
and he doubtless saw in the future of nut
growing much to interest him and much
of prospective good to his state. We like
monuments of this kind, that help others
to better lives and more proﬁtable and
pleasant surroundings.
The statement is generally made that
the Pecan will succeed wherever the large
species of hickory are found in the State,
and this is doubtless true, as the Pecan
belongs to the same family of trees.
Our experience in a small way in graft-
ing some of the choice varieties of Pecan
on young Hickory has been very satis—
factory, as to the growth, and we trust in
a few years to 'be able to make a good re—
port as to our success in getting them to
bear fruit.
In working the pecan on hickory we
ﬁnd it an advantage to graft under
ground and for this reason advise select-
ing the small trees in the forest where a
grove may be desired on account of the
hickory ‘being plentiful.
There is no doubt that the Pecan is ex-
tremely hard to work, and only when the
budding or grafting is done by an exper-
ienced hand is it likely that good results
will be obtained.
The Pecan will grow on any soil ex-
cept springy boggy land where the water
stands near the surface or where the soil
is underlaid with ledge rock at a slight
depth. *
AN ENTOMOLOGICAL CALENDAR FOR THE PECAN.

BY H. A. GOSSARD.
11] r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The following calendar is approximate-
ly accurate but must be admitted to be in
a measure conjectural, because observa-
tions on pecan insects have not yet been
sufﬁciently thorough to make possible an
absolutely authoritative schedule. We
hope that this imperfect one will stimulate
observation and thereby contribute to the
making of a perfect one in the near fu-
ture.
JANUARY.
The twig girdler is at this time, a lar-
va tunneling in the fallen twigs which
were severed in the preceding fall. These
infested twigs may be gathered and
burned.
Other fallen limbs may contain larvae
and pupae of the oak pruner, hence,
should be collected and burned.
The larvae and pupae of various borers
are in their tunnels in the heart—wood of
the trunks. The burrows may be located
by the particles of sawdust on the ground
and clinging to the bark beneath the ex-
ternal openings; also by the discolored
bark below the oriﬁces, caused by the 002-
ing of the sap. By means of a spring bot-
tom can or in some similar manner, inject
bisulphide of carbon or chloroform into
the furrows and at once stop the openings

with grafting wax or with a wad of clay
mud.
The larvae and pupae of the hickory
shuck worm are in the fallen and decay-
ing hulls beneath the trees, which may be
raked up and burned. The larvae and
pupae of this insect, are known to be
found in the fallen hulls in December and
therefore presume they remain here until
early in the summer when new hulls are
forming.
Two or three budworms and case-
worms are hibernating in small brownish,
blister-like cocoons and saber-shaped cas-
es on and about the budscales and on the
bark of branches. Reasoning from analo-
gy, spraying with the lime-sulphur wash
would probably be useful against them.
Grafts may be cleansed of the cocoons and
cases by means of a knife point, before be—
ing used.
The cottony scale is in the larval form
on the branches at this season. The dor—
mant winter period is the time to treat it;
spray with kerosene emulsion, one part of
emulsion to ﬁve or six parts of water.
Pruning can also be effectively used
against this pest at this season, the infest-
ed twigs being cut out and burned.
FEBRUARY.
Calendar and pratice ditto as for Jan-
uary.
MARCH.
Practically the same as for February.
APRIL.
Simultaneously with the bursting of the
buds in late March and early April, the
different species of bud worms and case-
worms commence a most destructive at-
tack. They burrow into the buds and
also into the tender twigs. Two of these
insects are caseworms, one of them being
commonly observed and of considerable
size, the other being much smaller and
ﬁnally maturing a case resembling a min-
iature cigar. The third species, after quit-
ting the buds, becomes a leaf-roller and
lives in a tube made by folding over itself
the border of a leaf. Later it gathers a
cluster of leaves to the original one, mak-
ing a conspicuous nest. The larger case—
worm also clusters leaves together into a
nest and several caterpillars may be found
in the same cluster. If these insects can
be successfully treated in the same way
as the better known budworms and case-
worms, a spraying with arsenicals should
be made while the leaf—buds are swollen,
just before they burst. A second spray-
ing should be made about a week later
than the ﬁrst, just where the leaf-buds
begin to show green at the tips. A third
application should be made as soon as the
leaves are expanded. Owing to its ad—
hesive qualities, arsenate of lead will
doubtless prove more satisfactory for
spraying pecans than Paris green. It
will be wise to make one of the ﬁrst two
and the third of these sprayings a com-
bination of an arsenite with bordeaux
mixture.
The large, leathery skinned caterpil-
lars of the Catocala moths. sometimes
known as “alligator” worms, begin their
depredations this month. They feed at
night and by day lie concealed in crevices
of the bark. or under trash on the ground.
This protective coloration makes their dis—
covery difﬁcult. Spraying with the ar—
senites ought to check them. The bud—
worm spraying will catch these insects
also. Right after a rain when the bark
is discolored by wetting, the lighter color
of the worms renders their detection more
easy and it is possible to collect and de-
stroy many by hand. If the trunks are

kept wrapped with burlap bands, many
caterpillars will retreat beneath these for
hiding and the next morning they can be
collected and crushed or thrown into a
pail containing kerosense and water. If
a sticky band of some kind_ such a “tree
tangle foot,” made by the O. and W.
T hum C0. Grand Rapids, Michigan, be
put around the trunk below the band to
prevent any of the worms passing to the
ground, it would seem possible to catch
nearly all of them in a very few nights.
Thus far, we have heard of no complaint
that “tree tangle foot" injures the tree.
In late March and early April, the eggs
of the fall webworm are laid on the leaves
in clusters of 400 to 500. In a week or
ten days, these eggs hatch into very hairy,
large-headed caterpillars, which always
live in webs that are enlarged according
to need, where spraying-with arsenicals
is regularly practiced they are not apt to
become numerous, but where no spraying
is done, the young nests should be pruned
out and burned; or a torch of fat pine,
attached to a pole, may be held beneath
the nest until the worms are destroyed.
The eggs of the Pecan tree borer, Sesia
scitula, are probably laid in April and
early May. Since the young borers usu-
ally enter the sapwood through some
wound in the bark, such as a graft union,
all such scars should be well covered at
this time with grafting wax with which
white arsenic or Paris green has been
mixed. Coat over the wax protection
with whale oil soap which has been dilut-
ed with enough water to give it the con-
sistency of thick paint. Pour into this
soap paint enough. crude carbolic acid
to give it a strong odor, and apply with
a brush at the beginning of a bright,
sunny day. Before night a tough. sticky
ﬁlm should form which is not readily dis-
solved by rain. Any wounds inﬂicted
during the course of cultivation should
be at once covered with some such mix-
ture as this.
MAY.
All of the species, hatching in April,
will extend their damage over into May,
spraying with arsenicals may be continu-
ed against caseworms and caterpillars if
the previous treatments were insufﬁcient.
Many of the measures already suggested
for April work against other insects will
need to be continued into May. The
moths of the caseworms, budwonm, etc,
begin to appear in numbers this month
and may be started up from their resting
places on the leaves, on the trunks, in the
mulch at the bases of the trees, etc.
The diﬁ‘erent species of heartwood
and bark borers are apt to commence egg-
laying this month, hence it will be wise
to keep the trunks and larger limbs cov-
ered with white-wash which may be ap-
plied with a spray pump. Some port-
land cement added to the whitewash will
doubtless add to its eﬁiciency, since our
object is to ﬁll the interstices of the bark
and make a covering over the whole
trunk which the young borers cannot
penetrate when they emerge from the egg.
Possibly a further addition of one pound
of Paris green or white arsenic to every
ﬁfty gallons of the white-wash would be
good.
During the ﬁrst half of May, the eggs
for the walnut caterpillar are laid on the
tender surfaces of the leaves, usually
those of the lower branches. These are
found in clusters of several hundred and
before hatching become of a glistening
white color. The young caterpillars feed
gregariously and when ﬁrst observed, the
few leaves on which they are found may

be plucked and the whole colony destroy—
ed. At _a later stage, spray with arseni-
cals.
JUNE.
The young caterpillars of the bud-
worms and caseworms are hatching from
the eggs and would seem to be amendable
to treatment with arsenical sprays.
Though some of them must extend their
bodies out of their encasing tubes to feed,
and others have in a measure the habits
of leaf miners, all consume more or less
or the epidermis, hence can possibly be
killed with poisons. Continue the work
of May against webworms and the wal-
nut caterpillars collect in masses on the
trunks of the trees to moult, kill them by
means of a burning torch or by crushing.
A ring of “ tree tangle foot” put around
the trunk above the_ mass before begin-
ning the slaughter will prevent any es-
caping worms from reascending the tree,
though they may seek other neighboring
trees and here continue their develop-
ment. If necessary repeat the white-
washing against the borers so as to keep
the coating intact.

Young caseworms and budworms
working on leaves and can likely be check-
ed by spraying with poisons. Because of
copious rains in spring it may be found
more advantageous to spray for these in-
sects during the drier months of summer
and fall. The second brood of web-
worms may be expected to put in their
appearance about this time. It is probably
that a second brood of catocalas or “alli-
gator worms” also appear at about this
time, since the moths of at least one spe-
cies issue in June and early July. Ex-
amine the white-wash coating on the
trunks and renew if necessary.
AUGUST, SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.
Budworms and caseworms continue
feeding during August and part of Sep-
ber, but usually ensconce themselves in
winter quarters before October. The
whitewash may need renewing in August
but this is unlikely if cement was used
the preceding application. The second
brood of webworms become conspicuous
during this period, so also does the sec-
ond brood of walnut caterpillars. The
twig girdler is busy in September and
October laying their eggs and girdling the
twigs in which the eggs are laid.
NOVEM BER AND DECEMBER.
Insects and practice about ditto as
given for January and February.
Inspect the roots carefully to ascertain
if root borers are present. If any are
found, treat with carbon bisulphide. Fill
up all cavities in the trunk with cement,
ﬁrst cutting out all rotten wood and singe-
ing the cut surface with a blast lamp to
destroy the spores of any rot fungi that
may be present. This will do away with
a favorite hiding place for hibernating
forms, such as the pupoe of the fall web-
worm.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
REPORT ON NUT CULTURE.
BY C. F. BARBER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Having been appointed by the Presi-
dent as one of the committee on this im-
portant committee and being satisﬁed that
the question will be thoroughly covered
by the other distinguished committeemen
I shall make my report very short and
shall deal with the growing of Pecans
and leave the question of the growing of
other nuts to the other committeemen.
I believe that the Pecan is the only
nut that can be raised for a proﬁt in the
state of Florida and I do not think it ad-
visable to attempt to raise a seedling Pe-
can grove. My observation has been,
that the bearing qualities are very uncer-
tain. I will not attempt to explain what
varieties are best to plant in Florida;
that part of our report I will leave to the
other committeemen.
Budding and grafting has proven to
be very expensive to nurserymen there-
fore, to plant out a grove with budded or
grafted Pecans is much more expensive
than it would be to plant the same grove
with seedlings but the assurance of having
trees bearing earlier with chances of a
crops of nuts each year will more than
pay the difference in putting out the
grove. My experience has been far more
satisfactory with buds than with graft-
ing. Where a nurseryman has irriga-
tion, I think the grafting has proven to
be as satisfactory and possibly more so
than the budding. Most all land in ’the
state of Florida has proven to be very
satisfactory in raising Pecan trees. The
low stiff soil with a clay subsoil anywhere
from two to ﬁve foot seems to be the best
land to grow Pecan trees on. Pecan trees
will stand most any amount of water on
low land without any injury to the trees.
They will not do much on land that is
underlaid with quick sand or land that
is better known as sand soaked land. The
Pecans are usually regarded as a difficult
subject to deal with in transplanting; af-
ter they have been transplanted for twelve
months and get started to growing then
a rapid growth can be put on them each
year with the proper attention paid to
them. I ﬁnd that barn-yard compost is
the best fertilizer to use around the Pe—
can trees. I raised one year old buds
last season on two year old roots that
grew ﬁve to six foot and some larger.
Pecan trees should be transplanted in
December or January to get the most sat-
isfactory results in growing off. I don’t
think it advisable to transplant late in the
spring after the sap has started to ﬂow in
the stock. My opinion is that it will
cause the trees to dwindle and ﬁnally die.
Plant out budded or grafted trees of the
best varieties and the results will be sat-
isfactory in years to come.

Report of Standing Committee on Citrus Fruits.

BY L. B. SKINNER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
When I was notiﬁed of my appoint-
ment as a member of the Committee on
Citrus fruits, I made up my mind that I
should surely be there, and even up to to-
day I was of the opinion that I would be
there, though there has been creeping in-
to my consciousness, the idea that some
thing was going to happen to prevent my
getting there after all. _
It is with exceeding great regret that
I give up the pleasure of meeting “the
fruit growers of the State from whom I
always learn something of value, and
with whom I always enjoy the time spent.
I say time spent, but I ought to rather say,
time saved. The towering practical, Mr.
Waite. the golden, Mr. McCarty, with
his pleasant smile, and hearty ways, the
faithful, hard working, Mr. Painter, all
these I shall miss.
I had_ intended to make a verbal report,
as I had been unable to get any replies
from my fellow committeemen, as to
what form our report should take.- The
wise men from the East, Phelps, Hart,
Hubbard, have recorded, in time past,
about all there is to know of orange cul-
ture and perhaps a little more, and we,
that are learners, would rather sit still
and listen that we may learn more, like
Sampson, or Boardman. Perhaps in the
past year I have learned some things that
will be interesting to fruit growers.
I have extensively used a power duster,
and I ﬁnd that it keeps fruit bright, but
it induces scale, and a good deal of it.
I ﬁnd that in a multitude of varieties of
the orange there is decided trouble. It
were better that a good many of these va-
rieties had never been born.
I hear Parson Brown fruit talked up,
it is a pretty poor fruit to my notion, and
Marsh Seedless grapefruit, be sure you
want it before you plant it. There is none
better than the Duncan Grapefruit, but
I am afraid that there has been a large
quantity of buds, not accurate to name,
of this variety sent out. Not intention-
ally, but by error, and I suppose that ill
often happens, in other cases too. It is
disappointing to plant Tardiffs, and ﬁnd
that you are going to reap Sweet Sevilles,
or Parson Browns, and ﬁnd you have an
ordinary seedling.
The Enterprise seedless orange, some-
times called Stark Seedless, is one of the
best bearers, and of a very good quality,
of the ordinary oranges, and commercial-
ly, has given me the best of results.
I have been interested in the compari-
son of the Valencia and the Tardiff or-
anges. I thought for a long time that
they were one and the same variety, but
under a different name. I ﬁnd upon look-
ing them carefully over, that they are
really distinct. That they are diﬁerent
in several ways. The Valencia is of a
deeper color, less of the lemon in color.
Then too the inside of the fruit is better
colored than the Tardiﬁ‘. On the other
hand I think that the Tardif’f is the better

keeper, both as to season, that is time of
shipping, and as to its ability to hold up
en route. And as to keeping qualities the
fruit en route, that remark opens up to me
the one question that occupies my thinker
these days to the exclusion of any other.
How shall we make our fruit keep and
carry better? What is the reason of the
epidemics of rot such as attacked us at
times the last two years? If I knew, and
could answer these questions aright, you
would have a paper worth your listening
to. I would like to ask your agricultural
chemists what effect nitrate of potash
would have on the stability of fruit? I
think from a test made for two years that
it is decidedly favorable to the keeping
quality. I would like to ask some of the
professors whether paraﬁine would tend
to keep the fruit from rotting.
I would like to ask whether, in the
opinion of growers, late cultivation tends
to make fruit rot in transit?
The markets are all practically done
with Florida citrus fruits, and yet we
could just as well grow enough Tardiffs
to keep them supplied for six weeks yet.
Suppose there is some waste, what of it.
we can stand it. And grapefruit—I ate
grapefruit in July last year from off the
tree that was the ﬁnest thing I ever ate on
a hot day in my life. I expect to eat it
again this year, and if we can get a grape-
fruit in April, May and June, I am willing
to risk its selling at a paying price.
I believe the variety to be a distinct va-
riety, but will know better when it is test-
ed longer. We ought to ship citrus fruits
from October to june continuously, and
when we do, the fruit industry need fear
no competition.
James Russell Lowell has an eleventh
Beautitude “Blessed is he that has noth-
ing to say and cannot be persuaded to
say it.” I am reminded that I would
rather work at growing oranges than
talk about it. I grow a considerable quan-
tity of fruit, and some of it is the best
I ever saw and some of it is the worst, I
am sorry to say. I know a very little, I
am hoping to learn a great deal more, and
again I want to express my regret at not
being able to be with you. I wish you a
very interesting and proﬁtable meeting.
I know that your officers have been untir-
ing in their efforts at the proper prepara-
tions for such a meeting.

Report of the Committee on Strawberries.

BY R. F. RIGDON.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen."
Strawberries are now one of Florida’s
staple crops and brings in to the State
each year many thousands of dollars, and
at a time of the year when there is not
very much other fruit to be had.
The soil best adapted to the growth is
a dark sandy loam, underlaid with
clay,—if it can be had—if not, any piece
of good lowland that can be well drained.
The best varieties as to ﬂavor and ship-
ping qualities, as far as I have tested, are
Klondike, Hofman, Improved, Lady
Tompson and Excelsior.
The yield per acre is, with a fair sea-
son, about ﬁve thousand quarts, if you
have home grown acclimated plants, and
about three thousand quarts if you have
to get northern grown plants.
Method of culture—First, the land
should be plowed from eight to twelve
inches deep and then well pulverized be-
fore being bedded, which should be done
at least four weeks before setting of plants.
as well selected ground gives a greater
assurance of a good stand of plants and
they will grow off more quickly and more
thriftliy.
The plants should be cultivated after
each rain very shallow. about one half
to one inch deep.
Method of marketing—The best and
safest way to get berries to market is in
ice boxes containing sixty ‘four quarts
each as they will arrive in the market
three days after as fresh as the day that
they were picked.
The growth and extent of culture has
been very much checked by the rates that
the express companies have placed on car-
rying berries to market.
Draw backs are many. — Drought,
freezes and late frosts are all very much
against the berry grower, but the worst
of all is the express company in their
charges to carry berries to market. and at
the end the commission men keep the rest
and send back for charges.
BY R. K. MUIRHEAD.
iMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I regret exceedingly that I will not
be able to be present this year. In for-
mer years I told the society all I knew
about strawberries. The only new thing
I know of is the time of planting, this
should be done in spring instead of fall
and the plants worked all through sum-
mer. This will insure large plants and
about four times if not ten times the yield.
I have tried it with the best results but
the cultivating through the summer Costs
money.
The difﬁculty of getting plants is
another difﬁculty but they can be got at
almost all the northern nurseries, and
when planted then the northern growxi
plants do very well.

Report of the Committee on Vegetables.
BY W. N. GIST.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I cannot in this paper, convey to your
minds a comprehensive idea of the vege-
table industry of the State. It is varied.
It is a deep subject calling forth much
energy and “gray” matter, and let me
accent the latter if the grower wishes to
be successful. It calls for as much care,
thought and energy as the raising of chil-
dren of which we expect to make men
and women of the highest types; that
may be an honor to the community in
which they may be cast.
The vegetable industry is too varied to
be discussed fully here at this time, but
I may say that it is one of the moneyed
industries and possibly would be pardon-
ed for saying that it now brings more
dollars into the State than the orange
crop. The movement of truck (you
know we grow truck and ship stuﬁ),
commencing in November and continues
until July. giving nine month’s shipping
season for the State; some part of the
State having suit that is wanted by the
man who has the dollars; all through
this period, and the market demand for
all our produce is increasing. Twelve
years ago the growers around Gainesville
would not have thought of shipping a
carload of lettuce to New York at one
time, now that market can take care of a
trainload at paying prices and I might
mention other crops. for instance, what
effect would Hasting's potato crop have
had on the market even ﬁve years ago.
The demand has increased and also
the means of distributing, and I might
say this part of the business has been
seriously neglected. It should be a busi-
ness separate from the growing. The
growing and packing is a job big enough
for one man, but nearly every trucker
thinks (and I’m one of them myself) he
can ship his stuff to better advantage
than the man who keeps up with that end
and makes it a business. giving his entire
time and attention to distributing. I
There is money in the business! There
is also sleepless nights and gray hair to
the one who falls a victim.

The Geology of Florida in Relation to Artesian
' Water Supply.
BY DR. E. H. SELLARDS.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In its general geology Florida is fortu-
nately of comparatively simple structure.
The formations of the state have suffered
no great distortion since their deposition
and lie for the most part nearly horizon-
tal as formed, or with a slightly accentu-
ated dip. For a clear understanding of the
water supply problem a conception of the
leading features of the geology of the
state is essential.
The underlying foundation rock
throughout the state is a massive and
very thick limestone. In character the
limestone is granular, soft and with many
shells, and, for the most part porous.
Borings indicate that water circulates
freely through it. The conditions of for-
mation, as indicated by the rock itself,
were, clear water free from land sedi-
ment in which shell life ﬂourished abund-
antly. This foundation limestone is com-
monly known as the Vicksburg limestone,
or in recent years the Peninsula lime-
stone. This formation we may expect
to encounter by 'borings in all parts of the
state. Beyond the coast line the forma-
tion is known to extend to Costa Rica.
and there is no reason to doubt that it
extends to the east into the Atlantic and
to the west into the gulf basin much
beyond the present Florida coast, and
is the one formation that is of uni-
versal distribution throughout the state
lying at the surface in small areas,
but for the most part buried at slight
to considerable depth beneath later rock
deposits. The peninsula limestone is ex-
posed at the surface except for a more
or less thick covering of sand in local
areas throughout Marion, Alachua, south—
ern Columbia, and Suwannee Counties.
In other parts of the State it is covered
by later formations, indicating that while
most of the state remained somewhat
longer under water, the areas named
appeared as islands at the close of the for-
mation of the peninsula limestone.
On top of the peninsula limestone
around these islands and throughout the
state in general there accumulated subse-
quent marine deposits some of them of
considerable thickness. These later for-
mations are, however, more or less local
in character and while reaching a consid-
erable thickness in parts of the state no one
of them extends unintermptedly through-
out the state as a whole. Immediate—
ly following the peninsular limestone
in the central part of the state is the Ocala
limestone, best exposed at the lime kiln at
Ocala where it is something more than
twenty feet deep. The Chattahoochee
limestone is perhaps a little later than the
Ocala and occurs along the Appalachaco-

la river. The Tampa Silex beds and
Tampa Limestone are seen at Ballast
Point, Tampa. Another thin formation,
the \Vhite Beach is exposed along little
Sarasota Bay. These several local for-
mations are included along with the pen-
insular limestone to make up what is
known in the more recent classiﬁcation as
the Oligocene of Florida. The rocks of
these several local formations taken to-
gether make up the surface rocks, except
for the mantle of sand over a very consid-
erable area of the central and western
part of the state.
The Micoene next above has an increas-
edproportion of clay and shales along with
some limestone and sandstone. The prin-
cipal area of Micoene extends along the
East Coast from Jacksonville to Lake
Worth or below, and reaches in some lo-
calaties a thickness of ﬁve hunderd feet.
The same time interval is represented
by a thinner deposit along the Appalacha-
cola river and west of the river towards
Pensacola.
Formations of still later date cover the
extreme south of the state and local areas
throughout the Estate in general.
The Florida deposits are all among the
more recent of the geology time divisions,
all falling within the Cenozoic or last of
the large time divisions. The state as a
whole lies entirely within and is a part
of the general coastal plains deposits
reaching from New Jersey on the north
along the Atlantic coast to the Gulf, and
west to Texas, embracing as a whole a
strip varying in width. but averaging
about 100 miles along the coast covering
the eastern part of New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North and South
Carolina, Georgia, all of Florida, much of
the southern part of Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas. The formations of
the coastal plains area as a whole are se-
dimentary containing much clay and
shales and sandstones, lying nearly hori-
zontal or with but slight dip. The sedi-
ment forming these deposits came evi-
dently from higher lands to the north
and west.
Owing to the fact that Florida. especial-
ly peninsula Florida, was farther remov-
ed from the source of sediment the pro—
portion of wash from the land was very
much less, and in the resulting seas an
abundant shell life was able to develope.
It thus happens that Florida is exception-
al among the other gulf states in the large
proportion of limestone it contains.
As will be gathered from this brief re-
view the Florida peninsula has been ele-
vated above water slowly. That the up-
lifting began at the close of the formation
of the peninsular limestone is evidenced
by the appearance of the island areas at
that time. That the further elevation was
also gradual and slow is indicated by the
successive deposits of later formations
around the island areas. It is assumed
that the slow upward pushing has brought
the peninusla up as a large anticlinal fold
with the highest part of the fold forming
the central area of the peninsula. Actual
observation of anticlinal structure from
the rocks themselves is difﬁcult owing to
the mantle of sand covering, and the lim-
ited exposures of rock. That there is a
dip, however, is indicated by the depth at
which any recognizable formation is en-
countered in borings. Thus the peninsu-
lar limestone which is found at the sur-
face in Alachua or southern Columbia
county is encountered in wells at St. Au—
gustine at a depth of 224 feet. Farther
to the south along the coast an even great-

er thickness of later formations rest on
the peninsular limestone. At Lake Worth
the limestone is reported at a depth of
1000 feet. A dip to the south is likewise
indicated from the fact that the peninsu-
la limestone in that direction dips under
later formations towards Tampa and the
Manatee region.
The features of the peninsula area
bearing most directly on the question of
underground waters are as follows: The
Florida peninsula has as its sub-forma-
tion a porous cavernous limestone. On
top of this is a varying thickness of sedi-
mentary rocks of alternate pervious and
impervious layers, limestone, shale, clay
and sand horizons, and that these hori-
zons dip in general to the east, south, and
west from the central area.
Artesian supply: Artesian water is
properly water conﬁned and under pres-
sure, usually pressure of its own weight,
so that when the stratum containing it is
tapped the water will rise in the opening
thus made.
Artesian flow occurs when the head is
suﬁicient to cause the rise of water to and
above the surface level of the mouth of
the well. '
The conditions necessary to bring
about artesian water may be grouped for
brevity under three heads as follows:
Dip of the strata.
Alternating impervious and pervious
strata.
Some condition or combination of con-
ditions bringing the water under sufﬁcient
pressure to supply lthe necessary head.
This latter condition may result from
the sagging of a series of these strata at
the middle allowing the edge to be expos-
ed at either side, so that the water will
ﬂow at any point lower than the exposed
area of the horizon. Such a trough like
structure is an artesian basin. The same
result may be brought quite as effectively
by an inclined porous stratum wedging
out between two impervious strata, or by
the pervious straum itself grading into
an impervious or less pervious condition,
as a sandstone grading into a ﬁner sand-
stone, or a sandstone grading into a shale.
Even a local variation in the thickness or
texture of the containing stratum may re-
sult in considerable head. The friction
of water threading its way long distances
through the pores of a pervious formation
affords sufﬁcient head for an appreciable
rise of water through a boring. (Cham-
berlin, 5th An. Rpt. U. S. G. S., p. I43).
The term, artesian slope is applied to
such an area. It is apparent that the
pressure of the Florida artesian water
is explained by artesian slope rather than
an artesian basin.
The dip of the Florida formations
whatever may have been its cause fumi-
shes the ﬁrst of the essential structural
features of artesian water accumulation.
The second condition necessary, the al-
ternating impervious and pervious strata,
is met in the varied IIZIJIIII'C of the Florida
deposits in which water tight clays and
shales are often succeeded by porous
and water bearing limestones and sand—
stones. The head necessary to induce ar-
tesian ﬂow is doubtless due to pinching
out of strata or change to ﬁne texture of
the water carrying layer.
Source of artesian water:
The catchment area.
The general gathering ground for the
artesian water of the coast is naturally the
interior region of the State. Of the rain-
fall of an area a part is evaporated and re-
turned to the atmosphere; another part is
carried oﬁ’ immediately to the ocean as

surface drainage; while a third part ﬁnds
its way into the ground.
Owing to the generally porous nature
of the Florida formation, that part of the
annual rainfall going directly into the
ground is an unusually high percentage.
While the part passing off as surface
drainage is a correspondingly small part
of the annual rainfall.
It is not to be assumed, however, that
all of that which passes into the earth is
available again as artesian supply. The
amount of water reaching the surface
through an artesian well is necessarily
less than that entering the ground, owing
to friction in ﬂow, to lack of completely
pervious strata above and below and ow-
ing to the evident fact that there is in all
cases sources of escape for the water
through channels other than the artesian
wells.
The area covered lby the outcrop of any
horizon will vary according to the thick-
ness of the horizon, the topography of the
area at which the outcrop occurs, and the
dip of the strata. The dip of the Florida
rocks is slight and the catchment area for
any collecting horizon is therefore propor-
tionately large.
In addition to this usual or normal
catchment area an added supply in some
cases, probably of considerable importance
is received from sinks reaching through
to the conducting horizon.
Of the great number of sinks through-
out the State receiving regularly surface
drainage many evidently reach no great
distance downwards and the water after a
more or less extended underground
course reaches a river or otherwise re-
turns to the surface. On the other hand
it is equally evident that some of these
sinks are waterways leading through im-
pervious strata and connecting with por-
ous horizons, below which conduct water
readily and are capable of becoming ar-
tesian horizons Thus if the water of a
sink is observed to rise to a deﬁnite level
and to be unaffected by any amount of
water going into it, and especially if the
level of the water in the sink is found to
agree practically with the level to which
artesion water rises in borings in the im-
mediate locality it becomes evident that
the sink leads to the artesian horizon. The
added supply of artesian water received
through such sinks is doubtless very con-
siderable.
In this connection should be mentioned
also a second unused artesian supply,
namely the drainage of inland areas
through deep borings. As is well known
this plan of drainage involves sinking bor-
ings to such depth as to encounter a con-
ducting stratum which carries the water
readily . Obviously the probabilities are
that the water is thus being turned into a
horizon capable of becoming an artesian
supply horizon in some lower area of the
State. Some such wells are recorded in
which the water is turned directly into an
artesian stratum, the artesian water ris-
ing in fact within a few feet of the sur-
face. Some of these wells present the un-
ique feature of being, during wet weath-
er drainage wells, and during dry weath-
er, through the medium of pumps, irriga-
tion wells. In these cases it is impossible
from the data now at hand to affirm that
the water thus added is available as an
addlition to the artesian supply at any
nearby region of lower level aving ar-
tesian ﬂow, but the inferences are very
strong that the artesian supply is directly
increased in this way.

Available supply of artesian water:
Fortunately Florida with its heavy
rainfall and with its formations especi-
ally adapted for taking up and holding a
store of water is subject to an annually
added supply not likely to be over drawn.
It must not be supposed, however, that
more water can be taken from the arte-
'sian horizon than enters it. On the con-
trary the supply avaliable is neccesarily
much less than the supply received. For-
tunately the rainfall is sufﬁcient to assure
an underground water supply among the
States most valuable assets.

Florida Immigration—What Shall It Be?
BY CAPT. a. E. ROSE,
STATE CH BIIST.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject assigned to me, “Florida
Immigration, What Shall it Be?” is one
that is not commanding much attention,
not only in Florida, but throughout the
entire South. We have recently had
several conventions of representative men
on the subject: Seldom do we have a
gathering, or convention of any kind,
agricultural commissioners, cane growers,
turpentine producers, timber men, saw
mill men, railroad men, ticket agents,
trafﬁc managers, farmers, cattle growers,
agriculturists or horticulturists, but the
subject of Immigration “crops out” in
one shape or another.
In fact, the Southern States have agi-
tated this question of Immigration—For-
eign Immigration—to a very consider-
able extent during the past few years,
much has been said upon the subject,
numerous plans have been proposed to
turn the tide of foreign immigration,
from the West, to the South. The estab-
lishment of direct lines of immigrant
ships, from Southern ports to Europe;
with agents of the Southern States estab-
lished in foreign countries, to secure im-
migrants, is probably the most popular
plan suggested. To avoid the “contract
labor laws," the States are asked to do
what the citizen (or corporation), is pro-
hibited from doing; and also to tax the
people of the State. to secure cheaper
labor, to compete with the working men
of the State.
Florida, I am glad to say, has not be-
come hysterical, 0r anxious, in this mat-
ter. She has displayed no great haste
to receive the inﬂux of foreign immi-
grants—Japanese, Italians or Chinamen,
so ardently desired, and earnestly advo-
cated, by some of our sister States—
urged on by Land Syndicates—mining
and manufacturing corporations, desiring
to secure cheaper, and more servile labor,
than is now obtained in the South, out-
side the cities.
While the phenomenal development of
the South, during the past decade, along
all lines of industry, agriculture, mining,
manufacture and transportation, has
created a large demand for labor, and
has largely increased the wages of our
working people, it is questionable if it be
for the best interests of the South, and
particularly Florida, to encourage foreign
immigration.
The South is now the only distinctly
American section of the Union; where
the traditions, habits, prejudices, virtues
and vices; courage, chivalry, indepen-
dence and love of freedom so characteris-
tic of the early settler or pioneer, can be
found in its purity. Where the true
American character, begat by the “pio-
neer,” “Puritan,” and “cavalier,” can still
be found. The descendants of those ad-
venturous men and women, who at their

own cost of deprivation and hardship, es-
tablished the original thirteen colonies,
on the Atlantic Sea Board; who ﬁrst oc-
cupied the land, drove back the Indian;
threw off the yoke of the old country—
with its limitations, political and relig-
ious, to establish a Republic of F reemen,
where liberty in its truest sense should
prevail.
The true American type—we certainly
have such a type—is now found princi-
pally south of “Mason and Dixon's Line”
—In the South Atlantic, and Gulf States;
and is most strongly marked in the rural '
districts of the cotton growing States;
particularly in Florida, where most of
our people can trace their lineage, direct~
ly t0 the founders of the Republic, with
little if any admixture of foreign blood—
Descendants of those grand old pioneers
—rugged, capable. stubborn, courageous
and honest, who lone handed, and by
mere force of character, conquered the
wilderness, as an heritage for their chil-
dren, and children’s children.
The descendants of whom fought the
bloodiest war of modern times, to preserve
the constitutional liberties of the Republic
founded by their fathers. Those fathers,
who by their sacriﬁces, made it possible
for the foreign immigrant to flock to the
States—the North and \Vest—after the
establishment of religious and political
liberty, by our Revolutionary ancestors.
Florida has had a large increase of
population, during the past ﬁfteen years;
she has increased from 391,000 to 620,-
ooo—a little more than 58 per cent.—
From 1890 to 1900, she increased 35 per
cent. (391,000 to 528,000). The States’s
census taken last year, now being com-
pleted, will show a greater proportionate
increase-
Florida gained a larger percentage of
population, than any other Atlantic State,
during the last United States census per-
iod; namely, 35 per cent. She exceeded
the-average of all the groups of States—
that is the North Atlantic group—20.90
per cent. The South Atlantic, 17.90 per
cent.; the North Central, 17.50 per cent.;
the South Central, 26.10 per cent., and
the Western Division, 31.90 per cent.
Her percentage of increase in popula-
tion was exceeded only, by Arizona,
Idaho, Indian Territory, Montana, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, \Vashington,
and Wyoming, from 1890 to 1900; while
the indications are that her increase for
the present decade will be far greater in
proportion.

The most remarkable feature of Flori-

ticularly natives of the Southern States—
notably from the States of Georgia.

Carolina.

All the other States and territories are
represented in Florida's population,
though the above list embraces all States
that have 1,000 or more representatives
in our population.
What I desire particularly to empha-
size—is that Florida has had a greater
proportionate increase in population than
any other State, except the few Northern
States mentioned previously, that have
been ﬁlled up by foreign immigrants;
exploited by the railroads and immigrant
ships—for simply “business reasons.”
The “Foreign Immigrant” is exploited
by the “Immigrant Ship” and railroad
like .any other commercial commodity.
Lumber, merchandise, beef, or pork; cat—
tle or hogs. And were it not for the
laws prohibiting individuals (or corpora-
tions), importing contract labor, the ques-
tion of foreign immigration would be
solved at once by the importation of mil-
lions of coolies—not Chinamen, Japanese
or Malays necessarily, but millions of
“Redemptioners,” from all parts of
Europe, who would be sold for a term of
years, to those desiring labor, miners,
manufacturers, planters, saw mill and
turpentine operators, for simply enough
to pay their passage and a proﬁt to the
transportation lines, as was done during
the early years of the last century.
Another remarkable feature of Flori-
da’s population—not only the great pre-
ponderance of American born citizens, is
the great number of native born children;
a population of 528,000 in Iooo—shows
270,293 children. or youths less than 20;
197,600 of school age; and 72,693 less
than four years old, more than half of our
population. Such facts are potent argu-
ments against foreign immigrants, par-
ticularly when we know that thousands
of our best American citizens are now
seeking homes in the State. That this
domestic immigration is rapidly increas—
ing is patent to any one who is noting
the rapid ﬁlling up of the whole State.
I think the State census of 1905 will
surprise many of our peole, when the
increase of population is noted, particu-
larly the natural increase. Race suicide
can by no means he charged against
Florida, where over one-half of the popu-
lation are school children, or younger.
That Florida needs, or can comfort-
ably care for—more people. is true; that
she is obtaining them more rapidly than
any other Atlantic State, is also true;
that by natural increase and by American
immigration—men and women from the
Southeastern States particularly, she is
rapidly ﬁlling up the vacant places is also
true.
Speaking of vacant lands, United
States lands, I desire to call your at-
tention to the fact that there is compar-
atively little vacant land, State or United
States, remaining. The State has little
left, no homestead lands at all, and has
claims against what remains unallotted
of some four millions of acres more than
she has to meet the claims with.
United States homesteads are being
rapidly exhausted. Most of the desirable
homesteads are now occupied. The re-
cent “Stone and Timber acts" are rapidly
absorbing the remainder of the United
States lands. Ninety per cent. of the
public domain has passed into \the pos-
session of individuals, syndicates and
corporations, during the past twenty
years. Not only in this. but in other
States.

Though Florida had probably a greater
acreage of State lands than any other
State, except Texas, some twenty—seven
million acres, more or less, practically
ﬁve-sevenths of all the land in the State—
less than twenty-ﬁve years ago, she to-
day is practically bankrupt in her landed
possessions, and has claims against her
for millions of acres more than she has
to meet the claims with.
At a recent convention held in the
Southern part of the State, the statement
was made by several gentlemen: men
well-informed and familiar with condi-
tions; that one of the principal reasons
why young men were ﬂocking to the cit-
ies, was that lands for homes could not
be purchased. This was not denied,
though repeated by several members, and
in the presence of representatives of sev-
eral of the larger Land Syndicates.
Our public domain—once the boast of
our State and Nation—has dwindled until
now it is difﬁcult for a young American
to ﬁnd 160 acres to homestead. We have
parted with our heritage, our vast
domain of productive soil—our own chil-
dren—to say nothing of the foreign im-
migrant—are left without homes, to be-
come the “bond servants” or “tenant far-
mer” of land syndicates, corporations or
trust magnates.
Do we need immigrants? Yes; Ameri-
can immigrants; particularly from the
Southeastern State—=men who will own
their own homes; maintain the true
American spirit, a love of liberty, and per-
sonal independence. Such men as were
recently alluded to by Judge Emory
Spear—in charging a jury in a noted
criminal case that has commanded inter—
national attention during the past seven
years—in charging, the Judge said, “I
am told that is has been cyninly said by
a famous New Yorker that no man who
has a million dollars can be convicted of
crime in America. The verdict of this
jury of plain, clear-sighted, honest Ameri-
cans has falsiﬁed such a pessimism. Of
that jury it may be said that there is per-
haps not a man who cannot trace his an-
cestry to a patriot of the Revolution which
established American independence. It
is true, as I have often declared, that to
the homogeneous Americanism of these
Southern States when they are plainly
shown their duty, our country may ever
look with confidence for the enforcement
of its laws and for the maintenance of its
institutions.”
True they will have to purchase their
lands—and pay several thousand per cent.
proﬁt to_ the present owners; and in a
few years, ﬁnd it difﬁcult if not impos-
sible, to obtain a free hold, by purchase
or otherwise.
Doubtless, some of my auditors will
consider me an alarmist. and believe my
picture overdrawn; let me assure them
such is not the case. \Vhen but a few
years ago—less than twenty—the foreign
emigrant, or the native born young
American—had tens of thousands of
homesteads, from which to select his one
hundred and sixty acres: he has today but
few to choose from, they are remote.
scattered and not desirable. having but
little agricultural value.
While our public domain has to a large
extent disappeared, foreign immigration
has increased until it has attracted the
serious attention of thoughtful Ameri-
cans. I quote a recent editorial from the
“Miami Metropolis,” one of the most
conservative of our Florida newspapers:
“Foreign immigrants are pouring into
Eastern ports in such large numbers the
Department of Labor and Commerce has

become apprehensive and has determined
to more strictly enforce the regulations
for the restriction of immigration.”
This is a country of vast territory, and
its assimilative powers are very great,
but there should be some limit to the in-
ﬂux of foreigners and the crowding of
our cities with a population which
seriously adds to the gravity of problems
that are pressing more and more for so-
lution. The stream of foreigners is not
suﬂ‘iciently distributed. Too few become
soil tillers and producers. It can be easily
understood why this country is so attrac-
tive to the poor of overcrowded Europe,
and quick and cheap transportation makes
it comparatively easy for them to seek
homes. In 1900 there were 10,460,000
people of foreign birth in this.country,
and over 21,000,000 born of foreign
parentage. About 35 per cent. of the
total population is wholly or partially of
foreign parentage.
Of the foreign-born population, 94 per
cent. is resident in the North, and 6 per
cent. in the South. In 1900 the total
foreign-born population of Allegheny,
Pa., was, in round numbers, 30,000; in
Atlanta, it was 2,500; in Charleston, S.
C., it was 2,500, and 12,000 in Colum-
bus, Ohio. In Louisville, it was 21,000
and in Lowell. 40,000; in Memphis, it
was 5,000, and in Minneapolis, 61,000.
In Worcester, Mass. it was 37,000; in
Rochester, N. Y-, it was 40,000; in Provi-
dence, R. I., it was 55,000, and 46,000,
in St. Paul. In New York City there
were 786,000 persons of German parent-
age, 715,000 of Irish parentage, 245,000
of Russian, 218,000 of Italian. 53000 of
Polish and 52,000 of Hungarian. A con-
siderable per cent. of the total population
is German and Irish.
These, as a rule. make excellent citi-
zens, and become thoroughly imbued with
American methods and ideals. But there
are millions of immigrants who are not
desirable as citizens; and even a large
inpouring of foreigners who may make
good citizens is not wholly unobjection—
able. Through immigration and natural
increase the country is being rapidly ﬁlled,
and when it becomes crowded, as it will,
it means a change of conditions—from
the free and easy methods of living char-
acteristic of Americans. to the close econ-
omy and hard life of the crowded coun-
tries of the old world and labor will be
cheaper and the cost of living greater.”
That I am not alone in my position,
I quote the language of that typical Amer-
ican citizen, Theodore Roosevelt—that
representative American the descendant
of the Dutch Founders of Manhattan on
the one side, and an equally noted South-
ern family on the other; in an address to
the representatives of Organized Ameri-
can Labor, at the White House, on
March 21, speaking of immigration, he
said:
“You have spoken of the immigration
laws. I believe not merely that all pos-
sible steps should be taken to prevent the
importation of laborers under any form,
but I believe further that this country
ought to make a resolute effort from now
on to prevent the coming to the country
of men with a standard of living so low
that they tend, by entering into unfair
competition with, to reduce the standard
of living of our own people. Not one of
you can go further than I will go in the
effort steadily to raise the status of the
American Wage Worker, so long as,
while doing it. I can retain a clear con-
science and the certainty that I am doing
what is right. I will do all in my power
for the lalliring men except to do what

is wrong; and I will not do that for him
or for any one else.”
“We must not let our natural sentiment
for succoring the oppressed and unfor-
tunate of other lands lead us into what
warped moral and mental attitude of try-
ing to succor them at the expense of pull-
ing down our own people. Laws should
be enacted to keep out all immigrants
who do not show that they have the right
stuff in them to enter into our life on
terms of decent equality with our own
citizens. This is indeed ﬁrst in the in-
terests of the laboring man, but further-
more in the interests of all of us as Ameri-
can citizens; for gentlemen, the bonds
that unite all good American citizens are
stronger by far than the differences,
which I think you accentuate altogether
too much, between the men who do one
kind of labor and the men who do another
kind. As for immigrants, we cannot have
too many of the right kind; and we
should have none at all of the wrong
kind; and they are of the right kind if we
can be fairly sure that their children and
grandchildren can meet on terms of
equality our children and grandchildren,
so as to try to be decent citizens together,
and to work together for the uplifting of
the Republic.”

Report of Standing Committee on Ornamentals.

BY MRS. GEO S. GATES.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Those of us who have borne the heat
and burden of the day, those of us who
have been twenty years in Florida, and
are thus entitled to the name of “Old
Settler." are beginning to rejoice because
of the real prosperity that is everywhere
' showing up over our fair State—at last
the time has come when we also have
green lawns, ornamental grounds and
good roads.
‘These years of experience have taught
us valuable lessons. these lessons are tab-
ulated and crystalized into records and
into great nurseries of thrifty stock. avail—
able for all kind of horticultural purposes.
So now, the wayfaring man, though a
“Yankee,” need not err. We are greatly
indebted to the State Horticultural Socie-
ty for a large mass of these records. and
we should all more earnestly work for a
broader ﬁeld of usefulness for this society.
For from the soil must ever come the
sound, healthy prosperity of any State.
As the spring is with us still. We must
express the joy we have felt from her
very ﬁrst appearance, in the fragrant
buds of the Yellow Jessamine. to the
present pageant now waving about us in
the waxy bloom of the great Magnolia.
\Ve have secured much pleasure by avail-
ing ourselves of the simple plants within
easy reach. In December we secured
many roots of the Yellow jessamine—
planted some about old stumps and some
on posts, and it is perfect for old fences
and arbors. By March, we had some
bloom, and the second year, with care
and fertilizer a mass of new growth and
blossoms—and I know no miser ever had
more joy with his gold. than we, with our
mass of golden fragrant bloom.
The wild plum is the next to bloom—
about the middle of February. It does
not bring a few blossoms. here and there,
but great wreaths. bunches and banks of
snowy bloom. One can go out and cut
great armfulls of feathery blossoms, and
ﬁll the house with the very spirit of
spring—and one is exalted with that
spirit as they pass and repass; those great
gnarled branches, that speak of greater
life and peace and hope—crowd halls and
dark corners with these ﬂeeting joys.
The gentle japanese make the Cherry
blossom time the happiest festival of the
year. So do all lovers of nature—the pear
tree is a marvel just after the plum, and so
full of blossoms are all fruit trees, that I
feel sure. Nature means that we are to
enjoy her blooms, as well as her fruits——
she is never stingy if you ever dare think
it of her, look at the spring-time blos-
soms; and learn there the wonderful les_
son of the large, full glorious develop-
ment that is certainly in common with all
Nature. Let me plead for the arrange-
ment of blossoms when we bring them
indoors—for the busy housewife gets the
most of her enjoyment from her cut ﬂow-
ers. Don’t crowd several kinds in the

129
same holder. A perfect rose; a perfect
branch of blossoms have as strong and re-
freshing an individuality as have our
human friends, and they repay us as
gracefully for respecting it, as they do.
Next to bloom is the pink Azalea, or Wild
Honeysuckle, as it is called all along the
Atlantic States—simply delightful in a
great mass—grown ten or twelve feet in
low land, but with care, a thrifty bush
on high land. The same can be said of
the Dogwood Lily of the Valley tree,
Spirea, or Bridal Wreath, the Oleander,
Cape Jessamine, Crape Myrtle, and the
Sweet Myrtle. These are all fragrant,
hardy and close at hand. We ﬁnd
December planting most satisfactory for
trees and shrubbery. We have had the
best success in planting Oleanders, by
getting a stake about two feet long, stiff
enough to drive, sharpen it at one end
and drive into the ground just where you
want it to grow, leaving out two or three
eyes or buds, they will put out from them
and you have a tree at once.
I want to recall Mr. Taber’s paper of
last year, to your mind. It is well worth
another reading. It was about the joys
of a thicket, he called it, “A Message
from the Woods.” I saw the thicket be-
fore I read the message, and I felt then,
that every Nature-lover had just some
such spot—I have. It is a human instinct
to keep a bit of nature’s work close at
hand, from whence can be drawn inspir-
ation, strength and hope.
It may be a bit of pond, full of gleam-
ing white lilies, or a bit of virgin forest
in its strength and grandure, or a thicket
full of the riotous profusion of trees,
shrub and vine, that in its blending of
shape and shade, is the despair of all our
timid efforts. Let me suggest the
greater planting of the Wistaria, both
white and purple, there again the Japan-
ese have produced wonderful effects, their
arbors are simply dreams. You do not
realize you are looking at anything man
has done, it looks like magic. Some of
the flower stems are three feet long, and
hang above the head like a purple and
white sky. It will grow rampant here,
even with little care—of course it is not
as earlyas the plum, or as evergreen as
the Yellow Jassamine, which I heartily
recommend—the Wistaria blooms in
early April and the Jessamine in early
February, both are valuable for wiring
to scrawny tall trees, and for covering
unsightly objects. But chief among vines
in this land of “Creepers,” is the wild
Smilax, or Bamboo Briar, as it is called
here. I spoke of this vine last year, and
wish to call your attention to it again.
I have found four varieties, a plain green
one, and a variegated one without thorns
and mostly roots, they are worthless,
never grow more than six or eight feet,
then there is a strong rampant growing
one with briars, and covered with black-
berries in the fall, ornamental, but cruel.
But the bamboo, or Wild Smilax, that
is shipped from the entire South, for
decorating along with Holly, Palm
leaves, gray moss, long leaf pine, etc.. is
a most beautiful and satisfactory plant—
grows just like cultivated Smilax, but is
hardy, evergreen and a smooth vine, no
berries, latter part of April has small,
greenish blossoms, very fragrant, much
like the Mignonette—if the roots are
planted in December the vine will grow
from thirty to sixty feet in a season.
It comes up in the spring with a
head like Asparagus and is edible,
rather a good substitute for that
vegetable, the vine runs along with this
head and gets its growth before putting

out its side branches- You must be up
and doing, for it is a rapid grower, it
stays awake nights to grow. But a dain-
tier, cleaner, more satisfactory vine, I
have never found.
A beautiful, hardy, ﬂowering border
that is very effective along a fence, is the
hardy Verbena. purple, it will grow al-
most two feet high. A neighbor has
one on three sides of a town lot— it is
a surprise and a delight to all who behold
it, a mass of soft purple splendor, it
reveals the value of ﬂowers in a great
mass.
There are wonderful possibilities for
Florida, I can only hint at them, and
give a bit of cheer and experience from
my own little corner in Putnam county,
and urge you to plant things that will
also be a joy to others after we have
passed away.
That brings me to the Village Improve—
ment work. This work for a higher life
for our village, for tree planting and the
making of good roads, is one where men
and women must work together. It is
certainly the mother’s anxious concern
that her town, her county, her State be
clean‘and up-to—date as well as her home,
for in them she must continue the educa-
tion of her boys and girls. It is the
environment of the young that makes us
have men and women with proper ideals
of civic pride, and of partiotism. Moth-
ers know instinctively how important it
is to give children the right appreciation
of beauty and cleanliness. When our
boys and girls get the right education
in Florida, our towns will be too nice for
hogs and cattle to run in and not until
then. But mothers sometimes fail. You
can ﬁnd this out by getting an ordinary
man to clean up a bit of road-way. You
will most likely ﬁnd his idea of “cleaning
up" means to “dig up” everything living
in sight, leaving a nice, clean bed of sand,
without the slightest idea of the use for
which the cleaning was made. We don’t
expect all men to see beauty, any more
than we expect all women to sing, but we
do ask, if you ﬁnd a beautiful, young tree
or Palmetto, that can remain in the
clearing, just as well as not; please let
it stay. In this village improvement
work, we deal with matters of fact, not
of opinion, so there is only the common
inertia of humanity to overcome, and it
is enough. Our study of how to get the
most out of what we have, and for the
comfort and happiness of all, has brought
the Christ spirit much closer to us, in our
homes and in our public work, for work-
ing with Nature, not against her, we are
one with the birds and the trees, and we
become as little children, simple and trust—
ful. Surely Chas. Wagner would love
Florida, for one soon learns here the
“Simple Life.” and cannot worry long if
he tries.
As woman is the maker of the home
“atmosphere,” and man the strength, the
foundation of the structure let us make
the most of these great forces, that the
environment may be the most perfect for
the proper development of our children.
Not stopping at the home but demanding
and struggling for better conditions in
our towns, our villages and our State-
Give me a man whose mother has
taught him to love the birds, the trees,
the beauties of nature, he is the man for
road commissioner, for park work, he
can see and save what nature has given
us so lavishly on every side. But with-
out the right environment and the ear-
nest love implanted in the child-heart, our
efforts will be slow and faltering.
Joy is in my heart when I read of

this good roads agitation, this work is
the most important work before us today,
the home, the mill, the mine are all handi-
capped terribly, without good roads.
Life is without sociability and work a
drudgery. There are many lovely spots
in our State, beautiful villages, ideal in
every way, but the tourist or settler are
driven to other localities by the awful
sand roads. This is a question for each
town to settle for themselves for the needs
and conditions are all so different.
\\"e are greatly indebted to Senator
Mann and Senator Morgan, for their
heroic work along this line, and we feel
sure they have the earnest support of
every member of this Society. Let me
suggest when you lay out your new roads,
you call a conference of the City Fathers.
and the Village Improvement Mothers.
\Vomen’s studies along these lines are
showing them the value of nature’s free
gifts in all States,_by road-side and river,
on mountain sides and in valleys. Im-
mense amounts of beautiful and suitable
material right at hand. They will be
sure to get the trees planted at once and
have all our magniﬁcent forest trees
represented. We like planting each spe-
cies by itself. a long line of “later
Oaks, a long line of Hollys, a long line
of Camphor, \Vild Olive. Live Oak, Pal-
metto, and a long line of the queen of all
flowering trees, the Magnolia Grandi-
fiora. This superb tree with its magniﬁ-
cent and odorous bloom should be planted
about every Florida home and village.
All the trees I have mentioned are ever—
green—what a wonderful collection, per-
fect for beautifying and shading our
roadways. Miles of highways shaded
with such ,a variety of splendid trees
would give us, in time, such fame as have
the giant Cryptomerians given japan on
her wonderful State roads. There the
poor of the cities travel for miles on per-
fect roads and under giant trees, taking
in their rude vehicles the babies and
kitchen outﬁt and journeying along for
days out of doors and under God’s great
canopy— they get courage and health to
return again to the city struggle. How
good it would be if our poor could jour-
ney to the ocean or gulf—only a few pal-
try miles, and it would often bring back
health to the fever stricken and hopeless.
In the face of the wonderful progress of
Florida in twenty years, we feel certain
that our good roads dreams will come
true. The Times—Union says they will.

PLANTS FOR HOME ADORNMENT.
BY W.C.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is not necessary for me to come
before you with any argument in
favor of the ornamentation of the home
surroundings. That subject has been so
often discussed here, that nothing re-
mains to be said on that line.
I think that we are all agreed that it
is desirable to do the best we can to make
our homes attractive and beautiful. It
then only remains for us to consider the
matter of ways and means. There are
a few favored mortals who do not need
to consider expense when they wish to
have a beautiful home. They give orders
that such and such things shall be done,
and immediately all the energies of gard—
eners, landscape gardeners, nurserymen
and ﬂorists are devoted to the task of com-
pleting the job satisfactorily. The result
is not always as pleasing, to a cultivated
taste, as would be expected from the
great outlay of money. Unless directed
by a wise controlling mind, effect is often
spoiled by crowding, or by the use of un-
suitable materials. This. however, does
not concern very many of our number.
I have thought it best, at this time. to
try to give a partial list of trees, shrubs
and vines that deserve a place in our door-
yards and are available to every one.
Last year, the present Chairman of the
Committee on Ornamentals, recommend-
ed the live oak. quercus virens, and the
water oak. quercus aquatica. Both are
desirable, the water oak makes the most
rapid growth, is symmetrical and beautis
ful. It is. perhaps. not so long lived as
STEELE.
the live oak. but trees of the water oak
that were over 50 feet high and with
trunks over a foot in diameter, twenty
years ago, are still thrifty and vigorous.
There are two other native evergreen
trees that should be added to the list, mag-
nolia grandiﬂora and magnolia glauca,
the latter is commonly known as sweet
bay. If given plenty of room, in open
ground, where they will not be shaded
by older trees, both species will grow
rapidly and form symmetrical heads.
They are highly ornamental at any sea-
son of the year, but are especially so when
in bloom.
The camphor tree, cinnamomum cam-
phora. is one of the most desirable shade
and ornamental trees that I know. It
thrives best on moist soil, but will grow
wherever an orange tree will live.
There are two smaller evergreen trees
that would be more commonly found in
cultivation if it were not for the fact that
they are very difficult to transplant. suc-
cessfully. I refer to the two larger varie-
ties of holly. Ilex opaca, the common
prickly leaved species and Ilex Dahoon.
The latter is much like the ﬁrst except
that it is of somewhat smaller growth and
the leaves are smooth. Hollies may be
transplanted by cutting the trunk of? close
to the ground, in winter, and then mov-
ing the roots at once with as little dis-
turbance as possible. I have known holly
trees to be transplanted with the tops on,
but there are more failures than successes.
Hollies are diecious, that is the staminate
and pistillate ﬂowers are borne on differ-

ent trees. None but the pistillate trees
ever bear fruit, and they will fail unless
there is a staminate trees within a reason-
able distance. If you live near a ham-
mock where there are wild trees you may
safely set out a pistillate tree with the
expectation that it will bear fruit. But
if not, it is useless to look for berries un-
less you have both kinds on your place.
In some locations, shade is not desir-
able all the year, or at least not neces-
sary in winter, in such places a decid-
uous tree may be planted. One of the
very best of these is the softmaple, acer
rubrum. This tree always excites admir-
ation when in bloom or in fruit. It
usually blooms in February and the fruit
ripens and falls before the leaves appear.
A close second to the maple is the
sweet gum, liquidamber staraciﬂua. It
is not striking in appearance when in
bloom, but its foliage is attractive, es-
pecially n the autumn just before it drops
oﬂ'. The corky winged branches are
quite curious in winter when not hidden
by the leaves.
Of course those of you who live below
the frost line have at least a few orange
trees. If any of you are so unfortunate
as not to be able to grow the ordinary
sweet or sour oranges, we would recom-
mend that you set one or more trees _of
the hardy orange, citrus trifoliata. As
an ornamental tree it has one advantage
over the sweet orange, that is the ﬂowers
come in clouds while there are no leaves
on the tree to hide part of them. The
curious thorny branches covered with a
sheet of snowy blossoms are beautiful.
Shrubs that will bloom all the season
are most desirable. Where it is not too
cold. the Chinese hibiscus has few equals
for showiness. but they are too tender for
some parts of the State.
- heard.
Altheas, a nearly related family to the
hibiscus, are entirely hardy and will bloom
throughout the entire season. There are
varieties of several colors, but not the
range of shades that may be found in the
Chinese hibiscus. I can especially recom-
mend the double white as being the best
of all.
Tabenaemontana coronaria, that is a
long name, but it has no common name
in this country, so far as I have ever
Henderson. in his “Hand-book
of Plant,” says that it is known as East
Indian rose bay, quite' as long a name
and but little easier to remember. This
is one of the most desirable that I have
ever seen. It is very tender, easily killed
by frost, but has grown at my home for
about 18'years, without protection, except
that a few times it has been banked about
the base with earth, and it has not failed
to bloom each year. When killed by frost,
it sprouts up quickly in the spring and
.soon begins to blossom and keeps it up
until cold weather comes again. The
ﬂowers resemble those of the cape Jessa-
mine, (Gardenia ﬂorida), but are not
over one-fourth to one-third the size, and
are more delicate in appearance. They
are very double, pure white and have a
delicate fragrance.
Bauhinnia acuminata is also quite ten-
der, but in my many years of experience
with it. it has not once failed to sprout
up and bloom freely.
The ﬂowers are single, pure white,
without fragrance. and from two to three
inches in diameter. I have only had
Bauhinnia Galpinii for about three years,
it comes into bloom earlier in the season.
The ﬂowering season, as with the other.
lasts until cold weather.. The blossoms
are smaller and are orange red in color.
Dautintonia punicea. known in some

parts of South Florida as “red pea-tree,”
is a handsome evergreen ﬂowering shrub
or small tree. It blooms about twice a
year, covering itself with long clusters
of large pea—shaped ﬂowers, bright orange
red in color. It is beautiful when in
bloom, but the blossoms are destitute of
fragrance.
Duranta plumieri, golden dew-drop, is
also an evergreen shrub. It is most
showy when in fruit. The ﬂowers are
small, a delicate lilac in color and are
borne-in long racemes. They are quite
pretty, but when the large yellow berries
are grown the bush is quite showy. The
fruit hangs on for months. often until
new growth begins again the next season.
There is a desirable class of shrubs that
is but little cultivated in this State. I
refer to the list of hardy shrubs common-
ly grown at the North, many of them
will do as well, or better. in Florida as
anywhere. There is only one objection to
them. that being that they bloom but once
a year and are deciduous. There is one
exception. one of the best of these old
favorites, the lilac, syringa vulgaris, can-
not be successfully grown in Florida, or
at least I have failed and have never heard
of any one that has made them do well
or even live, for any length of time.
I can recommend the Japan quince, cydo-
nia japonica. common syringa or mock
orange, philadelphus coronarius, weige-
lia rosea and other varieties of Weigelia.
The different varieties of Spirea should
also be included. All of these are showy
ﬂowering shrubs. The blossoms of the
syringa or mock orange. are almost as
fragrant as true orange ﬂowers.
I am exceeding the limit and must omit
many equally valable species, but I can-
not bear to stop without speaking of a
few vines. First the Ipomoeas, the peren-
nial varieties are all desirable. Ipomoea
learii is a strong grower and profuse
bloomer, ﬂowers large, dark purple.
Like the morning glory, on hot days
these blossoms fade by noon or soon
after, but in cool weather, I have seen
them stand up until nearly or quite noon
of the second day. A curious fact about
them is that when they last until the sec-
ond day, the color fades into a dull red.
Ipomoea mortoni is, if possible, a more
rampant grower than I. learii, but is not
so free a bloomer. Flowers red and
smaller in size.
Both of these species may become
pests if allowed to escape .into land that
you wish to cultivate. They run on the
surface of the soil and root along every
inch of their length. In that case, the
more you plow or cultivate them the more
you scatter the roots and the more plants
you have. The only effectual way to
destroy them is to cut-them oﬂ’, just below
the surface, with a hoe, as the roots alone
will not sprout. An ounce of prevention
is worth not only a pound of cure. but
many of them, do not allow the vines to
run on the ground at all. '
Ipomoea Michauxii, of Chapman's
Southern Flora, but I. jalapa of the
Cyclopedia of American Horticulture, has
received the name of “blushing beauty
moonﬂower.” It grows from a large
tuberous root. often a foot or more in
diameter; and has been called “potato-
vine.” It is a strong grower and a free
bloomer. ﬂowers open about four o’clock
p. m.. color delicate pink. Ipomoea sin-
uata is known in some localities as “noon-
day glory.” This species can be easily
recognized by its foilage, which looks
much like that of the rose geranium. It is
a vigorous grower, thought the stems
are quite-slender. It blooms freely, ﬂow-

ers small, white with a dark center, open-
ing about noon.
Rhynchospermum Jasminoides, some-
times caller Star jassamine is a woody
evergreen vine of strong growth and har-
dy throughout this State. In the spring
it is covered with small, pure white ﬂow-
ers that are quite fragrant.
I have a vine of this plant that stands
about ten feet high by six or eight wide
and three feet through, that has been in
bloom for a month. During that time the
foliage has been nearly or quite, hidden
by the dense sheet of ﬂowers which have
covered it. In the evening the fragrance
is so strong as to be almost overpower-
ing.
I cannot cover the entire list of desir-
able vines, but there is one more to which
I wish to call attention. It is Pereskia
laculeata, sometimes called “lemon vine,”
from that fact that the leaves are shaped
like those of a lemon tree, and are thick
and glossy. This plant is one of the few
members of the true cactus family that
has leaves. It is really a cactus, though
few would suspect it, on account of its
vigorous growth and profusion of leaves.
It is sensitive to frost and is often killed
to the ground. but sprouts up quickly.
Where a screen of vines is wanted, this
is one of the best. If killed to the ground
it will not bloom that season, for the flow-
ers come on new 'growth that starts from
last year's wood. When not hurt by cold.
it will literally cover itself with a cloud
of small flowers about one and one-half
inches in diameter. The color is peculiar,
being an almost transparent waxen white,
sometimes with a slight greenish tinge.
The blossoms resemble small single roses
in general appearance. They have a pow-
erful odor which is unpleasant to some
people.
I have barely touched upon the list of
desirable plants for home adornment, and
have not mentioned any of the more com-
mon species. The subject is so vast that
it is impossible, within the limits of a
paper that would be suitable on such an
occasion, to do more than skim over the ‘
surface.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Henderson.—\Vhen I ﬁrst came to
this part of the State I saw in Gaines-
ville a very beautiful vine on a veranda,
I called at the lady’s door and asked for
some and she called it the coral vine.‘
This seems to be the common name for it.
It begins blooming in June but is killed
by frost. One thing I think of value
about it is that it is the very best ﬂower '
for bees that _I have ever seen. It does
not seem to be very fragrant but the bees
will work on it while it is in bloom. The
flowers are shaped something like the"
sweet pea and are of a dark pink color.
I would like to know what it is. I think
it-_worthy of consideration.
Mr. Steele—There is a common vine
here known as Rosa Montana. I thought-
probably, from your description that it
was your coral vine. But from the dark
pink color it is not the same. The proper
name of the vine (rosa montana) is anti-
gonon leptopus.

Report of Secretary.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
At one time it looked as if the mem-
bership of the Horticultural Society was
going to be considerably behind that of
last year as there were not very many
remittances received for membership fees
during the year. However, the last no-
tice to the members brought out a large
response and many of the members did
some good missionary work in the way of
securing new members and today I am
able to make the following report:
Membership fee received for 1905

The Society has developed a new friend
at St. Petersburg, Mr. James Henry, who
at one time sent in 13 members. Mrs.
McCarty has also put in good work hav-
ing sent in 12 members. Mr._E. L. Rich-
ardson of Avon Park sent in 4 as also
did Mr. F. M. Campbell of Largo. Quite
a number of members sent in from one
to three.

It will be seen from the above report
that the society is going to be consider-
ably short of sufﬁcient funds to meet the
coming year’s expenses, to say nothing
of the expense of presenting a resolution
to the State Legislature for an appropri-
ation. It is earnestly hoped that all mem-
bers of the society will increase their ef-
forts towards getting more new mem—

at least 300 more.
The expenses of the coming year can
be cut down by reducing the cost of print-
ing the Report by leaving out the cata-
logue of fruits and doing away with the
illustrations. This feature of the Report,
however, is a very desirable one and if it
can be possibly done one or more illus-
trations should be continued.

Report of Committee on Legislation.
_— ' ’-
BY M. F. ROBINSON.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of
the Florida State Horticultural Socie—
ty.
DEAR SIR: As a member of your com-
mittee on Legislation, 1 would respect-
fully report: That it has been suggested
by our honored President and Secretary
that it is with the greatest difﬁculty that
the expenses of this Society can be main-
tained from the modest membership fees;
That no inconsiderable part of the ex-
pense, is the publication of the Society’s
Annual Report of its meetings; and that
the Legislature of the State should be pe-
titioned to make an annual appropriation
in aid of these expenses. Such a petition
would be entirely proper and in line with
the action of the legislatures of other
States that aid in the support of similar
Societies. That such a petition should
specify the amount of funds desired, and
name the purpose for which it will be
used, is believed by your Committeeman
to be highly important. Therefore it is
recommended that the Secretary make a
careful estimate of the amount necessary
for the publication of the Annual Report,
and prepare an appropriate resolution,
requesting the desired appropriation by
the legislature, and submit it to this meet-
ing for action.
Another matter which in the opinion
of your Committeeman is highly impor-
tant to the members of this Society, and
which it is the duty of the Society to lay
' and
before the legislature of the State and ask
for relief; and that is the deplorable
fence laws of the State; whereby cattle,
horses, hogs, sheep, and goats are per-
mitted to run at large. Therefore to
bring this matter before the Society for
its consideration, the following preamble
resolution is. hereby introduced.
Your Committeeman offers the follow-
ing and moves its adoption.
PREAMBLE AN D RESOLUTION.
WHEREAS, The farming and horticul-
tural community and the towns and cities
of the State of Florida aregreatly ha-
rassed and damaged besides being put to
an enormous expense by reason of the
fact that cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, and
goats are permitted to run at large; and,
WHEREAS, The ﬁnances of the State
would be vastly improved, if the owners
of such stock were compelled to fence,
and, directly or indirectly, pay taxes or
rent on the pastures used for such stock,
instead of being permitted to pasture their
stock on the land belonging to others or
belonging to the public domain; and,
\VnEREAs, It is believed that a large
majority of the voters in the State are in
favor of a radical change in the present
law; therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society in meeting asembled;
that the Legislature of the State of Flori-
da, be and is hereby petitioned and im-

plored to make and inforce such laws as
will prohibit the running at large of cat-
tle, horses, hogs, sheep and goats in the
State. And if, in the wisdom of the Leg-
islature, it is thought that any County in
the State contains a majority of voters
in favor of the present law, let it be sub-
mitted to the voters of each County to de-
cide whether the new law or the present
law shall be enforced in that particular
county. '
Resolved, That the above resolution
be submitted to the next Legislature, by
the Secretary of this Society.

Notes from Abroad.
BY DR. WM. C. RICHARDSON, TAMPA, FLA.
When Doctor W. C. Richardson ad-
vised me early in January that he was
about to visit the Citrus sections around
the Mediterranean I asked him to write
something on his observations. He kindly
consented to do so and mailed the letter
from Paris thinking it would reach me
at Jacksonville in time to be read to the,
Society. It failed to reach me in time
and I am doing the next best thing—
printing it in the proceedings. Personal-
ly and on behalf of the Society I thank
Dr. Richardson for his most instructive
and interesting letter.—C. T. MCCARTY.

PARIS, FRANCE, April 25, 1906.
C. T. McCarty, Esq., President Florida
State Horticultural lSociety, Florida
U. S. A.
DEAR SIR: In accordance with your
request to write you relative to things
of interest that I might see on my cruise
around the Mediterranean, in the way of
horticultural matters, I take occasion to
say that the ﬁrst stop was at Funchal Is-
land, of Maderia. This island grows
some oranges of a rather inferior quality,
and all sub-tropical fruits and vegetables
ﬂourish as extensively as the small limits
of the island will permit. Sugar cane,
however, seems to be the principal arti-
cle of cultivation.
The next place visited was Cadiz,
Spain, located on an almost barren little
peninsula, and aside from the splendid
harbor, its commerce as the chief port of
South Western Spain, and the manufac-
ture of salt by evaporation, it has little of
interest in a business way, but is rich in
art treasures and historical associations.
A visit to the interior, some hundred
and ﬁfty miles, revealed quite extensive
orange groves, and many quite large olive
orchards. The orange trees are planted
in squares in regular order, eighteen or
twenty feet apart, and do not seem to
grow anything like as large as our Florida
trees. In the gardens of the palace of the
Alcazar there are many very old trees,
one of which is said to have an authentic
history of over six hundred years; It is
a bitter sweet, and the man showing us
through the place said that sweet oranges
injected into the bitteF'stock, he meant
budded, were growing in the grounds
and bearing abundantly at ages of two
and three hundred years. These trees did
indeed look thrifty and healthy, but they
were no larger than our ﬁfteen or sixteen
year old trees. All the unprotected or-
ange and other sub-tropical trees had been
nipped with the cold to the extent of los-
ing their leaves, but this did not seem to
worry the Spaniards any, and they ap-
parently treated it as nothing unusual, or
of any consequence. Spanish oranges
are not of the best quality, and aside from
color have little to recommend them;
they are tender, thick skinned and of a
negative ﬂavor.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
The next stop was at Algiers, in North-
ern Africa, where oranges, lemons, gua-
vas, bananas. etc., were found in pro-
fusion. All showed the effect of recent
cold, but had not suffered as much as in
Spain. The orange groves were set out
in a much more crowded way. the trees
being only 12 or 15 feet apart, and, like
in Spain, all pruned up very high. The
mandarine oranges are raised very ex-
tensively in Algiers, and are of a most
excellent quality—in fact all the oranges
here are very good indeed.
After visiting Greece, Turkey and
Asia Minor, where olives and ﬁgs are
raised extensively, and oranges are grown
in a rather limited way, and where they
suffer a great deal from cold every win-
ter, the next place of interest from an
horticultural standpoint was Jaffa in Pal-
estine.
Jaﬂa is the home of the very best or-
anges we have seen outside of Florida, if
an exception be made in favor of a blood
navel found in a small way on the island
‘of Malta. The cultivation of the orange
in Jaffa is more wonderful to a Florida
grower than is the delicious character of
the fruit- The trees are planted in rows
not more than seven or eight feet apart,
and not more than ﬁve or six feet distant
from one another in the rows. All culti-
vation is done with hoes and spades and
they dig deep everywhere. even close up
to the trees. They have a loose sandy
soil, richer apparently than ours and their
only knowledge of fertilizers seems to be
conﬁned to barn yard manure.
\\'hen the trees get so large as to make
them too close together for convenient
cultivation and harvesting the fruit, they
cut them off alternately in the rows and
rebud the sprouts, I do not think any
trees are allowed to get more than ten
or twelve feet high before they_are thus
treated. I was told by a man whose
family are the most extensive growers in
this country that small thrifty trees close
together gave larger returns per acre and
better fruit than any other system of cul-
ture they had been able to devise.
Egypt was found to be almost as won—
derful from an horticultural and agricul-
tural view as it is from an ethnological
and historical standpoint. At Cario in
latitude 30 degrees north, where it never
rains and where the climate in much
warmer especially in summer, than in
Jacksonville, we found many things to in-
terest us. We were fortunate enough to
secure an introduction to the Director of
the Botanical and Zoological gardens,
who kindly devoted a forenoon to show-
ing us through the wonderfully rich pos-
sessions under his management, includ-
ing rare specimens of all kinds of fruits
and plants that grow, in this lavishly
productive country. Everything we ever
saw growing in Florida seemed to ﬂour-
ish here, including two splendid real
American alligators kept in a pool enclos-
ed by wire netting, separating them from
the Crocodiles. It seemed like meeting
friends from home, and after long asso—
ciation with Arabs, camels, donkeys, etc..
it cheered us up wonderfully.
We were also fortunate enough to be
in Cairo at the time of the Egyptian Hor-
ticultural Exposition, conducted with a
great ﬂourish under the auspices of the
Khedive, who by the way is a very pleas-
ant appearing, popular and democratic
monarch. The Exposition had a few
very ﬁne exhibits of fruits and some of
the ﬁnest kinds of large appetizing appear-
ing vegetables, also a beautiful show of
ﬂowers and tropical plants, but taken as
a whole it did not begin to come up to the

exhibit 'of any one of several single c0un—'
ties as shown at the Florida State Fair
held at Tampa. Oranges are grown
and cared for in Egypt about the same
way as in Algiers, except they depend
on irrigation entirely. Guava trees are
not small bushy things as with us, but
quite as large as orange trees and are
kept pruned up.
From Egypt we went to Italy and
Southern France, where from Naples to
Nice, along the shore of the Mediterran-
ean, the orange ﬂourishes in a more or
less precarious way, being often found
growing on narrow- terraces of a moun-
tain side with snow capped peaks in plain
view. In fact it appears to me that the
Mediterranean varieties of citrus fruits
can, and do, stand much more cold than
they do with us in Fla. Even in Egypt
there had been, shortly before our visit,
enough cold to cut down bananas and
knock the leaves off the guava and other
tender trees. While the cold is always
felt it is seldom extreme enough to freeze
the fruit, and at Nice in Southern France,
where they had recently experienced a
real freeze, we were told that all fruit
that did not drop off the trees within a
couple of weeks was considered as good
and marketable as if there had been no
freezing. Blooming seems later than
with us, and it was after the ﬁrst of
April before we saw any trees in full
bloom.
None of these countries produce orang-
es in quantities large enough to have
much apparent effect on our markets, and
in fact they do not seem to raise more
than enough for home consumption and
to supply local and adjacent markets. We
only had opportunity to get~at the prices
of oranges as sold at retail, and found
them selling at approximately the same
I
price as at home. As a table necessity
they seem to be well appreciated, and I
do not remember a single dinner any-
‘where in the Orient or Europe that we
did not have them. _
We noticed surprising and astonishing
things that completely upset our ideas,
based on experience, of the disposition
and nature of orange trees, such as seeing
them growing and ﬂourishing luxuriant-
ly out of holes in solid rock pavements
with no apparent soil or other nourish-
ment for their support and no possible
chance to cultivate or fertilize them. We
saw them trained against houses and
palaces, and shaded into arbors like vines.
In Egypt we saw several large en-
closures fenced in with hedges of orange
trees pruned and trimmed into various
shapes as the owner’s fancy dictated.
In conclusion I may say that the most
prominent feature of our trip was cold
always and everywhere, and with the ex-
ception of a few days in Cairo, and one
day clambering over lava and in warm
volcanic ashes on Mt. Vesuvius, the very
day before the great and destructive erup-
tion, we have not had a chance to get
warm !
In the lower end of the Jordan Valley,
near the Dead Sea, around the towns of
Jericho and Gillgal, was the only place
where we did not see evidence of frost.
In this small territory are a few
lemons, guavas, etc., but the Turkish sys-
tem of taxation is so oppressive that little
_is undertaken by the wretched inhabitants
in the way of fruit growing. They told
us that each and every fruit tree was
taxed the same, no matter whether it was
large or small, barren or productive.
Many were cutting down their trees and
selling the wood as the only way to escape
this ridiculous method of taxation. With

Question Box.
A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, ANSWERED BY
VARIOUS MEMBERS.
1. What is the cause of thick-skinned
grapefruit or oranges? Can the trees be
fertilized in a way to produce thin-skin-
ned fruit?
Mr. Taber-—Mr. President, I think
Mr. Sampson should be called upon to
answer this question. '
Mr. Sampson—There are a number of
causes for thick—skinned fruit. The ﬁrst
crop might have thick skins while the sec-
ond would' not. If you put on too much
ammonia in proportion to phosphoric acid
and potash, you might expect coarse-
skinned fruit.
Mr. Sample—I would like to know
if cultivating it is conducive to thick
skin.
Mr. Sampson—I think it is. We had
a portion of a natural sour grove where
trees were left too thick for anything but
hoe cultivation—three times a year—that
invariably grew much thinner-skinned
fruit than same variety where trees had
clean cultivation till rainy reason. They
produced much less fruit but it was solid,
handsome fruit and ripened earlier.
Maj. Fairbanks—I have noticed that
where I had my stables the land was very
rich and the trees planted near there bore
very thick skinned fruit. I concluded
that too much ammonia was the cause of
this thick skin.
Mr. Connor.—In my last report I said
something about cultivation. I think the
H—ro
matter of cultivation can be overdone to
a great extent. I have some old soil and
I think it is as poor as any in the State.
My plan has been to cultivate it without
cultivation, in other words, to make use
of the growth of beggar weed etc., mow
it down in summer and use what I want
for hay, then in the fall and spring run
over it with cutaway harrow and chop it
into the soil. After three years such treat-
ment it now looks like good soil.
Mr. Cook—I did not hear all that Mr.
Fairbanks said in reference to thick-
skinned grape fruit. My experience has
been this; in cultivating the citrus tree
and its fruit the use of a highly ammoni-
ated fertilizer with constant and late cul-
tivation produces a vigorous growth of
wood and a large, coarse. thick-skinned
fruit either grapefruit or orange. By the
free use of potash this result can be modi-
ﬁed somewhat as to the fruit.
Mr. Painter-—The thickness of the or-
ange peel depends on several conditions—
fertilizer, cultivation and moisture. or a
combination of the three. Young trees
that are highly fertilized and thoroughly
cultivated will bear thick skinned fruit if
the season is one of abundant moisture.
A dry season would produce thin-skinned
fruit because the tree cannot take up as
much of the plant food from the soil—a
lack of moisture means a lack of nitrih-
cation. Old trees that have but little cul-

tivation generally produce the thinnest-
skinned and best appearing fruit.
Mr. Hart—I will say my groves have
not been plowed in many years. I do not
cultivate deeply after the second year
from setting a grove.
I wish to speak of budding the orange,
more especially the Washington Navel on
rough lemon stock. This variety is a shy
bearer on sweet or sour stock but fruits
well on lemon yet my experience is that on
stock the navels are very coarse and poor.
My navels were so poor on this stock the
past season that I would not have shipped
them at all had I known just how poor
they were. The fruit may be better on
pine lands but for hammock I would say,
don’t use lemon stock at all.
I am cutting down my navels and put-
ting in other varieties.

2. Citrus trees in a grove eight to ten
years old have grown so thick limbed that
it is almost impossible to gather the fruit
grown inside of the trees. Would it be
well to prune out a lot of the inner
branches and twigs? Would it be a good
time directly after the blossoming season
is passed?
Mr. Hart—The older I grow in orange
culture the more I ﬁnd that I am not posi-
tive of many things I thought I had set-
tled in my mind, I have not settled. I
believe in letting the tree grow, I do not
think it was born depraved and has to
be cut to pieces every year. I do hardly
any pruning at all except to take out dead
wood and I am very much pleased with
results. Now as to the second question,
I would say this much, I would not prune
right after the trees bloom, if I were
going to prune at all it would be right
before the starting of new growth.
I
Mr. Connor.—-I was with Mr. Waite
while he was pruning some trees in Man-
atee Lemon Co. Grove at Palmetto three
years ago. If he has made it pay—after
the use of the knife in what I called at
that time a very free manner, it would
convince me that pruning is a good thing.
I would like to know what his success
has been.
Mr. Waite—If the grove is situated
near, or in the white ﬂy belt, I should
advise pruning out the centers of the or-
ange trees, for the ﬂy likes these thick
places, and we have noticed that almost
immediately after it gets started in a
grove the scale insects kill the most of this
inside wood and unless the tree is cleaned
out you will get but little fruit.
With us the grapefruit and lemon trees
do not grow as compact, and the lemon
especially, sheds a great deal of its inside
foliage from the fruit spur wood, yet
these will invariably produce bloom which
is well protected from cold, and the fruit
thus produced is of the ﬁnest quality. As
the ﬂy is quite severe on the lemon we
have found that the scale soon kills a
greater portion of this inside wood.
We have no set time for pruning, but
I believe that January is the best month
in which to prune, as the tree at that
time has enough sap ﬂowing to enable it
to heal the wounds thus produced.
Mr. Longley.-—-Mr. President, I do not
want to interfere only to prove as near as
I can that pruning is very objectionable-
I had a neighbor who had a grove of
about 85 acres who is always pruning
and today he claims four thousand trees,
but he will not average one box of fruit
to the tree. I do not prune at all and have
a good crop of fruit all through my trees.
I claim that pruning is good in the fore
part of the winter before blooming time.

3. What will labor and material cost to
~ spray 5000 medium sized orange trees?-
Mr. Connor.—During the last three
weeks I have had some experience in this
line, just the experience fruit growers
would have who have not the complete
apparatus for spraying. The cost of spray-
ing for about 500 trees was something
over $7.00, with an additional cost of
$8.00 for material used, or about $15.00
which would be an average cost to depend
upon. Trees bearing from two to four
boxes.

4. Will whitewashing orange trees
with pure carbonate of lime be detrimen-
tal?
Mr. Hart—I remember twenty ﬁve or
thirty years ago there was quite a- discus-
sion in regard to whitewashing orange
trees. In California several years ago I
saw where they had cut back their trees
to bud them, and that they had white-
washed the trunks eight or ten feet high
to protect them. This might be all right
. but I remember there were objections
found to white-washing but they have
gone out of my mind just now and I can-
not state them. Perhaps Maj. Fairbanks
can give us something on this line.
Maj. Fairbanks—I wish to say that I
have no information whatever- I like the
orange tree and think it is the most beau-
tiful tree in creation and it is a sacrilege
to white-wash it.
Mr. Painter.—Anything put on the
orange tree to cover up its pores is in-
jurious, especially during the growing
season. White-wash your fence and out-
buildings but wash the trunk of your
trees with water and whaleoil soap.
5. I have Mexican clover in my grove
and would like to know how to get it out.
Maj. Healey.—Let more of it grow and
you will not want to get it out.
Mr. Painter.——I would suggest that if
he really wants to get rid of it he move to
another county.

6. Explain how, when and-what quanti-
ty of blue vitriol to use for dieback.
Mr. Brown.-—I suppose that the regu-
lar Bordeaux formula would be used; it
should be used just previous to the start-
ing of new growth, I should say the latter
part of january, but it could be used later
in the season. If the tree is in a very bad
co'ndition, inoculate the tree, but my plan
is to use a spray.
Mr. Longley.——I would like to know
what quantity to use in this inoculation.
Mr. Brown—I use a quantity about
equal to that of the size of_ a pea inserted
right under the bark of the tree.

7. What -is the best remedy for foot
rot? Is it best to resort to remedies for
the cure of this-disease, or pull out the
tree and plant a new one.
Mr. Phelps—Some time, prior to 1895 g
I set out ten trees. I found this foot
rot on them later. I happened to meet
Mr. M. F. Robinson who advised me to,
apply sulphuric acid to the ground and
rake it in well, this I did and the very
worst tree I had came out ﬁne, in fact
better than any of them.
I should dread very much pulling up a
tree as it is no little job. and shall do
everything I can to save them otherwise
and I have saved a good many so far;
I still believe in the sulphuric acid well
raked in.


## p. 148 (#328) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. Painter.—The sulphuric acid
remedy referred to by Mr. Phelps is a
dilute form. Three gallons of 50 per cent.
B. acid is diluted with seventeen gallons
of water.
Mr. Blackman.—I have tried a good
many remedies, spraying, cutting away
the wood, Sulphuric acid, in fact almost
everything I could hear of; but the Only
effective remedy I have found for this
disease is blue stone- I inoculate the tree
close to the ground, cutting the bark the
same as for budding and inserting a
piece of blue stone about as large as a
grain of wheat. This must be done when
the sap is up and the tree in a growing
condition. I think that for foot rot blue
stone is a grand panacea. In some cases
it will scar the tree badly, but in time it
will heal over and the tree will put on a
most vigorous growth. I have found
quite a good many trees that were af-
fected; but in every case they were trees
grown on low land. I have never seen a
tree in our section that was grown on
high pine land affected by this disease.
Dr. Bessey.—What is the appearance
of a tree with foot rot?
Mr. Brown.——Thy become yellow and
drop their leaves. I did not know just
what it was at ﬁrst. but I wish I might
tell every grower who has foot rot in his
grove that if they will put blue stone in
the root just at the surface of the ground,
it will surely do the trees good.
Prof. Rolfs.—About four years ago we
tried some experiments in treating die-
back by inserting a small piece of blue
stone under the bark of trees.» In this
experiment a certain number of trees
were chosen to work upon, a number of
trees were treated as described above and
along side of these an equal number left I
untreated, careful notes as to the extent
of dieback and the location of the lesions
in the tree. About three months elapsed
before it was practicable to return to take
notes on the work, and it was found that
treated and the untreated trees were en-
tirely free from dieback. The point I
wish to make here is, that it is absolutely
impossible to draw a reasonable conclu-
sion from any experiment unless we
have checks upon our operations- Die—
back or citrus tree indigestion, may be
brought on by a variety of causes. even
different trees in the same grove may
have dieback from entirely different caus-
es. The matter of ﬁrst importance in
treating dieback is to ascertain what
caused it and then to remove the cause.
Often times this is all that is necessary.
The recovery of the tree may, however.
be hastened by an application of weak
Bordeaux mixture to the upper surface of
the leaves. Among the most frequent
causes of dieback I may mention plowing
during the rainy season, applications of
organic ammonia. hard pan or a rather
hard sub-stratum under the tree. A tree
that has a tendency to dieback may be set
over into a case of dieback by pruning or
cases or dieback have been known to be
brought on by root pruning. In other
cases of dieback have been known to be
ables them to secure too much organic
ammonia are apt to have dieback.
Mr. Hart.——I'n this matter of foot rot,
the time to cure the disease is in its early
stages; look out for it. examine the trees
and if you ﬁnd gum exuding at or near
the ground, dig the dirt away and expose
the roots, this will usually cure it. I think
when a tree has foot rot so as it loses its
leaves it is best to dig it up and set sour
stock in its place that is budded eighteen
inches above the collar.~
Mr. Frink.—I would like to hear from

Mr. Wilson as to his experience with this
foot rot in Porto Rico.
Mr. Wilson—We have a kind of foot
rot in Porto Rico which we have fought
with carbolic acid and Bordeaux mix-
ture. but whether this is the same foot
rot you have in Florida or 'not I do not
know. We discovered it a few years ago
only on a few trees. \Nhen I ﬁrst found
this foot rot on my trees my men put on
the carbolic acid too strong and killed the
tree but since then I have used this car-
bolic treatment, superintending it myself.
and found it very successful- A neigh-
bor of mine has found this remedy very
successful by pulling the dirt away from
the trees and washing them with this
mixture.

8. \V ill Dr. \Valker please give the so-
ciety a report of the camphor experiment
at Huntington?
Dr. VValkeL—Mr. President, I am
afraid the subject on which I am going to
speak, will place me in rather a false light.
I have in my possession a sample of cam-
phor prepared in Huntington and puriﬁed
in \Vashington, but ﬁrst must tell you
how this came into importance (and
must confess that it is of great importance
to us.)
Most of the camphor used in the United
States today coines from Formosa. Re-
cently several Japanese authorities were
quietly sent over here to see how much
camphor was grown, and whether we
could raise it successfully or not.
The results of their visit were so serious
that the celluloid manufacturers—our
great camphor consumers—said, in their
report to Washington that they must
have American camphor or move to For-
mosa. Camphor, up to this time had been
I
worth about thirty cents per pound. but
immediately advanced to $1.00 per pound.
In 1898 I met Prof. Hubbard who was
our State Entomologist and he showed
me the results of his experiments. I
found that one pound of camphor could
be extracted from 70 pounds of leaves.
It was at this time, when it was worth
only thirty cents per pound, that people
thought it would be a proﬁtable business
to plant camphor trees here.
The camphor trees are very beautiful,
and I got rather enthusiastic over mine,
which were growing well. When I heard
that another grade of camphor—a chemi-
cal product could be put on the market at
ﬁfteen cents per pound, so thought it
would be useless for us to try and raise
the trees. Camphor is very similar to tur-
pentine. Many people have tried to make
camphor out of turpentine and think it
will yet be done-
We waited for a year or two, during
which time the camphor workers were
said to be hard at work, but no camphor
was produced. Then. at a very oppor-
tune moment, these works were burned
and we do not think they will be rebuilt.
Camphor is also very essential in the
manufacture of smokeless powder. Al-
tho' other substances might be used yet
if anything should happen to draw us
into a war. when we would require a
quantity of powder immediately, we
would be in a dilemma if Japan decided
not to provide us with the camphor.
About a year ago, a gentleman came
down from the experimental station— -
\Vashington—to see what the camphor
outlook was in Florida. After a general
look around he took samples of this Flori-
da made camphor back to Washington
and puriﬁed it. The celluloid people were
interviewed and shown the samples which

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
resulted in an order from the president
of the company for 500,000 pounds of
Florida camphor at $1.00 per pound. But
unfortunately it was not procurable, and
we are out that $500,000. (Laughter.)
.The gentleman from the experimental
station came down, later to experiment in
Huntington. I was only too willing to
offer him all the facilities I had for the
experiment, as this was such an important
question, and should be pushed forward.
In six weeks time he (and his assistant)
returned to Washington and puriﬁed this
camphor. I had gotten 1.42 per cent of
camphor from my own trees but am told
they can do better at Washington. I did
not expect to go into the matter very
thoroughly, but just pass this information
along.
Other trees may be cut down by severe
cold, and that is the end, but not so with
the camphor trees, as we can use them
even four months after they are cut down.
I used some old trees that had been cut
down three months, and obtained 1.021
per cent of camphor, so I know that this
is true. So, if we go extensively into the
business, and a severe frost cuts down
the trees, we can still obtain the cam-
phor from them. '
I wish to call attention to the value the
camphor tree will be to us within the next
ten years. It will be worth millions of
dollars, if we only take hold of it. Japan
has all the trade now, but can we afford
to let her keep it? If Japan says they must
pay $2.00 per pound for their camphor,
we, who are obliged to have it, will be
obliged to pay. And if she says we can-
not have any at any price we will not
get it. If we do not stop the growth of
camphor in Formosa, for use in this
country, it means the loss to .us of {nil-
lions of dollars- '
I will take my chances on the camphor
growing. It is surprising what can be
done, and the only thing we need worry
about is that this Cynthetic camphor may
be made. Yet if it should be, we still
have our ornamental trees.
I would like to have the opinion of
this association on this subject.
Scattered about in different parts of
Putnam county are groves of these trees,
varying in size from a dozen trees to
several acres. If we can get the govern-
ment to take the matter up, you see of
what great importance it will be to us.
I have offered them every inducement to
come to Huntington and experiment on
my trees. I am willing for them to cut
them down, dig them up, or do anything
they like with them. I would like expres-
sions from this society in favor of having
this work pushed forward and suggest
that they show the government their ap-
proval and appreciation of the experi-
mental work being carried on.
Mr. Steele—On what character of soil
is the camphor grown?
Dr. Walker.—It will grow well on any
high pine land. I have beautiful trees
growing on my place at Huntington. The
cost of extracting the camphor cannot
yet be determined, as we were only experi-
menting. I do not know how the govern-
ment sample was extracted, but will know
in the fall, how it was done. In \about
two weeks I expect to have a sample of
the ﬁrst celluloid made from this Florida
camphor. ( Applause.)
Mr. Steele—*Mr. President, I had a
large camphor tree that was killed down
in the freeze of 1899, but now it has
grown up and is as large as ever. If
you will give a camphor tree a fair start,
it will grow right on, almost anywhere.
There is hardly any soil on which it will

151
not grow. It does not do so well on dry
soil.
Mr. Frink.—I would like to supple-
ment what Dr. Walker has just said on
the subject of camphor, I have recently
had letters from two different gentlemen
connected with the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, who stated that re-
cent experiments in producing camphor
gum have been extremely successful and
they seem to think it highly feasible to
produce camphor gum here on a proﬁtable
commercial scale. As a result of those ex—
periments I have recently had inquiries for
trees in lots of ﬁve to twenty thousand.
From these letters and inquiries I think
within a comparatively short time cam-
phor production will become quite an ex-
tensive industry here.

9. Have any of the members of the
society seen the nitro culture that is being
introduced by the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and with what suc-
cess? '
Mr. Hubbard—I would like to ask the
gentlemen from the State Experiment
Station what success they have had with
Alfalfa and nitro culture.
Dr. Bessey.—In behalf of the depart-
ment I would ask that a distinction be
made between nitro culture and nitrogen
gathering bacteria.
Mr. Hubbard—Either one of them.
Mr. Henderson—I did not know there
were two kinds, I want to know if their
use is satisfactory to the department of
agriculture.
Mr. Hubbard—Prof. Connor said that
they were experimenting with alfalfa at
Lake City and I wished to know if they
could give us any report that would be of
advantage in growing alfalfa. "
Mr. Merriam—I have had some exper-
ience with nitro culture, some of it is
very good. There has been a great deal
of discussion about this commercial nitro
culture and some of the experiment sta-
tions claim that it is not as good as that
sent out by the government. I tried some
last spring on beans and English peas and
it was a success on my peas, I tried it
very fully putting it on the seeds and in
connection with this I used fertilizer with-
out any nitrogen and right along side
of it I put in some that contained ﬁve
percent. nitrogen, but the phosphoric acid
and potash, with the nitro culture made
better peas than the fertilizer. I do not
know why it was but I did not get very
good results. I used this on some beans
but the cold killed the beans so I could not
tell about them. I could not see any dif-
ference on cow peas at all, one was as
good as the other. I presume that the
reason was that the ground was already
well inoculated. I understand that it is
necessary to have the nitro culture fresh
as it will not keep very long in the shape
the department puts it up.
Mr. Ellis—Mr. President, I have used
the commercial nitro culture on both cow
peas and velvet beans and I planted one
half with and one half without the nitro
culture and we could discover no differ-
ence at all. The nitro culture was bought
from a good reliable ﬁrm who claimed
that it was fresh. The bacteria seemed
to develop all right in the jars, but I
could see no difference in the crops at all.
Mr. Henderson.—I tried peas similar
to Mr. Merriam with a commercial nitro-
culture but could see no difference.

any experience in growing “Ginseng”?
With what success? Can it be success-
fully grown in Florida?
Mr. Painter.——Ginseng has been tried
in Florida but the only one who made

11. Can a grove be cared for and fer-

answer that in part, not from my own
experience, but for another. This gentle-
man take it one year with another, has
good to heavy crops of grapefruit. The
ﬁrst few years his grove bore, it would
produce a heavy crop one year, the next
lighter. The owner commenced experi-
menting in fertilizing and for the past
three years his grove has been loaded
almost to the breaking point. I do not
know what kind of fertilizer he uses, or
how many applications or when applied.
He uses a fertilizer manufactured in this
State. He works his grove in the spring,
allowing the weeds and grass to grow
through a'portiou of the summer. I do
not know how much fertilizer he uses to
the tree; but I do know that he gets a full
crop each year.
Mr. Connor.—I do not know that I can
give any light on this subject but I wish
to say that there are so many things that
have to be taken into consideration to
produce a full crop of fruit that I do not
think we can lay it altogether on the
kind of fertilizer used for the reason that
there as so many other things that we
have to take into account. If we do not
have moisture then we are not apt to have
a full crop of fruit. then again I think
the time, and quality of fertilizer used has
something to do with it. My idea is that
the time of fertilizing is in the fall of the
year, it seems to get the grove in better
shape to set fruit and then I would follow
that with a light application in the spring,
then feed the tree gradually all along the
year. If you feed the trees well, being
careful to have suitable analysis, you will
have no trouble in getting a good crop
each year.
Mr. Gist.—-—All of Florida is not so
fortunate as to have a rock foundation to
put their groves on, therefore some suffer
for the lack of moisture. I_ think Mr.
Connor’s remarks were well made, for
my observation is that a tree that has
been well fed winters well. Down in
Miami they do not have to consider the
winters as we do. A well fertilized tree
will stand a lower degree of temperature
than a poorly fed one and thus better
crops will be the result the next year.

12. How are bamboos propagated?
Will they grow from cuttings, if so what
time should they be put out?
Dr. Walker.—They are propagated by
taking the roots. This can be done at
most any time.
Mr. Steele—I saw in a neighbor’s yard
a large clump of bamboo, from which it
was impossible to get a sprout. I took
some cuttings, slender twigs, and planted
them in moist soil and all grew.

I 3. Given a sandy soil of a tidewater
island that is too salt for growing oran-
ges is it possible to neutralize the excess of
salt by the use of a special fertilizer?
The soil is so salty that the kelsey plum
after being transplanted when matured
will taste as salty as if it had been pickled

in brine. Larger pear trees planted in
this soil in February continue to grow,
putting on a large crop of fruit and again
blooming and fruiting, as did the plums,
and dying the second year after having
fruited three crops; the third crop of the
second year being immature. This land
is well above the ordinary tide and has a
ﬁne growth of palmettoes, live oak, cedar,
accacia and camphor but it is of a peculiar-
ly dry character getting dry immediately
after being soaked, seeming to lack nitro-
gen also. I would be glad to know how
I can make oranges and other fruits grow
on this land.
Mr. Painter.—There is no hope for
your ever being able to neutralize the salt
in the lower strata of your soil. It is evi-
dently there from salt water from below.
The only “neutralizer” salt has is water.
This dissolves it and would eventually
clear the soil if you had perfect drainage
and no return of salt water from below.

14. What is the best size of budded
stock of the orange or grapefruit to trans-
plant.
Mr. Frink.——In reference to size of bud—
ded trees, I wish to say that there is con-
siderable difference of opinion as to most
desirable for planting. Some people pre-
fer a two year bud and others one year
bud. The demand is heavier for four to
ﬁve feet one year buds than any other
size, and two year buds probably come
second. My own observation and exper-
ience goes to show that a four to ﬁve foot
one year bud is easier to transplant and
everything considered the most desirable
size.
Mr. Connor.——We all know that the
smaller the plant is or the-closer it is to
the seed, the better it transplants. When
it is removed from the seed bed, and is
tough enough to be transplanted I think
this is very true with the orange tree, for
this reason; you can get nearly all the
ﬁberous root with the young tree but if
you wait until the stock gets to be of
large size the feeding roots are necessa-
rily thrown out farther from the plants
and it takes a tree in that condition longer
to adopt itself to its surroundings and
start new roots. My opinion is that stock
from two to two and a half years old well
supplied with ﬁbre roots will adopt itself
better and receive less shock by trans-
planting than the large ones with no
ﬁbers.. I do not care so much about the
age of the bud it may be one or two years
old.
Mr. Hart—My interests simply call
for the best tree I can get and my ex-
perience has been that the size of stock
is of more importance in successful trans-
planting than size of bud. I would pre-
fer the stock to be two inches through.
I have trees bought from nursery stock
that were not larger than my ﬁnger after
the freeze of 1899 and they are not much
larger yet, but I have some trees of my
own growing that I planted out three
years ago. these buds were thrifty, the
stocks of good size and the trees now are
many times larger than the smaller ones
set years before. I came to this State
when the trees for our groves were all
taken from wild hammock and we did not
take any stock less than two inches in
diameter and some wEre six inches
through. We set them out and budded
them as they were set out, you cannot do
that with the small nursery trees. It takes
them some time to start new growth but
you take large trees at the ground. not
too large say about three and one-half
inches through and you will get your

grove quicker and make more fruit. You
bud the trees after they are transplanted
and your buds start right to growing and
in three years you have proﬁtable bearing
trees. I would not cut the old stock .down
close to the bud until the buds get to
growing rapidly, then cut them off and
wax them and the wound will soon be
covered over and a smooth trunk result.
You will get thrifty bearing trees from
large stock, while the small stock will
give away to drouth or any of the ills to
which the trees are heir.
Mr. Connor-—Did you ever try trans-
planting smaller trees from the nursery?
Mr. Hart—I certainly have. Have
you ever planted four inch stock? That
is well worth trying.
Mr Connor—Take a good tree and at
the end of three years you cannot reach
the tops of them. I have some now that
I tried this with and I cannot reach the
tops of them. I have never seen ﬁner
trees than I have in my grove planted
three years, and I used the ordinary four
or ﬁve foot bud, one year old in nursery.
Mr. Longley.—-It makes a great differ-
ence in conditions. I suppose Mr. Hart’s
place is on hammock land- On my pine
land I have taken stock three eights of an
inch thick and planted between trees that
had been planted two years, that had
grown from one and a half to two inches.
In three years from that time the small
trees were the ﬁnest by far and all planted
in the same row.
Mr. Chilton—In the past few years
I have set out in groves about/20,000 trees
of different varieties and I certainly must
bear out the view of Mr. Hart in refer-
ence to a good large thrifty stock with a
two year old bud in preference to a small
stock and bud. I have been in the busi-
ness for the past thirty years and came to
this State in the old time, which Mr. Hart
speaks of when we had large wild groves
of the orange scattered all through our
hammocks and know the time when we
set those large sour stumps, six and eight
inches in diameter and after budding they
made a quick bearing grove.
In three years we could count on a good
crop. It takes too long to wait with
small stock. I prefer a good thrifty four
year old stock with a two years old bud
of not less than three inches in diameter
to. start with and a two year bud.\ The
stock should be vigorous which is one of
the main points to beginners.
Mr. Blackman.—Is it possible to lay
down any iron clad rules that will govern
all conditions in the different parts of the
state?
Mr. McCarty--—No, of course not.
Mr. Blackman.—The ﬁrst two years is
the critical time with orange and grape-
fruit trees in Dade county and my exper-
ience is that a year old bud is the best
for planting in that climate and soil. In
Marion county I used three year old
buds with good success; but not so at
Miami.
Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I have a
few government hybrid buds here that I
cut last winter, if I remember correctly
about six hundred. I now have permis-
sion to' distribute these and if any one
present would like to try these oranges
I will be glad to give them some buds.
Many people have-been writing and ask-
ing the for these varieties and some seem
inclined to go into these new varieties
heavily. I would not advise that yet, we
do not know enough about them. Or-
ange trees when they ﬁrst bear do not

show just what the fruit will be later.
I am the only one who has fruited these
two varieties the Trimble and Weshart
and both of them have been earlier in
former seasons than the ordinary. tan-
gerine and of larger size. The fruit has
been large this year but not quite so early
as heretofore. It may develop later to be
an early orange or it may not, we do not
know, I would advise testing them in a
small way on different soil. '
Mr. Taber.-—I would like to ask again
what these two varieties are, as condi-
tions were so unsettled we did not get-
them.
Mr- Hart—They are Trimble and
Weshart, I will give a few buds to any
one who would like them; they are
hybrids, crosses between the Parson
Brown and Dancy Tangerine but are
practically tangerines. I took it for
granted that most of the members had
read of them. As I cannot supply them
by mail I take this opportunity.

basic slag is and how much available
phosphoric acid it contains? Is it as good
as lime to sweeten sour soils?
Mr. Painter.—Basic slag is a by-pro-
duct in the manufacture of iron. It is
also known as odorless phosphate or
Thomas slag. It was introduced into
Florida about ﬁfteen years ago but did
not become popular. It was then manu-
factured at or near Philadelphia but is no
longer made there. Basic slag does not
contain any water soluble phosphoric acid.
About one-half of the total phosphoric
acid is soluble in citrate of ammonia. be-
ing tri~calcium phosphate or reverted
phosphoric acid. It would be impossible
to have water soluble phosphoric acid
and lime in the same mixture as the.
lime would at once revert the phosphoric
acid. Slag is good for sweetening sour
land but lime is much cheaper. One ton
of lime will neutralize about seven times
as much acid as one ton of slag.

PROCEEDINGS
OF THE
TWENTIETH ANNUAL MEETING
OF THE
Florida State Horticultural Society.
For the twentieth time the Florida
State Horticultural Society held its annual
meeting, and the place of meeting this
time was within the gates of the delight-
ful city of St. Petersburg. Owing to the
poor schedules for getting to St. Peters-
burg it was thought that only a small
number of members would be at the open-
ing session, but in this every one was dis-
appointed. The ﬁrst session was well at-
tended, and each meeting up to the close
the attendance was above the average. In
fact. there were more members in attend-
ance during this session than at any time
since the meeting was held at Miami. So
many of the members had never visited
St. Petersburg or seen the Manatee sec-
tion, therefore they were delighted with
all they saw while on the trip, as well as
entertained by the splendid program offer-
ed.
The good people of St. Petersburg
chartered the Steamer Favorite and gave
the members a delightful ride up the
Manatee River. Owing to the rain no one
was able to get off and view the country
around, lbut they were able to put in the
more time regaling the inner man with
the good lunch the St. Petersburg people
sent along and served by the Ladies’ Im-
provement Society. The brew of the
coffee was perfection, the salads were su-
perb, the sandwiches just right, and a
plenty of everything for everybody.
The “next place of meeting” was an
interesting topic and was frequently dis-
cussed between meetings, in the boat, and
whenever a few gathered together. When
the voting time came. however, Gaines-
ville won with a good majority and was
announced as the next place for holding
the twenty-ﬁrst annual meeting of the
Florida State Horticultural Society. '

Address of Welcome on Behalf of the City.
By Hon. F. J. Northrop.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
)
I presume it is one of the chief pleasures
of the executive of any city to welcome
the various bodies of people that gather
in the city in convention or otherwise,
and I assure you that it is an especial
pleasure for me in this particular instance
to welcome to our city this distinguished
society; not alone for the honor you have
conferred upon us by holding this con—
vention here, but for the beneﬁcial results
we expect to derive from your presence
among us, and your particular purpose
here. I commend at all times any gather-
ing together in convention of any repre-
sentative body of people, because we all
‘ recognize the fact that it is the rubbing
together of the minds and the study of
our neighbors that brings advancement;
and advancement is certainly the order
of the day.
We are all well aware of the fact that
cultivation of the soil is the world’s great-
est and most valuable industry, and we
are also aware that there is vast room
for a higher education of our people in
this industry, and we look forward to
beneﬁcial results from these state con-
ventions. I feel sure that the beneﬁts
we expect to derive from your gathering
among us will be manifold, and for these
reasons I extend to you the courtesies
of our city, and assure you that we ap-
preciate the presence of yourselves, and
the importance of your purpose. The
keys of the city are yours, and I. trust that
you will be able to remember with pleas-
ure your stay with us.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
ADDRESS OF WELCOME ON BEHALF OF PINELLAS ORANGE-
GROWERS’ ASSOCIATION.

By Mr. A. F. Bartlett.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I was just congratulating myself that
I was to escape having to make this ad-
dress. The notice came to me a very
short time ago that I would be expected
to say a few words in place of the Presi-
dent of the Pinellas Orange Growers’
Association, who was not able to be here
on account of a sad calamity to some of
O
his friends. I had tried to persuade the
Secretary that it was his place and duty
to do this, but while I was attending
to some important business connected with
the Society, he conspired with the presi-
dent and substituted me for himself. I
have been at a loss to know how to get
out of it. I supposed- I had succeeded
until I was just called on, so you will

understand how unprepared I am for this
momentous occasion.
I realize that we are before a body
of representative people; people that I
have learned to admire, and whose wis-
dom I have been trying to drink in for
a great many years. .The splendid cour-
age'that has been manifested by the As-
sociation during its twenty years of exist-
ence (for this is its twentieth birthday we
are gathered together to celebrate) is a
remarkable thing. This organization has
lived through all the disasters that have
ever visited Florida since it has become
a state of any importance—going back
to the drought of 1890, the great freeze
of 1894-95, the varieties of bugs and in-
sects that have afﬂicted us, and everything
you can think of to discourage an organ-
ization devoted to this interest; but it is
still in existence and doing business at
the same old stand.
The people who have done this are
the class of people we meet here. I.have
lived in the \Vest, in the states where
they do not know the meaning of the
word “fail,” some of the states standing
high in the catalogue of industry and
wealth, and a short time ago I read a
statement in some journal that the peo-
ple of South Dakota were making more
money per capita than those of any other
state in the Union. I was in that state
at a time when contribution boxes were
passed around in the city of Chicago to
help the people of that state. I have
known the troubles of other western
states—Nebraska and others. They ap-
pealed to the nation to help them out
at their time of sorest need, but I have
never known Florida to appeal to the
nation or any organization to help her
out in the time of great disasters. I think
this is a credit to'her and her people, and
I am proud to claim a citizenship in the
state. I am not recognized as a genuine
“cracker,” but I hope to live long enough
to be known as one; to be known as be-
longing to their creed and their clan.
The people forming this organization
are the people who have been leaders in
thought and action; they have, perhaps,
represented the greatest industry in which
Florida is engaged, and to them is due
more than any other, perhaps, what we
get out of the soil. They have done a
splendid work. I mean by that, that the
most important things we know about
fruit culture, orange growing and truck
growing in this state, have been learned
principally through this organization.
This has been the leader, and has led the
state. and as I see what things have been
accomplished and see where we have been
beneﬁted, the more I see what is still to
be done on these lines, and the more I
feel the need of the people for an asso-
ciation of this kind.
I took out a life membership, because
I was afraid that I might possibly not
live long enough if I didn’t take out one,
to be considered a member at all. I want
to go down on the records as a life mem—
ber.
As I think of the splendid work this
Society has done, the more I am inclined
to believe that we will overcome the great-
er problems that are before us. It is a
good thing for us to have these problems.
If we were always fortunate in our deals.
and sold our oranges and vegetables at
a big price: if we had no trouble with
the transportation companies, the white
ﬂy and other insects, we could come to-
gether and have a “Hoorah,” but no-
thing would come of it. It is in over-

coming diﬂiculties that we become strong
and great, both as individuals and as a
nation. We must always expect them and
be ready to meet them. We have them
now. We have just suffered one of the
greatest droughts that ever visited the
state of Florida, and we have suffered
a great loss, but we are going right on
just the same. \Ve propose to do more
than we have done in the past, and to
bring our land up to the highest point
of production.
That brings up, perhaps, the problem
of irrigation, not only in orange culture,
but in trucking. Those of us who have
been through the West and know what
irrigation has done for those states, be-
lieve that there is a great future for Flor-
ida. I think that we will be able to solve
this great problem. We also have to
consider the problem of getting our fruit
and vegetables to market. These are
some of the problems that I believe the
Association can take up and can solve.
I think we can take them up and have a
hearing. Let us see to it that our agri—
cultural schools and our experiment sta-
tions are given an opportunity to work
along the right lines. Let us see that our
Legislature makes an appropriation that
shall enable us to make our work of ten-
fold more value than what we have al-
ready accomplished. Let us put it up
to the state to see that our agricultural
schools and our experiment stations are
supplied with the proper materials and
opportunities to make their work of the
greatest value. Let these come in closer
contact with the farmer; let farmers’ in-
stitutes be held everywhere, and be sup-
plied with the paraphernalia to go on with
these experiments which will enable the
farmer to compete with all his enemies
of heat and cold, insects and drought,
These are some of the problems that come
to the farmer or horticulturist, and I
think this Association can, and should.
and will, help him to solve them.
Now, in the name of, find in behalf of
the Pinellas Orange Growers’ Association
and of the Board of Trade of the City
of St. Petersburg, I extend to you all a
most hearty welcome.
RESPONSE.

Dr. George Kerr, Pierson.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen.-
We come among you, not as strang-
ers, but as friends. Permit me to say
that it was a happy moment in my
existence when, at last year’s meeting,
I cast my ballot with the great major-
ity to hold this year’s annual meeting
in this place. We have many valuable
members in St. Petersburg and vicin-
ity; indeed, all over South Florida.
They are valuable because of the untir-
ing interest that is taken by them in
the business of the Society, its increase
of membership, its larger attendance at
annual meetings, and also in the gen-
eral welfare.
These are strenuous times, when one
is judged by what he can do and by

the “square deal.” I take it, that this
is our platform. What we can best (10
for the good of all, and the “square
deal” between man and man.
I am authorized to say on behalf of
the president, ofﬁcers and members of
this Society, that we accept your dec-
laration of fealty and appreciation of
our efforts, with all their heartiness
and fullness. They are a stimulant to
a higher plane of usefulness and great-
er devotion to duty.
Horticulture as a business ranks second
to none. It came forth in the morning
when the sun ﬁrst kissed the footstool
0f the Creator as the waters receded,
and in splendor brought it into life.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our her-
itage. It is no gewgaw, or a second
handed article. It comes as the free
winds of heaven, unheralded, unbound-
ed, chaste. Thus, we lead the proces-
sion of all other callings.-
I say unto you who are ’not members,
come with us, and we will do you good.

President’s Annual Address.
By Prof. P.
Members of the Florida State Horticul-
tural Society; Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before presenting the address to the
20th meeting of the Florida State Hor-
ticultural Society, allow me to congrat-
ulate the people of St. Petersburg on
the splendid success they have attain—
ed in building this beautiful city. It is
only the periodic visitor to your city
that notes the improvement and pr0g~
ress. Those who call for the ﬁrst time
never knew it to be different, and those
who are here always see the changes
go on so gradually that it is rather a
development than a metamorphosis. I
wish also to congratulate the Pinellas
Orange Growers’ Association on the
frequent and instructive meetings they
have held. This young Association
will make its presence known and felt
before the State Society adjourns.
Amid all of these congratulations,
we feel deep down in our hearts the
absence of our late genial president,
whose invaluable advice has guided us...
Always ready as a peacemaker; fore-
most among the progressive; just en-
tering upon a wider and more useful
life for his county and state. Personal-
ly, it is a loss of a kind friend and an
able counsellor. To the Society it is
an irreparable loss. In this hour,
when the shadow is over us, we cannot
see the design. We can only bow our
heads in meek submission, and meekly
say, “Thy will be done.” I would urge
H. Rolfs.
every member of the Society to read
again his masterly address, which came
to us as a parting advice. Let me quote
one paragraph from this address, which
sums up the whole thought in a rounded
expression:
“I have felt strongly impelled at this
meeting to press upon your attention
these important matters. To give vent
to the thought that has been growing
in my mind for some years, that the
most vital and far—reaching questions
now calling for solution by Florida pro-
ducers were not cultural questions, but
commercial; not planting, but market
ing: not fertilizing, but transportation.
Let us think about these things. talk
about these, study them, conquer then-
If this thought, talk and study. take
not the form of action. then have we
labored in vain.”
Those of the Florida Horticultural
Society who are favored with informa-
tion on the commercial side of horti—
culture, especially with marketing and
transportation, should come forward
and discuss these problems, just as our
chemists have come forward year by
yea: and given us the best their labor-
atories and brains afforded. The bota-
nists, the entomologists, and the plant
breeders, all have placed before us in-
formation that required years of toil
and untold disappointments, until our
reports are quoted and looked up to a~
standards. even in far-oﬂ' India and New

Zealand. What we need is a careful,
concise, and methodical study of this
subject from the commercial point of
view. Prof. Tenny will present to us
a paper dealing with some scientiﬁc
features connected with transportation.
Why can we not have an equally able pa-
per discussing this from a commercial
point of view?
CHEMISTRY.
I have conﬁdence in the ability of
this Society to study and master all
problems connected with successful
fruit growing. Almost from its birth,
has it taken up problems for discussion
and study that would have been consid-
ered heretical by the Old School Horti-
culturists. The Society has certainly
shOWn its adaptability to new conditions
as they arose.
Chemistry, one of the oldest sciences,
was among the ﬁrst to be laid under
tribute by the advanced horticulturist.
At one time it was thought that all
causes for crop failure, excepting those
arising from climatic conditions, could
be discovered by an analysis of the soil.
Hence, we were taught that a chemical
analysis of the soil would tell us exactly
what elements were lacking, and what
elements were present in too great
abundance. The small amount of truth
upon which these assertions were based
gave sufﬁcient grounds for voluminous
articles to be written in a most lucid
language. Unfortunately, the most
voluminous writers were deﬁcient in
scientiﬁc training. and proﬁcient in lit-
erary work. These men were unable
to understand the restricting language
in which the scientists had stated their
proposition. Consequently, they build-
ed up wonderful theories and hypoth-
eses, all of which had to fall because their
‘chemical
major premise was only partially cor-
rect. Unfortunately for the true sci-
entist and the receptive reader, it is
frequently impossible for the lay read-
er to distinguish between scientiﬁc fact
and scientiﬁc fancy. The whole struc—
ture, the scientiﬁc as well as the fan-
ciful, fell into disrepute. This condi-
tion led to such terms as “Book Farm-
ers,” “Theoretical Farmers,” “News-
paper Farmers.”
“Truth crushed to earth shall rise
again. The eternal years of God are
hers.”
After clearing away the debris, the
foundation truth stood there ﬁrm and
immovable. \Ve have learned not to
trust in the ﬂimsy paper structure that
some still try to erect. The basic
truths, founded in the science of chem-
istry. are so much a part of our knowl—
edge now that there is no horticulturist
in my hearing but would rise in just
indignation should any legislator intro-
duce a bill looking to the abolition of
the ofﬁce of State Chemist. There are
still many discourses written which are
purported to be founded on facts from
the science of chemistry. Usually. these
discourses imperfectly veil their ad—
vertising nature. In addition to ad-
vertising essays, we have the pseudo-
an-d pseudo-horticultural es-
says constantly thrust upon us. These
are often a serious menace to our prog-
ress. They usually contain a few grains
of truth in a stack of chaff.
PHYSICS.
One of the most recent departures
from the old school horticulture is the
study of soil physics, or a study of the
soil from the standpoint of the physi-
cist. At ﬁrst thought it would seem
diﬁicult to form any connection be-

24 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
tween pure physics and horticulture;
but chemistry as a science concerns it-
self with the composition and materials
that make up the soils, while physics
concerns itself about the make up and
conditions under which these various
materials are found. The border lands
of these two sciences overlap one an-
other, so that a ﬁeld may be approached
from the realm of chemistry on the one
hand, and from the realm of physics on
the other hand, and ﬁnd savants from
both kingdoms rightfully encamped on
the same ground. Battles for the mas-
tery of these overlapping ﬁelds some-
times occur, resulting in loss of time,
and sometimes a loss of temper; all of
which is a loss to horticulture and
should not be tolerated. There is real-
ly no harm in exploring a ﬁeld from as
many points of view as possible, and
frequently a very great gain to all con-
cerned. The able address before this
Society last year by Prof Blair, shows
how little we actually know about what
goes on in the soil from a physical point
of view. We had all along felt that
there was a considerable loss of fertil-
izer from. the soil. due to leaching; but
had been told repeatedly by trust-wor-
thy witnesses that potash and phos—
phoric acid became ﬁxed in the soil. It
is now demonstrated from a physicist’s
point of view that a considerable
amount of fertilizer is actually washed
out and carried into the static water in
the soil. from which it is impossible to
reclaim any considerable portion.
SOIL PHYSIOLOGY.
The chemist has told us faithfully
what he found in his crucible.- The
physicist is likewise telling us how dif-
ferent natural and inert materials be-
have in the soil ; how the water
moves; what effect different elements
produce in the soil when applied; but
all of this still leaves us in the dark as
to what role different living subjects
play in the economy of plant growth.
For the solution of these problems
we shall have to look to the soil bac-
teriologist and botanist. I need here
only to mention the rather recent work
that has been done on the nitrifying
organisms, or the organisms which en—
able leguminous plants to make use of
the atmospheric nitrogen.
We have here three distinct sciences,
chemistry, physics, and botany, which
are each laboring actively to subdue the
same realm, the soil. These three,
however much they may discover,
will not complete the work for us.
What we shall need when these three
have secured the vast store of scienti-
ﬁc information locked up in the soil, is
the physiological botanist to tell us
what effect a variation of these factors
has on our cultivated crops. Of what
use is it to us to raise an orange that
turns even the stomach of an insect, or
to raise a variety of celery that has
such a thick epidermis that even a fun-
gus cannot pierce it?
FERTILIZERS.
There probably never has been a
meeting of this Society during which
the question of fertilizers was not dis-
cussed, and it is to be hoped that this
Society will not let the question rest,
until all superstition and misconcep-
tions have been cleared away. This
ideal state will not be reached however,
until we know more about our soil; un-
til we know more about the needs of
our plants; and until we know our fer-
tilizers. What we believe as true of
certain elements today, may tomorrow

25
be proven to be a fallacy; and our be-
liefs of tomorrow may likewise on the
following day be shown to be incorrect.
Let me cite a single illustration. Dur-
ing the early history of our Society, we
found earnest and eloquent advocates
of the use of ground rock phosphates as
a fertilizer for citrus trees. These ad-
vocates have either been converted to
the use of soluble phosphates, or have
been silenced. Ground rock is no longer
being actively advocated by any one.
Now comes Prof. H. J. Patterson, Di-
rector of the Maryland Experiment
Station. He used nine different chemi-
cal fertilizers as sources of phosphoric
acid—all that are ordinarily found on
the markets. Included in this list are ac-
id phosphate, dissolved bone black,
bone black, raw bone meal, and Florida
soft phosphate. The plots were laid off in
the regular form which is usual for such
work, the same chemical being applied
year after year since 1895 to each plot,
making eleven years of continuous use
of the same chemical on each particular
plot. Now comes the most startling
part, his conclusions. Two of them are
of special interest to us. The third of
his conclusions is that,—“Insoluble
phosphates produce a slightly higher
total average yield than soluble phos-
phates, and at about one-half the cost.”
The sixth of his conclusions is that,—
“Florida soft phosphate produced the
best yield of corn.” Let us not, how-
ever, conclude that the use of insoluble
phosphates is the best for us. In these
experiments annual plants alone were
used, and the soil upon which the fer-
tilizer was applied was clayey, and for
the most part contained considerable
humus. The conditions therefore, are
not exactly the same as ours; but these
experiments do show us the necessity
for careful scientiﬁc work, even on sub-
jects that we regard as closed questions.
\Vheeler and Adams of the Rhode Is-
land Experiment Station, working un-
der different conditions, ﬁnd that
ground rock (or ﬂoats) is the best form
of phosphates for squash and better
than any of the soluble or treated phos—
phates for corn.
COMBATING DISEASES AND INSECTS.
The question of combating insects
and of controlling diseases is as old as
the fertilizer question, and both are old—
er than our Society. We have publish-
ed valuable contributions on both of
these subjects annually. Whatever we
have attempted has been carried to a
full and creditable consummation. Every
year we have advanced slowly but sure-
ly. Sometimes our speakers have been
a little too far ahead of the average, but
the foremost have usually been abreast
with the leaders. One of the leaders
has not had a spraying machine in his
grove for years. Last year there was a
large exodus from the camp of sprayers
to the camp of those who use the natur-
al enemies for combating scale insects.
'We must look upon use of the spraying
materials for controlling insects and
fungus enemies as temporary expedi-
ents, which for the most part under our
present knowledge are unavoidable. In
certain cases it is absolutely necessary
to spray in order that we may avert
certain failure, but we are gradually
learning how to keep our groves and
vegetable ﬁelds from getting into such
distressing conditions.
The natural method of combating
scale insects is meeting with most ﬂat-
tering success, and can be economical-
ly applied. It is far cheaper to keep a

grove from becoming affected with die—
back than to cure the disease. Many
diseases and insects cannot be treated
in a similar way economically, because
we have not yet learned enough about
them. The cottony cushion s cale,
which at one time seriously threatened
the sub-peninsula, has been reduced to
a negligible quantity by introducing the
Ved'alia cardinalis, an Australian lady-
bird. California spent thousands of
dollars in attempting to subdue this
pest by artiﬁcial means.
CONCLUSION.
It is our province as a Society to
teach every member of this Association
what to grow, and how to produce the
best of everything. The old adage that,
“There’s plenty of room on top”, was
never more true than it is in horticul-
ture today. The man who markets the
best product never has to complain of
poor prices. It takes brains to do this,
and brains will count whenever they are
correctly applied. Sometime ago we
had a call from a gentleman from Michi-
gan who controlled considerable capi-
tal, according to his representations.
He was in Florida with a view of in-
vesting and had visited every vegeta-
ble growing and fruit growing section,
and closed his visit to the state by call-
ing at the Experiment Station. \Ne
discussed the various crops. Citrus
growing, in his opinion, was not desir-
able, since it took a long time to get
returns from the investment, and then
he was also told that the whitefly at-
tacked the trees. Peach growing was
also discussed, but that was given up
because peach trees had to be fertilized.
One crop after another was passed in
review. every one having some weak
point. Celery growing he considered
to be remunerative, but he had seen
some ﬁelds destroyed by blight. Final-
ly he said what he wanted was to learn
' of some crop that would not be frozen
out; that did not need to be fertilized;
that was free from insect attack and
fungus in'fection. He was very conﬁ-
dent that this infoiination could be giv-
en him at the Experiment Station, and
so came to get it. The Director told
him that this was a very easy propo-
sition and advised the man to plant
saw palmettoes. I do not want any
vegetable or fruit that is not relished
even by a bug, or one too tough to be
attacked by fungus, or too hard to
freeze. Give me the pineapple that has
to be packed in excelsior to keep from
being squashed in transit; give me the
orange that has to be scraped with a
wooden bladed knife to keep from in-
juring the peel; give me the cauliflower
that has to be wrapped in tissue paper.
Horticulture is affected more or less
by nearly every science, and by nearly
every art. Every walk in life is affect-
ed by the horticulture of the country,
and in turn as we are able to take ad-
vantage of the best of everything, will
we be able to prosper. During some
periods, our greatest needs lie in the
direction of better methods for controll-
ing insects. At other times, informa-
tion on diseases is needed most urgent-
ly. At one time we were in great need
of information on fertilizers. It seems
to me that what we are now needing
most of all is information that will en-
able us to put our crops into the hands
of the consumer at the least possible
cost. We need a sort of horticultural
political economy.

Report of Committee on Grapes, Figs and Persimmons,.
By P. J. Wister.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Appointed Chairman of the Committee
on Grapes, Figs and Persimmons, I com-
municated with the two other members
of the committee, Mr. Bacon, of Ormond,
and Mr. Steele, of Switzerland, for their
co-operation with reports of the northern
part of the state where my experience with
these fruits has been none. The require-
ments of these fruits and their culture
have at a previous meeting of the Society
been so well and ably discussed that it
would be only a repetition of what others
have already said to indulge on these
points; and I have, therefore, limited my-
self to a report relative to our experience
with these fruits on the lower east coast.
The southeast end of the peninsula has
been settled, as you all well know, at a
comparatively recent date, and as the set—
tlers were attracted more by the culture
of citrus fruits and pineapples, the
grapes, ﬁgs and persimmons have been
practically neglected altogether. As a
side issue to citrus and pineapple culture,
the majority of settlers seem to havie
taken tropical fruits, such as mangoes.
avocadoes. guavas, etc. Only in a few
isolated instances have I found anyone
planting the fruits under consideration.
Very little systematic culture has been
given these fruits, and the following notes
have been made from very few plants and
not large plantings.
Of grapes, a number of Eastern vari-
eties, as well as vinifera. or California
grapes, have been tried. The experience
of all who have tried growing grapes is
that severe pruning is injurious, causing
the vine to die back; and this is no more
practiced by those who are acquainted
with our local conditions. Most of the
vines that I have noted of late are train-
ed on a trellis, or overhead, allowing the
vines to grow, pruning away only dead
wood, which system is being practiced
on a trial vineyard at the Subtropical
Laboratory. Our experience has only
conﬁrmed that of others, that the vines
fruit well the ﬁrst two or three years, and
after that begin to die back and set very
little fruit. The vigor and adaptability
of the different varieties vary greatly. The
vinifera grape, which has been more un-
der my observation than the eastern
grapes, is very much subject to attacks
from. blackrot and mildew. Only by fre-
quent sprayings with Bordeaux mixture
is it possible to obtain good fruit. Again,
the berries mature very unevenly in the
bunches. which tends to make the fruit
less salable, and I consider it very doubt-
ful whether we will ever ﬁnd a vinifera
grape that will prove satisfactory. I have
not noted any insects attacking the grape
severely enough to lbe called a pest. Mr.
Thomas Spence, Buena Vista, Florida,
who has had more experience with grapes
in the lower part of the state than any
other person I know, writes me: “General-
ly speaking, I am. as you know, through
with trying vinifera grapes, as I think

the mildew and other fungoid troubles
will not admit of growing them success-
fully. Last year, as you know, was a
very poor one for grapes, and there were
none that could be said to succeed. The
year previous there were some nice grapes
on Black Hamburg, Brighton, Delaware,
Duchess and one of Roger's Hybrids;
but I don't consider that any of them have
made the growth this season to warrant
us in expecting any satisfactory results.
They all seem to die back without ripen-
ing their new wood properly, and they
are very capricious as to starting new
growth in the spring.”
The scuppernong has not, to my knowl-
edge, been tried. The “Key” grape has
been much spoken of at previous meet—
ings, but in addition to dying back, sim-
ilarly to other grapes, and ripening its
berries very unevenly on the bunches, it
is very inferior in quality, and not to be
recommended for planting. The Angu-
lata (a California grape) and Delaware
are (from limited experience) so far the
most promising varieties. The ancestors
to our cultivated grapes are indigenous
to temperate climate, and their descend—
ants have all been accustomed to a resting
season in the winter. For plants of this
character the winters in South Florida are
hardly cool enough for plants adapted to
a colder climate, and it appears as if the
introduced vines did not quite know
whether to grow or not, throwing out
feeble growths now and then, and not
ripening the wood properly.
There are frequently found vigorous
wild vines in the hammocks that bear
fairly good-sized bunches of very palata-
ble grapes. I have, during the past two
seasons, noted three vines that look very
promising and are apparently immune to
the two diseases above mentioned. In
the interest of every grape lover in the
state I would ask that anyone who knows
of such vines would try to get cuttings
and try hybridizing these with either Cali-
fornia or Eastern grapes. We might,
in this way, ﬁnd a variety more wholly
adapted to our climatic conditions than
an introduced grape. I am particularly
interested in the improvement of the grape
by means of hybridization and crossing,
and I would be glad to receive communi-
cations from those acquainted with wild
promising vines.
In looking up the ﬁgs, I ﬁnd that in
the upper end of the county (Dade) trees
that had been planted eight or more years
ago had made good growth the ﬁrst few
years. but later died back, or are doing
poorly. The cause has generally been
ascribed to the presence of nematodes.
While this may be the cause in some in-
stances. I believe that improper treatment
is the cause in others. In still others,
that they are planted in an unsuitable
location. In Miami there were young
trees planted in 1903 that now stand 10—
12 feet high, with a spread of ten feet,
that last year bore well and looked very
promising. These trees have received
good attention. The fact that these trees
are doing so well, and that the ﬁg does
well further up the state, seems to prove
that the fault does not lie entirely with
the nematodes, which are well distributed
throughout the southern states where the
ﬁg is well established and yearly gives
good crops. Fig culture is with us very
much in the experimental stage, and there
is apparently considerable difference in
the adaptability of the different varieties.
The ﬁg will hardly attain commercial im-
portance on the lower east coast in com—

petition with citrus and tropical fruits ;
but there isnothing more delicious than
a well ripened ﬁg or preserves made from
it, and every family ought to have a few
trees for home consumption.
A year ago the Subtropical Laboratory
received a consignment of capriﬁgs from
California, through the Department of
Agriculture, of which some varieties did
very well last year, when the freeze of
last winter killed nearly all to the ground.
They have spro’uted very well, however,
and are making rapid growth. The fruits
of these ﬁgs are not edible, but the plants
are necessary for the propagation of the
Blastophaga, which again is necessary in
the capriﬁcation of the Smyrna ﬁgs.
Later on, when the capriﬁgs are well es-
tablished, Smyrna ﬁgs will be tried and
Blastophagas introduced from California
where this insect is well distributed in the
ﬁg region. The progress of this experi-
ment will be watched with much interest.
Persimmons can scarcely be said to
have had a trial in the lower east coast.
I have seen remains of trees that were
planted several years ago, but I am satis-
ﬁed that the failures in many instances
lay with the cultivators.
Trees that I know receive intelligent
By w.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have very little to say on the subject
of grapes, ﬁgs and Japanese persimmons.
There was a time, years ago. when I was
familiar with all the varieties of ﬁgs which
are grown in Florida, and with most of
the northern varieties of grapes. But
for several years I was engaged in other
v
culture are now making good headway
for their age (four years), and are this
year bearing their ﬁrst crop. The native
persimmon grows wild on river banks and
moist land, and there is apparently no
reason why the Japanese persimmon
should not do well budded on this stock.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Gibbs—What is the color of the
leaf of that wild grape to which you re-
fer? Is it the wild scuppernong?
Mr. Wister—It is very similar.
Mr. Gibbs—Over on the Indian River
peninsula where I live, nearly opposite
Melbourne, there is an interesting grape
slowly getting a foothold among the wild
scuppernong. The foliage is much lighter
in color, and the fruit nearly as large
as the Concord, and is a dark red. It is
very acid, but it is the best jelly grape
we have tried. It is not a true bunch
grape, but often shows clusters of three
to ﬁve berries. It is sometimes found
bearing heavily, but generally seems to be
a shy bearer. I have heard it called the
“Missim” grape, but have suspected it
was an escape from some of the Munsons
that were brought in by Dr. Hall, an early
settler.

business, which prevented me from keep-
ing up my acquaintance with them. Du-
ring the last three years, circumstances
have enabled me to learn something of
present conditions. But the subject has
been so thoroughly and ably discussed by
previous committees, that there is but lit-
tle left to report. So far as I know, no

new varieties of any of these fruits have
been introduced within the past year.
Possibly it may be well to call attention
to some facts in regard to grape culture
in this state. There is no difﬁculty in
making the vines grow, that is, the difﬁ-
culties are only such as are to be met in
the culture of any other fruit, and the
vines of most varieties will ripen good
crops. beautiful bunches of fruit of ex-
cellent quality. and they will ripen at a
time when no other grapes are to be found
in the markets of northern cities.
About twenty years ago, being at that
time connected with the Florida Dispatch,
I was in Orlando at the time when the
ﬁrst crop of fruit began to ripen on the
vineyard of the Niagara Grape Company.
In company with several gentlemen of
Orlando, I went by special invitation to
visit the vineyard, to inspect the vines
and sample the fruit. We found thrifty
vines bearing a good crop, fully as large
as the age of the vines would warrant.
The bunches were large and the berries
beautiful in appearance, and of as good
quality as the Niagara ever produces. Yut
within a few years the vineyard was
abandoned. I never heard the full partic-
ulars, but understand that it was owing
to the fact that the cost of transportation
was so great that no proﬁt was left for
the growers. Another instance where the
express companies put on a rate which
was not what the trafﬁc would bear, but
enough to kill it, as it did the early at-
tempts at peach growing.
A little later, a number of Niagara
vineyards were set out near Moultrie in
St. Johns county. Within a few years
they also ceased to ship fruit to northern
markets, probably for the same reason.
That these vineyards have not been en-
tirely abandoned, is shown by the fact
that last year the St. Augustine papers
contained advertisements of wine made
from Niagara grown at Moultrie.
Possibly you may wonder why straw-
berries can be proﬁtably grown and ship-
ped from Florida, when they must be
sent in refrigerators, while grapes can
go by ordinary express. The difference
is that the strawberries reach the northern
markets when there is a scarcity of fruit,
while the grapes ripen in midsummer and
must compete in the markets with rasp-
berries, blackberries, cherries, etc.; con—
sequently they will not sell for so high
a price.
Fig culture in Florida has never be—
come a commercial success. The fruit
is so soft, when ripe, that it cannot be
shipped to a distant market. So far as
I know, no effort has been made to in-
troduce the Smyrna ﬁg, from which the
dried ﬁgs of commerce are made. They
are 'being successfully grown in Califor-
nia, and I see no reason why their cul-
tivation could not also be made proﬁtable
in this state.
The greatest drawback to proﬁtable ﬁg
culture in Florida is the fact that the trees
are very susceptible to the ravages of root-
knot. As was shown in the address of
Prof. E. A. Bessey before this society last
year (see the annual report for last meet-
ing), the only remedy for this trouble is
to starve out the nematodes which cause
it.
Japanese persimmon trees grow thrifti-
ly and bear large crops of fruit. Yet very
few have succeeded in making the culti-
vation proﬁtable. The chief reason for
this is the fact that the fruit is yet so
new in market that very few have ac—
quired a taste for it: hence the demand

is small. But the same trouble exists that
prevents grapes from being proﬁtable—-
the transportation charges eat up all the
proﬁts.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—I would like to ask on
what ground ﬁgs grow best in South
Florida.
Mr. W'ister.—On what we would call
low pine lands. The trees that I men-
tioned in my report have been grown
_on low pine lands and cultivated the
same as you would citrus trees.
Mr. Skinner—I am fond of canned
ﬁgs and would like to grow enough so
that I could have a mess of ﬁgs 0c-
casionally. I have never been success-
ful with ﬁgs grown on pine land, and
thought of starting in on hammock
land, and wondered if I could do it suc-
cessfully.
Mr. Wister—I see no reason why
the ﬁgs should not do well on ham-
mock land.
Mr. Gibbs—I have only grown ﬁgs I
on a small scale, but in 1904 when I
began planting, I found it stated in a
nursery catalogue that the ﬁg would
not stand cultivation in Florida, and
should be planted by the side of ‘build—
ings, or the ground under it be covered
with planking or some equivalent; so I
gave mine the protection of the fat
coquina rocks. For one fast-growing
White Adriatic, I disregarded Prof.
Hume’s advice and laid a ﬂoor of an
ever-widening circle of saw palmetto
roots under it from stem to tips of
outer branches, but it grows almost
too fast for me. I have to keep carry-
ing to it more big palmetto roots, and
don’t know as I can ﬁnd enough to
prevent the tree’s escape by rapid ex-
tension of its root system. And as for
the ﬁgs, they are the ﬁnest ﬁgs I ever
saw.
Mr. Hubbard—In relation to grapes,
I have heard that in addition to the
great expense of transportation, the
chief drawback in Niagaras is that the
grapes will not adhere to the bunch,
but drop off in great numbers and spoil
the appearance of the fruit before it
reaches the northern market. This, of
course. very much affects the sale.
Prof. Rolfs—Mr. Winters, can’t you
tell us something about those experi-
ments you tried on the kaki?
Mr. \Ninters—-American travellers
returning from Japan have frequently
told us about Japanese methods of fer-
menting the persimmons. Almost
without exception, these travelers
have spoken in the most complimen-
tary terms of the advantages to the
fruit from this process. Brieﬂy stat-
ing, the process as practiced in Japan
is to secure used saki casks. Roughly
speaking, the Japanese saki corres-
ponds very well to what we know as
beer in this country. The Japanese
secure used saki kegs, remove the head,
and then pace in it the persimmon
fruit. Care is taken by the Japanese
horticulturist to select the fruit that
has turned red but still very ﬁrm. We are
told that much of the success in fer-
menting kaki in this way depends on
the expertness of the person who does
the fermenting. First, in the matter
of selecting the fruit, when it is sufﬁ-
ciently matured, and not over matur-
ed; and second, in removing it from the
casks at a time when it has fermented
sufﬁciently. With a view of ﬁnding
out something about this method,
some experiments were taken up at

J
the Experiment Station last year with
persimmons in different stages of ripe-
ness. As saki casks could not be ob-
tained, glass jars were taken in place
of these, and alcohol was substituted
for the saki fumes.
The fruit used in this experiment
were of the Costata variety. All of the
fruit were mature, but still hard and
totally unﬁt for eating at that time.
The lot was made up of three grades
according to stage of maturity. First,
a lot of slightly bruised fruit which had
been gathered for a few days and
would have been ripe naturally in
about three days; second, a lot of fruit
that had been stored for a few days
with the ripest fruit gathered on the
date of experiment, most of which
would have ripened naturally in about
ﬁve days: and third, a lot of the ﬁrm—
est fruit, which was fresh from the tree
that day and which would have ripen-
C(i‘ naturally in about a week or ten
days. Equal quantities were weighed
and placed in ten lots. so as to have the
fruit in each lot as nearly the same size
and stage of maturity as possible.
We then prepared ten 2 I-2 gallon
jars in which to do the fermenting.
Glass was chosen because this would
enable us to make observations from
time to time without opening the ves-
sels: and also because it does not give
off any gas or liquid as wood might
even absorb liquid or gas. Eight of
these jars were then prepared by plac-
ing some absorbent cotton in the bot-
tom, to which had been applied approx'.
imately I oz. (25 cc—of 95 per cent.
alcohol. A glass plate was placed over
the cotton to keep the fruit from com-
ing in contact with the alcohol and yet
allow the gas of the alcohol to rise and
ﬁll the jars. The jars were then ready
for the fruit, which was carefully
placed. Another set of glass plates
large enough to cover the jars were
then placed on, being made fast and
air-tight by parafﬁn. Two aquaria, to
be used as checks, were prepared
without the use of alcohol. Each jar
was numbered, the stage of maturity
of the fruit in each being noted. These
were allowed to stand away from the
direct sunlight for nine days when one
of the checks and a representative
number of the others were examined.
They were then examined every two
days.
In the two check lots, there was no
external change to be noted in the
fruit, except a gradual ripening which
was shown in the darkening of the fruit.
When one of these was examined,
after standing nine days, the fruit
was mellow and some of them even
soft, but none of them were entirely
free of the puckery taste. As the rip-
ening continued, they became very
soft before the astringent quality dis-
appeared, and at this time the fruit
had begun to mold. There was no
striking internal change in color, ex—
cept the natural darkening as the fruit
became ripe.
Among the fruit treated, the least
mature fruit gave the best results. In
the two aquaria containing the least
mature specimen, the fruit remained
very ﬁrm, was in excellent condition
after sixteen days’ standing, and kept
very much better than the riper fruit
which was carried through the same
process. \Vhen examined after the
nine days, they were mellow through
and through, and were free of the as-
tringent ﬂavor. The sickening sweet

ﬂavor of the naturally ripened fruit
was replaced by a pleasant sub-acid ﬂa-
vor.
It was in Ithe greenest or ﬁrmest lot
that the least external change and the
greatest internal change took place.
After sixteen days’ standing in the closed
jars, this lot was entirely ﬁrm and
the ﬂesh was of a darker and richer
color than those of the same stage not
fermented. They were free from the
puckery quality. It was a ﬂavor that
one would not as readily become tired
of as in the case of the naturally rip-
ened fruit.
From this experiment, it is shown
beyond a doubt that the fruit is im-
proved by this process. It also clearly
shows that to obtain the best results
fresh. ﬁrm fruit, free from bruises,
should be used. The fermented fruit
keeps much better in closed vessels
than when exposed to the air. We
would suggest, therefore, that the fer-
mentation vessels be so constructed
as to allow them to be closed after a
portion of the fermented fruit has been
removed.
Mr. Gibbs—Had the fruit used in
your experiments ripened to its natur-
al color?
Mr. Winters—No, sir. It was ﬁrm
and totally unﬁt for eating.
Mr. Gibbs—A good many of them
get their full color before they are ﬁt
for eating.
Mr. Winters—This was not that va-
riety.
Mr. Rowe—What can I do to pre-
vent my persimmons from losing nine-
ty-ﬁve per cent. of their fruit after
they are set?
Mr. Hollingsworth—I have always
found that non-cultivation is the best
,33
for the persimmons. I have lost all my
fruit by cultivation.
Mr. ——Do you fertilize?
M'r. Hollingsworth—Where you ﬁnd
persimmons'growing naturally, I think
it is a mistake to fertilize. Persim-
mons have oﬁ years, and some years
they will produce heavily, while the
very next year their yield will be very
scanty.
Mr. —-—What about mulching?
Mr. Penny—Mulching is beneﬁcial.
The persimmon feeds almost on top
of the ground. The roOts spread out
almost at the surface of the ground and
where you use the mulch it gives them
a chance to feed on the surface right
where the roots are. It gives the nat-
ural conditions of the hammocks and
low places where they grow naturally.
Mr. Rowe—Do you have any trouble
from dropping under the mulch system
of culture?
Mr. Penny—When we have a heavy
crop, we usually lose about nine-tenths
of the crop and still have too much.
I have seen our trees breaking to
‘pieces with the fruit on them, and at the
same time they have lost nine-tenths
of their bloom. I have shipped several
thousand crates of persimmons, but we
have cut the trees all down except a
few on the outside of the grove. There
is not enough money in them commer-
cially in comparison with the citrus
fruits such as oranges and grape fruit.
There is also the same trouble with
persimmons as that mentioned by Mr.
Hubbard about grapes; they come in
competition with northern fruits. and
the transportation costs us too much
for the prices realized by the fruit. We
ﬁnd that the persimmon grows well
with us, and I cannot think of another

3%
crop in which we can do as well in the
quantity of fruit produced.
Mr. Bush—Do you cultivate these
persinnnons before using 'the mulch,
or after?
Mr. Penny—Absolutely we do not
cultivate. Sometimes, though, we
work over the land with a mowing ma-
chine to keep the weeds down.
Mr. ————-\\’hat kind of land is
best?
Mr. Penny—Low, ﬁat woods that
has been drained.
Mr. — What distance apart?
Mr. Penny—For persimmons, the
trees grow well when set about 20 feet
apart; 20 feet in the rows and 25 feet
apart. They grow to be large trees
25 to 40 feet high if they are not dam—
aged. Their wood is very brittle and a
heavy wind will break it down, espe-
cially where it is loaded with fruit. We
ﬁnd another difﬁculty in persimmons.
\/\'e could get a great deal more money
for them if they could ripen on the
trees. but the birds are very bad and
will ruin a great deal of fruit. Then
again. if there is a wet weather. the fruit
begins to crack. and that ends the fruit
for shipping purposes.
Mr. What form of fertilizer
do you consider the best?
Mr. Penny—I should say any good
orange tree fertilizer that you would
use for hearing groves would be ex-
cellent for persimmons.
Mr. Painter—Usually the best fer-
tilizer for persimmons is one contain-
ing but little or no anmiionia. One of
two per cent. of ammonia; eleven to
twelve per cent. of potash and eight to
nine per cent. available phosphoric ac-
id. to be made from sulphate ammonia.

Low grade sulphate potash and high
grade acid phosphate.
Mr. What is the nature of
your soil and sub-soil?
Mr. Penny—Our soil is low, ﬁat
woods. The land was originally well
timbered. The soil is-rather dark and
has a depth of three or four feet, I sup-
pose. Occasionally we ﬁnd a little
“hard pan” as we call it, but it seems
to be in spots.
Mr. Gibbs—Did you say you under-
drained that land? .
Mr. Penny—Not with under drains,
but with open ditches. As I under-
stand “under-drain,” it means pipes
under the soil. We have to do that
with our orange groves in places.
Mr. Hollingsworth—In California,
there is what is called the “muscat”
grape and I would like to know if any-
one in the State has made a success of
raising it in Florida. It is the best
grape I ever tasted.
Prof. Rolfs—Lots of people have
made a failure of it. But to come back
to the persimmon question; it seems to
me that it would facilitate our shipping
and the sale of the persimmon very
considerably if we can put into general
practice the process described by Mr.
Winters. It seems to me that the
question of keeping this fruit for a
practicable time is simply excluding
the air. That is all this process amounts
to. The alcohol or rather the fumes
of alcohol, was used to ﬁll up the spaces
in the jars that otherwise would have
been occupied by the air. The persim-
mons subjected to this process were
better than when allowed to ripen nat-
urally because of the absence of the
too sickish taste that frequently accom-
panies a dead ripe persimmon.

Report of Committee on Citrus Fruits.
By G. M. Wakelin, Lane Park.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen?
After conferring together the com-
mittee decided that every. member
should present an individual report on
whatever of interest had come to his
attention. There appeared to be no
particular phase of the topic for discus-
sion and besides it was doubtful wheth-
er more than one member could be
present.
The past eight or nine months have
tried the soul of the orange grower.
The usual fall drought spread over the
whole winter and then, merged with the
expected spring drought, has given
many sections of the state the driest
time known for years. The wonderful
vitality of the orange trees has brought
them through and will enable them,
when properly helped by judicious care
and fertilizing, soon to repair the dam-
age. The effects however will be only
too evident in a shortage of the com-
ing crop and, where groves have suf—
fered very severely, will reduce their
blooming next February.
Well, the lesson is—irrigate. Pipe is
high and advancing all the time but it
is not nearly so expensive as buying
fertilizer at $30 to $40 a ton to make'
bloom and fruit only to have it all fall
05. The harrow is a wonderful irri-
gator and mulching is also very helpful
but both are limited and the grower
ﬁnds he must add water to the soil or
else stand by and see the bloom and
fruit he worked so hard to get cover
the ground. Especially is watering
necessary in old groves where the trees
are large and often too close together.
Many of the trees of which I have
charge are in this category and had
they not been watered they surely
would have died. I hope the commit-
tee on irrigation has some new sugges—
tions as to methods of irrigation.
In addition to the long continued
drought the poor orange groves had a
freeze to contend with last December.
It seemed as if Jack Frost had a partic-
ular grievance against those who had
tried to escape him by migrating from
the old orange belt to the southern
counties. ,But in the eastern half of
Lake county where I am located there
was slight damage done. The tem-
perature with us did not fall below 27
degrees and fruit was uninjured. In
many parts of the state however orang-
es were badly frozen and alas! shipped
to market as sound fruit. A suspicion
was thus cast upon sound fruit even
when under a guarantee, and buyers
generally took advantage of the situa-
tion to keep prices down to a frozen
level. I am informed that up to a few
days ago grape fruit that had been dam-
aged by frost was still going into the
Philadelphia market. Unless a grower
has a particular trade to supply through
some commission man it certainly will
not pay him to consign fruit, however

sound it may be, after there has been a
freeze in the state.
We need to give more attention to
hardy varieties. Trifoliata stock is not a
success in light soils so its cold resist-
ant qualities are not always available.
But there is a variety of orange that is
cold resistant and thrifty above the or-
dinary. This is the Jaffa. Its heavy,
thick, vigorous foliage protects its
branches admirably, it bears, even while
young, good crops of heavy, ﬁne flavor-
ed fruit that is sweet early in the fall
and will hang on until late in the spring.
The Jaﬁ'a has not had the recognition
of its value to which it is entitled. It is
unfortunate that so many of the trees
planted years ago are of no particular
variety but just orange, like the man’s
hound that was mostly “just dog.”
Such trees not infrequently are charac-
terized by second grade fruit and not
much of that.
In uniformity of quality of product
California is away ahead of us despite
the fact that a good Florida orange is
without a peer, here or abroad. In
California the growers are effectively
organized, and the various citrus un-
ions exercise a strict supervision over
the fruit marketed. Fruit in any way
inferior is not shipped. \Ve need to
campaign toward this end and a higher
sense of honor among shippers. There
is too much green and frosted fruit
shipped from Florida. The state is
getting the name of shipping inferior
oranges.
Have any members had experience
with what has been called tuberose
blooming? Sometimes trees young or
old will put on, on a few branches, close
packed bloom enough to cover the
whole tree if properly distributed.
Such bloom always sheds off leaving
the tree bare of oranges. It is a serious
matter for trees to so expend their en-
ergy to no purpose. What is the cause
of this and what can we do to make a
tree properly distribute its bloom?
As a mere curiosity I am going to
place on the table a freak orange of some
good qualities. It was discovered
among some tardiff tnees. While it has
the navel feature it is quite seedy. But
the skin is thin and silky and the flavor
of the pulp really excellent. In form it
is very ﬂat so that the secondary or-
ange within extends well above the me-
dian line. This report is well estab-
lished as there are a number of trees
which bear this kind and no other. If
the seeds could be educated out of it we
would have a new navel of superior
quality.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Penny—I would like to ask Mr.
Wakelin more about that bloom he
spoke of. \‘Ve had last year on our
tangerine trees a good deal of bloom
that appeared to be very short—the
bloom buds. Is that the way yours were?
Mr. Wakelin—No, I never knew
tangerine trees to do that. The bloom
has been distributed over them. Other
trees would put on sometimes ﬁfty
blooms all on the terminal shoots, but
they would not amount to anything
because they all fell off. For all the
good such blooming does us, the tree
might just as well be dead. The blooms
this spring resembled bridal wreath
more than an orange tree. There was
an exceedingly heavy bloom.
Mr. Thornton—I have noticed that
the trees are full of bloom—almost
like the bridal wreath as Mr. \Vakelin
says. and this after the dry weath-

er we have had, too. I think it is the
dry weather causes it.
Mr. Hollingsworth—I wish to ask
if this is the case this season more than
usual.
Mr. Wakelin—Our trees have al-
ways done more or less of it, and I
have not thought it was on account of
the dry weather. We had a drought
from the ﬁrst of February to the ﬁrst
of April. Previous to their bloom they
were not suffering for water.
Mr. Hollingsworth—My experience
on these lines has been simply and
purely practical. I have corns on my
hands like a small boy has on his heels
because I have got right down and
worked with my men. I think the
same rules apply to the orange trees in
Florida as to the peach and apple trees
in Western Missouri, where I was rais-
ed. I have found that any abnormal
condition such as dry weather, or any-
thing like that will produce an abnor-
mal condition of the tree. If a limb
is injured by rubbing or chaﬁng, it
tries to reproduce itself and perhaps
goes to the other extreme in _order to
establish its equilibriumt we had an
old apple tree back in Missouri that
had never borne, and it had a spot on
it that I thought made a pretty good
target. and I shot at it, and after that,
it bore. I think a tree tries to offset
the injurious effects and many of them
will bloom out fully and never show
thatvit is in an abnormal condition.
Mr. Wilson—I would like to ask if
the same thing happened all over the
State that happened in my grove this
year. An insect appeared, we call it
the “thrip” at Gainesville. I noticed
it this year for the ﬁrst time. It is a
tiny insect resembling the hen mite.
It looks like what comes in the rose
in the spring and makes them blight.
I was so very anxious about the grove
and bloom on account of the drought
that I suppose I noticed the bloom
more than usual, and I think it is the
same- thing we call thrip, which de-
stroyed the strawberry crop around
Gainesville about ten years ago so that
there have been absolutely none raised
on account of it.
, I would like to say while I am up
that my grove is like the grove the
gentleman spoke of; the trees were
heavily loaded with bloom, but we
had no rain and I devised a scheme
to water them. I went down with four
teams and stopped at Ocala and got
whiskey barrels and put them on the
wagons and applied three barrels of
water to each tree while the trees were
in bloom and thought I had solved the
problem of making the fruit stick.
Now, the oranges vary in size from
one the size of the end of a lead pencil
to nearly a full grown orange, and they
have never stopped dropping from the
time they started. At what period can
you tell when the fruit that is on is
going to stay on? When can you safe-
ly estimate your crop?
'Mr. Taber—I think there is one
thing we should have settled. Did he
thoroughly wash out those whiskey
barrels before he began to water the
trees.
Prof. Rolfs—And I think we ought
to know whether he got them from
Ocala or Gainesville.
Mr. Neil—I would like to ask Mr.
Wilson if it was after that that the
thrip did any harm.
Mr. Wilson—I think it was before.
I think there would have been a good

many more 11' it had not been for the
thrip, because they got into the bloom
before they cracked open, and I expect
in many cases they cracked the bloom.
I noticed when the orange began to
show itself, it was a very pale yellow,
and I believe the thrip destroyed the
life of the bloom.
Mr. Neil—He asked when he might
estimate his crop. I have had some
experience in that line, and I would
say that the best time to estimate your
crop is the day before you go to sell.
There are so many circumstances that
may affect your crop at any time, that
it is difﬁcult to say just when you can
estimate with any degree of certainty.
Now, about that dropping he speaks
of. I have my very serious doubts
whether a tree ever drops any more
fruit than it ought to. \Ve used
to have these annual droughts; it was
exceptional to go through a season
without one and we used to fret a great
deal about them. I used to water a
great deal. but never saw that I had
any more fruit than my neighbors who
did not water at all. I don’t believe
that a tree ever throws off any more
than it should.
Mr. Longley—I have had a little ex-
perience with thrip. Year before last,
I had considerable thrip in my bloom.
but I had a good crop notwithstanding.
Last year I saw a lot of it, and sent for
some thrip juice. I sprayed my trees
in the bloom and it cut off about half
my crop. The thrip punctures the lit-
tle orange when the bloom opens and
you will often notice that the bloom be-
fore it opens is punctured as though
you had stuck a needle through it. You
will ﬁnd in one bloom a hundred of
these little punctures. I believe we
will have a pretty good crop of truit
this year, however.
Mr. W akelin—We notice our orang-
es sometimes fall oﬁ after they are
pretty well grown, and of a bright
green color and glossy. They fall off
and leave their stems on the tree. It
looks as though something had gotten
between the stem and the calyx and
pried it off. You cannot see anything
the matter with the orange, and the
tree has not suftered for water, either.
Mr. Penny—I would like to ask the
gentleman if he had a good crop of
fruit after these fell oﬁ.
Mr. \Vakelin—No, I don't think Sn.
They robbed the tree. I notice often
times where these oranges fell off,
they would be the only ones on the
ends of twigs and should not have fall-
en off, for they had no neighbors to
crowd them.
Mr. Hubbard—The thrip has always
been present with us more or less since
I began orange culture some twenty-
ﬁve years ago. Most seasons it has
very little effect on the fruit. The
thrip seems to get at and feed on the
honey that is secreted at the base of
the orange. In some cases, the thrip
may be a beneﬁt in mixing the pollen.
I do not think it does much damage
except to mar some specimens of fruit.
They sometimes gnaw snaky. little
tracks that run around on the peel..
As to the abnormal growth. I think
it is caused by shock to the tree. The
bloom and the foliage start from the
same class of embryo and it depends
on the condition of the tree at the time
when that embryo is formed whether
it will produce leaves or bloom. It
depends largely on the climatic condi-
tions. If the shock by cold is great,

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 39
it may go to an excess of bloom, and
if a drought comes on, it may make
more foliage than bloom. An exces-
sive crop is usually caused by some
shock, disease or starvation.
Mr. Hume—I do not believe that
anything done at the time of bloom has
much effect. I am inclined to believe
that shock is caused to the tree by
cold, drought or some such climatic
conditiOn. As far as Mr. Wilson’s plan
of watering is concerned. I think he
should have started watering long be-
fore he did, and done it about twice a
week. I think his labor was all wasted.
I think to get a good crop of fruit to
hold on the tree, you should begin
back a long time previous to the time
that the bloom comes on.
Mr. Hollingsworth—I experimented
on the watering question this year for
the ﬁrst time. \Ve had a rain nine
weeks ago that caused the bloom to
come out in just a few days. Certain
parts of my grove were in full bloom
and then we had nine weeks drought.
and the trees were going to cast their
bloom. I took a coal oil barrel, and
excavated around each tree in a circle
some six or eight feet. We designated
six tangerine trees that were heavy
in bloom. I gave three barrels of wa-
ter to them as rapidly as it would soak
down and then ﬁlled the excavation up
with dry dirt so as to hold the mois-
ture. Those trees have set a very good
crop of fruit. I have the nucleus of an
old grove of about forty-ﬁve trees that
are about forty-ﬁve years old. They
have had foot rot. die back. etc. (let me
remark in passing that a neighbor of
mine said his grove was of no use until
the foot rot got into it) but still bear-
ing very heavily. I watered a few of
these trees at the same time we ex-
perimented with the younger stock and
ﬁnd the same holds good in both cases.
Through the middle of this grove is a
ridge, and on the slope of this ridge I
had put out about a hundred sweet
seedlings some six years ago. This
drought overtook these seedlings.
They shed their leaves in the tops two-
thirds of the way down and directly after
the rain, within a week, they put on a
bloom. We had watered the trees in
the middle of the ﬁrst drought, and
when the rain came. they were so vig-
orous they reacted again. The second
drought caused them to cast that
bloom, and then about ten or ﬁfteen
days ago they put out a right good
bloom, which set the second time on
the same limb. That is a freak I can-
not explain. They have shed off their
bloom and formed oranges about the
size of peas and we believe they are go-
ing to stick.
Dr. Richardson—I have been |nuch
interested in the discussion. and I am
particularly interested in the talk of
Mr. Hollingsworth. I am inclined to
think from his talk that the thinking
he has 'been doing has made corns on
his brains as much as hard work has
made them on his hands.
An eminent physiologist, when ask-
ed what time he would begin treatment
of a child] to make it a healthy. well de-
veloped human being said he would- go
back one or two generations before the
child was born. I think that applies
to orange trees as well. It has been
argued that the injury which the
trees have received ' has been the
the cause of excessive bloom. It has
also been intimated that shooting into
a tree or doing anything to bring

about an abnormal condition will cause
bloom. I think our present difﬁculty
can; be traced back to the cold of last
December. I am of the opinion that it
was this that produced the abnormal
bloom, and is more to blame than the
drought from which we are all suffer-
ing. I think that this cold left the trees
in an improvident condition, but that
when they recover from the shock they
received last winter, they will again at-
tend to business. I don’t think there is
anything to worry about.
Mr. Neil—I presume this will not
end the discussion or get off the sub-
ject of irrigation. I am afraid that if
it took as much as three barrels of
water to a tree once a week and we had
to apply that three months before the
bloom and four months after, it would
not be a practical proposition. I have
always been opposed to irrigation be-
cause I‘do not believe that orange
trees throw off any more fruit than
they ought to throw off. I think an
orange tree knows how much fruit it
can bear and bring to maturity, and if
you force it to maintain and ripen more
fruit than it is able to, it is an irrepara-
ble injury to the tree. We are
supposed to have two of the best
groves in the eastern part of the coun-
ty and I do not apply exceeding over
one barrel of water, and that only once
a week or ten days. Rain water is the
best to use, lake water is the next and
artesian water is the last. I have some
trees pretty well loaded with fruit, but
our watering them did not save their
fruit, but kept the trees in ﬁne condi-
tion. I did not begin to water until
the bloom had appeared. We are in
hopes of having the second bloom, and
I think we will have two-thirds of a
crop in the State this year.
Mr. Skinner—I would like to know
how much of a crop we have, from
the orange growers’ standpoint and
the sellers’ standpoint. We ought to
be able to get at a pretty accurate idea
of how much of a crop we will have.
I would like to have the men from
the different sections get up and say
what percentage of a crop they think
they will get.
I have tried the kerosene barrel
method—not the whiskey barrel—and
have abandoned it. If. Mr. Neil will
go back to the season of 1897-98, he
will remember that the drought at that
time, was fully as bad as the one
we have just had. Around Sutherland
and Dunedin whole regions of pine
woods and oak woods died. I tried to
save my crop with barrels, and worked
hard. I poured water under my trees,
and my neighbor _across the fence did
not do anything, and when the time
came to bear, his bloomed and mine
didn’t. If you don’t water at the right
time, don’t do it at all. My experience
is that an irrigating plant nearly pays
for itself every year you put it in.
Mr. Stevens—I have tried a little
watering, and I ﬁnd that it keeps the
wilt off the leaves and keeps the trees
in growing condition, but some of the
fruit is on the trees, and some on the
ground. I don’t think they have drop-
ped more than is necessary for them to
drop.
Mr. Sampson—I want to speak
about a particular kind of dropping.
Even where the growth appears per-
fectly vigorous and healthy, the fruit
will drop off, but the stem and calyx
will remain green and will draw nour-

41
ishment from the tree all through the
season. It is not a natural drop, but
something is the matter with the tree.
No insect work as far as can be seen,
but a sap disease apparently.
Mr. Waite—In speaking of this
dropping. Last year, I think we had
as normal conditions as we ever had
in Florida; a warm winter, plenty of
rain, and one of the heaviest blooms I
have ever seen. The trees were white,
we had a good crop of fruit set, but
about the ﬁrst of May we had for about
ten days a cold wind from the east.
The nights were very cold. Immedi-
ately after, we found that our trees
were shedding their fruit and the same
conditions existed as mentioned by the
gentleman. The stems were green and
kept green during the entire season. I
was speaking to one of the oldest
growers in that section, and he stated
that in 1898 the same conditions ex-
isted. Our crops were heavily dam-
aged by the fruit shedding after that
cold east wind. I ﬁnd in some seclud-
ed places in our groves (where they
had protection) we had a good crop-
of fruit, while where the wind had a
good sweep the trees had only about
one-third of a crop. Where we expect-
ed 75,000 boxes we had only 25,000.
Mr. Willis—I am not old in the or-
ange industry; only about four years.
We put in a twenty-horse power en-
gine and ran pipes all over the grove.
We irrigate about every ten days. The
trees are in ﬁne condition and holding
their crop very well. We began ir-
rigating early in March, and our trees
look as good as they would if condi-
tions had been favorable, and growing
all the time.
Mr. Skinner—I would like to hear
from Mr. Hume and Mr. Rolfs about
that calyx dropping. I don‘t believe
that the east wind does it. I am losing
thousands of dollars right now.
Prof. Rolfs—So far as I have worked
upon it, I ﬁnd that there is an irritat-
ing agent there that gets in between
the orange and the calyx. Under cli-
matic conditions, such as drought, cold,
etc., it would shed off below the pedun-
cle so that there would be no calyx left
on the tree. My scientiﬁc work has been
limited to the small fruit, not larger
than a hazel-nut and at that time I
could not get the fungi that caused the
fruit to drop to infect the fruit. After .
the fruit arrives at about the size of a
hazel-nut, from this time until the fruit
is colored, there seems to be a period
of immunity. It is possible that this
east wind or other cold wind has a de-
pressing effect upon the plant and al-
lows these fungi to infect and knock
them off.
Mr. Hart—I would like to air my
views on these subjects, too. Accord-
ing to my little experience, I think that
the distance between the trees in a
grove has a great deal to do in decid-
ing whether it needs irrigation in a
dry time, or not. My trees are mostly
set twenty feet apart, some of them
thirty. One of the groves has the trees
set eighteen feet apart; that is on a
piece of ground that has some oyster
shells in it. At times, a few of these
trees have the dieback, and I think
for the past two years, to correct this,
I have hardly put a cultivator in it.
We had a dry spell as you all know
covering six months, and it was not
broken until lately. On that grove,
some of the oranges got soft. so that
they began to drop from the trees in

February, so I started to pick them.
Perhaps I got two hundred boxes of
soft fruit and I threw out what we
could not ship and sold the rest at
$2.00 a box. That, no doubt, was the
result of the drought, and I am con-
vinced that non-cultivation and close
planting had a great deal to do with
it. The trees are large ones, interlock-
ing their limbs and roots so as to oc-
cupy all available space. In my other
groves, the trees have come through
in ﬁne shape; they show little curling
of their leaves and have a good setting
of fruit today. If there is a drought
on, I would cultivate often and keep
the surface very ﬁne where this does
not interfere with treatment of dis-
eased conditions. You know it has
been said that two cultivations are
equal to a rain.
The planting of trees according to
the new horticultural method, which
I suppose you all understand as the
Stringfellow method, is also a matter
I would like to speak about. Quite a
number of years ago, our former presi-
dent, Mr. Adams, and myself met Prof.
Budd, who was one of Mr. Stringfel-
low’s ﬁrst converts, at an American
Pomological Society Convention in
Washington. and we went over the
ground thoroughly. Soon after, we
plan-ted according to this new method
experimentally. On uncultivated
ground. it is claimed to work ﬁner than
where the ground has been thorough-
ly cultivated beforehand. The roots
put down and go deep and do not suf-
fer from drought; the fruit is ﬁnely
and highly colored. and will stand ship-
ping better. according to the claims of
its advocates. I planted some of them
by the Stringfellow method and some
of them by the old method in alter—
nate rows, and during this drought
those trees planted by the Stringfellow
method have come through and show
but very little harm from the drought,
while the alternate trees set by the old
method have suffered some. I think
the conditions have been exactly the
same except the difference in the meth-
od of planting. Those trees have been
planted at least eight years. long
enough to have them show deﬁnite re-
sults.
Mr. What is the size of the
tree? How do they compare? He
(Mr. Stringfellow) claims a larger
growth.
Mr. Hart—It is rather in favor of the
“new horticulture” style of setting
trees. I went over them just a short
time before coming here to note that
particularly, and it is in favor of those
set out by the Stringfellow method,
though not very marked. The ground
in both styles of planting was thor-
oughly cultivated.
Mr. Longley—I set out a grove that
way some twenty years ago. I did not
know that it was anybody's method in
particular. I had not found out that
the roots went down straight, but that
may be the cause my grove did not suf-
fer. I know of a neighbor who was
setting out some lemon trees some
seventeen years ago and he tried the
experiment. He set one of them ac-
cording to my suggestion. For the ﬁrst
year. the tree that had the roots spread
out made the best growth. but the next
year the other one came up with it. and
the two are very much alike. I do not
know that the roots have anything to
do with it.
Mr. Kerr—I was about to ask to have

the roll called of those present; so that
we might comply with Mr. Skinner’s sug-
gestion as to how much of a crop of
oranges we can expect this year.
Mr. Rolfs—Suppose you conduct this,
Mr. Skinner, as you were the one who
suggested same.
Mr. Hollingsworth (DeSoto)—-For
the last two or three years I have been
trying to estimate the orange crop, and
have missed it so far, and I have said I
would never make another prediction. -I
think, however. that DeSoto county will
not have as much as last year. The im-
mediate neighbot‘hood of Arcadia will
grow nearer to last year’s crop. Our
county had between 700,000 and 800,000
boxes. The county has shipped since
1898 about 25 or 30 per cent. of the
state’s entire crop. I think, however, this
year DeSoto will not have more than half
a million boxes, if that much. We hope
the condition for the remainder of the
season will improve very much, but even
in that case we will not have much more
than half a crop.
I don't think our grapefruit bloom was
up to the average. \Ve see now occasion-
al b100m. The bloom is scattered over
a long period. My estimate would be that
if the conditions until the time of gather-
ing are favorable, there will be 450,000
boxes.
Dr. Phillips—I am not a member of
this association, but for the last two years
have made a specialty of oranges. There
has alwaYs ‘been a haphazard way to esti-
mate the orange crop. Nine farmers out
of ten will decide what they are going
to have, and their expectations are always
colored by their desires, and they will say.
“Oh, yes sir; we are going to have a
magniﬁcent crop." I know there is a
long—felt want in this state for deﬁnite
statistics. I know it is of interest to me,
and I think to everyone else in the state
that is engaged in the orange industry.
Mr. \Vaits (Manatee county)——We
will have about 10,000 boxes. If it had
not been for the freeze we expected about
60,000 or 70,000 boxes. I have not been
over the whole county. Outside of our
own groves the trees seem to be setting
a very good crop. From what I can
hear, there will be one-half or two-thirds
of a crop. The grapefruit crop is shy.
Mr. Brown (Manatee county)—I can
not speak for the county. but in our own
groves we will not 'have ten per cent. of
a crop: less than ten per cent. due to the
freeze and the drought.
Mr. Hampton—I have been traveling
around in a good many different sections
of the state, and I don't believe there will
be on an average twenty-ﬁve per cent.
of a crop. That is a very conservative
estimate. for in many places there will
not be ten per cent.
.\'Ir.—-—(Polk county)—I think
there will be about ten per cent. of a crop.
I don't think I have seen a grove that
has even ten per cent. Only one or two
groves have a crop worth mentioning.
Mr.—Our grove “has been very
late and the fruit is so small it is hard
to make an estimate. I would say that
the crop at the end of our grove will
amount to half a crop; in other words.
about 12,000 boxes. ,
Mr. (Hillsboro county)—-I don’t
think our crop will be a heavy one. and I
doubt if the grapefruit will come to half
a crop. I do not know whether the east-
ern part will have much of a crop or not.
I have heard that it would be Short.
Mr. Hoard (Orange county)—I thin

individually we will have twice the crop
we had last year, and I think it is due
entirely to our irrigation. Our irrigation
plant has more than paid for itself this
year.
Mr.\Vakelin (Lake county)—Down in
Lake county the trees bloomed in the reg-
ular time. They continue blooming un-
til about now. The younger trees bloom-
ed at the regular time, and they have done
pretty well. There was about two-thirds
of a bloom until the latter end of March.
Mr. (Orange county)-—S o m e
trees bloomed pretty well early in the
season, but most of it fell. After the
rains, many bloomed again, and now a
part of the trees are white with bloom.
I think in our neighborhood the orange
crop will not be more than a third of a
crop.
Mr. (M a r i o n county)—Not
over one-fourth of a crop, or less.
Mr. Hart (Volusia county)—-I will
say that on the east coast where protected
there is a reasonably good crop, and more
have protected their groves this winter
than ever before; but I think that on the
west side of Volusia county in groves not
protected, there is a short crop.
Mr. Kerr (Volusia county)—In the
northern part of Volusia county the
groves are showing up well, the treees
are looking ﬁne, and we will probably
have half a crop. I attribute this greatly
to the excellent location of the county, etc.
Mr. (Lee c0unty)—I do not
think there will be more than half a crop.
Prof. Rolfs (Dade county)-—I know
it is shy in Dade.
Member—How much was the entire
crop in the state last year?
Mr. Skinner—It we 5
around 4,000,000.



somewhere
Mr. Tilton—How do you regard the
June bloom fruit? We have a little of
it in our grove.
Mr. Hubbard—The scattering June
bloom is usually thick skinned and dry
and pulpy and of poor shipping quality.
Mr. Hart—If you have nothing else
on the tree it is pretty fair. If mixed up
with the regular season fruit, it is poor.
It is always thicker skinned. I had much
rather it would stay off than come on,
although when there is no other fruit
on the tree it does very well.
Dr. Phillips—I want to bring up the
question again of getting up reliable esti-
mates. I have heard variohs estimates
gotten out by parties in the month of
May, and perham they will get out an-
other the next month that is entirely dif-
ferent. and when the crop is gathered, it
is‘entirely different from either estimate.
I think this society should adopt a method
to get the correct statistics, say, in the
month of July, when experienced orange
men can estimate a crop with a degree
of accuracy. Then, I think, each county
should be represented, this society ap-
pointing a person or persons to go out
and send in an estimate to headquarters.
Then let the society force the railroad
companies to prepare to handle the crop
which we will give them. If we have a big
crop, the transportation should be prepar-
ed beforehand to take care of it. Suppose
it is necessary to pay a man for his ser-
vices; it will be worth much more to the
orange grower to have information he can
rely upon. If it is rumored that we have
a larger crop than we really have, it has
a depressing inﬂuence upon the price and
we lose a great deal more money than
these statistics will cost us.
Mr. Hart—I would say that this could

easily be done if we had an appropriation
from the state, or some income more than
we have at present; but we have had to
economize in every direction.
Mr. Longley—As far as my experience
is concerned, I believe that all of the or-
ange growers here and elsewhere would
be willing to pay a bonus for just such
information. The information is sent out
all over the country that we will have an
enormous crop of fruit by parties bent
on depressing the price of our fruit. I
have no doubt but that every orange
grower has lost hundreds of dollars every
year. If we assess every member ﬁve
dollars it would pay big to get just that
information.
Mr. McLane-—This is a very important
question, and I move that the president
appoint a committee of ﬁve gentlemen
whose duty it shall be to formulate a
plan to present to this body tomorrow by
which statistics can be secured. I think
that everybody will agree that it is a
matter of vital importance; not only the
men who produce the fruit, but the men
who buy it should have some intelligent
idea. we know that every other crop
produced in the United States is estimat—
ed. I make that motion and hope some-
body will second it.
Motion seconded.
Mr. Painter—While on this subject I
wish to state that I undertook last year
to get up information just like what you
are talking about now. I sent out over
12,000 letters, addressed to growers all
over the state, asking them for the very
information that you are seeking for.
How many replies do you think I got out
of that 12,000? Just 1,200. The trouble
is to get the information from the grower.
They seem to be afraid to give the in-
formation out, and seem to want to make
you think they have a big crop, whether
they have or not.
Mr. Phillips—I can readily appreciate
that very few people will answer ques-
tions like those, and realize how very hard
it is to get this information. My sug-
gestion is to get conservative business
men, pay them for their time and let them
go over the counties and get this informa-
tion from an unprejudiced standpoint.
Not one man in a hundred would refuse
to let him estimate his crop. Not to have
this estimate costs the state of Florida
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Mr. .McLain—The motion is already
before the meeting that a committee of
ﬁve be appointed to formulate and pre-
sent to this body a plan whereby this in-
formation can be secured. I call for the
question.
Motion put and carried.
Mr. Cribb—There is a doubt in my
mind if this information would be worth
anything to us. I never saw an orange
grower who could estimate his crop with-
in ten or ﬁfteen per cent.
Prof. Rolfs—The following committee
is appointed: P. Phillips, A. H. Brown
and Wm. C. Richardson.

WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION.
Prof. Rolfs—The matter of citrus dis-
eases being up for discussion, I wish to
make a few remarks in connection with
this subject. The most serious disease
and the most peculiar one that we have
had anything to do with recently is the
one which causes withertip in citrus. The
causative agent here is colletorichum
gloeosporiodes. This species of fungus
is probably the same as the one that oc-
curs on the mango and the avocado; a

fact which is of considerable interest to
us. especially since the avocado and man-
go occur in the same region, and often
in the same orchards, with the citrus.
Mr. Neeld will remember that in 1893
the mango bloom blight occurred pretty
severely on the sub-peninsula. Up to that
time the trees had fruited heavily. In
1894 the bloom blight was so bad that
only a small crop matured, and investi-
gations were started at once with a view
of establishing what caused the diseases.
Some information was gotten as to the
identity of the fungus, but in the winter
of 1894-95 the trees froze to the ground,
leaving us without an opportunity of
carrying on the work already started.
Since 1901 investigations on the same
disease were begun in the mango or-
chards of Miami. The mango bloom,
when attacked by this fungus, soon turns
black and falls off.
During the period of bloom, various
species of insects visit the mango blossoms
for pollen and for honey. These crawl
about over the blooms, passing from dis-
eased blooms to healthy ones. As the
insects pass over the diseased bloom, they
come in contact with the spores of the
fungus. These adhere to their body or
to their appendages, and the spores are
then carried to the healthy bloom. In
addition to the insects, the winds also help
in disseminating the fungus spores. It
therefore seems almost impossible for a
single bloom to pass through this trying
ordeal without becoming infected. As a
rule. a small quantity of fruit sets in spite
of all these adverse conditions. As soon
as the calyx and corolla have fallen away
from the flower, the young fruit is not
in immediate danger of being infected.
The recently set fruit stands in a perpen-
dicular position, consequently the danger
of fungus spores coming in contact with
it is greatly reduced. When, however,
the fruit has reached about the size of a
pecan nut. the weight becomes too heavy
and the fruit causes the peduncle to turn
over and bend downward. This gives
the fungus a chance again to attack it,
since the spores from other portions of the
tree may be carried, by moisture, down
on to the fruit and infected. - On some
trees, where the fungus did not affect
the bloom, or those which are not affected
by bloom blight, the disease gets started
sometimes on the young fruit. In such
cases the young fruit falls from the trees.
literally by thousands. While the fruit
is quite small it tums entirely black be-
fore falling off. As it advances in size
to that of a hen's egg, this blackening
becomes less apparent. After the fruit
has arrived at about the size of a hen’s
egg the epidermis becomes too hard for
ready infection. The fungus spores,
however, are washed from the epidermis
just as before. The fungus, however, in
place of causing infection, merely causes
irregular streaks over the fruit. or what
might be called tear streaks.
TREATMENT—AS soon as bloom blight
makes its appearance on the mango, it
is necessary to begin a vigorous campaign
of spraying. using the ordinary form of
Bordeaux, going against all recommen-
dations heretofore in regard to its appli-
cation. Direct the spray here against the
bloom and right into the open blossom.
Spray every third day, and continue this
until a crop of fruit is set that is vastly
heavier than the tree can bear. As soon
as a very heavy crop of fruit is set, spray-
ing may be discontinued until a large pro-
portion of the fruit has become large

enough to bend the peduncles over, and
the fruit hanging in a pendant condition.
Then spraying should be again resorted
to. An application of once in two or three
weeks will be sufﬁcient at this time.“ After
the fruit has arrived at the size of a hen’s
egg no further spraying need be done.
\VITH ERTIP OF CITRUS.
For the last six or seven years, work
has been carried forward actively on the
study of withertip of the citrus. As said
before, this disease and the mango blight
are caused probably by what is the same
species, Collctotrichmn gloeosporioidcs.
Similar to the bloom blight of the mango
we have a bloom blight of the citrus, in-
cluding grapefruit and lemons. Citrus
bloom, when attacked by this fungus,
sheds 05 in great quantities, leaving
scarcely any fruit set. As soon as the
grove owner discovers a condition of this
kind. he should give careful attention to
the blooms. If withertip fungus is pres-
ent in this stage of the citrus bloom, a
considerable number of the petals in place
of being pure white, as they should be,
or withering a brown. will have turned
a brownish red. By means of the hand
lens. one will be able to learn to distin-
guish fungus infested petals from petals
that are merely dropping and withering.
TREATMENT.——Here again, as in the
case of the bloom blight of the mango,
our recommendations are contrary to the
usual practice of. spraying, in that we
advise spraying directly into the bloom,
using Bordeaux mixture of the ordinary
strength. “While this operation will de-
stroy a quantity of the bloom. it will be
comparatively insigniﬁcant when compar-
ed with the amount that it saves. As
new blooms open constantly, the spraying
should be repeated at short intervals, prob-
ably not more than three or four days
apart. This, of course, will depend upon
the severity of the disease in the grove,
and the possibility of doing the work with
the spraying machine.
After the bloom has shed and a con-
siderable quantity of the fruit has set,
there is still considerable danger from
withertip fungus. If a large quantity of
young fruit is shed off free from the
calyx, one should regard it as a very sus-
picious condition and make careful
examination for the withertip fungus. If
the fungus occurs, the young fruit should
be sprayed as promptly and thoroughly.
as possible. From the time the fruit is
set until it reaches about the size of a
large hazel-nut it is very apt to be attack-
ed by this fungus. After the fruit has
reached the size of a large hazel nut there
appears to be little danger of its being
attacked by this fungus. From this time
until the fruit reaches the coloring stage,
it seems to enjoy comparative immunity.
During this period, when the fruit ap-
pears to enjoy immunity from fungus at-
tack, the tree itself seems to be vulnerable
to its injuries. For controlling the disease
in the tree We would not advise spraying,
but would advise pruning. Prune out all
dead and diseased wood, and do it as
thoroughly as your time and pocketbook
will permit. This pruning out should be
done preferably before the middle of July
in the summer time, and before the middle
of February in the winter time.
In the fall of the year, after the fruit
has begun to color, it is again vulnerable
to the attack of this fungus. The mark-
ing on the fruit, whether it is grapefruit
or oranges, is rather characteristic in that
it makes a large brown sunken area, be-
ginning usually with small size spots and

increasing in size. In groves where one
notices considerable dropping of fruit, this
disease should be suspected at once and
a careful examination made for it. If
the fruit is dropping from this cause,
spray wtih an ammonical solution copper
carbonate (ammonical copper carbonate).
In using this fungicide, the spray should
be directed toward the fruit as much as
possible, keeping it away from the leaves
and branches of the tree. We know from
experience that an application of fungi-
cide is pretty certain to be followed by
an attack of scale insects, since the fungi-
cide kills off the fungus which attacks
the scale insects, as well as the fungi
which attacks the fruit.
Mr. Gibbs—Did I understand you to
say that you threw a good, strong spray
upwards right into the bloom?
Prof. Rolfs—Yes, we did. But the
rains and dew carry the spores downward,
and by spraying downward the fungicides
follow the paths of the rain and dew
drops.
Mr. Skinner—I want to ask a question,
too. We are all interested in the buying
of nursery stock. We don’t want to get
any more insects than we can possibly
help, and I want to bring up a point that
has been in my mind for some time. When
the state inspector signs a certiﬁcate, say-
ing that there is no white ﬂy or other
insects in a nursery, I think we ought to
be able to place dependence on that certiﬁ-
cate I understand that last year some
nurseries got certiﬁcates saying that they
were free from white ﬂies when I knew
positively that they did have white ﬂies,
and I think we should insist that if certiﬁ-
cates are given they should be honestly
given. If the nursery that has white ﬂy
will clean their trees and promise to do
the best they can to get them out, they
should have a certiﬁcate to that effect,
but they should not have a certiﬁcate say-
ing that they are free from white ﬂies.
I think the experiment station, or who-
ever gives the certiﬁcates, should give
them honestly. I would like to make a
motion that this society, as a body and
as a society, shall request whoever is in
authority to give these certiﬁcates that
they give them strictly in accordance with
the law, and not give certiﬁcates that are
no good.
Dr. Berger—I wish to say that these
certiﬁcates were given to the best of my
knowledge, honestly and honorably. If
there were any white ﬂies I certainly did
not know it. I know that so far as I am
concerned I did not give a single certi-
ﬁcate where I had any doubt that the cer-
tiﬁcates would not be telling the truth.
Mr. Skinner—How do your certiﬁcates
read? Do they all read one way?
Dr. Berger—Yes, sir.
Mr. Skinner—That this nursery is free
from white ﬂy?
Dr. Berger—Yes, sir.
Mr. Skinner—I will not mention any
names, but I know of certiﬁcates being
given when it was a patent fact known to
everybody that the certiﬁcates were given
when they did have white ﬂies. I think
the growers should have some protection.
Mr. Bell—I move that a committee be
appointed by the president to examine in-
to this matter and report at some future
meeting the course they think this society
should take in relation to it.
Prof. Rolfs—In regard to the matter
of giving these certiﬁcates that are given
to the nurseries in Florida. The other
states in the Union require that stock shall
be certiﬁed before it can be shipped. The

state of Florida makes no provision for
the inspection of nurseries; consequently
our nurserymen are placed in the position
of not \being able to ship their nursery
stock into another state. Is Mr. Skinner
going to sit down on the nurserymen and
say they cannot ship their stock out on
account of having no inspection? The
other states, as a kind of waiver on the
delinquency of this state, have said, “We
will allow the stock to come into our state
upon the certiﬁcate of the entomologist
of the experiment station.” Dr. Berger,
or one of his assistants, has made the
inspection, has granted certiﬁcates, and
if there were any white ﬂies in there,
they did not know it. You could do more
about it if you had a state entomologist.
Mr. Skinner—Well, I know there are
certain nurseries in this state that have
the white ﬂy, but still have a certiﬁcate
saying they have not got the white ﬂy.
I think a certiﬁcate ought not to be given
saying that it is free from white ﬂy when
it really has them.
Prof. Rolfs—The state has made no
appropriation for a State Entomologist.
Dr. Richardson—There is a motion be-
fore the house, which, I think, covers the
ground fully. I do not think that Mr.
Skinner meant to insinuate that there is
anything maliciously wrong; at the same
time it is possible that there is an in-
spection that does not inspect, and if this
is so, a very great wrong is being done.
We do not want to send the white ﬂy out
of our state as the white cotton cushion
scale was sent in. We have no means
of inspecting except in the method that
has been put before you, because there
is no provision for it. Now, suppose a
proper committee be appointed to look in-
to it and settle this matter at this point
without any further discussion.
Quesion called; motion put and carried.
Mr. Bell—I move that the ﬁrst vice-
president be empowered to appoint this
committee.
Motion seconded and carried.
Dr. Berger—I would like to have the
ﬂoor for a few minutes. I would like
to ask Mr. Skinner if he ever saw any
nursery stock sent out from a nursery
with my certiﬁcate, when it had white
ﬂy?
Mr. Skinner—No, sir.
Dr. Berger—I wish to state that all
certiﬁcates were given in good faith to
cover shipments out of Florida, as there
is no law in the state of Florida compel-
ling any inspection of stock not going
out of the state. Inspection is made for
other states, and whatever the state of
Florida gets out of it, it gets under the
inspection laws of those states.
Mr. Belle—It has been the practice of
some nurserymen to defoliate everything,
and I think we should require that. In
shipping stuff through the states some-
thing may get on it. Some nurserymen
make it a practice to defoliate everything;
others do not defoliate at all.
Member—A short time ago, trees were
sent out of a certain part of the state to
another place, and it was understood that
there were white ﬂies in that section, and
when they came they were defoliated;
but when trees came from another part
of the state where there was no white ﬂy,
the foliage was on.
Mr. Taber—The ﬁrst vice-president
has announced that the following com-
mittee is appointed to report on the ques-
tion of certiﬁcates of inspection: W. C.

Richardson, chairman: H. B. Stevens and
1. D. Bell.
Prof. Rolfs—\Ve have with us the
State Entonmlogist from Georgia, Prof.
Smith. \Ve would be glad if he will give
us a short talk.
Mr. Taber———Can’t you tell us about the
operation of your law, etc.?
Prof. Smith—I am glad to tell you
about the inspection law in Georgia. In
the ﬁrst place, we have there a State
Board of Entomology, supported by the
state appropriation. and their work is laid
down in the law which created the de-
partment. Onebranch of the work is
the inspection of the nurseries in the state.
The State Entomologist, or duly author-
ized assistant, is required to visit every
nursery in the state each year and make
a careful inspection of the nursery and
surrounding conditions. and if the nurs-
ery is found apparently free from the San
Jose scale and other insects and diseases,
the nurseryman is given a certiﬁcate un-
der which he can ship stock to any part
of the state. and that certiﬁcate is usually
accepted by any entomologist in any other
state where they require a certiﬁcate.
I have been in Georgia only four years,
but know somewhat about the working
of inspection in other states. and I think
that perhaps we make a more thorough
inspection than the majority of the states.
I want you to notice this point, that
the law requires us to inspect the nurs-
eries. and if we can do so consistently,
we give a certiﬁcate saying that the stock
is apparently free from San Jose scale.
There is no entomologist in the world who
can say that a plant is absolutely free
from San Jose scale. You cannot say that
a nursery is absolutely free; but after it
has been carefully inspected by a com-
petent inspector who has had considera~
ble experience, he can tell you pretty well
whether it is infected or not, and if he
ﬁnds no sign of that pest, we feel safe
in giving the certiﬁcate.
Mr. Skinner—You spoke of the San
Jose scale. It seems to me a couple of
years ago a lady-bird was imported from
China. What has become of them?
Prof. Smith—Most of them have died
out. Of all the colonies started in sev-
eral states the one in Marshallville, Ga.,
was the most successful. In the summer
of 1903 we found that they were destroy-
ing some of the scale, but not enough
to make any appreciable decrease. Next
spring it was impossible to ﬁnd many
there, probably on account of the spray-
ing that had been given the previous win-
ter. In the summer of 1905 I sent one
of my assistants to every place in Georgia
where a colony had been established, and
also sent him to DeLand, Florida, where
we had sent some of those lady—birds,
and he found almost none whatever. The
general concensus of opinion is that the
lady—bird will probably never become ac-
climated in the United States.
I might state further. with regard to
the nursery inspection, that there is a
need. I think, in Georgia and other states
of some change in the nursery inspection
laws. It is getting to the point where
it is almost impossible for all the nurs—
eries in the state to be free from the San
Jose scale, and I feel that the time is com-
ing when the scale will get in such a
great number of the nurseries that it will
be necessary to issue a different kind of
a certiﬁcate than what we have been issu-
ing. If the nurserymen are prevented
from selling their stock by reason of ﬁnd-
ing a little of the scale in a small block,

perhaps only in a little corner, of the nurs-
ery. it will be an unjust law.
Mr. Griﬁ‘ing—I understand there is a
movement among the entomologists to get
a uniform law about inspection.
Prof. Smith—Yes, sir; the entomolo—
gists of the United States at their last
meeting advocated that, and the nursery-
men have also taken it up and tried to
get them to work together. They should
work together, with the idea of getting
some uniformity in the laws, or some one
law that Would be adopted by all the
states.
i Prof. Rolfs—Tell us how much is ap-
propriated annually by the legislature for
this entomological commission in Geor-
gia.
Prof. Smith—$10,000. Of course, on-
ly a portion of that has to be used for
nursery inspection. If we did nothing
but keep with the nurseries. we would
not need that much. Our work covers
a larger ﬁeld now. _
Mr. \Naite—I would like to ask Mr.
Rolfs in regard to this scab or scaly bark
that I have noticed in a few groves in
this section; that is, on the Gulf Coast,
some time ago. I presume Prof. Rolfs
can give you a better description of it than
I can.
Prof. Rolfs—Last year. immediately
upon the experiment station being sep-
arated from the university, Mr. Fawcett
took charge of that work on the scaly
bark and has been working upon it since
that time.
Mr. Fawcett—I was in hopes that the
subject of scaly bark would not come up,
but I will try to tell you all I can about
it. This disease became known to the
experiment station only about two years
ago. when a specimen was ﬁrst sent in to
us from this vicinity for‘our examination.
In investigating the distribution of this
disease I found it was conﬁned to a limit-
ed area including this peninsula from just
above St. Petersburg to a few miles above
Tarpon Springs.
The ﬁrst infection covers only a small
spot, and this enlarges until ﬁnally the
whole limb becomes scaly and scabby and
reminds one of the progress of leprosy.
Almost nothing is known of a remedy
for scaly bark, but we are beginning some
investigations with a view toward pre-
venting the spread of this disease.
Mr. Longley—Does it appear only on
the orange tree, or does it also attack
other citrus fruits?
Mr. F awcett—It is conﬁned almost en-
tirely to the sweet seedlings variety.
Grapefruit seems to be free. we have
begun experiments with the Bordeaux
mixture.
Mr. Skinner—I think it was from my
grove that the specimen you s ak of
came. I have experimented a little with
this disease myself and inoculated the
trees and the roots with a little bit of
sulphite of copper with beneﬁcial results.
The scaly bark is almost identical, I think,
with the “brown spot" that occurs
through this section and makes the fruit
rot. (The specimen referred to was sent
in by the Secretary and taken from Mr.
Skinner’s grove.)
Mr. Fawcett—I might say that along
in the fall about August, the fruit becomes I
covered with these spots, and there is
every indication that the fruit has be-
come infected from these scabs. The
disease is a serious one and needs to be
looked into.
Mr. Waite—I would also like to ask
if, in treating the disease called “Mela-

nose,” blue stone under the trees would
be beneﬁcial.
Prof. Rolfs—In connection with this
subject I would like to say it is what
some people call physiological disease.
That does not express anything, but it
is due to malnutrition. It is very closely
related to dieback. You can cure a tree
by spraying it with Bordeaux mixture.
Melanose and dieback do not usually oc-
cur on the same tree, although I have
seen the two diseases on one tree. It is
what you might call “citrus tree indiges-
tion.”
In the case of the dieback we made
very careful experiments to see whether
an application of blue stone to the soil
would be of advantage. we found no
advantage in treating the dieback in this
manner. We also applied it to (the leaves
and found it of no advantage. We tried
the lime on the leaves of the dieback tree
and saw no advantage. In these experi-
ments we had untreated plots that we
used as checks. In three plots that were
treated with Bordeaux mixture they at
once responded and showed beneﬁcial re-
sults. Now, I will say that, not having
made the experiment of applying blue
stone to the soil, we are a little inclined
to doubt if it would be advantageous in
treating this disease.
' Mr. Waite—In one section of our grove
last year we had a good deal of fruit af-
fected by melanose, and a gentleman liv—
ing up the river who had quite a large
grove, told me it was so badly infested
that nearly all the fruit dropped off be-
fore it was matured. and he said he used
about one or two pounds of blue stone
around the trees, and the next year very
little fruit was affected. and the second
year there was none at all. I applied
some, but did not know whether it was
the right thing to do or not.
Mr. Hoard—~I have used blue stone
as a remedy for dieback for several years.
and always with good results. Have cur-
ed small trees that were almost dead and
put them in ﬁne condition. Have also
used it on large seedling trees which were
so badly affected with dieback that nearly
all of the fruit would split and drop off
early in the fall. I commenced using it
on these large trees the year before last,
with the result that the fruit was much
improved last year; so I gave them an-
other dose last year and am using it again
'this year. In using it on small trees,
care must be taken not to use too much,
as an overdose would be fatal. Large
seedling trees will stand from three to
ﬁve pounds twice a year, broadcast.
Member—W'hat else do you do besides
that?
Mr. Hoard—Nothing at all. \Vhen-
ever I see a tree with symptoms of die-
back I get some pulverized blue stone and
apply it just as I would fertilizer. I have
used it in the liquid form and have also
put small pieces under the bark, but have
come to the conclusion that it makes very
little difference how it is applied so the
tree gets it, and have adopted the easier
method of throwing it broadcast.
Mr. Penny—I use blue stone under the
trees. I put it on the crown roots and
cover it over. I have thought possibly
that is where they get the most beneﬁt
from the Bordeaux.
Prof. Rolfs—\Vhere we applied it to
the soil there was no beneﬁt from the
Bordeaux.
Mr. Donovan—I tried the same ex-
periment last summer with blue stone in
spreading in a circle around the tree to

the outer edge of the branches. It seems
to do my trees good. They are dieback
stock, and the trees this year do not seem
to show any dieback. I didn’t do any
thing else, so I think it must be due to
that treatment. I have also sprayed with
Bordeaux and killed the dieback.
Mr. Waite—Prof. Rolfs, did I under-
stand you to say that lime applied to the
soil would not correct the conditions
there?
Prof. Rolfs—In our experiments we
wanted to ﬁnd out what element in the
Bordeaux corrected the disease, so we
applied slaked lime to the soil in the plot,
and in another plot we used lime on the
leaves to ﬁnd out whether the application
to the leaves was necessary, or whether
it was necessary to put it on the ground
where it would be taken up by the roots.
In the place where we used the lime on
the leaves or on the ground, it gave us
negative results; in other words, were
no better than our checks. But in those
cases where we used Bordeaux mixture
on the leaves we got decidedly better re-
sults. We had the lots laid off with about
thirty trees in the plot and went through
one set and then took another set. Our
conclusion was that, from the test we
made, Bordeaux mixture must be applied
to the leaves to be of advantage in curing
the dieback. Mr. Waite has spoken more
of the melanose than of the dieback, but
it is very analogous to it in its behavior.
Mr. Waite—I have suggested that you
use lime. I applied lime to the amount
of 1,000 pounds to the acre and only this
past winter, and I thought of applying it
again this summer.
Prof. Rolfs—There are a good many
things that may cause this dieback, and
you want to make sure just what is caus-
53
ing it when it makes its appearance. Top
pruning may cause it; carbonate in the
soil may cause it; or if there is too much
acid in the soil—humic acid—that may
cause it. If it is the latter, lime would
correct the conditions.
Member—Is blue stone an antidote for
humic acid?
Prof. Rolfs—I think not.
would have no effect.
Mr. Waite—I would like to know if
anyone has cured iby inserting blue stone
under the bark and kept check, so that
he could tell if it had any effect.
Mr. Cooper—I had some trees on our
place that had the dieback, and I tried
the experiment. I took every other tree
down the row and put blue stone under
the bark, and it set up a terrible “spew,”
but it straightened them right out. Last
year I applied it just as you Would fertil-
IZCI'.
Member—What quantity?
Mr. Cooper—A piece about the size
of a grain of wheat.
Member—How large were your trees?
Mr. Cooper—We tried it on trees six
inches through. I had one tree on a'little
ﬁve-acre place that certainly was a for-
lorn object, and it was astonishing how
it picked up. Last year we tried some
by casting it broadcast and with as good
results. I mean to keep the experiment
up.
Mr. Hampton—I had some experience
with this blue stone inoculation and ﬁnd
where it is used carefully it is very satis-
factory. I have taken trees and inoculat-
ed them in three different places, but I
never used more than a piece the size of
a small grain of wheat. Where you use
more it splits the tree until it looks as
thought it had been frozen.
I think it

Member—Does this add to the growth
of the tree?
Mr. Hampton—The tree shows a big,
thrifty green leaf. and I never found any
bad effects if used carefully.
Member—What is the chemical action
of the blue stone that causes the beneﬁcial
action?
Prof. Rolfs—I don’t believe that has
ever been worked by the chemist. I do
not think that we know just what the
chemical reaction is.
Mr. Hampton—For the past two or
three seasons I ﬁnd that the kumquat,
where budded on the rough lemon, espec-
ially, has the sap oozing out right at the
connection of the bud and the stock. I
would like to know the cause.
Prof. Rolfs—\Ve have not succeeded
in getting any cure or any deﬁnite in-
formation as to the cause.
Mr. Skinner—Isn’t that identical with
the same disease that is in Cuba?
Prof. Rolfs—I think not. As near as
I can tell from observation without in-
vestigation. it is not a genuine disease.
It almost invariably occurs where it is
budded on the rough lemon.
Mr. Hampton—I am of the opinion
that the stock of the rough lemon out-
grows the ‘bud, and I think it throws out
too much sap for the bud to absorb, and
it throws it out in the form of gum.
Mr. Grilling—Regarding the fungus
asked about. Prof. Rolfs discovered this
red fungus (Sphaerostible coccophila)
about ten years ago. \Ve have had it in
mind since that time, but we didn’t have
the courage to try it. In the meantime
it cost us anywhere from a few hundred
up to about four thousand dollars a year
to keep the scale under control. That
does not mean that the orchard was badly
infested; you probably wouldn’t ﬁnd one
tree in a hundred that had any scale on
it. We used the spray as a preventive
to keep it down. At the Horticultural
meeting last spring, in Jacksonville, F. P.
Henderson reported that owing to his
inability to spray he got this fungus into
his orchard and it practically cleaned up
the scale. We went to Mr. Henderson’s
orchard and found the conditions exactly
as he had reported them. You could see
that ninety per cent. of the trees had
been infested and the wood was pitted
with the marks of the scale, but you could
not ﬁnd a live scale in the orchard. \Ve
immediately went to work to introduce
the fungus in our 650 acres of peach
orchards. Although it was the last of
July, we tried to inoculate all the infest-
ed trees 'by taking a piece of limb infested
with either the red fungus (Sphaerostible
Coccophila) or the black fungus (M yrarn-
gium durii), and binding on the limbs
of the infested peach trees. Last fall
we thought that the fungus was not go-
ing to do the work, but, much to our sur-
prise, this spring the orchard is coming
out with practically no live scale showing.
It took a lot of nerve to do it, but I be-
lieved that if you have got the nerve to
keep your spraying machines out and en-
courage the natural enemy, it will help
you out.
Prof. Rolfs—Mr. Griﬁing left off the
most important part, and that is the cost
of applying the fungus.
Mr. Grifﬁng—VVe didn’t know where
to ﬁnd a supply of the fungi, so arranged
with Mr. Henderson to furnish the limbs
infested with the fungus and carry it to
the orchard in sufﬁcient quantity for ﬁve
hundred acres for $200.00. I do not
suppose it cost us to put it on the‘trees

over $250.00 or $300.00. Since then we
ﬁnd that we could get quantities of the
fungus by hunting up live oak trees that
were infested with obscure scale. You
can ﬁnd it almost anywhere if you look
carefully. You will ﬁnd where the oaks
are infested with the scale, the fungus
will be growing out over the scale. I
think the one that has done the best work
is the black one, which seems to work
equally well during either the wet or the
dry weather. I don’t think the cost of
applying the fungus will be over $1.00
per acre. Mr. Berger, please tell them
what per cent. of the scale you found had
been killed.
Prof. Berger—We estimated
thing like 99 per cent.
Mr. Grifﬁng—Prof. Smith from Geor-
gia has just been in the orchard. He
came to see what the results were, and
he might tell you.
Prof. Smith—I came from Georgia
principally for the purpose of investigat-
ing the red fungus on the scale, because
if it will do the work in Georgia, it is
of great importance to our fruit grow-
ers. I visited that orchard last Monday
and found that the scale was practically
dead, as has been reported. In 'fact, a
larger per cent. was dead than Mr. Ber-
ger has reported in the majority of the
orchard. We could not ﬁnd much red
fungus, either, at this season of the year.
Of course, I am not well enough acquaint-
' ed with the work of this fungus to ex-
plain the condition, but certainly some-
thing has killed the scale in that orchard,
and if not the fungus it is something
equally valuable. In my own personal
opinion. I think, there is very little doubt
but that the fungus is doing the work.
Mr. Griﬁing—I want to say right here,
some-
too, that when we visited the Henderson
orchard last June we didn’t ﬁnd any fun-
gus. \Ve simply found that the scale was
dead.
Mr. Rowe—Would it not be possible
to dissect some of those insects and ﬁnd
out what was working on the inside?
Prof. Rolfs—That is exactly what I
did ten years ago and presented the re-
sults of my work to this society at the
Orlando meeting, and before I got
through reading my paper I had the house
entirely to myself. I never tried it again.
The red—headed fungus has several
stages in its life history, some of which
are invisible to the unaided eye. The life
history of this fungus being unknown,
it proved a serious obstacle in its practi-
cal use as an insecticide. \V e found that
the scale was dying off without any ap-
parent cause. After learning the life his-
tory of the fungus all of this difﬁculty
disappeared. In my studies I found no
difﬁculty in getting pure cultures of this
fungus from insects that showed no signs
of disease to the unaided eye. (For a
full discussion of this fungus see Bulletin
No. 41 of the Florida Agricultural Ex-
periment Station.)
After we have discovered this peculiar-
ity of the fungus we then found that by
taking some of the diseased insects we
could readily get cultures of this fungus
from them, proving quite conclusively
that it was the cause of the death of
those particular insects. Since that time,
however, we have made considerable pro-
gress, and have added the black fungus
as an ally in killing off the San Jose
scale. The red-headed fungus likes a
moderately dry season, while the black
fungus wants, or prefers, an extremely
rainy one, such as we had last year. Con-

sequently, the black fungus ﬂourished bet—
ter last year than the red-headed. I think
it is a good plan to have both of these
friends in our peach orchard.
In this connection, I might say that
the long scale of the citrus is also severe-
ly attacked by these two fungi. In addi-
tion to these we have the white-headed
fungus which Mr. White has been using
for several years with the greatest satis-
faction to him and those people who are
watching the operation.
Mr. Hudson—“fill someone please tell
us how much time is required for apply-
ing the fungus lbefore the scale is dead?
Mr. Grifﬁng—Until last January or
February we were afraid that the experi-
ment was going to be a failure, but when
the scale came out this spring it soon dis-
appeared.
Mr. Hart—I have talked so much on
this subject that I am a little modest about
saying more. It does do me so much
good to hear Mr. Grifﬁng get up and
talk about the nerve it takes to try the
experiment he has been trying and found
successful. That very nerve I have been
preaching and urging on all my friends
for the past twenty years. I am pleased
beyond measure to know that so many
are adopting the natural and rational
method of controlling injurious insect
pests, and when Prof. G0ssard stated at
the Miami meeting that over 50 per cent.
had adopted these methods I felt like test-
ing the case and letting it go on. I be-
lieve you are on the right track, and will
do all I can to encourage it.
Mr. Skinner—How about the natural
enemy of the rust mite? Has it got any?
Mr. Hart—J have found quite a num-
ber of these and have been careful not
to drive them away by spraying. I never
sprayed for the rust mite. I am not thick-
headed enough to say that I would never
spray under any conditions, for that
would be foolish; but I would not spray
until I had tried almost everything else,
even should dire disaster threaten in some
new form.
Mr. Hampton—Let me tell you how I
treat my trees for the rust mite. I powder
the dry Bordeaux on the trees, and it
keeps my fruit nice and bright. I have
not given up spraying altogether, but ﬁhd
it injurious in many respects. I had much
rather put the dry powder on than to
spray it. I have also used the dry sul-
phur.
Mr. Hart—In my crop this year there
was but a small part of one per cent. of
rusty fruit. In fact. I did not pack a sin—
gle box during the season.
Mr. Hampton—As I understand, your
grove is in a hammock or in dark ham-
mock soil. I have found that on light,
clay soil the oranges will be more in—
clined to be rusty than on the dark, clear
soil. Now, I would like to know how
that holds good with the balance of your
experience.
Mr. Hart—I think you are right in
that. \Ne all know that by covering the
ground with mulch it will do away to
a great extent with the rust. The rust
mite does not like a direct. strong light
or reﬂected light. If you can cover the
ground in some way, you can do away
with a good portion of the rust mite.
Mr. Hollingsworth—I never see results
without looking back in an effort to locate
the cause, and I have wondered if the
climatic conditions have not had a great
deal to do with the disappearance of the
scale. I can think of nothing else to lay
it to, and I think that the radical seasons

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 57
we have had did a great deal towards
the destruction of the scale.
Mr. Griﬂing—Last year we had a very
wet, rainy winter and spring and early
summer. This year we have had identi—
cally the reverse, so I don’t see how the
dry weather can be accountable for the
disappearance of the scale.
Mr. Hudson—I have noticed in setting
out young trees, that the scale appears on
the body of the tree within about ten
months after it has been planted out. I
have used a little coal oil and ﬁnd that it
works very well. The older trees can
stand the scale better than the younger
ones. I have also noticed that the scale
takes more readin where there has been
much vegetable matter in the way of
beggar-weed, etc.
Mr. Waite—Is there any injurious ef-
fect to the orange trees by using sulphur-
ous acid as a spray for foot rot?
Prof. Rolfs—There would be no in-
jurious effects by using it in a diluted
state. The dilution is about one to ten
of sulphurous acid. The sulphurous acid
is one of the ﬁrst remedies recommended
for foot rot, and you will ﬁnd that it
does no damage to the sound wood. Sul-
phurous acid is what was recommended
ﬁrst, and by mistake some people have
used sulphuric acid. This latter will cure
the foot rot all right—so will a red hot
iron.
I would like to say in connection with
the rust mite and the red spider, that in
each of these cases I have found that
diseases attacked them as well as higher
insects. They do not exactly belong to
the insects, but to the spider mites. They
are attacked by diseases as well as higher
life, but when you attempt to inoculate
them with disease germs you will see that
it is a very diﬂicult thing. The practica-
bility of the scheme falls down when you
come to applying it. The difﬁculty is
almost unsurmountable. Dry sulphur,
or the sulphur and lime that Mr. Hamp—
ton has recommened, is a perfect remedy
for it. On my own trees I used this
calcium sulphide and had it applied merely
to the fruit. I gave the colored man
special instructions to apply it to the fruit
only. By use of a hand lens, one can
tell when the mites are migrating to the
fruit and causing it to turn them to a
rusty or golden rust. If they are present
in sufﬁcient numbers to cause it to turn
to a golden rust, the spray should be ap-
plied.
Member—How can you spray the fruit
without spraying the leaves at the same
time?
Prof. Rolfs—The citrus fruits are
nearly always on the end of the branch,
and are away from the leaves. The fruit
that is inside in the dark is not apt to
be attacked by the rust mite.

Report of Committee on Diseases, Insects, and Method
of Control.
By Ernest A. Bessey.
(Pathologist in Charge of Sub-Tropical Laboratory.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I regret that it is impossible for me
to be present in person at your meeting
in St. Petersburg, but my work compels
me to be out of the State. My report,
accordingly, will be read by the Secre-
tary and will, naturally, be somewhat
shorter than if I could be present to ex-
plain the various points. I have conﬁned
my observations to the Southern part of
the State and have asked Professor Hume
to include in his report something about
the diseases occurring in the Northern
part of the State and diseases of nursery
stock.
Probably the greatest interest in the
matter of diseases centers around the
struggle with white ﬂy. This has been
gradually spreading Ibut has not, so far
as I am informed, made any very great
jumps. According to a statement of Mr.
C. B. Thornton of Orlando, the unpre-
cedented drought the past winter and
spring has been beneﬁcial in one respect
in that it reduced the injury from this
pest. He states in a letter to me that “the
red fungus stood the dry weather and is
still active, while the yellow, while it
spread very rapidly after its ﬁrst appear-
ance early last summer, has itself been
attacked by a fungus enemy and is now
virtually exterminated. My experience
with the red fungus has been so satis-
factory that I will have no further use for
my spray-pump.”
On the other hand, the dry weather has
been favorable to the spread of the purple
and long scale, but Mr. Thornton is con-
vinced that the fungi will keep it under
control.
The exceedingly dry weather has had a
more or less harmful effect on the Man-
atee snail which requires a certain amount
of moisture for its favorable development.
Especially disastrous have been the ﬁres
which have run through the hammocks
in many of the groves in that vicinity,
since these totally exterminated this bene-
ﬁcial mollusk in the region burned over.
The orange disease known as “blight,”
or in some parts of the State as “wilt”,
has slowly continued to spread through
the State. It has now ﬁrmly taken hold
in the lower end of Merritt’s Island and is
doing great damage to the groves there.
There is nothing new in the method of
treatment that can be reported at this
time although I have started to take up
the investigation of this disease again
and hope, upon my return to the State
this summer, to do a good deal of work
upon it. In view of this, I would be very
glad to get into communication with all
orange growers who are troubled by this
disease. In a few localities I have found
the disease to attack severely not only the

orange, but 'pomelo and Tangerine, al-
though the most serious injury is done
to the orange.
This past season a peculiar disease has
been noted in several parts of the State.
It resembles in some respects foot-rot in
that there is observable diseased tissue
from which gum ﬂows, but differing from
that disease, it is found on all parts of the
tree, in many cases'being found both on
the stock and cion if the bud is rather
high, and in other cases being conﬁned to
the cion alone. Mr. Thornton reports
that he has treated some trees with sul-
phuric acid solution. also boiling water,
with apparently great improvement. I
can at present say nothing regarding the
cause of the disease for that is unknown
to me. In some cases, however, it seems
to be due possibly to unfavorable effect of
the stock on the cion, for it is far more
abundant in those trees where the cion is
larger than the stock.
Mangos and avocados suffered severely
last summer from the rotting and spotting
of fruit due to the anthracnose fungus
C ollctotrichu-m glocosporioides which has
been shown by inoculations with pure cul-
tures to be the same as the fungus caus-
ing the disease of the citrus known as
“wither-tip". The past winter has been
so dry that the disease was not nearly as
abundant as the previous winter, but yet
in many groves the blossoms were de-
stroyed by this fungus so that but few
fruits were set. This is especially true
of the avocado. In general, however, the
fungus is far less abundant than last year
and as a result a far greater number of
mangoes and avocados set than last sea-
son. It was noticed that those trees which
were sprayed with Bordeaux mixture dur-
ing blooming period set fruit far better
than those which were not so treated. In
this connection a point of great interest
was observed by me in the vicinity of
Miami regarding the effect of improper
fertilizing upon the injury from the fun-
gus. A grove of budded avocados set out
two years ago near the city of Miami was
fertilized with a formula about as follows:
Phosphoric acid . . . . . . I 5 per cent.
Ammonia . . . . . . . .3 to 4 per cent.
Potash . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 4 per cent.
As a result doubtless of the low amount
of potash in the fertilizer and of the lack
of potash in our soils, last year’s growth
did not harden up well; furthermore,
probably as a result of the excess of phos-
phoric acid, the young trees blossomed
very profusely, although they were far
too small to do so properly. The fungus
promptly attacked the blossoms (for the
trees were not sprayed) and spread
through the blossoms into the stocks of
the inﬂorescence and into the twigs, the
tissues not having been hardened up the
fungus did not stop, however, as it us-
ually does. but kept spreading down the
trees, in many cases killing them
to the ground ; in others, girdling
some of the larger limbs by running down
short spurs. I think there is no reason-
able doubt but that this excessive injury
could have been prevented had the trees
been properly fertilized. Of course the
destruction of the blossoms by the fungus
would require more than proper fertiliza-
tion to prevent, viz: spraying with Bor-
deaux mixture.
Celery suffered quite considerably
around Sanford this year. from two dis-
eases; one, a leaf spot disease caused by
the fungus Ccrcosfora apii, and the other,
black-heart. probably caused by bacteria.
Nematodes probably caused somewhat
more than the usual amount of injury to

truck-growers on account of the drought,
the affected plants showing the result of
the injury much sooner on account of
the limited water supply. Nothing fur-
ther than was said last year can be stated
now with reference to combating these
pests. It seems probable, however, that
where sub-irrigation can be used to soak
the soil full of water for a period of sev-
eral days, the trouble from nematodes can
be prevented, or very greatly reduced
for some months or years to come. . Possi-
bly on this account, the trouble due to
nematodes is less abundant around San-
ford than at Orlando where this sub-irri-
gation cannot be successfully practiced.
Report of Committee on Control of White Fly.
(F umigation.)
‘ By Dr. A. W. Merrill.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gen-tlcnwn:
The history of the use of hydrocy-
anic acid gas for insect pests covers a
period of nearly twenty-one years.
The process was discovered and
brought to its present degree of per-
fection in California where it has
steadily grown in favor until, at the
present time, thousands of tons of
potassium cyanide are used annually
for controlling scale insect pests. This
remedy has also become well estab-
lished in the orange growing sections
of New South \Nales and in South
Africa. Vv'herever it has been adopt-
ed, it has proven to be the cheapest
and most effective of the direct rem-
edies for citrus pests.
Several years ago, Prof. H. A. Gos—
sard, well known as the former exper-
iment station entomologist. undertook
some experimental fumigation work in
this State and was led to conclude that
the efﬁciency of this treatment against
the white ﬂy is such that if a fumigated
grove were segregated from all others,
one fumigation would render it so
nearly clean that it would need no ad-
ditional attention for two or three
years. Prof. Gossard predicted that
“a process that has been found so val-
uable in every other part of the world,
is certain to eventually come into favor
in Florida.”
Having in charge the white ﬁy inves-
tigation of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, the writer secured the
assistance during the past winter of
Mr. Stephen Strong, a horticultural
commissioner of Los Angeles County,
Cal.. a man of wide experience in prac-
tical dealings with citrus pests and
probably as well posted on the subject
of fumigation as any other man in that
State. Modern fumigation methods as
adapted for use with trees of all sizes.
were employed for the ﬁrst time in this
State during the past winter months

and considerable data has been obtain-
ed which shows the superiority of fum-
igation over even the most successful
spraying, both in regard to cost and
effectiveness.
It is the writer’s object to give in
this paper a concise statement regard-
ing the methods involved in the fumi-
gation of orange groves and the results
obtained thus far by the experiments
along this line, looking to the control
of the white ﬂy. Much more extensive
experimental work will be conducted
next winter with the object of testing
improvements suggested by past ex-
perience, and of reducing the necessary
cost to a minimum.
CONDITIONS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR
GOOD RESULTS.
Isolation of an infested grove is the
most favorable condition for successful
control of the 'white ﬂy by fumigation.
Next in importance as a favorable con-
dition is concerted action among the
owners of adjoining groves, in the case
of groves not sufﬁciently isolated for
independent action. Whether or not
this concerted action will be obtained
in any particular instance rests with
those interested in the success of the
orange growing industry for the prob-
lem of how to accomplish this was
solved many years ago in California.
In Florida, Orange county has already
made a beginning towards the adoption
of a systematic campaign against the
white ﬂy, having organized a Horticul-
tural Commission with powers equivalent
to those of similar commissions in Califor-
nia. The ofﬁcials having the matter in
charge, however, have not felt justi-
ﬁed in attempting active ﬁeld work on
a large scale until careful experiments
shall have determined what course can
be followed with a certainty of uniform
results. ’
The third condition which strongly
favors, if it is not absolutely necessary
for good results, is the absence of the
white ﬂy food plants other than citrus
trees. Chinaberry trees including the
variety called “umbrella” tree cause
untold injury to orange growing inter-
ests. While all of these trees do not
become infested each year owing to
various circumstances which it is unnec-
essary to mention here, it is well
known that in many. localities, espe—
cially in central and northern Florida,
adult white ﬂies produced by them
occur in myriads throughout the towns
in midsummer. Chinaberry and um-
brella trees favor the rapid dissemina-
tion of white ﬂies from centers of in-
fection, also their successful establish-
ment in uninfested localities. They
seriously interfere with the success of
fumigation as well as of all other rem-
edial measures by furnishing a favored
breeding place where the white ﬂy can
regain its usual abundance in a much
shorter time than would be the case if
it were entirely dependent upon the
citrus trees for its food supply. Of the
other food plants of the white ﬂy, cape
jessamine and privets should, like the
chinaberry and umbrella trees, be
classed as public nuisances in all or-
ange growing sections.
W HEN TO FU MIGATE.
Fumigation for the white ﬂy should
be done during December, January
and February, beginning about two
weeks after the adults of the last fall
brood have disappeared, in order that

63 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
all of the eggs deposited by these
adults may have time to hatch. It
should be remembered that the pres-
ence of adults is practically a positive
indication of the presence of unhatched
eggs. It is impracticable to attempt to
destroy the egg stage by fumigation
or, as a rule, by any other direct
means. The scale-like stages, techni-
cally known as the larval and pupal
stages, are readily destroyed when the
dosage is properly estimated.
Ordinarily, it would be undesirable
to continue fumigation after the adults
begin to emerge in considerable num-
bers in the spring. This time, of
course, varies according to locality and
weather conditions, but in general is
between the middle of February and
the ﬁrst of March.
For some not well understood rea-
son, fumigation with hydrocyanic acid
gas in bright sunlight is liable to cause
injury to the foliage even though in
the absence of bright sunlight the same
dosage might give entirely satisfactory
results. On cloudy days, it is safe to
fumigate during the middle of the day,
but on clear days the work should not
be started until between four and ﬁve
o’clock in the afternoon. Fumigation
should not be attempted in a strong
breeze particularly if the tents have
not been made gas tight or nearly so
by one of the treatments which will
be referred to hereafter. The presence
of moisture on the leaves in the form
of dew does not seem to have any del~
eterious effect upon the foliage al-
though in California it is considered
necessary to increase the dosage in
such cases to ensure effectiveness of
work against scale insects. The tents
are more difficult to handle when wet,
and it has not yet been determined
whether. everything considered, it is
desirable to continue to fumigate when
the foliage has become wet with a
heavy dew.
EQUIPMENT.
Many different styles of fumigating
outﬁts have been employed in orchard
fumigation in California since the ﬁrst
discovery ,of the process. Ordinarily
a person unfamiliar with the practices
of recent years, pictures to himself
some clumsy process of shifting bell or
dome shaped tents from tree to tree
by means of huge derricks, mounted
on wheels and provided with gafts and
an intricate system of ropes and pul-
leys. Such methods, however, have
long since become a thing of the past
and their use is remembered only as in-
teresting incidents in the early history
of the fumigating process.
Practically all modern tents for fum-
igating purposes are made in the form
of regular ﬁat octagons, and are gen-
erally made of six-ounce drill and eight-
ounce duck. A tent of this pattern is call-
ed a “sheet tent” and its size is stated
according to its diameter. In general
a sheet tent is large enough for a tree
that measures not over two-ﬁfths of
the given size. For trees up to 14 feet
in height, bell or dome shaped tents,
held open at the bottom by means
of a gas pipe hoop are sometimes used.
With small trees of uniform size, they
are easy to handle and they require
less material in their construction, but
they are not as adaptable for general
use as are sheet tents, and hence are
not as extensively used.
It is the general custom in Califor-

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 63
nia at present to use untreated tents—
that is, tents which have not been
treated with any material either by
dipping or painting for the purpose of
making the canvas more nearly gas
tight. This is not the result of such
treatments having proven unnecessa-
ry, but seems rather to be due to the
practice of fumigating by the contrac-
tor system, whereby the contractor for
a certain price per tree furnishes the
equipment and labor and the owner of the
grove supplies the chemicals. The contrac—
tor naturally prefers to use a larger
amount of the chemicals per tree rather
than to be put to the expense of treating
his tents so as to better conﬁne the gas.
A tanning solution obtained from tan-
neries and known as “oak ooze”, and
a decoction made from the prickly pear
cactus, have been used extensively in
California in years past for increasing
the tightness of the tents. Linseed oil
and ﬂexible paints have also been used.
to some extent. The subject of the de—
sirablity of treating tents is one which
needs further investigation.
Tents when not over 48 feet in di-
ameter, lare placed in position over
trees to be fumigated by means of so
called “changing poles.” Larger tents
are handled by means of uprights or
derricks. The changing poles are light
poles varying from 15 to 20 feet in
length and attached to the tip of each,
is a rope somewhat longer than the
pole itself. Uprights or derricks are of
simple construction, braced at the bot-

lightness. Uprights are made from 25
to 32 feet in length according to the
size of the trees to be covered. They
need be only within two or three feet
of the extreme height of the tree for
the uppermost branches readily bend
forward when the tent is being pulled
into place.
The material used in the generation
of hydrocyanic acid gas are Potassium
cyanide (K C N), Sulphuric acid (H-2

the potassium cyanide be 98 or 99 per
cent. pure, and that the acid show a
The pro-
portions of these materials used in gen-
erating the gas are, one part of the
cyanide, one part of acid (liquid meas-
' ure) and from 3 to 4 parts of water.
The commissary consists of a mov-
able table provided with balances for
weighing the cyanide, a large stock
pitcher for the acid, a measuring glass
graded for ﬂuid ounces, rubber gloves
for the man who measures the acid,
and a tin scoop and leather gloves for
the man who weighs the cyanide. The
generator tray is placed on top of the
commissary table while “weighing up.”
It is made with a removable upper
rack for convenience. The upper rack
contains two rows of tin cans for hold-
ing the cyanide. Directly below each
can in the lower rack or body of the
tray is a pitcher for holding the acid
for the given tree. The gas is gener-
ated in earthernware jars of a capacity
of from one and a half to three gallons
according to the size of the tree. For
large trees, two generator jars are fre-
quently used.

tion. First, the dosage should be care-
fully estimatedand a so-called “sched-
ule”‘prepared showing the location of
each tree and the amount of cyanide
which should be given in each case.
The work done by the agents of the
Bureau of Entomology during the past
season has not been completely Sum-
marized as yet, and it is therefore im-
possible at this time to present a table
of required dosage for trees of different
sizes. Before deﬁnite recommenda-
tions of this kind be made, it is desir-
able that further experiments be con-
ducted with tents treated by different
methods. A general idea of the
amount of potassium cyanide required
with an untreated tent of eight-ounce
duck, can be obtained from the follow-
ing table which includes only a few
examples selected from the many rec-
ords:

The measurements of a tent are eas-
iest made by means of a tape measure
attached to'a reel. The measurement
of the circumference is made within a
few feet of the ground. To obtain the
distance over, the end of the tape is
held in one ,hand while the reel is
thrown over the center of the tent
and the measurement made from
ground to ground. Tables will be
prepared in due course which will
show the proper dose for trees of va-
rious sizes, but with a little experience
in calculating the dosage from actual
measurement, a fumigator should be
able to estimate the amount of potas-
sium cyanide with sufﬁcient accuracy.
In each outﬁt, from two to ﬁve men
are employed according to the size of
the trees. For medium sized trees up
to 22 feet in height, four men can
work to advantage. This crew can
handle thirty tents every forty-ﬁve
minutes, and can treat about 400 trees
in a night’s work of ten hours. For
trees from 23 to 35 feet in height, der-
ricks or uprights are used, and a crew
of ﬁve men are needed to handle about
12 or 15 tents every forty-ﬁve minutes.
The changing of the bell or hoop
tents from one tree to another is a sim'
ple procedure, requiring but a few sec-
onds’ time for two men. Sheet tents
are placed in position over the trees
up to about 22 feet in height by means
of the changing poles described, and
require from less than a minute up to
a minute and a half for each tree.
Trees from twenty—two to thirty-ﬁve
feet in height can easily be covered by
means of the derricks or uprights. The
uprights being placed in position, the
tent is raised by means of the pulley
attachments, the uprights are then
pulled forward by means of a rope at-
tached to the top, and as they fall the
tent is pulled over the tree. The cov-
ering of the largest trees can be ac-
complished in between one and two
minutes. It is readily seen even from
this brief description, that the mechan-
ical difficulties involved in this process
are insigniﬁcant when compared with
the labor. required for spraying and in
addition, it lacks the many disagreea-
ble features which always accompany
the application of liquid insecticides.

fumigators weigh the potassium cyan-
ide and measure the acid, arranging
the dosage for each tree in the racks
of the tray, the cyanide in the upper
rack directly above the pitcher of acid
for any given tree. One man usually
measures the acid and generates the
gas and is known as the “generator.”
From two to three men look after the
changing of the tents and are known as
“tent pullers.” Another man known
as the “tent kicker” follows the tent
pullers and pulls or kicks in the tent
at the bottom and also raises the edge
of the tent while the generator passes
in with the can of potassium cyanide,
pitcher of acid and the generating jar
containing the required amount of wa-
ter. The jar is placed near the base of
the tree and the acid poured in follow-
ed by the cyanide, after which the gen-
erator passes out quickly and the edge
of the tent is dropped into position.
The commissary is usually located
where it will be most conveniently sit-
uated for the entire night’s work. Af-
ter shifting the tents and generating
the gas, all hands return to the com-
missary and the materials weighed up
for the next change of tents. This
procedure is varied somewhat accord-
ing to the number of tents operated
and the individual practices of the fum-
igators.
POISONOUS NATURE or THE GAS.
The necessity of observing simple
precautions in fumigating w'it‘h hydro-
cyanic acid gas is so well known that,
although this is one of the most dan-
gerous poisons, there is no record of
a fatal accident resulting from its use
as an insecticide. After removing the
tent the contents of the jar should be
emptied between the rows of trees and
covered with earth. When emptied close
to the trees the roots are likely to be in-
jured, especially when'the soil is very
porous. Great care should be taken to
avoid pulling the tents over any of this
material even after it is supposed to be
carefully buried.
EXPENSE OF FUMIGATION.
Wherever the surrounding condi-
tions are such that a 'grove'would re-
ceive full beneﬁt from the almost com-
plete extermination of the insects, the
cost of fumigation would ordinarily be
about the same as three sprayings, but
its eﬂiciency in checking the white ﬂy
would be equal to at least six sprayings
at the rate of three per year. At the
outside, the cost, making ample allow-
ance for wear and tear of tents, should
not exceed that of four sprayings.
Even on this basis, the cost of fumi-
gation in a period of two years would
not exceed two thirds the cost of the
best of spraying while the results ob—
tained would be far more satisfactory
and uniform. These estimates are
based on the cost of fumigation with
untreated canvas. With canvas made
approximately gas tight, the cost
would doubtless be reduced fully lone-
third.
Fumigating tents are expensive as a
ﬁrst outlay; those large enough to
cover a thirty foot tree costing about
$90.00 and to cover a ﬁfteen foot
tree, about $20.00. It is not advisable
as a rule for an orange grower to in-
vest several hundred dollars in fum-
igating tents for his exclusive use, al-
though many with extensive groves
would doubtless prefer to do this. In
some citrus fruit growing countries
where fumigation is practiced against
scale insects, several growers form a

club and share the cost of the fumigat-
ing outﬁt, which is kept at the disposal
of each of the members in turn. Such
a plan might be followed in many cases
in this State. A few orange growers
with a crop worth annually $10,000 or
$15,000 would not be put to an unrea-
sonable expense in the joint ownership
of an outﬁt costing $1,000. Fumigation
by the contractor system as it is now
done to a great extent in California,
may also come into use. The plan
which can be most strongly recom-
mended is for each orange growing
county in the State, when the proper
time arrives, to maintain an outﬁt large
enough for the needs of the orange
growers within its limits, and to pro-
vide for fumigation under the direction
of a County Horticultural Commission.
The average annual loss due to the
white ﬂy in the infested groves in
Florida may be conservatively estimat-
ed at 33 per cent. Taking into consid—
eration the reduction in number and
size of the fruit and the indirect loss
through the necessity for washing the
fruit and subsequent deterioration in
its shipping quality. the total loss
for the state is not less than three hun-
dred thousand dollars per annum. Ac-
cording to the Eighth Biennial Report
of the Florida Commissioner of Agri-
culture. there were in 1903, slightly
over three million citrus trees in the
State. more than one-half of which
were non-bearing. The foregoing esti-
mate of -a loss of $300,000 per annum
is based upon these ﬁgures, placing
the number of infested groves at one-
eighth of the entire number. Accord-
ing to this estimate, there are at pres-
ent, omitting nursery stock, about four
hundred thousand infested trees in the
State of Florida. An avreage of ﬁfty
cents per tree would be an ample al-
lowance for fumigating the infested
citrus trees in the State. This would
give us $200,000 as the estimated ex-
pense of fumigating these trees. The
work of Prof. Gossard and the work of
the Bureau of Entimology during the past
few months furnishes evidence that no
further loss would be occasioned by the
white ﬂy for two or three years; hence the
sum of $200,000 invested by the citrus
growers of Florida who suffer losses
from the white ﬂy, would result in the
prevention of a loss of at least $600,-
000. This point is made not as a prac-
tical recommendation, for the adoption
of the practice of fumigation should
he gradual, but simply to provide a
basis for the estimation of the desir-
ability of using this treatment in indi-
vidual groves.
While it is generally considered that
in Florida the natural enemies of the
purple scale are so effective that any
direct treatment is unnecesarry or un-
proﬁtable. citrus groves are frequently
met with where this scale is a serious
pest, and where the losses prevented
by fumigation would amount to sever-
al times its cost. In conclusion, the
writer would express his conviction
that in the case of the majority of the
groves, the destruction of the purple
scale and other true scale insects would
represent an increase in proﬁt which
would, by itself, offset the actual cost
of fumigation, leaving as clear gain the
beneﬁts derived from reducing the
white ﬂy to a negligible quantity.

Control of White Fly by Stamping Out.
By H. B. Stevens.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The loss of fruit by thieving had be-
come so great, that the growers at De-
Land about decided to organize a fruit
growers’ society for self protection, and to
help in other ways, that such an organ-
ization could; but like most such move-
ments, it was only talk until the white
ﬂy was discovered on some trees in the
very center of the town .
That called for prompt action and there
was no trouble found in getting the grow-
ers together and organizing the “St.
Johns River Fruit Growers’ Association.”
One of the ﬁrst things they did, was
to appoint a committee to devise means
for combating the white ﬂy; that com—
mittee ﬁrst tried spraying with pure ker-
osine, with a result that they destroyed
about 90 per cent. at one application, but
the diﬂiculty was to reach the other IO
per cent. Soon after, the cold of Decem—
ber come, and it took off so many leaves
from many of the orange trees in the part,
that the committee thought was the infect-
ed district, that they decided the best plan
would be, to go into the matter thoroughly
and defoliate all infected trees or shrubs.
The matter was brought up before the
society and they voted an assessment to
meet the expense, and instructed the com-
mitttee to go ahead.
The way they went about it was this.
ﬁrst, they examined the trees and shrubs
that they thought might be infected, and
if they found any of the larva or pupa of
the ﬂy, then they took a few of the infect-
ed leaves and with a glass showed them to
the owner, and asked his or her permis-
sion to remove the plants, or defoliate, as
the case might be. If the party objected,
then they let him alone, and went to the
next place, knowing well, that after he
had time to think the matter over, and to
understand what an injury the pest would
be, and how we were offering to remove
it without any expense to him, he would
consent later, and so it proved, in every
case but one, and in that case the party
had to be persuaded by other means than
reason.
It was soon found, that wherever
there were Cape Jessamine bushes there
was apt to be white ﬂy and in following
up the ﬂy they went over an area of four
square miles, and defoliated every infect-
ed orange tree or jessamine bush and also
privet hedges.
Had we anticipated in the beginning,
that we should have to go over anything
like so great a territory, we might have
shrunk from the task, but after we began
we did not turn back.
After going over every place we found
anything on, around De-Land, we turned
our attention to near-by places, and soon
found that the ﬂy had gotten quite a
strong hold at DeLeon.
We called the attention of Mr. Mc-
Bride to what the ﬂies were doing in his
grove at DeLeon Springs, and he at
once put a force at work defoliating a
ten acre grove, and he says he got it done
for $135. Adjoining him, was a grove
equally effected, that we could not prevail
on the owner to do as Mr. McBride had

68 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
done, but they consented to our doing it
for them.
Now any grower who has ever spray-
ed for white ﬂy, knows that he has got
off easy, if he has not spent more than
$35 on ten acres, and still he knows
that he has not killed them all and that
enough are left to keep him working the
next season. If he could only be sure
that he had stamped them out, he would
not mind that expense.
we have not found a live ﬂy, so far,
this spring, in or around DeLand, and
all it cost us, was $158.80 to do the
work.
We consider it a good investment, even
if the ﬂies get in next year, for all our
groves are free this year anyway.
From the experience we have had I
feel sure the ﬂy can be stamped out of
a'most any section of the State, if the
growers will only go at it in earnest, and
be willing to lose all the leaves, where-
ever there are any signs of the ﬂy found.
By doing this work as late as possible,
in the spring before the ﬂy begins its
general hatch, or the trees to bloom, the
work can be done with the least expense,
and it need not diminish the crop any
more than the ﬂy itself would do, if as
much.
I wish to say right here that our com-
mittee was greatly helped by two visits
from Prof. Rolfs, he encouraged us to
believe that we could make a success of
it, and he helped to make the skeptical
growers willing to allow us to take the
leaves from their trees.
Our society was also greatly helped
by a talk he gave us on insects, and dis-
eases, and I am sure that if the growers
in the different localities of the State,
would organize as we have done, and then
when a difﬁcult problem comes up, invite
Prof. Rolfs to pay them a visit, they
would soon ﬁnd that his talks would save
them in the expense of working their
groves, much more than the society would
cost them. So far our society has cost
none of its members more than seven dol~
lars apiece.
One lesson we have learned at DeLand,
that is if you fear the white ﬂy watch
your jessamine bushes as the ﬂy will ap-
pear on the Cape Jessamine ﬁrst and if
you want to delay their coming destroy
all such bushes in your neighborhood.
The ﬂy will spread faster from one
jessamine bush to another than from one
orange tree to another.
In many cases we found larva on Jessa-
mine bushes and no sign at all on orange
trees near 'by, but if there were many of
the larva on the jessamine bushes we de-
foliated the orange trees as a precaution.
To overcome thieving, we allow any
member of the society who wishes to do
so, to post a notice of $2 5 reward offered
by the society for evidence that will
convict any one, other than a child, for
stealing fruit, and the society does the
prosecuting, which makes it easier to pun-
ish a thief than if an individual had it to
do.

Control of the White Fly by Natural Means.
Dr. E. W. Berger.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
A study and discussion of the different
phases of this subject are exceedingly in-
teresting and important whether consid-
ered from- a purely practical or from a
purely scientiﬁc standpoint. \Vhen con-
sidered from a Purely practical standﬂoint
it involves mainly the knowledge neces-
sary for successful insect control. This,
however, includes a knowledge of the life
history, habits, and conditions of exist-
ence of the insect pests to be controlled,
of the fungus or insect parasites or other
enemies that feed upon the pest, and the
plants or animals that we desire to protect
or rid of their injurious insects or other
pests. And last but not least, a knowl-
edge of the methods for propagating and
distributing the natural enemies of the
insect pest that we desire to control is
absolutely necessary. Thus, to take the
ease of the citrus whiteﬂy as an illustra-
tion, I ﬁnd that I cannot arrin at a
rational understanding of this “whiteﬂy
problem” without a comprehensive under-
standing of the life history, habits and
conditions of existence of the whiteﬂy, of
its fungus enemies and of the citrus tree
itself. The methods for distributing, or
propagating and distributing, the fungi
must be solved in reference to the case at
hand, guided, of course, by previous ex-
perience and the established principles of
the subject.
When considered from a purely scien-
tiﬁc point of view this subject involves
phases of the mutual dependence and re-
lationship of living things as a whole.
Aside from the many interesting facts of
this relationship the question arises, how
came this relation-ship about P+this de-
struction of one kind of living thing by
another kind.
The truth of the matter is that nearly
all animals are a “pest” in so far as some
other animals or plants are concerned.
Animals that live on decaying animal or
vegetable matter are the only exceptions to
this among animals. Plants are thus
about the only living things that live with-
out breaking the commandment, Thou
shalt not kill, if you will allow me to
temporarily extend this mandate to all
living things. But even among higher
plants we have those that kill other plants
and animals or at least live upon their
substance. Thus the dodder in part lives
upon and ﬁnally kills other plants; the in-
dian pipe, beech drops and the green mis-
tletoe feed upon the sap of other plants.
A few of the higher plants are also cami-
vorous, feeding in part at least upon in-
sects and the like, which they capture.
Thus the drosera, or sundew, the Venus
ﬂytrap, the pitcher plant and bladderwort
belong to this group. But the chief des-
troyers in the plant kingdom are the bac-
teria and fungi which attack both living
plants and animals as well as dead ones, .
and many of these are to be feared as a
scourge, only too frequently leaving com-
plete desolation in their path. To this
class belong the cholera germ, consump-
tion, typhoid, diphtheria and others, of
which there are varieties attacking ani-
mals as well as man. Among such pests

of plants can be mentioned the several
blights of vegetables and fruit trees and
some root diseases, all caused by bacteria
or fungi. In fact, nearly all plant dis—
eases not caused by insects or other ani-
mals belong to this class.
A printed list would be a long one.
But, were plants and animals to vote on
the greatest pest of all living things, no
doubt man himself would receive a un-
animous vote as the most wanton des-
troyer. And the object of all this so-
called ﬁghting of pests, in sum and sub-
stance, is but to make for man, that larger
parasite, a little easier living, a little purer
atmosphere to breathe, and perhaps add a
span or two, to his human existence.
Brieﬂy stated, the present relative signiﬁ-
cance and abundance of each animal and
plant group is the result of a struggle
to make a living. In this struggle differ-
ent groups began to prey upon other
groups and the whole kingdom of living
things (plants and animals) has become
in a. manner somewhat delicately balanced
in regard to relative numbers.
NATURE BALANCED AND UNBALANCED.
But nature occasionally gets a little out
of balance, so to speak. Either some plant
or animal group gets out of its place and
begins to feed upon some other plant or
animal group not normally its food, or
it increases abnormally either in propor-
tion to its food or out of proportion with
its natural enemies. In either case, it be—
comes a pest proper, in the sense that we
ordinarily use the term. Our so-called
ﬁghting of pests consists also in nothing
more than in an endeavor to restore the
equilibrium in nature or in overbalancing
the same in favor of the crop that we wish
to harvest. To accomplish this we may
use artiﬁcial means for combating the
pest, such as spraying, poisoning, fumi-
gating, etc., or we may artiﬁcially spread,
or propagate and spread, some known
enemy of the pest that we desire to con-
trol, or in other words, propagate a pest
of the pest.
As already stated, nature is generally
quite balanced in the relative proportion of
each kind of living thing. It is only when
any one of these ﬁnds a great abundance
of food, or some calamity keeps its ene-
mies in check, or it is transplanted into
some other country or district where its
enemies have not followed, that it can in-
crease abnormally. I refer, of course in
particular, to plants and animals ordinari-
ly known as pests. Thus if we plant an or-
ange grove, we bring into existence an
enormous amount of food for orange in-
sects, with the result that the latter may
increase enormously, much more rapidly,
for a time at least, than their enemies. If
left alone, the natural enemies of some of
these would (in fact have done so), very
likely at sometime strike a balance and
control, if they did not exterminate, the
same.
NATURAL ENEMIES OF SCALE INSECTS IN
FLORIDA.
However, we do not ordinarily care to
wait for nature to strike this balance, as
it might necessitate replanting our grove
for a life-time, and we either try to keep
the insects off by some artiﬁcial means. or
we try to discover their enemies and un-
dertake to propagate them artiﬁcially, or
in some manner encourage their increase.
In the case of several of the scale insects
of trees, in Florida, the fungus parasites
of these have become very efﬁcient when-
ever the same were not destroyed by ex-
tensive spraying. or whenever the grower

undertook to spread and encourage the
same.
The several fungi parasitic upon scale
insects in Florida are the Red-headed
Scale Fungus (Sphaerostilbe coccophila),
the Gray-headed Scale Fungus (Ophi-
0nectra coccicola), and the Black Scale
Fungus (M yria-ngium durii).
Several insect friends have also been ac—
tive in keeping the scales of orange trees
in check. Among these insect friends are
several species of lady~bugs (beetles), the
larvae of lace~winged ﬂies (Chrysopidae),
the larvae of the Hemerdbians (Hemero-
biidae), related to the lace-winged ﬂies,
and perhaps several ﬂy-like parasites be-
longing to the Hymenoptera. The efﬁ-
ciency of all these fungoid and insect
friends is so great that many citrus grow-
ers as well as some others have learned to
depend upon them altogether.
FUNGOUS ENEMIES OF SAN JOSE SCALE
IN FLORIDA.
The remarkable mortality among the
San Jose Scale some ten years ago near
DeFuniak was discovered by Professor P.
H. Rolfs (Bull. 41), to be due to the red-
headed scale fungus, already mentioned.
About two years ago Mr. F. P. Hender-
son, of Arno, Florida, introduced some
of this fungus into his peach orchard, and
later discovered that the scale had been
killed to such an extent as to amount to
its control, if not its eradication. Based
upon this extraordinary success in his own
orchard, Mr. Henderson succeeded in con-
vincing the Gainesville Orchard Company
and the Griﬂing Bros. Company to intro—
duce this fungus into the peach orchard
of the former near Gainesville, and into
the ﬁve-hundred-acre orchard of the lat-
ter at Komoko. Mr. Henderson collected
the fungus necessary for this work in
great part from oak trees, upon
which it frequently occurs in great abun-
dance, growing upon the obscure scale
(Aspidiotus obscurus). judging from in-
spections made last February in these or-
chards by Prof. H. S. Fawcett and the
writer, 95 per cent. to 99 per cent. of the
scale was dead at the time of inspection.
The black scale fungus (Myriangium
durii) has also been instrumental in re-
duoing the amount of scale in these or-
chards, and Mr. Henderson has stated, if
I recall rightly, that he ﬁnds more of this
black fungus in his orchard a-t Arno than
of the red. \Vhich one of the two fungi in
question has been the most ei‘Ieotive in
these orchards We have not at present
been able to decide.
OTHER ATTEMPTS AT CONTROL BY
NATURAL ENEMIES.
Not a few successful and unsuccessful
attempts have been made along this line
with other insects. The most notable of
these has been the attempt to control the
increase of the chinchbug, in several of
the States by means of a fungus disease of
this insect. The introduction of the Aus-
tralian lady-bug to control the cottony
cushion scale, orginally introduced into
California, is too well known to need any-
thing more than mere mention. The
former has not been a complete success,
and I believe has been generally aban~
doned. while the latter appears to have
been an unqualiﬁed success. The failure
of the former is due to the general lack
of favorable moisture conditions neces—
sary for the rapid development of this
fungus at the time when the chinchbug is
most destructive. Whenever the condi-
tions of moisture we're favorable. the

fungus appears to have been abundantly
successful in checking the chinoh bug.
The fact that past efforts at obtaining
an enemy from China of the imported
San Jose Scale have not been successful
does not indicate that this will not event—
ually be accomplished. Efforts are being
made to ﬁnd and import the natural ene-
mies of the gypsy moth and the brown-
tail moth into Massachusetts from Eu-
rope. Efforts are also at present being
made to introduce the parasites of the
purple scale of citrus into Italy where this
scale appears to be on the increase. The
ofﬁcers of the Pasteur Institute are un-
dertaking the introduction of an American
robber ﬂy into Algeria for the purpose of
reducing the numbers of a certain taba-
nid (a member of the horseﬁy tribe)
known to be instrumental in spreading a
certain disease of the dromedary.
While Americans have not been idle in
the matter of propagating fungus and in-
sect parasites of insect pests, on the other
hand some very interesting work goes to
the credit of foreigners. I have already
referred to the presence of the purple scale
of citrus in Italy and the effort to obtain
a parasite of the same from Florida. It
is now nearly a year that I prepared (at
the request of Dr. L. 0. Howard) 9. box
of citrus leaves and twigs heavily infest-
ed with this scale to be shipped to Dr. Ber-
lese of Italy for this purpose. I have also
previously referred to the efforts of the
Pasteur Institute in behalf of the drome-
dary in Algeria. I shall next brieﬂy re-
view a few more instances of like nature
and interest.
Experiments have been made by Ger-
man and French investigators to destroy
the grubs of cockchafers by means of a
fungus frequently found parasitic upon
these. An effort has been made in France
(but only partially successful) to control
a certain turnip weevil by infecting the soil
with a parasitic fungus in order to destroy
the grubs. In South-west Africa grasshop-
pers have been in part controlled by means
of a species of mucor (Mucor Iocustici-
da), a relative of the gray bread mold.
One of the most successful as well as
important efforts in this line relates to
the destruction of ﬁeld mice in Thessaly
by the use of the Bacillus typht' mun'um,
or in plain English the bacillus of mouse
typhoid. This germ is distributed (1903)
on small pieces of bread or other culture
media used for growing fungi and bac-
teria in the laboratory by several of the
states of Germany and Austria. It is not
known to be injurious to man or domestic
animals. A disease—producing microbe of
rats has also been discovered by a F rench-
man.
In 1906 six disease-producing bacteria
were cultivated and recommended by the
state laboratories of Russia. These were
recommended for the destruction of the
following animals: House-mouse, rats,
marmots, wood-mouse, ﬁeld-mouse, ear-
less-marmot, and the Norway rat.
TI-IE WHITEFLY AND ITS FUNGUS ENEMIES.
With this fragmentary review before
us, I desire next to take up in some detail
the work done in Florida on methods of
distributing the several fungi, parasitic
upon the whiteﬁy. The remarkable in-
crease of the whiteﬁy is perhaps best ex—
plained by the probable fact that this in-
sect is a foreign importation with but a
few of its natural enemies, the fungi,
coming along with it. The great in-
crease of this insect in newly infested sec-
tions 'of the state can also be explained in
this way: The fungi do not at once fol-
low the ﬂy to these newly infested sec—

tions. The generally persistent presence
of the fungi parasitic upon the whiteﬂy
in whitefly infested groves after they have
once been introduced, and the thorough-
ness with which they do their work, when
once well under headway, places these
fungi among the most remarkably efﬁcient
of fungus parasites. These fungi came
unbidden to begin their good work, and
not a few growers have learned to spread
them from tree to tree and from grove to
grove, and are depending altogether upon
them to keep the ﬂy in check. The num-
ber of the fungi parasitic upon the white-
ﬁy is generally given as three, although
a fourth one. the red headed scale fungus
already mentioned, occasionally develops
upon the whiteﬂy larvae; but the number
it destroys, so far as observed, is insigniﬁ-
cant. These three fungi are the Red, the
Yellow and the Brown. The red and
the brown are pretty generally distributed
throughout the whiteﬂy infested groves
of western Florida from Fort Myers to
Lake City, and as far east as Orlando.
The red fungus has been known for about
ﬁfteen years, and the brown for about
eleven. I desire to emphasize that this
red fungus of the whiteﬂy is not the
same as the red-headed scale fungus al-
ready mentioned several times. The yel—
low fungus was ﬁrst recognized as such
by Prof. P. H. Rolfs last September on
specimens sent in from “7 inter Park,
Florida. At this writing the yellow fun-
gus appears to be limited to Eastern
Florida, and is found in the groves at
Orlando, \Vinter Park. Oviedo, and
Mims. The scientiﬁc name of the red
fungus is Aschersonia aleyrodes, Web, of
the yellow Archersonia ﬂavo-citrina, P.
Henn. The fruiting stage of the brown
not being known, this fungus has received
no deﬁnite name. It is this so-called
Brown fungus, furthermore, for which
some evidence exists that it represents two
fungi. Professor H. S. Fawcett, of the
Florida Agricultural Experiment Station
has several times observed a form of this
fungus that he thought might be the fruit-
ing stage and even succeeded in getting
artiﬁcial cultures from which he again
succeeded in infecting whiteﬂy larvae.
This fungus, however, appeared to be a
species of Verticillium and somewhat dif-
ferent in appearance from that of the
Brown as it ordinarily appears. Recently
a similar condition, but not fruiting, was
observed by him on some specimens sent
in by the writer from Palmetto, Fla.
These latter specimens presented two
fomis of Brown on the same leaf, thus
indicating very strongly the presence of
two fungi, each working on the larvae of
the whiteﬂy. Further observations must
detemiiine whether these different appear-
ing fungi are different forms of the same
fungus or distinct species and also their
relative efficiency.
A UNIQUE PHENOM ENON.
The phenomenon of these several fungi
parasitic upon the larvae and pupae of the
whiteﬂy in Florida is unique in several
ways: (I.) The fact that there are at
least three of the fungi practically lim—
ited to a single food supply (the larvae
and pupae of the whiteﬂy) is surely re-
markable; (2.) The abundance of infect-
ing material generally at hand in infected
groves practically ready to be used for
starting the fungi in other groves, to-
gether with (3.) The relative ease with
which this can be applied in infecting
other whiteﬁy-infested groves are facts of
great importance to the man in charge of
the grove; (4.) The favorable climatic

conditions generally existing during a
good part of the year in Florida is not
the least of these.
In the majority of instances where nat-
ural enemies of an insect pest were em-
ployed for its control the material either
had to be'imported or cultivated at some
laboratory and distributed from there.
Again, since it could not well be foretold
when an outbreak of the pest would occur,
it became necessary to keep a supply con-
tinually under cultivation. In the in-
stance of the whiteﬂy the grower need not
fear any sudden outbreak of the pest. He
knows beforehand just about what he may
expect and what the situation is. Nei-
ther does he have to depend upon the
Station for a supply of fungus. I shall
add, however, that we do expect to cultii-
vate these fungi at the Experiment Sta-
tion, and we expect to leave no stone un-
turned until we are able to do so. That our
Professor H. S. Fawcett has made Some
progress along this line will be evident
from some of the lantern slides which I
will show later in the evening. I must
frankly add. however, that our ﬁrst effort
along this line on a large scale was not a
success. But, unless some unforeseen and
unsurmountable difficulties are encoun-
tered we hope to succeed.
DIFFICULTIES.
I have one regret, namely, that the freeze
of last December, together with the pro-
longed drought of the past six or seven
months. has so reduced the amount of
the fungi that it will be diﬂicult to obtain
any large quantities for some time this
season. I hope, however, that by the
middle of this summer a new crop will
have started. The frost reduced the
amount of the fungi by causing the leaves
to drop from the trees, while the drought
has caused it, as well as the leaves, to curl
and large quantities have been loosened
from the leaves and dropped to the
ground.
Another factor which may possibly in-
terfere somewhat with the efﬁciency of the
Yellow Fungus is the discovery of a fun-
gus (a species of Cladosporium) that lives
upon the yellow. This has been observed
by Dr. A. W. Morrill at Orlando and by
myself at Mims (near Titusville) and
Winter Park. When I ﬁrst observed it
at Mims last December it was on some
trees that had been sprayed and I then
lightly passed it over. thinking that the
yellow fungus having been injured or
killed by the spray this other fungus came
on as a saprophyte. Dr. Morrill observed
it more carefully at Orlando and consid-
ers it a parasite of the yellow fungus. My
observations lead me to believe that this
second fungus comes onto the pustules of
the yellow fungus later in the season after
the pustules of the latter have matured
and have perhaps undergone some degen-
erative changes. Again, from the fact
that this second fungus occurs in three- of
the strongholds of the yellow fungus, al-
ready mentioned, I cannot help but feel
that its presence is of no great signiﬁcance
so far as the efﬁciency of the Yellow
Aschersonia is concerned. If it were a se-
rious pest of the yellow fungus I believe
that the latter would have been seriously
retarded in one or the other of the four
places mentioned where the yellow fun-
gus has been very effective. Besides, I
do not believe it probable that this second
fungus could ‘have infested the yellow
fungus in all four of the localities men-
tioned at one time and I therefore infer
that the same has been present for per-
haps several years without seriously re-

tarding the usefulness of the yellow fun-
gus. Dr. Morrill observes (circular to the
Press) that the Red Aschersonia is rarely
attacked by the Cladosporium.
Dr. Morrill has recently called my at-
tention to another fungus in the Man-atee
country which he believes may be a super-
parasite of the brown. This fungus which
occasionally overruns the brown much re-
sepibles a certain stage of the black scale
~fungus,Myrang1'um duryii, but a com-
parative examination of these two by
Professor F awcett has so far failed to
verify the possibility of their indentity.
Personally, I believe in regard to this fun-
gus as I do in regard to the Cladosporium
overrunning the yellow fungus previously
considered, that it attacks the brown fun-
gus only after the latter has become weak-
ened from old age or other causes such as
drought, etc. To sum up, it appears that
we have in these two possible super-par-
asites a new issue for investigation.
CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR THE FUNGI.
Nearly all fungi thrive best in the pres-
ence of an abundance of moisture, es-
pecially in a moist atmosphere. The
past year has given me abundant evidence
that the fungi parasitic on the larvae and
pupae of the whiteﬂy spread and increase
but little during cool or dry weather.
This fact limits the time for their intro-
duction into whiteﬂy infested trees and
groves to the rainy season of the year or
to the months of June, July, August and
parts of May and September. These are
the months during which success is most
assured, but other periods of rain and
warmth will be favorable. The moisture
conditions may also be favorably supple-
mented by permitting plenty of vegeta-
tion in the nature of cover crops, wind-
breaks, etc., to grow at the proper season.
Irrigation or sprinkling, where the outﬁt
is at hand, will help in creating and con-
serving a moist atmosphere in a grove.
INTRODUCING THE RED AND THE YELLOW
ASCHERSONIAS.
The chief drawback to introducing the
fungi has been the supposed difﬁculty of
starting (“planting”) them in whiteﬂy-
infested trees. The matter appears to be
much more simple than was heretofore
supposed. At Lake City the writer suc-
ceeded (June 20 and August 8th, 1906)
in introducing the Red Aschersonia into
four out of ﬁve trees by pinning leaves,
with an abundance of fungus pustules
upon them, to the leaves of the trees. In
two instances the fungus started in an-
other part of the tree some distance from
the pinned leaves, but as no other infected
trees could be found within one-half mile
of these, it is considered safe to assume
that the fungus started from the infected
leaves placed there. In two of the success~
ful instances the leaves with the fungus
pustules upon them were dry and had
been picked about a month before being
pinned into the trees, showing that the
spores of the fungus retained their vitality
for at least a month and no doubt longer.
It was also found that the fungus had
started in three different trees at Lees-
.burg, into which Judge _I. B. Gains had
pinned some leaves. No Red Ascherson-
ia had hitherto been observed at Leesburg.
Since writing the ﬁrst part of this para-
graph. the writer has found the fungus
started in each of thirty-seven trees into
which he had pinned leaves of the Red
Aschersonia six weeks previously (August
I 5th) at Leesburg. In all, forty-two trees
had been treated in this manner. but ﬁve
of them were not examined for lack of

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
time. In many of these trees the fungus
had made good headway, and in one in-
stance Judge Gaines reported that it had
started at the end of two weeks from the
time of infection. W. H. Maxwell of
Titusville, also reports that he has ob-
served the Yellow Aschersonia to start
in two weeks after “planting” (pinning
leaves) the same in trees infested with
whiteﬂy.
The writer has also succeeded in start-
ing the Red Aschersonia by spraying a
mixture of spores and water on the under
surfaces of the leaves in trees infested
with whiteﬂy. This method of applica-
tion was successful in starting an infec—
tion in two out of three citrus trees, spray-
ed at Lake City (July 10, 1906). In each
case (leaves pinned or spores sprayed)
the fungus was observed to have started in
three to four weeks from the time of
application of the spores or leaves. Eight
trees were also sprayed at Leesburg at
the same time (August 15th) that the
fungus was started there by pinning on
leaves, and examination six weeks later,
showed that the fungus had started in
each tree.
These experiments are a complete dem-
onstration that this fungus can readily be
started either by pinning on leaves or by
spraying on spores. there being only one
failure in ﬁfty-two trials made during the
months of June, July and August, 1906.
Hitherto, planting into a grove small
trees with fungus—infested whiteﬂy larvae
upon them has been considered the only
sure way of introducing it. This method
is good and sure, where the trees_can be
kept from dropping their leaves, but is
rather impracticable on a large scale. The
infected trees should be planted so that
their branches and leaves extend among
.sen the injury.
the leaves of the tree to be infected. If
necessary, the infected trees may be plant-
ed in tubs and raised on platforms or oth-
erwise elevated.
One serious objection is raised in re-
gard to the efﬁcacy of the fungus, namely,
that when it has practically killed off the
whitefly and the ﬂy starts to infest the
grove anew. it takes the fungus so long to
start that the ﬂy has done considerable
damage before the fungus gets it under
control. The situation appears to be about
as follows. During one year the fungus
cleans up the ﬂy; the second year the
grove is generally clean, also the
fruit; the third year the ﬂy re-
infests the grove, and the trees and
fruit are again black with sooty mold:
then the fungus does its work again; etc.
Now, in view of the fact, that the fungus
can be introduced by pinning on leaves
or by spraying on spores. . the fungus
should be started at the same time that the
rt-hiteﬂy larvae are ﬁrst observed, and
while the progress and injury of the ﬂy
may not be wholly offset, yet I believe a
great deal can be done in this way to les-
It is purely a question
of helping nature (the fungus) along by
guiding her at the critical moment. This
is an important point. A grower should
not wait for the fungus to start of its own
accord but should start it himself as soon
as he discovers the presence of the white-
ﬂy and this should be done whether the
fungus has previously been present or not.
The fungus should be introduced and han-
dled with the same rational consideration
with which spraying or fumigation is car-
ried on. Because the fungus is a natural
remedy and will of itself (generally)
spread and reduce the whiteﬂy is no rea-
son why rational means for artiﬁcially
.rfrcadin g the same should not be used.

BY SPRAYING ON SPORES OF THE FUNGUS.
If it is decided to introduce the fungus
by means of spraying on spores, care
should be taken to spray against the under
surface of the leaves. Future experiments
may show that this precaution is not nec-
essary but we are not likely to go very
far astray by adopting it for the present.
Forty well developed pustules having the
bright red spots upon them are sufﬁcient
for a pint of water. Two well infected
leaves may be taken as representing the
forty pustules 'but one leaf will frequently
have the required number and often more.
A pint of the solution, I believe, should be
suﬂicient for a tree of ordinary size where
a very ﬁne spray is used. From this it
will be seen that spraying is the most eco-
nomical in so far as infecting material
required is concerned. Three thousand
leaves will about ﬁll a bushel measure.
Two leaves per tree to make the spray,
gives us ﬁfteen hundred trees that can be
treated with this number of leaves. Where
an abundance of leaves are available the
spraying solution may be made stronger;
it cannot be made too strong. After hav-
ing poured the water over the leaves and
stirred the same about for a few minutes,
ﬁfteen to thirty minutes should be allowed
for the spores to become dissolved out of
the red spots on the pustules of the fun—
gus. Then the mass should be stirred
again, thoroughly, in order to wash out
all the spores possible. Do not permit the
solution to settle but strain the liquid at
once through a piece of cheesecloth or
ﬁne wire sieve. An atomizer spray is to
be preferred because it does not require so
much liquid to spray the tree. At all
events, a nozzle that produces a very ﬁne
spray should be used. The above esti-
mate of one pint of liquid per tree was
based upon an atomizer spray. If on the
other hand, no atomizer is available, a
spraying machine may be employed. The
spraying solution should under no condi-
tions be permitted to stand in a copper or
brass tank, for the amount of copper that
would go into the solution might be fatal
to the spores, as these are very sensitive to
copper. If a spraying machine made
wholly or in part of copper or brass, must
be used, the same should be thoroughly
cleaned before using, and then the work
should be done as expeditiously as pos—
sible. If it is necessary to use the copper
or brass reservoir connected with the
spray pump or spraying machine this
should be partially ﬁlled with the solution,
enough only being put in, to spray three
or four trees. Spray the solution on the
under surface of all the infested leaves
giving special attention to the heavily in-
fested new growth. If it happens that only
a limited amount of the spraying solu-
tion is available it may be diluted with
water. Thoroughly spraying all the trees
with a weaker solution is considered pre-
ferable to spraying half the trees, or only
part of each tree, with a stronger solution.
It goes without saying, that it would be
futile to introduce fungus into a tree not
infested with whiteﬂy. The fungi in ques-
tion, so far as known, can thrive only
upon the whiteﬂy, so that there would be
nothing for them to live upon in a non-
infcsted tree. It will also be well to wait
before introducing fungus into a tree until
the whiteﬂy larvae can be abundantly
found under a considerable number of
leaves. To spray every tree in a grove re-
gardless of the individual requirements
of each tree would frequently lead to
waste of material and labor. The writer’s
plan of campaign would be as follows:
Start the fungus in all the trees in which

the whiteﬂy larvae can be readily found.
Later, say in three or four weeks, inspect
the grove and spray all the trees not pre-
viously sprayed and which now show the
presence of whiteﬂy. In another three or
four weeks inspect again and spray. Each
tree should be considered individually and
treated accordingly. Any trees not show-
ing a good start of fungus in three to six
weeks should be sprayed again, wholly or
'_ in part. This kind of procedure should be
continued from year to year, and the pre-
diction is made that in a comparatively
few years, when the citrus growing sec-
tions of the State have in this manner been
thoroughly saturated with the fungi, there
will be no whiteﬂy problem.
I have stated above that the fungi in
question can thrive only upon the whitefly
larvae and pupae and this is probably true
in nature. In the laboratory, however,
Professor H. S. Fawcebt has been success-
ful in growing the Yellow and Red As-
chersonias, and to produce spores, upon
several of the media generally used for
such work. There is but little doubt that
the Brown Fungus can be cultivated on
the same media. This opens up the pos-
sibility of producing spores of the fungi in
the laboratory for use upon trees. But
as an abundance can generally be obtained
from infected groves it is not likely that
we shall very soon be compelled to depend
upon artiﬁcial means for a supply. The
fact, however, that a fungus can be cul-
tivated artiﬁcially gives the scientiﬁc in-
vestigator greater opportunity for careful
and varied experiments and observations
that may eventually lead to broad scien-
tiﬁc principles of practical value.
I wish to state again that if the ﬁrst
attempt at introducing the fungus fails
to produce a good start in a grove, or in
individual trees of a grove, a second at-
tempt should be made and a third one if
necessary. This kind of spraying is much
cheaper (and I believe spraying on the
spores is preferable to pinning on the
leaves; but both methods can be used)
than spraying with insecticides, and is
perfectly harmless to the trees. This
point, furthermore, should not be lost
sight of, that the increase of the fungus in
a tree (other things being equal) is in
the same proportion that we succeed in
starting it in that tree. Thus, if we suc-
ceed in starting IOO pustules of fungus in
one tree and 300 in another, it will be ev-
ident that the spread of the fungus in the
last tree will be three times as rapid as in
the ﬁrst one, and hence the importance
of making as good a start of fungus as
possible by repeated sprayings.
Attention should also be directed to the
fact, that for subsequent sprayings, fun-
gus from the trees previously treated may
be used, provided it is sufficiently develop
ed. This will be evident as the pustules
increase in size and become a bright scar-
let red in the Red Aschersonia or a bright
yellow in the Yellow Aschersonia.
BY PINNING ON LEAVES.
To introduce the fungus by pinning on
leaves I would suggest that from one to a
dozen or more well infected leaves be
pinned to a tree. The number will be de-
termined by the amount available. At
Leesburg 12 leaves per tree were used.
Each infected leaf should be pinned to the
under surface of the leaf on the tree, with
its under surface down, that having been
its position before it Was removed from the
tree and is in closest keeping with nature.
The infected leaves might be pinned with
the infected (or under) side against the
under side of the leaves on the tree, and I
have obtained good results in this way,


## p. 79 (#435) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 79
but for the sake of keeping close to na-
ture I advise the other way for the present.
Each infested leaf should be pinned as
high up in the tree as is convenient. that
is, at least as high as a man can reach. To
pin it higher is desirable. It should, fur-
thermore, be so placed that the drip from
it, when it rains, will drop onto a cluster,
or several clusters, of leaves beneath it.
Use two pins for each leaf. I have ob-
served that the fungus sometimes starts
on the leaves beneath the pinned leaf
rather than at the leaf to which the in-
fected leaf was pinned. It is well to pin
a small piece of paper on the upper surface
of the leaves to which the infected leaves
are pinned as a mark. This will greatly
facilitate later inspections.
THE BROW N FUNGUS.
What has been said for the Ascher-
sonias applies (with one probable excep-
tion) also to the Brown Fungus. The
spores of the Brown Fungus have not
been discovered, and this fact makes it
uncertain whether it can be successfully
introduced by spraying. This leaves two
methods available for introducing the
Brown Fungus: (I) to pin leaves having
whitefly larvae infected with the fungus
upon them onto the leaves of the tree
into which it is to be introduced; (2) to
plant small trees, having the fungus upon
them, into the grove as previously ex—
plained for the Aschersonias. (See also
Bull. 88, by the writer, Florida Agricul-
tural Experiment Station).
CONCLUDING STATEMENT.
So much on the subject of the fungi.
I should be extravagant were I to herald
the same as an absolute panacea. They
are, however, a very valuable adjunct to
a \vh'iteﬂy-infested grove and with a
thorough knowledge of how to best intro-
duce the fungi, “together with a little extra
fertilizer for each tree, the grower will
be able to continue the growing of citrus
fruits proﬁtably, other things being equal.
I should not hesitate, however, to recom-
mend judicious spraying in isolated
groves (i. c., isolated by sufficient distance
or forest barriers from other groves)
or on small trees where [the work can be
done thoroughly. By judicious spraying"
I mean that the man knows the proper
time to spray and to spray thoroughly.
And then, I should recommend spraying
only in the nature of a makeshift to tide
over a certain period pending either the in-
troduction of the fungi or fumigation.
Following Dr. Morrill’s careful experi-
ments and observations on fumigation for
the whiteﬁy during the past year, I antici-
pate that many growers will take up this
method of controlling the ~whiteﬁy, and
that rightly so. And, as more experience
along this line becomes available it appears
not at all improbable but that many grow-
ers will prefer to contrdl the whiteﬂy as
well as other insects by fumigation. This
will be especially true for growers or dis-
tricts so isolated as to be comparatively
safe from becoming immediately reinfest-
ed from nonfum-igated districts.
In regard to the subject of insect con-
trol by means of their natural enemies in
general, many efforts along this line have
been only partially successful or complete
failures while perhaps only a few can be
accorded complete success. But the fact
that there are failures does not indicate
that any particular effort along this line
will be a failure, since each case must be
worked out on its own merit. This brings
us to another important fact which may be
of much value in guiding our efforts to
control insect pests by means of their

insect or fungoid and bacterial enemies.
We may roughly divide insect pests into
(I ), those which are always with us, such
as scale insects and the whiteﬂy, and (2)
those whose appearance in suﬂicient num-
bers to be destructive is uncertain. Among
such may be mentioned the several leaf-
hoppers, destructive to corn, beans, etc.,
grasshoppers, chinch-bug, and others.
The fact that these latter can generally be
found only in small numbers, or practi-
cally disappear altogether, except during
periodic and sporadic periods of increase,
this results in a natural decrease of their
enemies to a minimum. It being practi-
cally almost impossible to cultivate a sup-
ply of their insect enemies on artiﬁcial
foods or other insects, and generally difﬁ-
cult enough to artiﬁcially cultivate their
fungoid or bacterial enemies, it follows
that the enemies of these pests are gener-
ally not at hand in sufﬁcient abundance to
meet the requirements when an outbreak
of such a pest occurs. All this, together
with the possibility of unfavorable weath—
er conditions, in case the enemy supplied is
a fungus, makes the proposition a difﬁcult
one.
When considering the proposition of
controlling the ﬁrst (1) class by means of
their natural enemies we have this great
advantage, namely, that the insect is gen-
erally with us in abundance at all times
and hence also its enemies; and our work
is simpliﬁed to this extent, that-about all
we have to do is to devise methods of
spreading its enemies to keep them abreast
of the pest and to protect them by creating
conditions favorable for their increase.
If we desire to supplement their natural
increase by cultivating them in the lab-
oratory, it will be mainly for the purpose
of observing them at closer range and un-
der peculiarly favorable conditions other-
wise unobtainable. It is under the favor—
able conditions accompanying this ﬁrst
(1) class of insects that we are laboring
in our effort to control the whiteﬂy and
scale insects of Florida.

The Inﬂuence of Packing Methods on the Carrying
Qualities of Citrus Fruits.
By Lloyd S. Tenny.
(Assistant Pomologist.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The agricultural interests of the world
have made immense progress in recent
years, especially true is this in this coun-
try. In a single generation there have been
developed our modern system of State
Experimental Stations and the National
Department of Agriculture. It was only
recently that the primary object of these
institutions and frequently the only real
one, was the studying of plant diseases.
This in turn gradually led into the work
of plant breeding in all its phases, the
securing of varieties resistant to certain
diseases, those especially adapted to one
soil or one climatic condition, and thus
the work has broadened, not only along
this line but along every line, until now we
ﬁnd the Department of Agriculture and
many of the State stations undertaking
a careful scientiﬁc research along a mul-
titude of lines Connected with the farming
interests. N0 phase of the subject is
considered too small or too unimportant
to be left out.
One of the subjects into rwhich this
study has led us at the Department of
Agriculture is the transportation side of
fruit handling. The wonderful extension
of our railroads and the great headway
that has been made in the methods of
transporting perishable produce, has made
it possible for every section of the country
to produce those fruits and vegetables best
suited to its soil and other conditions.
And so the vineyards and orchards of
California, the gardens of Texas, and the
semi-tropic fruits and vegetables of Flori-
da have come to be well known things
over the country. But the one thing
which has made all this practicable and
- has enabled the man of New York or
Denver to have Florida fruits upon his
table is the development of the transpor-
tation side of agriculture. The study of
these transportation subjects and the
methods of harvesting and packing fruits
intended for distant markets is a study
worthy of real investigation. \Vhat com!-
mercial advantage would it be to Florida
to produce a delicious orange if you grow-
ers and shippers were unable to put this on
the market at a proﬁt.
Uniformly almost during recent years
has good fruit demanded excellent prices.
Methods of orchard management have
been improved, so that the yield is nearly
certain and the quality of the fruit high,
the various fungous and insect diseases
are watched and methods of preventing
their spread sought, and so along every
line we ﬁnd the conditions such as to jus-
tify us in expecting an industry at a very
high point of development, and such do
we ﬁnd to a great measure. The fact re-
mains, nevertheless, that while we are pro-
ducing something like a 4,000,000 box

crop in this State, worth some ten millions
of dollars. that the proﬁts to the ordinary
shipper are comparatively small. I real-
ize at the same time that doubtless most
of the orange men here today are conduct-
ing their business on a liberal margin of
proﬁt; at the same time you will admit
that there are those in your immediate
neighborhood who are not so fortunate.
These conditions exist in a measure at
least from the great losses there are in
transit from decayed or wasty fruit.
TIIE EXTENT OF THE LOSS FROM DECAY.
It is difﬁcult to estimate the extent of
this loss, since no accurate and detailed
inspection reports are made, but not one
of you will deny that there are heavy loss-
es. As we have come into closer touch
with the shippers throughout the State.
[we continue to get more of the inside in-
formation regarding this sort of loss. It
is not uncommon to hear of cars arriving
at destination with 20 or more per cent.
decay; even in some exceptionally bad cas-
es it runs as high as 50 per cent. From
personal conversation with many of the
large Florida commission men in New
York City, a 15 per cent. loss seems a
conservative estimate. One of the very
large houses and one that favors Florida
fruits, expresses their opinion as follows:
“The past season has been an exception-
ally good one, and [0 per cent. would
cover the losses in most of the cars, but
in former years a 20 per cent. or 25 per
cent. decay was not uncommon. We
should think that a I5 per cent. waste
would be a fair average for several years.”
.But for our purpose let us be even more
conservative in our estimate of the loss
from decay in transit and place it at to
per cent. which means but 7 or 8 rotten
Oranges in each half bix of 1505. \Vith
this moderate loss, it means on a crop of
three million and a half boxes, the loss of
three hundred and ﬁfty thousand boxes,
or over one thousand cars of fruit. If the
cost of picking, packing and shipping
amounts to one dollar and a quarter a box,
. then you are paying out over $400,000 to
harvest rotten oranges. If you are a ship-
per and buy your fruit at a dollar a box,
that means another loss of over $300,000,
or to put the ﬁgures into one sum, you
orange men of Florida are losing each
year close to one million dollars from this
one cause alone. The purpose of the De-
partment of Agriculture in opening this
line of experimental work is to determine
whether this loss is a necessary one. and,
if not. what are the causes and how far
are the present packing methods to blame
for the present condition of affairs. The
subject is one that cannot be covered in
an investigation extending over one sea-
son alone, nor over two, but it is one that
must be followed for a series of years, or
10ng enough to determine experimentally
the effects of different methods of picking,
hauling, packing and shipping, season af-
ter season. So let me say now that any
statements made today or any results
given, are only preliminary and subject to
change as the work develops. The work
was begun this past season, and, at the
best, only a preliminary survey could be
made the ﬁrst year. Had it not been that
the results obtained so far were so uniform
and so suggestive, we would not feel jus-
tiﬁed in bringing before you even this pre-
liminary report. I should like to say fur-
ther that we are beginning this work with
no set idea as to the inﬂuence of the pack—
ing methods on this subject, and so have
no pet theory to advance. The work will
be wholly experimental in nature. and our
aim will be to devise methods of handling

the citrus crop with the least amount of
loss in transit.
THE CAUSE OF DECAY.
The decay which causes practically all
the wasty arrivals is produced by the
growth of a common blue mold fungus, a
low form of plant life. The spores which
form the blue covering on the surface of a
rotten orange act as the seed for the repro-
duction of this plant. These are ever
present, the dust of the air is laden with
them, and each orange doubtless has many
of them on its surface. Before decay
takes place, three things seem to be neces-
sary, as they are necessary for the growth
of any plant. a soil in which to grow, heat
and moisture.
One of the characteristics of the blue
mold fungus is that it seldom if ever lives
on living tissue. A perfectly healthy un-
injured orange on the tree is seldom seen
decaying. When the fruit is picked the
life of the orange does not stop immedi-
ately, the cells continue active for some
time after. It should, therefore, be im-
possible for the fruit to decay soon-after
harvesting. and from experiments we see
that a perfectly sound orange may be
covered with these spores and held in a
warm, moist room and yet no decay takes
place. But once bruise the fruit or injure
its skin, thus killing some of the cells, and
one of the conditions for the growth of
this decay fungus has been supplied; it
has proper soil conditions. If you place
this injured orange on your desk in a
very dry place, or put in a very cold room,
it probably will not rot, but pack it in a
box, wrapped in paper, so that any mois-
ture there may be retained, and then place
the box in a warm, moist spot and the
decay will be very rapid.
\Vith this understanding of the nature
and cause of the common decay, it be-
comes easier to see how the harvesting
methods might have an important bearing
on the keeping quality of the fruit. If
the methods are such as to injure it by
bruising or cutting the skin, then we
would look for decay, and in turn careful
methods should give sound fruit.
THORN PUNCTURING.
Starting our investigations with the
fruit as it hangs upon the tree, some in-
jury has been done already by thorn punc-
turing and branch injury. In seedling or-
chards this damage at times may run quite
high, and after a period of warm. moist
weather, decaying fruit may be found
on the tree. Close inspection of some of
these in the early stage of the rot will
generally show that the decay is begin-
ning around some sort of a mechanical
injury, although it may be so small that
it is scarcely seen without the aid of a
hand lens. This class of injury is in-
creased by the method of picking, namely
in the setting the ladder, by the picker
pulling the branches about, and by his
hitting the fruit against the thorns. In
examining fruit from the same tree,
picked by different men, it is common to
ﬁnd in one box ﬁve or six fresh thorn
bruises. while in another not one is seen.
A small number of counts made so far
indicate that about 6.6 per cent. were
thorn or tree injured. This varies from
one to 22 per cent. ths with 5 per cent..
3.9 per cent., 6.6 per cent. and 6.8 per
cent. were found.
CLIPPER CUTTING.
Enormous damage may be done by
puncturing the fruit with the clippers in
the act of picking. On the other hand, it

is not necessary to do any damage.
Three years ago when Mr. G. Harold
Powell, of the Department of Agricul—
ture, began his work with the California
citrus fruits, he found as high as 15 or 20
per cent. of the crop made subject to de—
cay from this thing alone. He and his
associates made records on hundreds of
boxes, with the result that at that time a
5 per cent. injury was as low as could of-
ten be found; frequently the per cent. ran
to 25, not infrequently to 40 or even 50,
and with some individual pickers even to a
higher amount. The shape of the Navel
orange as grown in California, with a
sunken area around the stem,- favors this
injury with the clipper. In attempting
to cut the stem as close as possible, the
shears punctured the skin. To a much less
extent, this damage is found in Florida.
The round orange is more easily clipped
with a short stem, and there is much less
danger of its being cut. A count of a
considerable number of boxes show 5.0
per cent. clipper cut. In many cases no
injury was done at all, and in a few the
percentage ran high.
Mr. Powell has demonstrated by many
shipping tests, and it is accepted as a fact
among California shippers, that an orange
with a broken skin is liable to decay in
transit. Boxes of that class of fruit have
reached New York City this past season
with as many as 105 rotten oranges in a
box of 1265. When injured fruit is ship-
ped under ice or during cold weather, the
decay upon arrive? is often small. This
same fruit shows a rapid breaking down.
however, when it is held a few days upon
the market.
The following chart will indicate the
amount of decay in injured fruit as com-
pared with sound lots:
CHART I.
Apparently free from mechanical
injury . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 per cent decay.
Mechanically injured . . . . . . . . . .48 per cent decay.
The average for the sound fruit is 2.9
per cent. decay, while the injured fruit
ran as high as 48.7 per cent. rotten.
These ﬁgures are the results of the work
done in Florida, and while the tests have
been few in number, yet they only conﬁrm
the results obtained in California with
series extending over a long period of
time. ,
LONG STEM PUNCTURES.
Another type of injury is the punctur-
ing done by long stems. Some pickers
leave a considerable number of stems sufﬁ-
ciently long to pucture other fruit. This
damage may be done as the fruit is drop-
ped into the picking bag, from the move-
ment of the oranges in the bag. in the
hauling, or somewhere in the packing
house.
INJURY FROM DROPPING.
It_wa.s a question, however, whether
all the decay which develops in a car of
oranges in transit from Florida could be
attributed to the above causes. \Vith 3 or
4 per cent. thorn punctured fruit, 8 or 10
per cent. clipper cuts, and some additional
stem punctured oranges, it is difﬁcult to
explain a 40 or 50 per cent. decay. These
high percentages seem to indicate that at
times at least nearly or all of the fruit
was made susceptible to decay. To a_ fruit
man, unaccustomed to your methods of
hervesting and packing, the most probable
explanation of this condition would be in
the amount of rough handling and drop-
ping to which the fruit is subjected. The
picker in his hurry lets the fruit fall into

his basket or bag and generally takes pains
to give each orange an extra shove with
his shears as he aims the fruit toward the
basket. He often holds the branch with
one hand and allows the oranges to drop
the 18 inches or 2 feet into the basket.
In an ordinary gang, a drop of 12 inches
seems about the minimum which any or-
ange receives in the picking; two feet is
not uncommon. In pouring into the ﬁeld
crate, which is 13 inches high itself, the
mouth of the bag is held 6 inches above
the box, and here is another drop of 18
inches onto the bottom. Not counting the
rough handling in loading and in hauling,
sometimes over very rough roads, there
is another very dangerous drop into the
hopper. This is often large and the fruit
rolls down a steep gravity run and hits
again._ With another tumble into the
bins the oranges are ready to pack. The
question then is, does dropping make the
oranges susceptible to decay? The only
way to settle such a question is by experi-
menting. Pick carefully some boxes of
oranges, pack half the lot as they are,
drop the other half a certain known dis-
tance—we selected 18 inches—then pack
them and hold along with the ﬁrst lot for
10 days or two weeks. Do this, not once,
nor twice, but a hundred times, and you
will begin to know whether an 18 inch
drop will cause any decay. Here are some
of the results of our ﬁrst year’s work.
These experiments were done in your own
packing houses, through the courtesy and
excellent co-operation of the owners and
foremen. At the same time that the ex-
perimental lots were packed, several box-
es from the regular house pack of the
same fruit were set aside.v These were
picked, hauled, and packed in the usual
manner and by the regular workmen. In
preparing the series of dropped fruit, un-
usual care was taken to have the oranges
picked carefully and not dropped into the
bag and box. All mechanically injured
fruit was removed and there were no long
stems. Just before packing each orange
was held 18 inches above the ﬂoor or bot-
tom of the box and dropped separately
this distance.

tained 20.1 per cent. was in the drop of
18 inches. How much of the 22.9 per cent.
waste in the house pack may be attributed
to a similar cause, we will leave to you to
judge, who know something about the
amount of rough handling a box of fruit
ordinarily receives.
SUMMARY.
It does not seem best at the present
time to make any very deﬁnite recommen-
dations. I should like to present, how—
ever, the following questions for your
consideration.
Is there not an immense amount of
rough handling in your orange groves
and packing houses?
Is it not reasonable to expect, and do
the experiments not indicate, that the in-
jured and dropped fruit has been made
susceptible to decay?
Other conditions, such as the amount of
moisture and heat at the time of packing,
the length of delay in shipping, the time
in transit and the character of the weather
encountered, all have their bearing. But
as a preliminary consideration, is it not
more than probable that the packing meth~
ods have much to do with the keeping
quality of citrus fruits?
DISCUSSION.
Member.-—VVhat is the character of
the land? High pine land fruit?
Mr. Tenney—All kinds. This is
one of the things of which more deﬁ-
nite notice will be taken another year.
We did not ﬁnd a great deal of differ-
ence in the results where the experi-
ments were made with high pine land
or hammock land fruit. There were,
however. striking differences in indi-
vidual lots of fruit.
Mr. Hart—A question I have in
mind is whether, if that fruit was kept
a little while and cured and softened
up, it' would not have gone through
with less percentage of rot. \Yhen an
orange is just off the tree and rigid,
the drop would injure it considerably
more than after it had been off the
tree for 24 or 36 hours, and that brings
up the matter of whether curing is de-
sirable or not before shipping.
Mr. Tenny.—Oranges that have
been picked some time will probably
not be injured as much by dropping as
those that are freshly picked. The
difﬁculty, however, lies in the fact that
a large proportion of the damage is
done in the picking, hence curing some
time after picking will not remedy the
trouble. Under your present harvest-
ing system, the trouble is in getting
your fruit into the packing house.
There is little doubt that an orange
that is cured will stand a drop better
than one that is just picked and conse-
quently hard.
Mr. Hart—Then another important
point is that where fruit is shipped in
small quantities, it is loaded largely
by the freight handlers, and it is not
unusual for them to shoulder the box
and give it a shove and let it go. Now,
if we had cured the fruit, I think it
would have been injured less than
when packed immediately from the
tree and crowded into boxes.
Mr. Tenny—The matter of delaying
the shipment will be taken up before
our work is ﬁnished. I could give you
some of the results from the California
end. but do not feel justiﬁed in doing
that. because the same conditions
might not hold good here in Florida.
Mr. 'Hart—In putting on the cov-
ers of the boxes considerable injury
might be done, while, if partly cured,

it might get into market in better
shape. ‘
Dr. Richardson—There 'has lately
come into use a different kind of pack.
\Ve used to put the oranges in and
press the top down and nail it. Now,
the market seems to like a loose pack.
The ends of the top are nailed down
and the center at the partition, is not
nailed down, and it bellies out. Was
the pack you used the loose or the
ﬁmi pack? I think the loose pack
permits the fruit to be bruised.
Mr. Tenny—We use the ﬁrm pack.
In any case, there was no damage in
our experimental lots after the fruit
was packed. Any injury that appeared
on this fruit was made before the box
was nailed up. The boxes were set
in the packing houses very carefully
and no injury was done by the drop-
ping or the rough handling of the
boxes. ‘
Mr. Skinner—In my opinion, this is
one of the most important sessions.
Now, about the picking of the fruit; at
the start I want to say that I don’t see
what we are going to do. I had one
man six feet and over picking for me,
and found him with his arms extended
full length and dropping them down to
the basket. I don’t know how in the
world we are going to get rid of the
trouble. Last year, I provided my
men with a bag to tie around them
that had a kind of a proboscis. I also
agree that there is a great deal of
trouble in the packing, but how to
overcome it is a question. Naturally,
this brings up the labor question. I
shipped this past season about 60,000
boxes, and every time I saw a fellow
dropping an orange, it touched me
right on a tender nerve. You can im-
agine that by the end of the season I
was a nervous wreck. There seems to
be seasons when everything carries
well, and then another season when
everything rots. Mr. Sampson ship-
ped a carload of oranges to Augusta,
Ga. and they were not over three or
four days in transit, but when they ar-
rived there, they were entirely worth-
less. I do not know how to meet these
conditions. I expect to try a blower
to see if I cannot dry my fruit. The
atmosphere in this country is saturated
to the full point with moisture, and
sometimes the oranges are dripping
wet with moisture from the atmos—
phere. I would like to know your
opinion as to whether it would be prac-
ticable to use a blast of that kind to
keep the fruit dry.
Mr. Tenny—This is a question con-
siderably discussed in California. I
am not willing to venture an opinion
on it. The point in question is this:
If the climatic,conditions are such so
that the atmosphere contains 90 per
cent. or so of moisture, and this moist-
air is blown over the fruit. it may ap—
parently dry them off, but in reality
the air which is around the fruit after
it is packed is still very moist. As the
oranges continue to give off moisture
after being packed, it seems probable
that if the weather is moist. there
would still be sufﬁcient moisture to al-.
low decay to take place. Regarding
the question as to why one lot of fruit
will decay while another packed appar-
ently under similar conditions arrives
in a sound condition, is possibly be—
cause the atmospheric conditions at
the time of the two shipments were en-
tirely different. One shipment may
have been injured by the pickers, and

at the time of packing the weather was
dry, while in a short time the condi-
tions may be entirely different, and a
lot of fruit injured in a similar manner
to the ﬁrst lot may show a heavy de-
cay. The relation between the climat-
ic conditions here at the time of har-
vesting and the decay conditions upon
arrival on the market is something we
want to investigate further. How
much good may be accomplished by
blowing air over the fruit, I do not
know.
Dr. Phillips—I would like to ask
what the gentleman thinks about using
the brush.
Mr. Tenny—If your fruit is not
dirty, do not brush it. Do not handle
your oranges any more than is abso-
lutely necessary. If they do not need
washing or brushing, don’t do it. They
may be washed or brushed probably
without serious damage, but make a
practice of handling your fruit just as
little as is possible. I know of no wash
yet discovered that will kill the spores
of the decay fungus and at the same
time not injure the fruit. This fungus
is the same that causes the blue mold
on bread and other things, so the
spores are ever present. It is not a
parasite. it is a saprophyte; that is. it
lives on dead tissues. It will not live
on a live, healthy orange.
Mr. Gibbs—VV hat class of labor do
you depend on in California for picking
oranges?
Mr. Tenny—JThey have the Japanese,
Chinese, Mexican and hoboes. I realize
that you have hard labor conditions here
in Florida, but we had this same thing
to meet in California. But let me ask
you this. If all your orange trees were
transformed in a night to peach trees,
wouldn’t you gather the entire peach crop
without punching them or dropping
them? Wouldn’t you?
Mr. Hart—This seems to be an ex-
perience meeting. Mr. Skinner was
speaking about the question whether we
could overcome the careless picking or
not, and I would offer one suggestion
which I got from Mr. Stevens in regard
to that matter that has been of great help
to me. That is, to have all your ﬁeld
pickers have a piece of chalk"and put
their numbers on the boxes. When it
comes into the packing house, if there
is any injury to the fruit that has been
picked, you can identify the picker who
did that work; then, of course, you can
speak 'to your foreman and have him
see that the trouble is corrected or the
picker discharged. Where you have care-
less pickers (and they will get careless if
not closely watched) they think that their
fruit goes in with all the rest so you can-
not identify it, and consequently they take
little pains.
The next point is about the current
of air in the packing house. I can take
an orange and with my thumb nail cut
through the cuticle clear around the or-
ange and put it up on a beam and it will
dry up and the wound will become air-
tight. It can go into the market, if the
conditions are fairly good, after it has
left my packing house, in good shape.
I believe a current of air is very import-
ant in a packing house, and if you can
sweep a dry current of air through, it
will heal those wounds.
Now, about the moisture in the atmo-
sphere. If the fruit gets cold during the
night, and the morning comes up bright
and warm, the orange does not warm up
as quickly, and the warm air deposits

its moisture on the oranges and makes
them wet. I have my packing house so
built and arranged that I can close it up
entirely. If the night has been cold and
_ the days are warm I close it up early
in the day and keep my oranges dry until
packed. If I open a window or a door,
even for a few minutes, the oranges are
wet.
As to the picking boxes, to avoid too
deep a drop, I would have my ﬁeld boxes
shallow.-- I would not have them as deep
as some do. For the picking receptacle
I would not use a bag. There may be
less danger of injury from dropping, but
you can tell your men to put them into
any receptacle without a drop. When
they put them into a bag they are climb-
ing over the tree. It is a thorny tree,
and they cannot help but get the bag
against the thorns and branches of the
tree, or thumping it against the ladder.
There is a gentleman here, I think, who
invented a metal receptacle, so that you
can stoop down and allow the oranges
to slide though the lower end without
any drop. I believe we can pick into these
picking baskets safely. They are the best
of any kind that I have found, when of
the correct shape. The baskets are made
by the Wakeﬁeld Rattan Company in
East Boston. I have paid all the way
from $1.00_ to $2. 50 for them.

Member What size of basket is most
desirable i“
Mr. Hart—I think those that hold
about half a box, fairly deep, but not
wide from the body outward. The out-
side should be higher than that next to
the picker.
Now, about brushing and washing. I
do not believe you can put your fruit
in really ﬁrst-class shape with a brush,
unless you have water connected with it
someway. I wash mine particularly on
account of the ﬂy-specked fungus which
gives the fruit a little cloudiness. Fruit
shipped without has not such a tempting
appearance, but that which has been wash-
ed meets more the demands of the very
best trade and looks like pure gold. If
you run a brusher over a rotten orange,
you are apt to inoculate every bristle. I
do not think that you can get satisfactory
results without using water. To put the
fruit on the market in the best possible
condition, I think it must be washed. I
think more and more will come to that
conclusion and adopt the washer, and
there is at least one washer on the mar-
ket that will do it in ﬁne shape and with-
out injury if properly handled.
Out of my grove this year we lost
simply one box of oranges from the
whole packing. The lot in which that
was, was shipped under extremely severe
conditions after it left my hands. This
year I shipped until the middle of March.
I speak of this to show you that washing
does not injure the fruit; if anything,
it is of beneﬁt. I 'have taken fruit picked
by the same man, put half of them
through the washer and the other not,
and stored them away in the'packing
house and left them there for six or eight
weeks, and in each test the unwashed
fruit gave away ﬁrst.
Mr. Tenny—I would like to ask Mr.
Hart if his orange crop was a peach crop,
if there would be any bruises on it when
it was shipped.
Mr. Hart—Not if I could help it; nor
are there any on any oranges if I could
help it. I am especially particular about
that, and not only have my pickers to be
careful, but when the fruit goes into the

washer there is not an orange goes
through, but that there has been a ﬁnger,
thumb or eye on 'the calyx, and no
long stem goes in. If there is a puncture
in that fruit, that fruit is laid aside, every
orange is examined again by the grader,
and all found injured in any way are dis-
carded.
Mr. Gibbs—Do you use any mechani-
cal agency, such as potash?
Mr. Hart—Up to this year I used soap,
but this year I have not used any at all
and found the results equally as good. I
prefer soft water, though I use some pump
water. I prefer soft water, and think
the oranges can be washed without soap
successfully.
Mr. Julian—Could you put up ﬁve cars
of fruit and do this?
Mr. Hart—\Vell. yes, sir; I would
wash every orange. Of course, it is pret-
ty nearly impossible for the very large
shipper to give the careful handling to
the fruit that a smaller shipper can, but
I would do it just as nearly as I could,
anyway, or sell off a part of the grove
and get the same or a little better income
by giving more care to the balance.
From the drying rack they go into the
drying crates. These in my packing
house, are made ﬁve by six feet and set
on a bearing that allows of tipping to
run the fruit to either end. The oranges
are never two deep when curing. I do
not intend to ship in less than forty-eight
hours after my fruit is picked; a little
longer is just as good. By that time in-
jured fruit shows up and is culled out
more easily and surely.
Report of the Committee on Fertilizer and Irrigation.
By E. S. Hubbard, Chairman.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In considering the question of fertil-
izers I shall pass by the question of
sources and percentages of the necessary
elements, and devote my time to some
of the problems of application and effects.
An immense amount of valuable and often
contradictory facts can be gathered on
these questions, and it seems almost im-
possible to draw any exact conclusion on
the subject, except that each individual
user of fertilizers should strive to use
the formula or mixture that will give
the best average results under the varying
climatic conditions his crop and soil are
subject to. It is needless to say that the
past winter has been the driest in the
memory of the oldest inhabitants. and I
will use the Irish potato crop grown in
my vicinity for a few illustrations.
It has been demonstrated that the
grasses transpire through their foliage
between 500 and 600 times their dry
weight of water in making their growth,
and I estimate that Irish potatoes use

between two and three inches in perfect-
ing the crop.
As the evaporation in a season of av-
erage warmth and sunshine is doubtless
fully as much more a minimum rainfall
of between ﬁve and six inches must be
registered, provided it is well distributed
over the growing period, and no fall is
so great as to run off in the drainage
ditches.
Measured by the Weather Bureau rain
guage, the rainfall the past winter was
as follows: November, .06 inches; De-
cember .44; january .47; February 1.07;
March .96. The total during the grow-
ing months of January, February and
March being just two and one-half inches,
mostly in small showers that wet in very
little, the greatest fall being just one inch
on February 5th. The soil was already
dry from the only one-half inch com-
bined rainfall of November and Decem-
ber, and the evaporation owing to the
unusual number of warm, sunshiny days
was greater than the average. The rain-
fall, therefore, was less than half what
was necessary for an average crop, while
the crop averaged about two-thirds; the
deﬁciency of rainfall having been some-
what made up by the subsoil water rising
by capillarity towards the surface.
I noted exceptions, however, that were
interesting. New Year's eve one man
had over two acres of seed dropped by
hand in ridges split by a bull tongue,
so that the fertilizer mixed in the soil
was practically exposed. That night
there was a shower of .05 inches, and the
man woke in fear and trembling lest his
seed should freeze before morning. He
covered it early next day with a disc
ridger and harvested 45 barrels per acre,
the average annual yield being about 40
.latter months being 9.48.
barrels. This .05 inches of rain, there?
fore, by dissolving his fertilizer and sur-
rounding his seed with wet soil nearly
doubled his yield over an adjoining ﬁeld
planted two days earlier.
Another man had his fertilizer in the
opened ridges exposed to two showers,
December 20th and 21st, aggregating .29
inches, and harvested 35 barrels per acre.
Another man irrigated with an artesian
well running the water in ditches between
his lands which are some forty feet wide,
and harvested ﬁfty barrels per acre.
Later planted potatoes are usually more
proliﬁc, and some irrigated ﬁelds at Has—
tings are reported as yielding 80 barrels
per acre, while newly broken, unirrigated
ﬁelds were not worth digging.
This illustrates the advantages of dis-
solving fertilizers and irrigation in dry
seasons; but, on the other ‘hand, the prob-
lem of very wet seasons is equally serious. ~
The previous winter the rainfall was 1.42
inches in November, 3.54 in December,
3.72 in january, 3.51 in February, and
2.25 for March; the total for the three
There was
much cool, cloudy weather with small
evaporation, and the rainfall was twice
what the potato crop needed._ This sea-
son, nitrate or soda applied to the mix-
ture before planting was undoubtedly
nearly all lost, and similarly to other
seasons. the crop was so slow growing
and maturing. I judged large percentages
of the potash and phosphoric acid leach-
ed also. I therefore sent a sample of
soil to Prof. Blair for test tube experi-
ments of leaching. The soil was about
one foot deep in the test tube. and the
ﬁrst application of four inches of water
leached 37.8 per cent. of the soluble phos-
phoric acid. The second application of

92 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
three inches of water leached 15.8 per
cent., and the third application of three
inches leached 6.9 per cent.; a total for
ten inches of water of 60.5 per cent. of
the small amount of soluble phosphoric
acid mixed with the test soil. The ex-
periment with sulphate of potash was even
more striking. The ﬁrst four inch ap-
plication of water leached 67.3 per cent.,
or over two-thirds of the potash; the sec-
ond of three inches 17.3 per cent., and the
third of three inches, 6 per cent.; a total
for the ten inches of water of 90.6 per
cent. of the sulphate of potash mixed in
the test tube soil. Now, the condition of
fertilizers covered in a ridge of soil is
not half so favorable to leaching as these
test tube experiments, and when these
soluble salts are diffused through the soil,
the humus must hold more of the atten-
uated solution, yet, at the same time,
when the soil is fully saturated with rain
and the water table gradually sinks be-
low the surface, a large percentage of the
soluble fertilizers must be carried with it.
If we lose half as much fertilizer as
was leached in the experiments, it is a
most serious loss and drawback to har-
vesting good crops. If we only knew
when a wet season was coming, we would
apply our fertilizers on the installment
plan, or when a dry season was coming
we would apply soluble fertilizers in ad-
vance; but undoubtedly the safest plan
from lack of this knowledge is to apply
the less soluble fertilizers and have in
reserve an irrigation plant with which to
meet the emergency of drought.
In this, however, the individual must
work out the problem; according to his
peculiar needs, or average the good sea-
sons with the bad to determine proﬁt or
loss.
In fruit tree fertilizing, especially if
the sod method is used part of the year,
soluble chemical fertilizers are a neces-
sity, as they will dissolve without evapo—
ration or loss. Nitrate of soda is of ex-
treme solubility, and sulphate of ammonia
probably leaches about as fast as phospho-
ric acid. Broadcast applications to or-
ange trees, for instance, which have a
healthy and unlacerated system of ﬁbrous
roots, may be depended upon unless rain-
fall is excessive, to be practically all
available for plant growth.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Wakelin—Let us hear from the
gentleman who has Mr. Chase’s property
in charge.
Mr. Hoard—The pump we are using
at Chase & Company’s grove is of simple
construction and great capacity and is en-
tirely different from any I have ever seen
used in this state. It consists of a wood-
en box two feet square inside and eighteen
feet high, with a steel shaft running
through the center from top to bottom.
This shaft has a water wheel at the bot~
tom end and another wheel of the same
kind] in the middle and an eight inch pul-
ley on the top end which is connected with
the engine by an eight inch belt. The
box stands on end in the edge of the
lake where the water is about three feet
deep. The lower water wheel is so con-
structed that when revolving rapidly it
raises the water to a height of seven and
one-half feet where the upper wheel catch-
es it and carries it out at the top of the
box. This gives us an elevation of ﬁfteen
feet above the lake and six feet above
the highest point in the grove and con-
siderable pressure. From the top of the
pump the water runs through a ten inch

terra cotta pipe across the grove from
east to west. This pipe is cemented 'to-
gether and buried undler ground and has
a ﬁve inch outlet every 90 feet, which may
be opened or closed as desired. From
these ﬁve inch openings the water is
conducted through ﬁve inch galvanized
iron pipes to all parts of the grove. This
ﬁve inch pipe is in ten foot lengths and
is connected in the same manner as stove
pipe. We can run four lines of this ﬁve
inch pipe at once, or if we are short of
piping, we use three lines and run the
fourth opening into open furrows. We
can run ﬁve of these furrows from one
opening, or if we used the furrow system
alone we could run twenty furrows at one
time. These furrows are about eight
inches wide and two to three inches deep
and 500 to 600 feet long. This will give
you an idea as to the capacity of the
pump: We commenced using this irri-
gation plant about March Ist, and kept it
going every day for over two months. As
a result, we will have twice as many or-
anges as we had last year. and in all
probability three times as many as we
would have had this year without irriga-
tion. In other words, an increase of at
least 5000 boxes over last year.
Member—What kind of land is it?
Mr. Hoard—Hammock land;
porous and thirsty.
Mr. Griﬁing—How many gallons per
minute do you get?
Mr. 1Hoard—J have never ﬁgured that
out, but a man from California estimated
very
it at 120 miner’s inches as they measure
water out there. He says this irrigation
plant in California would be worth $100,-
000.
Member—What is the cost of that
plant?
Mr. Hoard—I cannot give the exact
cost, but it is a much cheaper system
than those of like capacity in general
use in this state. I believe I would be
safe in saying that the whole cost did not
exceed $1500.00. The pump alone cost
about $150.00 in New Orleans.
Mr. Griﬁing—He speaks about irriga—
tion in open ditches. \Ne have always had!
the idea that we had to pipe the water
to get it over Florida sand, therefore con-
sidered irrigation too expensive for practi~
cal purposes. The past season, we start-
ed pumping water in open ditches or
furrows and ﬁnd that all it is necessary to
do is to get the water to the highest
point from which we have no trouble‘in
running it from 500 to 700 feet. The
cost is so low that almost any planter can
do it. A pipe line sufﬁciently large to de-
liver 60 to 70 gallons per minute. 1600
to 1800 feet long ought not to cost over
$700.00 or $800.00. This is exclusive of
pumping plant. This line in this climate
can be simply strung out on top of the
ground and moved as occasion demands,
thus being able to irrigate a large area
with it from one source of supply. A
gridiron of pipe lines in the ﬁeld or grove
is not necessary for practical, efﬁcient and
economical irrigation.

Lime as a Remedy for Acid Soils.
By A. w. Blair.
(Florida Experiment Station.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlcmenf
Before taking up directly the relation
of lime to acid soils, it may be well ﬁrst,
to refer to the amount of lime in differ-
ent soils, the ease with which it is wash-
ed out, etc., and discuss very brieﬂy the
functions of lime in agriculture.
Calcium, which is one of the elements
of lime, is found in the ashes of all plants,
and some lime is found in practically all
soils. As naturally found in soils, lime
exists in combination with other groups
of elements; for example as calcium
phosphate (phosphate of lime), cal—
cium carbonate (limestone), calcium
silicate, etc.; and from these com-
pounds it is dissolved by soil waters and
taken up by plants.
THE AMOUNT OF LIME IN SOILS.
According to analyses made by the
Florida Experiment Station, the aver-
age amount of lime in a number of sam-
ples of soil taken on the Florida East
Coast, between Lemon City and El-
dred. is .012 per cent., and taking the
weight of an acre foot (the soil on one
acre t0 the depth of one foot), to be
4,000,000 pounds this would give us
496 pounds of lime, or approximately
1-4 ton to the acre-foot. The average
amount of lime in samples of soil rep-
resenting Orange, Hillsboro, and De-
Soto counties is .028 per cent., which is
equivalent to 1,120 pounds, or a little
over 1-2 ton to the acre-foot. Many
soils in the humid regions of the United
States contain from .2 per cent. to .4 per
cent. of lime and if we take the aver-
age of these, .3 per cent., and the weight
of an acre—foot of these soils as 3.500,-
000 pounds, we ﬁnd that they contain
5 1-4 tons of lime to the acre-foot, which
is twenty—one times the amount in the
East Coast soils. Snyder gives the av-
erage amount of lime in 200 fertile soils
as 2.16 per cent., equivalent to 37 4-5
tons per acre-foot, which is approxi-
mately 150 times the amount in the
East Coast soils, and 67 1-2 times the
amount in the samples representing Or-
ange, Hillsboro and DeSoto counties.
It is evident from the foregoing that
many of the Florida soils contain com-
paratively small quantities of lime. The
same is true, in a measure, of other
bases, as magnesium, potassium, iron,
etc. This is to be expected where 8
soil is composed so largely of sand.
LIME EASILY WASHED OUT OF THE SOIL-
Undoubtedly there was a time when
these same soils contained much more
lime than at present, but through years
of cultivation and leaching it has been
lost. The amount removed by crops
each year, though small in most cases,
must not be lost sight of, especially
where no part of the crop is returned to
the soil. In addition to this loss there is a
constant leaching going on which depletes
the soil of its lime. From an examina-
tion of the composition of drain-waters
from unmanured land, it has been

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 95
shown that in all such waters lime is the
' ingredient most abundantly leached
out, and the same has been shown to
be true of the waters of some of the
world’s largest rivers. Reade, in his
treatise on Chemical Denudation in
Relation to Geological Time, calculates
that 143 1-2 tons of lime carbonate are
annually removed by solution from
each square mile of land in England and
“’ales, and the average amount remov-
ed annually from each square mile of
the earth’s surface is about 50 tons.
SOILS OF LIMESTONE ORIGIN MAY BE DEFI-
CIENT IN LIME.
It is commonly believed that soils
of limestone origin are rich in lime, but
this is not neceSsarily the case. The
relative ease with which limestone dis-
solves in carbonated waters partly ac-
counts for this fact. An instance has
been cited where two soils were
thought, by the owner, to be rich in
lime. derived! from. lime-stone rock, but
while the parent rock in one case con-
tained 92.6 per cent carbonate of lime,
and in the other 91.3 per cent., the soils
contained only 3.28 per cent. and .40
per cent.. respectively. In another in—
stance. the parent rock contained 30 per
cent. carbonate of lime, and the result-
ing soil .14 per cent.
THE FUNCTIONS OF LIME IN AGRICULTURE.
Although all plantsrequire lime, it is
not usually regarded as a fertilizer in
the sense that phosphoric acid, potash,
and nitrogen are, since it usually ex-
ists in the soil in quantities far in excess
of the actual food requirements of the
plant. (Among the other elements
which are required by plants, but which
exist in the soil in quantities quite sufﬁ-
cient for their requirements, may be
mentioned iron, sulphur, magnesium, and
sodium). However, there may be rare
instances where the soil has been so
thoroughly exhausted of its lime that
an application of this material would be
of value from the standpoint of a fer-
tilizer. As we have just seen, lime has
a part to play in building up the plant.
This is shown by the fact that calcium,
one of the elements of lime, is found in
all plant ashes. This may be termed its
physiological function.
Physically, lime improves the condi-
tion of the soil; if it be a clay soil it
becomes more mellow, and is more eas-
ily drained and cultivated; if it be a san-
dy soil the lime acts as a cementing
Material, binding the grains together,
thus lessening the loss of water and
plant food by percolation.
Chemically, lime aids in rendering
more available, elements of plant food
which are locked up \in the soil and are
unavailable to the plant; especially, is
this true of potash.
In the processes of the nitriﬁcation of
organic compounds, nitrates are formed,
and if no base is present to unite with
these, they are easily lost by leaching ;
however, if lime be present, they will unite
with the calcium of the lime, and in this
form, calcium nitrate, they are readily
available as plant food. Lime hastens
the decomposition of organic matter, and
aids in the formation of ammonia and
other nitrogen compounds from this or-
ganic matter.
A function of lime which we have
been slow to recognize, but which nev-
ertheless is an important one. is its
power to correct acidity, or sourness,
in soils. due partly at least to the pres-
ence of organic acids. Such soils are

now known to be quite general, even
where the land is high and well drained.
These soils are unfavorable to the
growth and development of nitrifying
organisms, and as a consequence the pro-
cesses of nitriﬁcation would tend to
cease. Further, the tendency of these
organic acids would be to attack such
bases as are present in the soil, and if
iron be one of these bases, salts of this
metal would be formed, and these salts
would prove injurious to micro-organ-
isms, and possibly also to the tender
rootlets of the plant.
It is believed by some that lime aids
in the production of root hairs, and that
by this means the absorption of potash
is encouraged.
IS THIS CONDITION OF son. ACIDITY
A GENERAL ONE?
If then there is a tendency under
some conditions, to the formation, in
the soil, of organic acids, the questions
which will naturally present themselves
to those interested in agriculture and
horticulture are: To what extent are
the soils with which I am concerned
thus affected, how may I recognize such
a condition, and has lime proved an efﬁ-
cient remedy? Perhaps the most ex-
haustive work along this line has been
done by Wheeler and his associates, of
the Rhode Island Experiment Station.
For something like twelve years they
have been working on this problem, and
they have shown beyond a doubt, that
the sandy soils of Rhode Island do very
generally give an acid reaction; and
they have further shown, as will be
pointed out more fully later, that lime
is an efﬁcient remedy. Hilgard has
noted a similar condition in the sandy
upland soils of Mississippi and other
southern states, and earlier, Ruﬂin call-
ed attention tO extensive tracts of that‘
character in Virginia. French investi-
gators have mentioned large areas of
sandy soil in Brittany, Limousin, and
other sections of France, as distinctly
acid; and in German writings refer-
ence to sandy, sour soils is not wanting.
Hilgard in speaking of sour soils
writes as follows: “The-acid reaction
characterizing the ulmic substances, is
also characteristic of many woodlands,
notably in the United States of the soils
of the long-leaf pine region of the Cot-
ton States, both upland and lowland, as
well as of many deciduous forests in
northern climates. Hence, liming,
whether artiﬁcial or natural, effects a
most notable improviement together
with a marked change of vegetation in
these lands.” Previous to the work of
Wheeler, Hartwell, and others, it was
generally considered, in America at
least, that only low wet lands, or those
that were largely made up of muck,
were subject to the sour or acid condi-
tions; but we now know, beyond a doubt,
that in many places, upland and well
drained soils do show a decidedly acid
reaction. The question as to how we
shall recognize this condition is not al-
waysthe simplest. It may sometimes
be recognized by the character of the
vegetation, or the crops grown on it,
but the surest way is a test of some
kind. The one most generally used is
the litmus paper test, though this is not
always satisfactory, since it gives us no
very deﬁnite idea of the degree of acidi-
ty, and undoubtedly fails in some in-
stances, to indicate an acid condition
which really does exist. And here it
may be said that our knowledge of
methods of determining soil acidity is

97
very general. Even the best soil chem-
ists are not agreed upon a uniform
method, although a number of methods
have been proposed and are being tried
in various laboratories. When such
methods are perfected, as they ulti-
mately will be, we can determine the
exact acidity of any soil and then cal-
culate to a nicety the amount of lime
required to neutralize this acidity. Un-
til such methods are perfected, investi-
gators and agriculturists will have to
content themselves with using tenta-
tive methods and with ﬁeld trials, using
different quantities until the right
amount is found for the different class-
es of soils. One thing, however, seems
deﬁnitely settled, and that is that we
must recognize the fact that an acid
condition in the soil is more generally
prevalent than has heretofore been be-
lieved to be the case.
\‘VI-IAT CAUSES THIS ACIDITY.P
In wet locations where large quanti-
ties of organic matter undergo decay,
enormous amouts of humus accumu-
late as a result of the decomposition.
Such humus is said to be usually,
though not always, in an acid state.
The acidity is naturally dependent upon
the lack of bases with which the organic
acids may combine. Until compara-
tively recently little reference has been
made to an injurious degree of acidity
from such causes, in upland or well
drained soils. That a dangerous degree
of acidity may and often does exist in
such soils is now well recognized. We
have, however. been slow to recognize
this fact, and on this account, no doubt,
we have often attributed the failure of
crops to cold, poor germination of
seeds, drought, excessive rains, attacks
of insects or fungi, which should have
been attributed to soil acidity.
The formation of organic acids by the
decomposition of organic materials in
soils deﬁcient in bases, would then seem
to be a reasonable explanation, in part
~ at least, for the existence of acid soils.
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS or AN ACID CON-
DITION IN THE sOIL?
\Ve cannot answer this question in
full; we do not know. As the subject
is further studied we shall know more.
IfI should say that it causes the wilt of
the orange, I might be very wide of the
mark, but on the other hand, no one
can say absolutely that it does not cause
this disease. We do, however, know
some of the effects. We do know that
it interferes with the processes of nitri-
ﬁcation, and thus prevents the plant
from getting certain food elements that
it should have. We do know that in
many instances clover, alfalfa, and other
legumes, have failed almost entirely on
acid soils, but have done well when the
acid of these same soils has been neu-
tralized with lime.
IS LIME A SATISFACTORY CORRECTIVE?
Volumes could be written showing the
beneﬁcial results obtained by the use of
lime on acid- soils, but here it will only
be necessary to make brief reference to
a few instances. The experiments con-
ducted by the Rhode Island Experiment
Station have shown that something like
thirty-one plants, including vegetables,
grasses, fruit trees, etc., are beneﬁted by
the use of lime, while nine are indifferent
to its use, and four are injured by it. The
Maryland Experiment Station reports

list of those beneﬁted, that is placed by
the Rhode Island Experiment Station in
the list of those that are indifferent.
Veitch, of the Department of Agriculture,
reports a very decided increase in the
weight of clover, cowpeas, and alfalfa, on
soils that were limed over those that were
not limed. In fact, in the case of the
alfalfa. no crop was secured on the un-
limed plot; and he further shows that in
no case does the yield on the plots where
the acid was only partially neutralized by
lime, equal the yield on those where it
was completely neutralized. At the Ohio
Experiment Station they have found it
difﬁcult to get a good stand of clover on
acid soils, the clover dying out in patches,
and being supplanted by a grth of
sorrel. In one case this unfavorable con-
dition was aggravated by the use of fer-
tilizers compounded with acid. \Vith a
ton of lime to the acre they secured a lux-
uriant growth of clover. The report sug-
gests that a smaller quantity might have
sufﬁced. Others have noted the decided
improvement brought about by the use of
lime on clover, alfalfa, and cowpeas,
where the soil was acid, where before
these crops had been a partial or total
failure. The beggarweed also is a legume,
and may it not be true that the difﬁculty
which so many have had in getting a
good stand of this crop is due to an acid
condition in our soils? In this connec-
tion it is of interest to note the following
statement taken from the Rhode Island
Experiment Station report for 1893 ; “The
application of lime on our soils has en-
abled us to secure a good catch of clover
where it was before impossible.”
ARE FLORIDA SOILS GENERALLY ACID.P
No systematic study has been made of
the soils of this State with reference to
this particular point, but judging by tests
which I have made of soils representing
rather widely separated portions of the
State, and by the statements of others, I
feel justiﬁed in drawing the conclusion,
that our upland soils are more generally
acid than we have heretofore supposed
them to be. That our muck soils are de-
cidedly acid I think no one will question.
Many of the muck soils are quite rich
in nitrogen, and in addition contain
some phosphoric acid and potash, and
should prove quite valuable as a fertil-
izer, but in many places they are under
the ban, because they have been accused
of ruining groves and pineapple planta-
tions. It is very probable however, that
it was the organic acids in the muck that
'were responsible for the damage, and if
those who have thus basely slandered
muck will try a liberal applica-
tion of lime, and by liberal I mean enough
to make a fair sample of the mixture show
an alkaline and not an acid reaction. there
is good reason to believe that their slander
will be turned into praise.
WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THIS ACIDITY IN
FLORIDA sous?
As was pointed out in the early part
of this paper Florida soils are generally
very deﬁcient in lime, and likewise in a
number of other bases, and this in itself
may explain, in part at least, why our
soils have a tendency toward acidity.
There being a scarcity of bases to neutral-
ize the organic acids formed by decaying
organic matter, the acid tendency prevails.
Moreover, the large quantities of com-
mercial fertilizers that we are constantly
using undoubtedly tends to aggravate this
condition. There are present in most soils
hydrated silicates, and non—acid organic
compounds which have a strong afﬁnity
for sodium, potassium. calcium, and mag-

nesium. When these bases are dissolved
by the soil waters, or when they are added
in alkaline compounds, they immediately
combine with these neutral constituents—
silicates and non-acid organic compounds
—and thus the soil is prevented from be-
coming alkaline until the above mentioned
aﬁinity is satisﬁed. This condition, while
harmful to sensitive plants, is probably not
so harmful as the presence of free acids
or acid salts. Further than this, there
is good evidence going to show that the
reaction which takes place between cer-
tain of these soil constituents and added
chlorides and sulphates, produces positive-
ly acid salts. There can be but little doubt
that it is due, partly at least, to the acidity
thus produced, that the injury arising
from the use of chlorides and the sulphate
of ammonia on neutral or acid soils is to
be ascribed. It was found in experiments
at the Rhode Island Experiment Station
with different forms of nitrogen on acid
soils. that sulphate of ammonia was pos-
itively poisonous to plants when it was
not used in connection with lime. When
the acidity of the soil was corrected by ap-
plications of air-slaked lime, the sulphate -
of ammonia was beneﬁcial. This beneﬁ-
cial effect is attributed to the fact that the
lime restored the alkaline condition of
the soil necessary to the transformation
(by nitriﬁcation) of the sulphate of am-
monia into nitrates, so necessary to most
crops. I would not therefore, recom-
mend a reduction in the amount of fertil-
izers to be used, but would remedy the
evil by a liberal application of lime once
in two or three years, or oftener if found
necessary.
The causes above mentioned are gen-
eral : there may also be local causes which
are responsible for this acid tendency. In
some parts of the State sulphur water(wa-
ter containing hydrogen sulphide, H1 S)
is used for irrigating purposes. Now
when hydrogen sulphide gas comes in con-
tact with air, the hydrogen unites with
oxygen to form water; but it is also true
that some of the sulphur may be oxidized
to sulphuric acid, and where this system of
irrigation is carried on for years at a time,
keeping the ground wet during a good
part of the year, the accumulations of sul-
phuric acid and sulphates may reach con-
siderable proportions. Under such con-
ditions injury to crops may eventually be
expected, unless lime is used in liberal
quantities. A statement made to me re-
cently by a celery grower of Sanford
would seems to bear out this theory. He
said that a few years ago only a few
barrels of lime were used in Sanford, but
that now the market could scarcely supply
enough. No doubt this increased de—
mand is partly due to the increased acre-
age. but it is no doubt also due in part,
to the fact that the growers are learning
that without it they cannot get good re-
sults. This same grower said that he
used about a ton to the acre. Notwith-
standing this fact, a test of sevenal soils
at this point, his among others, showed an
acid reaction. Examples of the oxidation
of sulphides, with the formation of sul-
phuric acid, are to be found in the vicinity
of coal mines. Whole tracts of land have
become pnactically sterile from having
been saturated with water containing free
acid and ferrous sulphate formed by the
oxidation of iron pyrites.
WILL THE CONDITION OF FLORIDA SOILS
BE IMPROVED BY THE USE OF LIME?
On this point also there has been no
systematic investigation, but if the sandy,
sour soils of Rhode Island and Massachu-
setts, of France, England, and Germany,

and of Virginia and Mississippi, have re-
sponded well to the use of lime, then there
seems good reason to believe that the
same will be true of Florida soils. De-
tached instances might be given showing
the value of lime on Florida soils. I have
noted Bermuda grass growing luxuriantly
where a mortar bed had formerly been
located, and where plaster had been
thrown out and ashes scattered, when
only a few feet away where the soil had
not been thus treated, it was difﬁcult to get
the grass to grow. As already noted, the
celery growers of Sanford are using large
quantities of lime and say they cannot pro-
duce crops without it.) Perhaps almost
every one has noted the more luxuriant
growth of vegetation on spots where piles
of logs and brush have been burnt, and
while this is perhaps due in part to the
potash contained in the organic matter, it
is no doubt due also to the fact that the
lime in the ashes has neutralized the acid—
ity of the soil.
LIM E SOM ETIM ES IN] URIOUS.
Excessive amounts of lime may have
an injurious effect on almost any crop,-
while any excess of lime whatever seems
injurious to a few plants. Under some
conditions, too, lime seems to favor the
production of the potato scab. For these
reasons it is important that judgment be
used in the application of lime to the soil.
If lime is used directly with sulphate of
ammonia, ammonia gas will be set free
and lost. It may, however, be used direct-
ly with nitrate of soda and organic fer-
til-izers.
FORMS OF LIME TO USE.
W'here the neutralization of acidity is
the only object to be sought, caustic or
quick lime will probably be more economi-
cal, since fewer pounds are required.
However, quick lime, slaked or hydrated
lime, and air slaked lime, or carbonate of
lime, are probably equally effective pound
for pound of actual lime.
Marl is a form of carbonate of lime
and contains from 5 to 95 pounds of car-
bonate of lime per hundred pounds of the
material. A good quality of mar] would
prove quite effective in correcting soil
acidity, its effectiveness depending on the
ﬁneness of the material.
Phosphate of lime, that is phosphate
rock, when ﬁnely ground has also been
found effective on acid soils. This is
valuable not only on account of its neu-
tralizing effects on acid, but also on ac-
count of the phosphoric acid which it con-
tains, the phosphoric acid gradually be-
coming available after having been in the
soil for some time.
THE LIT MUS TEST.
This must be made with considerable
care, else erroneous results may be se-
cured. The following method if careful-
ly carried out will give satisfactory results.
Having secured from a drug store
strips of both blue and red litmus paper,
take one or two ounces of the soil to be
tested, moisten in a clean glass or cup
with pure vwater (water that will change
the color of either paper must not be
used), bringing the mass to about the
consistency of thick paste. After allow-.
ing this to stand about ﬁfteen minutes.
part the soil in two places with a clean
knife blade and insert a strip of each
kind of paper, carefully pressing the soil
against the paper with the point of the
knife. Allow to stand for about ﬁve min-
utes then remove and wash off adhering
particles of soil with the pure water. If
the blue paper has become red, or shows

red spots, the soil is acid; if the red has
been turned blue, the soil is alkaline, and
if neither has been changed the soil may
be neutral. Do not put the ﬁngers or
hand upon the end of the paper that is to
be placed in the soil.
DEFINITE EXPERIMENTS.
T'he Experiment Station is beginning
some systematic work with reference to
the effect of lime on acid soils, and we
hope at no distant day to be able to report
some deﬁnite results.
We shall be glad of the cooperation of
any of the members of this society who
are interested in the subject.
Principles in Tree Pruning.
By H. Harold Home.
I” 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
To understand the underlying princi-
ples of pruning, we should know some-
thing of the structure of the trunk of the
tree, and its branches. If we examine a
cross section of the wood of an old! tree,
we note in the centre, the pitch surround-
ed by the heart wood. Around this is a
band of sap wood and outside of all a
protecting cover, the bark. just between
the bark and sap-wood lies the cambium
layer in which all growth takes place.
From it, wood is formed on‘one side and
bark on the other.
WHERE A BRANCH STARTS.
Branches always develop from buds
and, where produced normally, the branch
is formed from a bud developed the year
previous. In consequence the base of the
branch is generally one year younger than
the part of the tree on which it grows.
We commonly refer to the portion of the
branch extending into the wood as a knot.
This knot has its origin at the pith. If
we examine a section cut through the
branch and the trunk on which it grows,
we will note that the grain of the knot
runs to the center of the tree.
From this we learn the lesson, that if
for any reason the branch should die and
rotting should commence, that the rot
will extend along the knot into the center
of the tree and there continue its work
in the trunk.
THE HEALING OF THE WOUND.
With the removal of the branch all in-
ner portions of the tree are exposed by
the wound made. The bark being re-
moved, the wood is laid bare and decay
has an opportunity to begin its work.
Every tree in healthy, active growth
makes an effort to cover over the wound.
The healing does not take place over the
whole surface. A tiny ring, or cushion of
woody tissue protected by bark, is thrown
out from the cambium layer all around
the wound. This is called the callus.
This callus gradually shoves out, increases
in size and! ring after ring of growth is

added until the wound is covered. If the
wound is small this may be done in a
single season, but if large it will take
several years. .
THE STUB.
If a branch is cut off a few inches from
the tree the cut end of the stub does not
generally heal over. There is no life in
it, it dies back and acts as a foreign body.
In ninety-nine per cent of cases, the tree
makes an effort to heal over the wound at
the base of the stub. It is impossible how-
ever for it to succeed as the tree cannot
exert suﬁicient pressure to cut it off and
the callus frequently forms a mound
about its base.
The stub usually disappears in time by
rotting oFf and the result is a knot hole.
The ﬁrst principle in pruning is to leave
no stubs.
KNOT HOLES.
When the stub rots away, leaving a
knot hole, the rain enters, sand and dirt
are blown into it. Sufﬁcient soil is fre-
quently formed for plants to grow in it.
Everything favors the extension of the
rotting process. The ‘heartwood in the
trunk and branches sometimes even down
into the roots is destroyed. A strong
wind blows the tree over, and we wonder
why it fell.
The rotting of the wood is not due to
chemical or atmospheric action. It is due
to minute plants—fungi and! bacteria.
These live and grow in the wood and
bring about its destruction. The fruiting
parts of some of the fungi are quite large.
those of the shelf fungi for instance.
WHERE TO CUT.
We have learned that the stub is objec-
tionable and injurious to the trees in that
it prevents the healing process. Leave no
stubs. Make the cut as close as possible to
the part that is to remain and in making
the cut hold the saw parallel to the branch
or trunk from which the branch is remov-
ed.
The cut should be as smooth as it is pos-
sible to make it. It heals better.
TO PREVENT SPLITTING.
If the branch is large and heavy, an
accident often occurs in close cutting.
When the branch is half cut off, its weight
causes it to split and frequently the injury
extends down along the trunk of the tree.
This may be prevented by making a cut
on the underside of the branch half way
through it a foot or two out from the
trunk. Then on the upper side three or
four inches farther out another cut should
be made half way through. The branch
will drop off. The resulting stub can
then be cut off where it should be.
WOUND PROTECTION.
A wound has been made and the inner
portion of the tree is exposed. how can
rotting be prevented? By covering the
cut surface with something which will
prevent the entrance of decay. The most
desirable substance is one which will stick
well, wear well and at the same time not
interfere with the healing process. As a
dressing for tree wounds many different
materials have been used, such as shellac,
grafting wax, tar and paint.
Ordinary grafting wax is not good, it
curls up around the edges and peels oﬁ’.
A formula used by Mr. W. S. Hart is ex-
cellent: One pound of resin and two
ounces of tallow; melt these and mix
thoroughly. Remove from the ﬁre and

103
after cooling slightly, "add slowly six
ounces of alcohol and one ounce spirits of
turpentine.
Shellac likewise cracks and drops off;
tar is likely to prevent the healing process.
Of all the substances which have been
used from time to time no material so
nearly ﬁlls all the requirements of a
wound dressing as pure lead paint made
up with good oil. Sufﬁcient coloring
should be added to make the paint about
the color of the bark.
Paint the wound as soon as it is made
for no amount of paint will keep the
wound sound if rotting has already be-
gun.
TIME TO PRUNE.
It is not advisable to prune trees during
the time when the sap is in active motion.
At this time it is well nigh impossible
to properly protect the wound; the neces-
sary coat of paint will not stick to a sur-
face wet with sap, which has bled from
the tree. The best time to prune is during
winter and early spring before growth
starts. If it cannot be done then, the trees
should be pruned in spring just after they
are well out in the leaf.
PRUNING TOOLS.
Some people like to use an ax, but in
the hands of the average individual it is
a poor tool to use. About one man in
ﬁve hundred knows how to handle it. It
should be banished from the orchard and
the street. In the writer’s opinion the
only time that the ax should be used either
on a fruit or shade tree is when it is
vigorously applied just above the roots,
when it is deemed advisable to remove a
diseased or worthless specimen. The ax
is synonymous with hacks, cuts, stubs,
knotholes, rotten trunks, decayed trees
and general neglect. It is opposed to good
treatment, intelligent care and a true ap-
preciation of the needs and nature of a
tree. Banish it!
Get a good pair of pruning shears, a
pruning saw and knife. The dearest in
price are the cheapest. Keep them sharp
and with these the right sort of work
can be done.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Neeld—-—I think the best time to
prune a tree is after the sap has fallen and
the leaves have fallen. I would like to
have your idea. In connection with this
subject, I would like to say that our trees
lost their leaves in the freeze, and when
the leaves came forth again they were
little bits of leaves—they never developed.
That was largely because there was no
moisture in the soil. There were a great
many water sprouts, and they put on large
leaves.
Prof. \Hume—In reply to the ﬁrst ques-
tion as to the best time of pruning; an old
German adage says, “Prune apple trees
while in the bloom.” One of the best sea-
sons is after the tree comes out in full leaf,
speaking of trees that drop their leaves
in autumn. I do not believe in pruning
when the sap is moving in the trees, when
the wound is likely to bleed freely. If
we prune it at that time. we cannot get
our covering to stick. \Vait until the tree
comes out in full leaf. Either then or
prune when the tree is entirely dormant.
One of the things that makes spring
pruning the best. particularly if you are
desirous of removing dlead wood, is that
dead wood is much more easily found.

About those water sprouts you speak
of; I have seen a good many cases where a
tree had been severely injured, and these
water sprouts had come out with vigorous
leaves on them. I think it is a good plan
to leave them there. I don’t know that I
would take them off at all.
Mr. Hart—It seems to me there are a
few more points that we might touch up-
on. Now, “water sprouts.” I would say
by all means let them grow and make
leaves just as quickly as you can. They
furnish lungs to the trees. If it is an or-
ange tree that has been cut back by a
freeze, and those sprouts are sour, let
them go until they get a good top on the
tree, then bud and lop the tops down but
don’t cut them off. The sap will ﬂow
to the highest buds and these sour sprouts
will, while bent to the ground, maintain
the large root system and growth until
we have a good sweet top there. When
the buds get well started, bend them out
and spread them out, making a wide tree.
They may be long and slim and apparently
of very little use, but bend them out and
do not cut them off. The result is that
you check the ﬂow of sap near the trunk.
Where the sap is checked it will push out
a new growth and in a little while you
get plenty of fruit, the limbs become
strong, other limbs surround these and
you get a symmetrical tree. The orange
tree will become a symmetrical tree in a
few years if given a chance and do it with-
out pruning to any great extent. There
are a few cases where it will be well to
nip in and in rare cases to cut a limb, but
I think it far better to force limbs in place
than to cut them off.
Now, in regard to stubs. There are a
few cases, perhaps, where it may be well
to leave a stub for awhile. For instance,
if we have a nursery tree of pretty good
size and lop the top down from above
the bud, when that bud is grown large
enough so that you can remove that old
top, it sometimes is best, I think, to cut
the old! wood off leaving quite a little stub,
and wait until the bud has gotten large
enough and has strength so that by cut-
ting the stub off close‘ just before the
spring or summer growth, it will becover-
ed up quickly and no serious wounds or
rotten wood remain in the tree. I ﬁnd it
practicable to do this in many cases where
trees have been injured in some way and
heavy pruning of partly dead wood has
to be done before renewed growth is
strong enough to cover woundls promptly.
Mr. Sheppard—I have found a pretty
good wound covering in coal tar. It keeps
out all the water. is ﬂexible and the
wounds will heal right up.
Mr. Hume—In my opinion, it is a very
unsafe thing to use. I have seen injury
done to the trees by it, and the healing of
wounds prevented by its use.
Mr. Sheppard—I have seen where it
has been beneﬁcial.
Mr. Hume—Some people still recom—
mend the use of gas tar, and the practice
is still prevalent in Europe, but has never
been followed to any extent in this coun-
try. I have used it on oak trees and it
works very nicely. On peaches and cher-
ries as well as some other fruits, I would
not use it.
Mr. Sheppard—{It works pretty, well on
orange trees. ‘
Prof. Hume—Some men I know had
the experience of killing some three hun-
dred trees with tar. You cannot convince
them that tar is all right.

Mr. Grifﬁng—Have you used shellac?
Mr. Hume—Yes, and it is very good
while it lasts, but it soon ﬂakes off.
Mr. Hollingsworth—I agree with Mr.
Hume on every point he has made, except
in the use of utensils. I pruned two or
three years with a saw and used the long
clippers and the hand pruner. I think I
have used] every outﬁt that any pruner ever
did use, and I must say I like an axe the
best. You can take a pruning axe and
grind it down very thin, and then after
you have had practice enough you can cut
exactly in the right place. Always strike
from the under side of the limb. I am
heartily in favor of the axe system over
any saw. A saw wound will hold more
water than an axe wound. It is the water
in the wound that causes the rot. It is
very much quicker also.
Report of Committee on Ornamentals.
By Mrs. E. S. Hubbard.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Let us imagine that we have chosen
our new home. Our house and buildings
are ﬁnished and our grounds are leveled
and ready for planting.
We have selected a spot in middle
Florida where the temperature occasional-
ly touches the frost mark, and where in
extreme seasons, ice is formed.
\Ve, therefore, must use plants and
shrubs that will thrive in our peculiar sit-
uation. The ﬁrst consideration is our
lawn. St. Augustine grass will prove
most satisfactory, for it resists cold weath-
er. When frequently clipped, it forms a
mat of bright green, and after a severe
freeze, it soon regains its freshness. It is
planted by slips and roots and is easily
destroyed when desired. Bermuda grass
thrives best on dry soil, but is browned
by frost in winter and is hard to eradi-
cate.
Our piazzas are furnished withsupports
for vines. Strips of poultry netting
three feet wide, are, at intervals, set up—
right two or three feet from the ground,
extending to the eaves. With this ar-
rangement, the beloved vines can be en—
joyed to the utmost, without injuring
buildings or interfering with the painter
in his work.
First in our list is Rhyncospermum
iasminoides. Its dark, ever green foliage
forms a thick screen during the winter.
In April, its profusion of dainty white
blossoms, transforms it into a drapery of
lacework. If allowed to do so, it will
reach the highest chimney with its trail of
graceful fragrance. Akebia qu-inata, its
characteristic foliage and its clusters of
ruddy purple blossoms lasting from early
March until May, must not be forgotten.
Chinese Wistaria, if kept in subjection
by persistent pruning, will give a wealth
of great, fragrant, purple pendants.

The English honeysuckle must not be
mistaken for the paler and rampant va-
riety which will not be satisﬁed
with its own space in the border,
but which will not be content unless
it overruns everything within reach
and even usuips the grass plot and
ruins the lawn. The English honey-
suckle, on the contrary, seldom suckers
and needs only occasional pruning. It
will reward the grower with bloom and
delicious perfume throughout the year.
The bark is red and the foliage dark
green. The buds are deeply roseate
without, and the ﬂowers are pure white
within, turning to cream color and ﬁnally
to a dull orange. In the early, dewy
morning, when the perfume of this honey-
suckle mingled with that of the Rhynoos-
perm-um and Magnolia ﬂoat through the
open windows, the combination is ex—
Quisite beyond description.
We must not tarry too long with the
vines, but mention in brief succession,
Bignonia venusta, that glorious vine
with its masses of ﬂame colored trumpet-
ﬂowers; another variety with wax-like
ﬂowers of white and canary. and still an-
other rightly named the Gloria, with large
throated blossoms of delicate lavender,
veined with purple. These vines are har-
dy, enduring any cold which visits this
section, and also thriving during the heat
of the long summer.
Many tropical vines can be successful-
ly grown here. We must expect them to
be cut back, sometimes, by cold weather.
They spring up again as if by magic, and
seem even beneﬁted by the disaster.
Among these are Clerodendron Balfouri,
Antigonon leptopus, the showy Rosa de
Montana from Mexico, the climbing Alla-
manda with great golden ﬂowers, so very
noticeable at Miami; Thunbergia frag-
rans with snowy blossoms and graceful
twining stems, and Bougainvillea, Thun-
bergia grandiﬂora, a very elegant climber,
has large, white-throated. sky hue ﬂowers
and handsome foliage. Lastly, I will rec-
ommend Cobea Scandens and its large
purple bells always in bloom. Its method
of climbing is unique, for it attaches itself
to supports by clinging tendr-ils growing
at the ends of its compound leaves.
Our list of shade and ornamental trees
begins with the evergreen oaks which
need neither praise nor description. Fol-
lowing the oaks are Magnolia grandiﬂora,
lo‘blolly and sweet bay, umbrella tree, syc-
amore, one of our grandest native trees;
Vitex or chaste tree, with purple spikes
and whose palmate leaves smell of laven-
der; the starry leaved sweet gum, Ilex or
American holly; scarlet maple whose bril-
liant red seed pods appear in midwinter;
and lastly the Liriodendron tulipfera,
whose oddly cut leaves and large, showy.
tulip-shaped ﬂowers have given it its
name of tulip-tree.
Cornus canadensis, or white ﬂowered
dogwood is most charming with its level
masses of foliage and bloom. It savors
of the picturesque having a marked indi-
viduality. In the same class will be found
Camellia Japonica, so prized for its large
perfect ﬂowers, and Azalea Indica, whose
wondrous display of lovely blossoms of
an inﬁnite variety of shadings and col-
ors is a marked feature of northern Eas-
tertide. Magnolia fuscata and some va-
rieties of Magnolia from China and Ja—
pan which are 'deciduous, and whose ﬂow-
ers are richly colored with rose and pur-
ple, are very desirable. Olea fragrans or
sweet olive mus-t be included. for the
unctuous perfume of its small clustered

white bloom is unique and delicious, and
it will group well with Judas tree or red
bud and Gardenia fragrans both single
and double.
The trees and shrubs which I have
chosen are perfectly hardy and will give
entire satisfaction.
Among some tropical shrubs which
grow again after frosts, are Pleroma pur-
purea. Tabernamontana, night bloom-
ing jasmine and the charming group of
Hibiscus.
We associate palms with the tropics.
The following species, however, have
been thoroughly tested and! ,we can
safely plant them; Cocos Australis, S'abal
palmetto, our own cabbage palm, and also
another hand-some variety from Cuba,
Chamoerops Excelsa, Chamoerops
humilis, Phoenix Canariensis and Phoe-
nix sylvest'ris. Lamnia Borbonica, and
Phoenix dactylifera, our date of com-
merce, are sometimes nipped by severe
freezing but we must risk something for
their beauty and in the latter for its fruit.
These palms will make trees; some of
them growing to a height of 40 feet or
more. They, with many others, are now
growing in the grounds of the late E. H.
Hart at Federal Point.
We must not overlook some very
charming acaulescent palms and their
kindred. Chamoerops hystrix or needle
palm growing wild in many parts of
Florida and also near Savannah, Ga.,
must be planted in the shade of tall palms,
and it will then send out a host of glossy
leaves with long slender stems. admirable
for cutting. Cycas revoluta cannot be sur-
passed when well grown. Cycas circin-
alis, a more tender variety, is exquisitely
beautiful. '
Some fourteen years ago, in June, we
107
made a trip .on the St. Johns river on the
steamer “City of Jacksonville.” As we
went into the brilliant light from the out-
side darkness, we were dazzled by a vision
of color and} beauty. On a table in the cen-
ter of the salon, where the light fell upon
them from above, was placed a wonder-
fully beautiful arrangement of aquatics.
In the center was a large bowl of great
glowing blood red water lilies, wide open
and in bud—Nymphea Zanzibarensis, the
large night blooming water lily from
Zanzibar. On either side, and around,
were bowls ﬁlled with smaller blos-
soms; pale blue, white, yellow and blush,
all with foliage. A stand, near by, was
devoted to a single specimen. It was
ﬂoating in a large bowl. Its abundant,
shining, dark green leaves and spikes of
buds and open ﬂowers, lilac shaded with
purple and a dash of yellow. attracted
universal attention.
Mr. Fuller, who was taking this charm-
ing collection from his home, Edgewater
on the St. Johns, to his summer home in
New York. told us that this interesting
plant which he viewed with pride, was
Eichornia crassipes, a new, rare aquatic,
and that he had paid $10.00 for a small
plant some time before. It had, however,
increased so enormously that he had
thrown several cart loads of it into the
St. Johns river, and he wondered if it
would grow there. You doubtless recog-
nize that plant, which so greatly admired
by some, is heartily detested by others—
the water hyacinth.
The most fascinating of all garden
beds, our water lily pond, is made by dig—
ging out the earth to a depth of 2 or 3
feet and cementing the excavation. Put
a layer of muck and sand at the bottom
and ﬁll with water.

Our rose garden, to which we turn
when wishing to express regard or sympa-
thy with others, by sprays, or a basket
perhaps of fragrant roses, must be care~
fully planned. Mrs. McCarty has given
us in her report for 1905, most complete
and valuable directions for planting and
caring for roses. My list will include
Bride and Bridesmaid, American Belle,
Richmond, Andre Schwartz, Kaiserin
Augusta Victoria, Madam Lambard, Pa-
pa Gontier, Madam Cochet, La France
both pink and white, Cecil Bruner, Duch-
ess de Brabant and Magna Charta. Climb-
ers Devoniensis, Gloire de Dijon, Chrome-
tela or cloth of gold, Reve d’or, Madam
Peary or climbing Kaiserin, Adlelia Prae-
del and climbing Meteor.
These roses are well adapted to our cli-
mate and conditions. M'adam Lambard is
“unsurpassed as a general utility rose.
' During the entire year this rose with Ce-
cil Bruner and Duchess de Brabant will
continue to give us ﬁne buds and ﬂowers.
Even the thrip, that inveterate rose pest,
has little taste for these three varieties.
In our planting and arrangement we
must give due attention, not only to detail
but also to general and harmonious effect.
From the lists which I have given, com-
binations and groupings can be made of
inﬁnite variety.
I will close with mention of that won-
drous vine, so dear to tourists and so faith-
ful in its efforts to adorn the waste places
as well as the gardens. The native ﬂora
of Florida would lack its crowning glory
in the absence of the Yellow Jessamine.
Report .of Committee on Peaches, Plums and Pears.
By Aubrey Frink.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have not prepared any paper on peach-
es. pears and plums, for the reason that I
could not get, prior to coming here, just
the information that I wanted. I under-
stand that Mr. Shooter is now in Europe,
and] today I talked to Mr. Klemm and he
has no report to make.
This season has been a hard one on
peaches as well as oranges. In fact, for a
year they have suffered. Last year being
wet, was 'hard; then coming that severe
cold at Christmas time which alone would
not have done so much damage, but com-
bined with wet weather and succeeding
dry weather, together with the April cold,
has done a great deal of damage to peach-
es. From information th-at I can get, it
seems that the crop is very short. Some
people claim that their crop will not “be
more than twenty-ﬁve per cent. At some
places around Lake Helen and DeLand
the per cent is a little better. The trees,
also suffered 'a great many offsets on ac—
count of the cold, wet and drought.
However. I do not think that they are in
any worse shape than the oranges, which
suffered by drought and cold.

Now, as far as varieties are concerned,
there are four or ﬁve varieties that do well
and are a good market kind. Perhaps
the one entitled to ﬁrst place is the Jewel.
That is planted more largely, perhaps,
than all others combined. Following that
is the Waldo. Those two peaches are
very similar; in fact I doubt if you could
tell much, if any, difference either in size,
quality or appearance, except that the
Jewel is a triﬂe larger and is also from ten
days to two weeks earlier. This is one of
the arliest varieties we have, making it
on that account a desirable market variety.
It is also a free stone.
Then come the varieties of the Bidwell-
Peento type; Bidwell Early, Maggie, Su-
ber and} Yum Yum, which are very similar
in appearance, character and tree growth
and time of ripening, being right along
with the Jewel. These are cling stones.
The Peento and Honey types are far
preferable, in fact, the only ones that give
us our market peaches. Those of mixed
strain like the Jewel and Waldo, also seem
to be preferable. The Peento seems to be
a more vigorous grower, making a longer
lived tree than the honey. They are on a
par with our native seedling trees in
vigor.
As far as pears go, I do not think that I
have anything new to say. Pear growing
is all right if you can keep out the blight,
but I do not know of any remedy or any
preventive. About the best thing seems
to be non-cultivation. The two varieties
grown most generally are the LeConte
and the Keiﬂer.
As far as plums are concerned, there is
a general opinion that they do not do well
in Florida; but this is a mistake for there
are several varieties of plums that do well.
The Excelsior was the original one intro-
109
duced some twelve years ago. This is a
cross between some variety of the Japan—
ese type and the Southern Chicksaw type
and bears very well. There is also the
Terrell plum. This is very similar to the
Excelsior; a triﬂe larger and I think of
a little better ﬂavor. Then there is a yel-
low variety, the Queen; also the Howe,
very similar to Excelsior; and a new va-
riety called Miller, which is later than any
of the others, but which is one that I think
will succeed very well in Florida. The
Excelsior has been tried and proven very
satisfactory. The others are comparative-
ly new, but being similar in tree growth
and of the same type, I think they will do
well throughout the whole state.
Mr. Hampton—“That about the Rival
peach?
Mr. Frink—I am not so well acquainted
with that. I understand it is very similar
to the Hall’s Yellow. Hall’s Yellow has
not been a success commercially. It was
planted a good deal a few years ago, but
for some reason or other it has not made
a demand. The demand for that class of
peaches has fallen off very considerably.
At one time we could not furnish near
enough trees to supply the demand, but
now we have to be careful not to over-
stock ourselves.
Mr. Gibbs—What is the matter with
the Dorothy, or the Angel?
Mr. Frink—The Dorothy is good, but
for market purposes I think it is a little too
late. The Angel peach is a good peach,
and a pretty one—a little acid for some
tastes, and perhaps a little late for the
best market. It comes a little too near the
season of the Georgia peach.
Mr. Gibbs—What time would you
think an early peach would begin to ripen?
Mr. Frink—That is a little hard to

answer. The different seasons makes
them ripen at different times.
Mr. Gibbs—VV hen I left home on
Saturday, the Angel peach was almost in
full, brilliant coloring. I think that is a
little early.
Mr. Hart—The Suber, how about that?
Mr. Frink—That is one of the best and
should have been included in the list of the
Bidwell varieties.
Mr. Penny—I would like to ask about
what time would be the best to plant the
Excelsior plum.
Mr. Frink—That question might cover
a good many different kinds of trees-—
generally, the late fall or early winter. I
consider December the best month.
Member—I have an Excelsior plum
tree in my yard which has borne well for
four successive years, but for the last two
years it 'has been rather shy. I have ex-
cused this, though, on account of the ex-
treme weather conditions. I have some
other trees of different varieties of plums
that have not given me a quart of plums
in twenty years. The Excelsior is the
one that has always given the best satis-
faction, in my experience.
Mr. Longwood—Do you know any-
thing about the Satsuma plum?
Mr. Frink—It is very erratic. Some
report great satisfaction while with others
the results are unfavorable. Around
Tampa, I understand they do fairly well.
It is something like the Kelsey. I would
not advise planting it generally.
Mr. Penny—I would like to ask the
gentleman who said! his Excelsior plum
did well, what kind of land he has.
Member—It runs about four feet of
yellow sand. After that, clay phosphate
below, and water on an average of ﬁfteen
feet.
Mr. Penny—D0 you think they would
do well on low land?
Member—I have tried all kinds of
land, but I don’t know that I can tell you
exactly what the solution is for the plum
problem. It seems to be a very erratic
kind of a tree, and they sometimes do well
or ill for no apparent reason at all. Some
graft pears on the wild! haw and say they
do well.
Mr. Neil—A man in my county told me
to spray with the Bordeaux mixture and
I would always have a good crop.
Mr. VVaite—I have succeeded in bold-
ing the fruit better this year than before,
and I spraved with the Bordeaux.
Mr. Frink—Now, if you take a peach,
for instance, that is a native of a different
country and bring it down here, it is al-
most impossible to make it bear. Occa-
sionally you can get a few fruit, but as a
general proposition, it never is very suc-
cessful. I think the Kelsey plum is out
of its proper environment.
Mr. Hudson—lHow can you get a peach
that will mature later in the season, say
in August?
Mr. Frink—There are varieties that
will do that, largely of the native Spanish
type. There are several of those peaches;
just now I do not recall any of the names.
It is hard to get them to bear so well
when budded as when they are seedlings;
that is, speaking of the Spanish type.
Probably one of the best here is the Estel-
la, which is very late and, under favorable
conditions, bears well.

Strawberry Culture.
- By I. M. Brownlee.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The soil furnishes anchorage for the
roots of the plants, and a reservoir for
food and moisture. It makes almost no
difference to the plant whether the soil be
light or heavy, sandy or clay, so long as
these objects are accomplished. The plant
lives on the food it ﬁnds in the soil and
not on the soil itself. It is true that the
strawberry—like any other crop—must
generally thrive best on rich sandy loam.
But is this not the ideal soil for any crop?
It holds fertilizer and moisture, but is not
easily puddled. It becomes sufﬁciently
compact without getting hard or lumpy
and it admits air. These qualities are es-
sential and they can usually be had with
less labor and care in sandy loam than in
any other soil. Here in Bradford county
you may see all kindls of soils planted to
strawberries, from low stiff, to high sandy
loam. and with little difference in the
yield. I don’t believe there is any crop
grown that is less particular than the
strawberry about the kind of soil on which
it is grown, not even grass.
KIND OF BERRIES GROWN.
There is very little discussion to be had
on the berry most grown here, as the
Klondyke is grown almost exclusively
throughout Florida. There may be a few
Lady Thompsons grown here, but very
few indeed. The Klondyke was origi-
nated in Louisiana some years ago. It has
a very vigorous bush, free from rust or
blight, and a very dark green foliage.
The fruit is simply perfection, being large
and exceedingly high colored, and very
ﬁrm, which makes it a good shipper.
This berry was introduced here about
six years ago, and has held its own better
than any other variety ever planted here.
The Klondyke is a very proliﬁc berry.
When we have anything like a good sea-
son you may expect anywhere from nine-
ty to one hundred and ten bushels per
acre.
PREPARATION OF LAND AND METHOD OF
CULTIVATION.
In preparing land for strawberries, it
is very essential to have your ground free
from grass and well pulverized, for when
you make your ground up you do not
want any cavities underneath the plant.
It makes it difﬁcult in getting plants to
live, and even if they should live over a
cavity, the plant will be a shy bearer. I
usually plant berries after oats; plow in
the oat stubbles before the grass comes
through and then keep it thoroughly disk-
ed until ready to bed, which may be from
july 15th to September Ist, just as you
may choose. In bedding my ground, I
use eight and one-half feet for bed, and
put four rows of berries to the bed, make
the two center rows 18 inches apart and
outside rows 22 inches from center rows.
The cultivating is done with a hoe and
hand cultivator. Run the hand cultivator
about once a week if the ground is wet.
This keeps the ground loose and prevents
grass from coming through. I use a
horse cultivator to plow out my water
furrows.


## p. 112 (#486) ############################################

112
FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
It is very essential to keep the ground
well pulverised to prevent it from forming
a crust on top and thus drying out too
easily .
BEST METHOD OF MARKETING.
Marketing the berry crop is a very difﬁ-
cult matter. Almost anyone can grow
them, but when it comes to marketing
them it takes one who has studied the con—
ditions for several years. My method is
to select one good reliable commission
house in each city that I expect to ship to
(I use New York, Philadelphia and
Boston for my markets) and ship to him
regularly. It is well to have berries on
the market every day if you possibly can.
Put up your berries in good honest pack-
ages and mark your name on the crate
and it will not take your commission man
long to secure a good tracile on your fruit;
one that the trade will call for. Or, if
you expect to sell to buyers at your own
town, it is best to put up honest packages
and you will never have any trouble in
selling. The buyers soon learn who puts
up good berries and are always ready to
buy that kind.
GROWTH AND EXTENT OF INDUSTRY IN
THE STATE.
The strawberry industry has grown
wonderfully in this state in the last few
years. Ten or twelve years ago the ship-
ments from this county on the heaviest
days were no more than from three to
four hundred bushels, while last year its
heaviest day would reach ﬁve or six
thousand bushels. Last year there were
$9,000.00 worth of berries sold at Starke
on the wharf in a single day, besides
several hundred bushels shipped on con-
signment. The net sales to the growers
of this county last season were between
$350,000 and $400,000, and there seems
to be no limit to the industry. Several
years ago, I thought that the market
would be glutted if we grew too many
berries, but last season, with our large
supply of berries, there was a continued
cry for more berries.
DIFFICULTIES AND DRAVVBACKS OF STRAW-
BERRY INDUSTRY.
The principal diﬁiculty in the straw-
berry industry is the drought in the sum-
mer in the setting season. The plant is
very delicate, and unless we have plenty
of rain during the setting season it is
very diﬁicult to get a stand, and in order
to get a good yield we must have a good
stand of nice large bushes, as a small bush
can never produce the fruit a large one
will. We sometimes have a drought dur-
ing the picking season that also hurts us
very much as it makes the fruit small and
of an inferior quality. The blight gener-
ally strikes us during the dry season. An
insect (commonly known as the thrip)
often sucks the bloom and kills it and
then they work on the small berries. I
have seen them ‘dlestroy an entire fruit
crop.
We sometimes have a late freeze that
destroys a great quantity of fruit, but we
can’t call this a drawback as it is most
generally to our advantage as it keeps
berries back nonth of here.

Report From Pinellas Fruit Growers’ Association.
By Mr. I. G. Julian, President.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
This association started here among the
pineapple and then the orange growers
took it up here, forming the Orange
Growers’ Association some four or ﬁve
years ago. We have the meetings quar-
terly the ﬁrst Saturday of each month of
March, June, September and December,
which have proved very interesting to
some sixty or eighty. Every now and
then we say we must take all the orange
growers in, but all of them can’t get in at
the same time. I think we are on a per-
manent basis and at least 50 or 75 of the
orange growers would say_pmitively that
we are. We ﬁnd our quarterly meetings
very interesting. We generally have two
sessions on the days we meet; one in the
forenoon and one in the afternoon. Then,
if there is any special point that we want
to know more about, we call on the Ex-
periment Station for that speciﬁc point
and one of Prof. Rolf’s assistants comes
down. I believe the Prof. himself was
down here once and started to give us a
30 minute talk, but we were all so inter-
ested that when he ﬁnally did look at his
watch, he found he had barely time to
catch his train. We meet at different
points, Largo, Ozona, Clearwater, St.
Petersburg, so that if it is impossible for
some of the members to leave their homes,
the meetings are brought to them, and it
does not work a hardship on anybody.
We think it is a good organization for the
betterment and general diffusion of ideas.
New members are coming in all the time,
and I think it is now on a ﬁrmer footing
than it has been for the last four or ﬁve
years. We hope to make it a great good
and beneﬁt.
Prof. Rolfs—I can assure the meeting
that this Association is a wide-awake body
and as intelligent a lot of people as any-
one would want to see.
Report From Pasadena Farmers' Club.
By B. W. MeLain.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In response to the courteous notice from
your president that the Programme Com-
mittee had reserved a date for a report
from the Pasadena Farmers’ Club, I now
have the honor to introduce the Pasco
County Fledgling.
This 3—year-old Agricultural Society
was born September 24th, 1904, at the
residence of Mr. C. F. Gardner, on the
shores of Lake Pasadena.
Actuated by a common impulse of co-
operation and an earnest desire to master
the problems involved in agricultural
pursuits, twelve gentlemen and nine la-
dies organized the Pasadena Farmers’

Club and elected Mr. A. Roberts, Presi-
dent...\'Irs. C. F. Gardner, Secretary, and
Mr. Stephen Soar, Treasurer.
Monthly meetings have been held and
the ofﬁcers proven so satisfactory that they
have been annually re-elected; while the
membership has increased from 21 to 68,
with an average attendance of 30.
The distinguishing feature of this club
is its combinatitm of home and social in-
ﬂuences with the practical and scientiﬁc
discussion of the problems incident to ag-
ricultural life.
The ladies and children contribute most
effectively to the general entertainment as
evidenced by Master Butts, a sturdy 3-
year-old, who at our last meeting made
a happy hit of “My Country ’Tis of Thee”
and “I belong to the Band, boom! boom!”
The social relations are further pro-
- moted by meeting in turn at the homes of
members, each family bringing a basket
of lunch, which is assembled by the hos-
tess and spread in a home brewed dinner,
which is thoroughly discussed before the
purely practical and scientiﬁc subjects are
introduced.
“Well”, I hear you ask, “What has
been accomplished P” I answer,—First, a
method has been found to bind together
in a coherent group those interested in
the products of the soil so that their indi-
vidual development reacts one upon the
other, and the experience of the unit mem-
ber becomes the property and knowledge
of all.
Second, the animated discussions and
interchanges of practical experience have
already developed a strength and conﬁ-
denCe which will be eﬁ‘icient in originating
and shaping the new projects of irrigation
and culture. which must be perfected be—
fore general and liberal results can be ob-
tained by Florida farmers.
Third, a power has been organized and
a spirit developed which enables the farm-
er to get into closer touch with other or-
ganized workers and thinkers; and the
practical and personal assistance already
accorded us by members of the Agricul-
tural Station has had a marked inﬂuence
in awakening the interest and encourag-
ing perseverence in the work. I believe
that the ensuing three years will witness
an unprecedented development in Pasco
county.
It is eminently proper, in this connec-
tion, to note the intelligent, unwearying
and genial spirit of its President, Mr. A.
Roberts, who from its inception to the
present moment has studied its interests
and presided over its deliberations.
This brief sketch of the origin and poli-
cy of the club does not contemplate details
of the practical work done or a view of
the scientiﬁc and technical grounds cov-
ered.
I assume that the ofﬁce of presenting it
has come to me because of my very ear-
nest interest in all such matters rather
than any practical knowledge or exper-
ience of the subjects involved; and there-
fore, in bringing to you this greeting from
the Pasadena Farnir'rs’ Club I have at
once the honor and pleasure of introduc-
ing to you my associate delegates,—gen-
tlemen who are not unknown to you and
who. by long residence and practical ex-

Legislative Help.
Prof. Bartlett—I 'had not expected to
bring this matter up at the present time.
It is a matter of so much importance that
several of our people have desired me to
bring it before you, possibly through a
committee. I have spoken to some of the
older members in regard to this, and have
also spoken to some of the younger mem-
bers. There are three things I wish you
to consider. One of the things is in re-
gard to the experiment station. \Ve
have an experiment station here, but we
get very little beneﬁt from it, compared
with what we ought to get. \Ve would
like help along the line of irrigation, es-
pecially the truck men and fruit growers,
better than what we are getting now.
We have to go up to the experiment sta-
tion and bring the men dow-n, paying
their expenses, and then when they have
just opened a little vista to our eyes, they
are gone. The people in the experiment
station are dloing all they can, but they
have a_lim-ited amount of money to do it
with. $15,000 is all that they get. Flor-
ida has never given them a dollar. Every
State in the Union is allowed $15,000
through the Hatch Bill for an experiment
station. I suppose our state gets $15,000
because every state is entitled to that. All
through the west they are giving many
dollars. In Illinois, in Wisconsin, in
Nebraska. and in Kansas, they are doing
great things for their agricultural experi-
ment stations. \N here they put out thou-
sands of dollars, they have been taking
in millions. We are doing very little,
and I think a sentiment should be stirred
up in the state so that the matter would
be taken up by our Legislature and! that
it would give us for this purpose at least
as much as the Government gives.
I understand there is a bill before the
Legislature now to give $5,000 for the
Farmers’ Institute and $30,000 for build-
ings needed by the Experiment Station,
and I think it is the duty of every agri-
culturist to see that it does not fail. Our
State has great prospects in agricultural
and horticultural lines, and I think we
should use every means in our power to
realize these prospects.
The Interstate Com-merce Commission
is doing a great deal for the whole coun-_
try. California has done a great dleal for
itself because of its compact organization.
we want to do the same. We want to
go before the Interstate Commission and
get them to co-operate with us. We
should have a committee appointed to go
before them and see that we get what we
want. \Ne ought to have half the ship-
ping rate we are getting now.
\Ve had an appropriation from Con-
gress for $5,000 last year with which to
ﬁght the white ﬂy, and $10,000 this year.
The State has not been doing enough.
Congressman Sibley has done all that one
man could do and our Congressmen Mr.
Sparkman and Mr. Clark, have co-oper-
ated with him and they have been able to
get this $10,000. The United! States
Government comes in and helps us, and
we do nothing. Now, our Legislature
should do something to eradicate this
curse of orange culture. Let us show
that we are interested ourselves and give

our legislators no peace until we get some
help from them:
These are the three things, and I ask
that you have a committee of ﬁve appoint-
ed to look into these several propositions
and report on them and the advisability
of presenting and handling them. I put
it in the form of a motion.
Motion secondedt
Mr. Painter—A good many members
will probably remember that Mr. Hart
at two different meetings put in a resolu-
tion somewhat to the effect that we want-
ed to get aid from the Government to
help ﬁght the blight. I went to \Vash-
ing’ton and presented it to Secretary Wil-
son myself. He said he wanted to do all
he could, but just then the appropriation
was all taken up and he said “What are
you doing yourselves ?” You can count
on his helping you and meeting you more
than half way on anything you will un—
dertake that will be of beneﬁt. He also
said, “If you will get your people to-
gether and] show that you mean some-
thing, then we will help you.”
Dr. Richardson—There are some
things that nobody can ﬁnd out. Mr.
Painter knows that. You know that this
Society has gone to the trouble time and
again of preparing bills to be presented
to the Legislature. Have they ever gone
through? No. I do not know what be-
came of them. Nobody else, it seems,
can ﬁnd out. We simply have apathetic
members, an apathetic society and an apa-
thetic political party. By that I mean the
men who are in control of the Legislature
of our state. I know of no better way to
wake them up than to wake up ourselves.
I think every member of this organiza-
tion should take it upon himself to see
that the legislature is ﬁxed. I don’t mean
ﬁxed in the political sense, because I do
not think that the horticulturists of this
state are in a position, ﬁnancially, to ﬁx
anybody. I do not think we should ﬁx
them as it is ordinarily understood, in the
underhanded way, but in a way that will
serve our purpose perhaps, better. I
mean by that in a way that will make
them think they are going to be ﬁxed
deﬁnitely and permanently and ﬁnally.
Let us ﬁx them in their political graves
if they do not do something for us.
I do not think we should be discour-
aged by our failures in the past but that
we should try again. I know of no bet-
ter time than right now, and I am heartily
in sympathy with the motion offered by
Mr. Bartlett, and hope that you will ap—
point a committee that will do something.
Let us get at the Legislature of the State
so that we may be able to report. if we de-
sire more help from the Government,
that Florida has at least done something
for herself. Let us ever bear in mind
the old adage that “the Lord helps those
who help themselves.” Let us help our-
selves ﬁrst and then apply to the Govern-
ment.
Prof. Bartlett—I think Dr. Richard-
son’s remarks are well put, and I think
we should get help from our own Legis-
lature before applying to the Govern-
ment. I was at a banquet where Mr.
Sparkman was present, and he said,
“What are you doing to help your-
selves?” Of course, there was nothing
that could be said.
Prof. Rolfs—I would like to say a ,
word in explanation. We have slightly
more funds than Mr. Bartlett spoke of,
on account of the creation of the Adams
Fund, but these are so circumscribed by
law that we must use this fund for origin-

a1 investigation only, and the work that
Mr. Bartlett wants done and that we all
want to do, is classiﬁed as F‘armers’ In-
stitute work and demonstration work; in
other words, putting into practice well
known principles, and where principles
are well known, the money received from
Congress cannot properly be used. How-
ever, the experiment station staff once in
a while, if it is possible to slip out to
some of these farmers’ gatherings, are
very glad to do so. When a body of
local agriculturists get together and! say
that they will pay our expenses, we are
very willing to go out and give them our
time. But we cannot justly charge ex-
penses for work of this kind to the funds
mentioned. The Federal Government is
this year expending something like $60,-
000 for agricultural work in the State of
Florida; that is, investigation work. You
are perhaps surprised at the amount.
There is the Hatch Fund, the Adams
Fund, a Subtropical Laboratory Fund
and the white ﬁy appropriation, in addi-
tion to the local demonstrations and] ex-
periments.
You will see where Mr. Tenny and Mr.
Powell and men of this stamp are costing
the Federal Government a great deal, and
you will see how much the Federal Gov-
ernment does and how little the State
does. Consequently, the federal oﬁicers
have the right to feel a little discouraged.
The people at Tallahassee are contem-
plating an appropriation to give to the
experiment station a home. I suppose
there is nothing more important than a
home. We have had none up to the
present time. This bill proposes about
$30,000 to be expended for the buildings
and $5,000 annually for Farmers’ Insti—
tutes.
Mr. Skinner—I was at Tallahassee sev-
eral years ago when one of t'he bills came
up that the Society recommended. The
difﬁculty seems to be that the Horticul-
tural Society seems to be identiﬁed with
the orange industry. The state of Flori-
da is much larger than the orange indus-
try. If you make the people in each part
of the State think that they are to be
beneﬁted by the passing of- a bill, it is
pretty likely to go through. They are
willing to pass any bill that does not call
for money. Let them all see that it is a
beneﬁt to the state, and I think there will
be no trouble.
Japanese Matting Industry for America.
Prof. Rolfs—I understand that the
ofﬁce of the Seed and Plant Introduction
is now looking for a place to plant the
Japanese matting rush, and we have their
agent with us this morning. Probably
you will be as interested as I am in this
matter, and I will be glad if Mr. Tull
will give us a few remarks.
Mr. Tull—The matting industry in.
America so far is very young; it is still
in its infancy. This is an entirely new
thing in America and the ofﬁce of Seed
and] Plant Introduction under the Bureau
of Plant Industry has recently taken it up.
The growing of this grass was tried by
private individuals but they made a fail-
ure. They succeeded in getting machin-
ery, but could not get raw material. They
went to China and Japan and ﬁnally se-
cured a number of plants and sent them

over here to be grown. Japan sent a
representative over here and found we
were trying to compete with them so they
immediately stopped our supply of straw.
The American Company sent a man to
Japan again and] got a small supply of the
Chinese straw and they are now making
a very ﬁne grade of matting but the sup-
ply of raw material is very limited. At
this point, the Department of Agriculture
took up the work of introducing these two
grasses from China and Japan.
Some experiments have been tried with
our native grasses on the coast of South
Carolina, principally in the abandoned
rice lands. The rice industry along the
Atlantic Coast, which at one time was so
thriving, has within the last ten years, en-
tirely died out on account of the rice in
. Louisiana and Texas being grown by the
use of machinery. The Department
thought that by introducing the matting
grass into North and South Carolina, they
might bring back into cultivation the
abandoned rice ﬁelds, but so far have
proved unsuccessful with the native grass-
es.
Last year we got a special appropria—
tion through to send a man to Japan to
get the roots. as the plant is propagated
in this way. I went to Japan last fall and
ﬁnally succeeded in getting a great many
roots of the two different kinds of Japan-
ese and Chinese roots. These roots were
ﬁnally landed at California but in very bad
condition, so to save them we left them at
Chico. Cal.. to grow for the summer. The
plants are now doing very nicely. We
are now planning to distribute those roots
next fall, beginning at Texas and running
along the Gulf into Florida and up into
South Carolina. The plant requires al-
most the same conditions that are re-
quired in rice culture. It is planted in the
winter and then water put on. The water,
with plenty of fertilizer, forces the plant
into a very long. slender growth. We
have arranged now for an experiment
with some Japanese in Texas who have
put out about one and one-half acres of it.
We wish to distribute the plants now at
Chico in two or three different places in
Florida as well as Texas. There is now a
ready market for the straw at $80.00 per
ton.‘ In Japan, the grass yields from four
to Six tons per acre.
The way the Chinese and Japanese
grow it is much cheaper than the methods
we would have to employ. The labor
conditions there are nothing compared to
what they are here. The plant is peren-
nial and you can put it in the ground and
leave it; with the_aid of water and the
proper use of fertilizer you can continue to
harvest year after year.
Our object is to ﬁrst ﬁnd out if the
grass will grow. Then we will have to
work it out by practice and ﬁnd out the
best methods of growing it. I will be
glad to answer any questions or talk to
anyone on the subject.
Mr. Hart—W'hat is the price of grow-
ing and preparing for market; putting it
in shape?
Mr. Tull—The two kinds of straw are
cured entirely different. Two days of
hot sunshine will cure it. The process of
curing in Japan is very crude and very
long compared to the way in which we
would have to do it. The grass is cut and
spread out in the ﬁeld. and after two days
of hot sunshine, the farmer considers it
cured.

Camphor for Florida.
W. O. Reichtmann—I regret that I
cannot make quite as explicit report as I
would like. Probably the thing that
most of you are interested in, is whether
camphor can be produced commercially
in the United States. The ﬁrst thing to
be ascertained is as to whether the plant
can be grown at all successfully or not.
The natives of Florida can probably
answer that question much better than I
can, as they have it here with them, and
have undoubtedly noticed the habits of
its growth. From the trees which are
present, it seems to me that there is but
one answer to this question, and that is,
that the tree can be grown, and grown
successfully.
The second point I would mention, is
as to whether the camphor tree as grown
in this country is producing camphor.
You have already had two reports, one
presented in 1896. by Henry Hubbard,
stating that he had received as high as
one and four-tenths per cent. of camphor
from the fresh twig of the camphor tree.
The second was from Dr. Walker, last
year. in which he presented some of the
work of the Department and the results
of his own personal experiments.
Our work has been conﬁned to Florida
and in California. but at the present time
we have not as yet found a single tree
but that an appreciable quantity of cam-
phor was contained in the leaves and
twigs of the tree. The amount of the
cam-phor does not compare with the
amount reported as being found in the
trees grown in its native condition. This
may be due to several reasons. The
chief reason is perhaps that we are work-
ing only one side of the matter and the
people of Formosa are working under
entirely different conditions. They may
be working on the basis of dry material,
and we on fresh material, which would
give a variation of sixty per cent. '
The last point to be mentioned, and
perhaps the most important point in con-
nection with the camphor work. is_the
camphor as produced in the United States
of a quality that it can be used commer—
cially. Samples of the camphor that have
been produced in Florida have been sub-
mitted to the trade for their own demon-
stration and observation. and the report
sent to the Department from the ﬁrms
who have been testing it, is, that they
would have thought it was from Japan or
Fomtosa if they had not known where
it came from.
Secondly, does it have all of the quali—
ties, physical and chemical, that the For-
mosa and Japanese camphor have? It
has. .
Lastly, I can only state that one ﬁrm-
has taken the matter up, and has started
planting a tract of three thousand acres
with camphor in your own state.
I regret that I cannot go into the de-
tails of the work and give you a more
detailed talk. This, I trust, may be done
in the immediate future.
Dr: Walker produces samples of cam-
phor.
Dr. W alker—I am not in a position to
give you much further information about
the matter. Mr. Reichtmann has taken
charge of the camphor plant. I am
doing my best to cultivate as much cam-
phor as I can. Mr. Wood is now in
charge of the work at Huntington. Dr.

Reichtmann has taken charge of the large
establishment at Satsuma.
I veriﬁed my own statement made last
year, and ﬁnd that camphor can be grown
more than successfully. The experiment
as far as it has gone, is perfectly satis-
factory. I'have written and advised peo-
ple to go into this, and a great many have
said that there could not be anything in
it, because if it was as good as I said, I
would want to keep it_all to myself. The
sample just displayed was made from
trees that I planted myself and had puri-
ﬁed in Washington, and is of a most
satisfactory nature. I can only say to
any of my friends who are interested in
' camphor—I fancy the best thing they can
do is to plant it.
Mr. Sheppard—What degree of cold
will a camphor tree stand?
Member—In Marion county, I have
not seen one that showed the slightest de-
gree of being injured by the cold.
Mr. Hart—Does the variety have any-
thing to do with its power to withstand
the cold?
Dr. Walker—I think the condition of
the tree at the time the frost comes has
more to do with it than anything else.
The leaves will stand a considerable
amount of cold and when they fall, retain
a considerable portion of their camphor.
From the very small amount of opportu-
nity we have had, we discovered that the
camphor makes its growth as a rule pret-
ty regularly. I have noticed a few that
have made a very irregular growth. A
peculiar advantage is that they will stand
more cold than an average orange tree,
and when cut down you can get your
camphor from the dead wood.

Necrology.
\
Report Submitted by G. L. Taber, W. S. Hart and Wm. C. Richardson.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
There are times in the lives of socie-
ties, as of individuals, when we are
called upon to cope, as best we may,
with the feelings that overwhelm us,
and to give expression, in some form,
however inadequate, to the esteem and
love and honor in which we hold our
departed dead.
This is one of those sad occasions
and our lips falter and the words we
grope for come haltingly and broken
and seemingly powerless to convey the
thoughts we would utter. We stand
apalled at the calamity that has over-
taken us. Since last we met our
honored and beloved President,
Charles Tobin McCarty and ﬁve others
of our highly esteemed number, have
passed into the Great Beyond. The
sad record! in chronological order is as
follows:
L. J. Sawyer of Tibballs, Saint Lucie
county, died at Oswego, N. 1., July
20th, 1906, aged sixty-eight years“
George Rainsford Fairbanks of Fer-
nandina, Nassau County, died at
Suwannee, Tennessee, August 3rd,
1906, aged eighty-six years.
Denis Redmond of Saint Nicholas,
Duval County, died at Jacksonville,
September 24th, 1906, aged eighty-two
years.
Abner Atwood of Pawtucket, R. I.,
died at his home in Pawtucket, Novem-
ber 23rd, 1906, aged eighty-two years.
Charles Tobin McCarty of Eldred,
Saint Lucie County, died at Fort
Pierce, January 30th, 1907, aged ﬁfty
years.
Henry George Sartorious of Semi-
nole, Hillsboro County, died at Las
Vegas, New Mexico, March 30th, 1907,
aged thirty-two years.
Your committee on Necrology, to
whom the sad duty was assigned, beg
to report the following resolutions:
Whereas, during the past year, death
has removed our beloved chief execu-
tive oFﬁcer and several of our most
worthy members, and
Whereas, it is due their honored
memory that ﬁtting tribute be paid
them and expression given to our deep
sense of loss, therefore,
Resolved, that in the death of
Charles Tobin McCarty, our society
has lost a President whom we loved,
an executive ofﬁcer of high ability, a
man, a brother and a friend who was
in every sense one of “God’s noble-
men;” that in the death of George R.
Fairbanks we have lost a zealous work-
er for the interests of our society, a
historian of note and an honored
Christian gentleman; that in the death
of Denis Redmond we have lost one of
our esteemed honorary members, who
for many years was noted in literary
work and zealous in horticultural pur-
suits; that in the death of Abner At-
wood, L. ]. Sawyer and H. G. Sartor-
ious, we have lost three of our worthy
and esteemed members.
Resolved that we extend our sym-

pathies to relatives and friends of these
deceased members.
Resolved that these resolutions be
spread upon our minutes; that suitable
memorial notices be printed in the
forthcoming Report of the Society;
that the same report shall be dedicated
to the memory of our deceased Presi-
dent, Charles Tobin McCarty, and that
this dedication so appear on the title
page.
CHARLES TOBIN McCARTY.

“Our self-made men are the glory of
our institutions.”

Charles Tobin McCarty was born at
Green Bay, Wisconsin, on February
24th, in the year 1857.
He came of blood which had proved
its staunchness amid the dangers and
hardships of a new land; he owed his
being to parents noted for energy of
brain and brawn, in a community
where each person must of necessity,
have possessed something of the he-
roic; he sprang from a race which could
not be moulded into unchangeable
austerity even by the exigencies of
pioneer life. He was the son of a
frontiersman and he early took upon
his young shoulders his share of that
father’s burdens. Here it was that his
inheritance from his Celtic ancestry
stood him in good stead. It made him
cheerful in the midst of difﬁculties; it
gave him the power to see poetical
beauty as well as practical opportunity
in the pine forests about him; it ﬁred
him with ambition, and whispered to
him continuously of great things to be
done in the world, even though that
world seemed an unconquerable wilder-
ness.
He was a boy in whose sturdy man-
liness his father felt a just pride, upon
whose gentleness his mother relied;
whose courage won the respect of his
brothers and whose courtesy made
glad the hearts of his sisters.
He gave of himself freely. of his
warm sympathy, of his mental activity,
and by this very generosity created
for himself a little higher plane; opened
up for himself the way along which he
resolutely trod toward loftier ideals.
He was, from his earliest years, con-
sumed with a thirst for knowledge, for
education, apparently realizing from
the ﬁrst that without this he could not
reach the heights on which he had
ﬁxed his eyes. Only those who are
acquainted with the limited education-
al advantages of the “’est in those
days, can appreciate the difﬁculties in
his way. \Vhatever they were he
surmounted them, and in 1878 entered
Tilford Collegiate Academy at Vinton,
Iowa, with so many credits that he
graduated from that institution a year
later.
In the class with him was Miss
Elizabeth Matter, whose record in
school work was equal to his own. As
he had been one marked and set apart,
so had she been a leader, a forceful,
independent spirit. Upon the stage
from which these two delivered their
addresses, they were made man and
wife, on the day of their graduation.
Life as they could see it ahead of them,
was not a path of roses, but they enter-
ed upon it conﬁdently, secure in the
knowledge of their tried powers, ani-
mated by kindred ambitions, and sure
that the depth of their affections would

not only help them overcome all pos-
sible diﬁ‘iculties, but would make the
struggle together, a real happiness.
Their faith was justiﬁed. The dark
days came, but they were not cast
down, for they had each other and that
to them, always meant more than any-
thing else.
The happiness of their home life, the
remarkable harmony of their union,
deeply impressed all who were allowed
the privilege of intimate association,
and the desolation of such happiness
weighs heavily on the hearts of their
friends.
In 1882 Mr. McCarty entered the
Law Department of the Iowa State
University, graduating with honor at
the close of his course. After devoting
I. year to the practice of his profession
he was induced to accept a professor-
ship at Tilford, where he remained un-
til 1888.
His work as a teacher was of a high
order, adding markedly to the strength
of the school and leaving an imperish-
able impression upon the minds and
hearts of the hundreds of young people
who came under his inﬂuence. His
power was felt outside as well as in-
side the class-room. He was friend
as well as instructor. He not only
drilled his students in the acquisition
of knowledge, but he interwove facts
with a broad philosophy, which gave
them warmth and vital signiﬁcance.
On February 19th of this year the
alumni of Tilford held a memorial
service in honor of their beloved
teacher. Hundreds attended and their
sincere sorrow showed that the years
had not lessened their regard for Mr.
McCarty, nor their appreciation of his
worth. Thus it is that fellow students
123
and pupils after an interval of twenty
years, declare that Mr. McCarty, “en-
riched and inspired their lives and
generously helped to lead them out to
broader and better ﬁelds.”
In the year 1888, driven by ill health,
he severed his connection with Tilford,
left a state where friends were legion,
and with his brave wife and three small
sons, began his struggle with the
wilderness of Southern Florida. In a
tiny clearing at what was then Ankona,
but is now Eldred, he built his humble
dwelling. On its site there now stands
a handsome residence, and the wilder-
ness has given place to broad, highly
improved acres. The mighty change
stands as a monument to his unusual
keenness of foresight. to his tireless
industry and his inflexible determina-
tion.
He entered into the cultivation of
his pineapples, not only with the
shrewd practicality of the business
man, but with the eagerness of the
earnest student entering a new ﬁeld of
knowledge. As it was with pineapples,
so it was with the citrus fruits, or in
fact, with anything which gave promise
of becoming a valuable resource of his
newly adopted state. He was always
student and scientist as well as culti-
vator.
In 1895 the English Government
was looking for a person competent to
judge of the possibilities of the Baha-
ma Islands and instruct the people
living there, in the art of turning such
possibilities into valuable facts. At
that time Mr. McCarty had become
so widely acknowledged as an au-
thority on semi-tropical industries, that
he was chosen to ﬁll this important
and honorable position.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
As a result of his labors in the is-
lands, he published at Nassau in 1896,
“The Farmer and Fruit Grower’s Al-
manac for the Bahamas Colony.”
This almanac had nothing to do with
the calendar, but was a clear, concise
and thoroughly valuable treatise on
citrus fruits, vegetables and pine-
apples, by C. T. McCarty, Agricultural
- Instructor. It met with the hearty ap-
proval of His Excellency Sir Wm. F.
Haynes Smith, K. C. M. G., Governor
of the Bahamas, and proved of incal-
culable value to the people of the
islands.
His numerous addresses on subjects
interesting and helpful to Floridians,
have been widely copied and quoted.
At the time of his death, January
30th, 1907, he owned and operated the
largest pineapple plantation in the
world. He had however, of late years,
placed the active management of this
vast acreage in the hands of his capable
eldest son, Daniel T. McCarty.
As the East Coast country develop-
ed, Mr. McCarty’s abilities as a lawyer
and as a well informed and intellectual
citizen were in great demand, and he
gave his entire time to affairs in the
conducting of which he was eminently
qualiﬁed to shine. He had as a lawyer
a large and ever-increasing practice,
serving at the same time on the legal
force of the F. E. C. Ry Co. In part-
nership with A. C. Dittmar, of Ft.
Pierce, he was engaged in an extensive
real estate business.
He was a heavy stockholder in the
bank of Ft. Pierce, and a member of
its Board of Directors, president of the
Florida State Horticultural Society,
president of the Ft. Pierce Board of
Trade, the animating spirit of the
county good roads association and a
Mason of highest rank.
To quote the words of a fellow-
townsman: “He was always found in
the front ranks of those working for
the improvement of Ft. Pierce, St.
Lucie county, the East Coast and the
State of Florida.
Mr. McCarty was shot on the streets
of Ft. Pierce, the morning of January
30th of the present year, and died the
afternoon of the same day, leaving the
entire community shocked at “the cruel
cutting off of a noble life,” in deep
gloom over the loss of such a friend
and citizen, and with the ﬁrm belief
that his place could never be ﬁlled.
He was a quiet man, with quiet
tastes, and he lived a quiet life, yet
when he died there came expressions
of sorrow and affection from hosts of
friends scattered over sixteen states
of this great union, and from almost
every county of this beautiful state he
loved so well. Some of these friends
occupy posts of honor among their
fellowmen; others are from the bum-
bler walks of life; all are alike bereft
and grieving.
Comfort and sympathy, without
stint, has been given to the heart-
broken'wife and her three grief strick-
en, but manly sons. Words are feeble;
all we can do is to say: “Thy will be
done.”
“God calls our loved ones, but we lose
not wholly
What He has given;
They live on earth in thought and deed,
as truly
As in His heaven."

GEORGE RAINSIORD IAIRBANKS.
To mention the name of George
Rainsford Fairbanks is to bring to
mind one of the leading characters in
the history of this and adjoining states
for the past sixty-four years, and one
whose literary ability has contributed
much to perpetuate that history.
Major Fairbanks was born in Water-
town, in northern New York, July
5th, 1820, and died at his summer home
at the University of the South, Suwan-
nee, Tennessee, August 3rd, 1906, in
the eighty-seventh year of his age.
Entering the Sophomore class of
Union College, Schenectady, New
York, at the age of sixteen, he gradu-
ated with the class of 1839, at nineteen.
He received the degree of M.A., both
from his alma mata and from Trinity
College, Hartford, Connecticut.
In 1842, he was admitted to the bar
in New York State. In the same year
he came south. This was three years
before Florida was admitted to the
Union, and he remained a citizen of the
Territory and State for the next sixty—
four years.
He ﬁrst settled in historic St. Augus-
tine, but later made his home in Fer-
nandina.
For four years (1842—46), during the
territorial days, 'he was clerk of the
United States Superior and District
Court for the northern district of
Florida; and the year after Florida’s
admission to the Union in 1845 he was
a member of the State Senate (1846-
48). He became Vice-President of the
Florida Historical Society, honorary
member of the New York Historical
Society, and held other positions of
trust and honor, but was best known
to many of us as a fellow-horticulturist
and the efﬁcient President of the Flori-
da Fruit Exchange, from its ﬁrst real
business meeting up to 1895 when the
big freeze put the Exchange out of
business. '
Throughout most of the period of
its existence, he has been a valued
member of this association, and records
of the part he has taken in its discus-
sions, and the papers contributed by
-'him, form some of the most valuable
portions of the Society’s annual re-
ports. '
Over the inscription, “George R.
Fairbanks, Historian of Florida,” his
likeness will be found in the report of
1901. ~
“History and Antiquities of the City
of St. Augustine, Florida;” “Fair-
bank’s History of Florida,” “Florida
Freezes” (the latter ’a short Sketch
contributed to this society in 1895 and
to be found in its annual report of that
year), and the many other products
of his fertile pen will be found helpful,
instructive and entertaining, but the
work nearest his heart was the estab-
lishment and fostering of The Univer-
sity of the South, Suwanee, Tennessee,
of which institution he published a
history in his eighty-ﬁfth year.
At a convention of the Episcopal
church, of which he was an ardent
member, held on Lookout Mountain,
July 4th, 1857, the plan of the institu-
tion had been promulgated and formal
organlization effected at a notable
meeting of representatives of ten
Southern states.
At this meeting he was appointed
delegate and trustee for Florida. _
From that time it became the leading

interest and aim of his life to which he
devoted unceasing energy.
Its re-founding and re-organization,
and hence the actual existence of this
noble seat of learning, after the war,
was primarily due to his labors and
those of Bishop Quintard, of Ten-
nessee, and it was a point of honor that
he had been present in session at every
meeting of its Board for forty-nine
years, including the one in 1906 before
his death.
A pamphlet issued from the press of
the University of the South, in October
last, plainly shows the high esteem in
which he was held by the trustees and
faculty of that institution. the last few
sentences, of which are copied and
read as follows:
“As of everything that meets our
eyes on this mountain, he was more
than all the rest of us put together,
the layer out and maker and keeper of
it.
“There is nothing here that did not
know and own him in it.
“There is nothing here that does not
and will not feel and mourn his loss.”
' DENIS REDMONI).
Mr. Denis Redmond, was born in the
County of \Vicklow, Ireland, Feb. 3,
1824—the distinguished members of
the Irish Party,-in the English Parlia-
ment, John E. and William Redmond,
are of the same family. In his youth
Mr. Redmond lived for a time in Balti-
more, Md. Later, he went to Augusta,
Ga. There he was at ﬁrst connected
with the leading paper, “The Augusta
Chronicle,” afterwards with the
“Southern Cultivator,” of which he be-
came owner and editor, and which he
conducted successfully for over twenty
years.
He founded the Fruitland Nurseries.
now owned by P. J. Berckmans 8: Sons,
and built many beautiful homes in the
neighborhood of Augusta, that are still
monuments to his good taste and love
of trees and ﬂowers. '
He was a lover of books, owning a
very rare and extensive library, and
was considered an able literary critic
" and an authority on English poetry.
He traveled widely in this country,
and his love of nature was his religion.
After the war he went further south,
living at different times in New Or—
leans, Pass Christian and Pascagoula,
then to Florida, where he made his
home for thirty years and was con-
nected with fruit growing and journal-
ism. He was twice married. He had
two children by the ﬁrst marriage,
who survive him, Mrs. Locke, of New
York City, and Mrs. Mel Redmond
Colquit, of Washington. D. C.
Summed up, Mr. Redmond’s life
was one of great usefulness and devo—
tion to the good and beautiful. He was
endeared to many by reason of his
loving. magnanimous nature and his
beautiful mental gifts and attainments.
He was one of the three honorary.
members of this society.
He died on the 24th of September,
[906, after a brief illness, in Jackson-
ville, Fla. His wife followed him to
the grave in three days.
REV'L J. SAWYER.
Rev. L. J. Sawyer, born at New
Haven, Conn., Dec. 19th, 1837, died at
Oswego, N. Y., July 20th, 1906.

Leicester J. Sawyer was graduated
from Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y.,
class of 1859, graduated from Union
Theological Seminary, New York City,
1862. October 8th, 1862 he enlisted
in Co. H. 27th Conn. Vol. At the bat-
tle of Fredericksburg was wounded
three times in active service, and twice
while lying on the battleﬁeld waiting
for removal.
In 1864, he was ordained to the min-
istry at Menasha, \Vis., and for twelve
years remained in the West preaching
at Sheboygan, VVis., and Burlingame,
Kansas. In 1876 he returned East, be-
came pastor of the Presbyterian church
at Oriskany, N. Y., and in 1877 took
charge of the Presbyterian church at
\Vhitesboro, N. Y. On March Ist.
1889 he accepted a call from Emmanuel
church, Amsterdam, N. Y., which po-
sition he resigned in 1898 to remove to
Tibbals, Fla., and began regular serv-
ices at Eden and Jensen in 1900. Later
he accepted the pastorate of a Union
church at Ankona and Eldred, which
charges he held until ill health caused
him to resign in April, 1906.
Rev. Mr. Sawyer was a man of bril-
liant intellect and one whose brain
force seemed never to grow weary, a
speaker who could hold an audience
at will, a scholar of great attainments,
speaking eight languages ﬂuently; al-
ways ready to respond when called up-
on, and using no manuscript, he made
his services valuable at all times and
places. He was a genial companion
and earnest friend. Mr. Sawyer had
been a member of this Society for sev-
eral years, but much to our regret, his
health did not permit him to attend our
annual gatherings.
ABNER ATWOOD.
Mr. Abner Atwood was born at
Carver, Mass, in a house that had
sheltered three successive generations
of his family. He came from good
old New England stock, John Atwood,
the common ancestor of the family in
America, having settled at Plymouth,
Mass, in 1633.
The youth of Abner Atwood was
passed in school and helping his father
on the farm .until he attained his nine-
teenth year. He then went to Taun-
ton and entered the employ of William
Mason & Company, then one of the
largest cotton machinery builders in
the country, to learn the trade of ma—
chinist. After an experience of ﬁve
years, he took charge of a section in
the works of the Taunton Locomotive
Company, remaining until 1858, when
he formed a partnership with J. O.
Draper in Bedford, Mass, for the
manufacture of soap. In 1862 the ﬁrm
of Draper &, Atwood removed to
Pawtucket, R. I., and in 1866, upon the
death of the junior partner of the ﬁrm
of R. & G. Cushman, spool manufac-
turers, Mr. Atwood was invited by the
surviving partner to an interest in the
ﬁrm and business. Until 1875 the
style of the ﬁrm was Cushman, Phillips
& Company. Mr. Cushman then with-
drew, and the ﬁrm of Atwood, Craw—
ford & Company was formed. The
product of the ﬁrm is spools and fancy
wood turning. In 1890 this company
was incorporated under the name of
the Atwood Crawford Company, and
Mr. Atwood was elected president,
which position he held to the time of
his death.
He was a prominent member of the
Central Falls Congregational church,

and for the past 22 years one of its
deacons. He was also a member of
the board of directors of the Young
Mens’ Christian Association, and a
member of the building committee.
As a member of the latter body, he
manifested a deep interest in the build-
ing of the association’s new home.
Mr. Atwood purchased his place at
Thonotosassa, Fla., a little over twenty
years ago, and he and his wife had
spent their winters there, with one or
two exceptions, for over ﬁfteen years.
He took much interest in his Florida
place and in all things pertaining to
orange growing and the welfare of
this society.
He died at his home at Pawtucket,
R. I., after a shortillness, on November
23rd, I906. His wife had preceded
him to the grave but a few weeks. He
left no children. He was a man of
sterling worth and character, and one
that any community could ill afford to
lose.
HENRY GEORGE SARIORIOUS.
Henry George Sartorious was born
in Grundy County, Iowa, April 23rd,
1875, and came to Seminole, Fla., with
his parents in the fall of 1890. His
early education was obtained in the
public schools; his close application
and wide reading gave him a fund of
knowledge on a wide range of subjects.
On August 6th, 1896, he married
Miss Lenora Whittle. Mrs. Sartorious
died a year later, leaving him with a
little ten-day-old daughter, who very
shortly afterward followed her mother
to the grave.
After this, Mr. Sartorious taught the
public school at Seminole for three
terms, then took a course in the Tampa
Business College, following which he
worked as an express messenger on
the A. C. L., running between Tampa
and Jacksonville.
Feeling that his aged parents needed
him at home, he gave up his position
and returned to Seminole, taking direct
charge of his father’s grove properties.
In March, 1906, he was married to
Mrs. Eva Drew Lewis. During the
spring of 1906 his health began to fail,
tuberculosis having developed. He
went to New Mexico hoping to regain
his health, but died at Las Vegas,
March 30th, 1907. Mr. Sartorious was
a noble, upright Christian, a member
of the Methodist Episcopal church, an
earnest worker in the Christian En-
deavor Society, and active in temper-
ance reform.

Secretary’s Report.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
At the beginning of the year, the pros-
pects for a large membership were not at
all ﬂattering, and when the report of our
president’s death was conﬁrmed, it seemed
at the time that the shock to the Society
would tend to dwarf it. But this calamity
which has befallen us. seems to have
awakened the interest of every one in the
Society and to draw the members closer

crease our membership, so that at the be-
ginning of our meeting we had nearly

Report of the Executive Committee.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :
The Executive Committee met in Jack-
sonville on July 29, 1906, to consider the
publishing of the report, and the appoint-
ment of the Standing Committee. This
Committee instructed the Secretary to
have the report published following the
form of previous years. Owing to the
lack of funds in the‘ treasury, however,
all half tones and the catalogue of fruits-
were omitted so as to bring the expense
of publication as low as possible. The
Committee then adjourned.
On March 4th, the Executive Com-
mittee met in the oﬁice of the secretary in
Jacksonville, with the following members
present: Prof. P. H. Rolfs, Gainesville;
G. L. Taber, Glen St. Mary; E. S. Hub-
bard, Federal Point; O. \V. Connor,
Tangerine and E. O. Painter, Jackson-
ville. It was moved and! seconded that the
date of the next meeting be placed at May
14th. ISE'h, 16th and 17th, commencing
on the evening of the 14th.
It was also moved and seconded that
Mr. J. D. Bell. of St. Petersburg, be ap-
pointed Chairman of the Local Com-
mittee with power to choose his associates
and report the names and rates of the
different hotels there.
Report of Committee
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:

the question is a very annoying one and
that the only report we can make, much
It was moved and seconded that the
secretary write to Mr. Jos. Richardson
and secure the best rates possible for the
Association.
The following committee on Necrology
was appointed: G. L. Taber, Glen St.
Mary, chairman; W. S. Hart, Hawks
Park, and Dr. \V. C. Richardson, Tampa.
The secretary was authorized to get out
advertising matter for business houses to
send out.
The meeting was adjourned.
In St. Petersburg, May 16th, the Ex-
ecutive Committee met with the following
members present: Mr. E. S. Hubbard,
chairman; G. L. Taber, P. H. Rolfs, E.
O. Painter, and W. S. Hart. The
minutes of the previous meeting were
read and approved. It was moved by Mr.
Taber that the report and bills of the
secretary be approved It was moved by ‘
Mr. Taber that the report of the Treas-
urer, W. S. Hart. be accepted, as same
was examined and found correct. Bills '
presented by the secretary were audited
and ordered paid.

as we deplore it, is a rather negative one.
We have had the subject under careful
consideration for two days and beg leave
to report as follows: -

ed is done by the entomologist attached to
the State Experiment Station and is pure-
ly a voluntary matter on his part, made
at the request of, and to accommodate the
nurserymen, and is not required as a
regular duty or in any way provided for
by statute or other law.
' The present Experiment Station Ento-
mologist states that he has only made
eleven inspections during the past year,
and that his methods and practice, in-
cluding form of certiﬁcate, are and have
been in accordance with the customs and
rules established by his predecessors in
ofﬁce.
The fee charged for an inspection is
$5.00, which is turned into the Experi-
ment Station treasury. In adldition to his
fee the Entomologist is paid his traveling
expenses by the parties requesting the in-
spection, thus making him substantially
their agent. It seems that the certiﬁcate
of inspection is desired by the nursery-
men to enable them to market their pro-
131
ducts in other states and foreign countries
which require inspection, and is, there-
fore, unfortunately so far as home pur-
chasers are concerned, more in the inter—
est of the nurserymen than the planter.
\V e feel that this is all wrong and that
this society should take such action as
may lead to a more extended. legally
authorized, well regulated and beneﬁcial
system which will properly safeguard the
purchaser rather than the seller, and! at
the same time be reliable and equable for
all.
We therefore recommend that the
Legislative and Executive Committees be
and are hereby instructed to do all that
may be in their power to secure the adop-
tion by the legislature of requisite and
speciﬁc laws for a proper, reliable and
systematic method of inspection.
Respectfully submitted,
WM. C. RICHARDSON,
F. G. SAMPSON,
H. B. STEVENS.
Statistics of Orange and Grapefruit Crops.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
We, the undersigned committee, recom
mend that the State Horticultural Society
take in hand the plan suggested by Dr. P.
Phillips, of Orlandlo, to obtain statistics
from all the orange growing counties of
the state, the approximate number of box-
es of oranges and grapefruit that will be
raised during the year. This we feel will
be a beneﬁt to the grower as well as pack-
er, and the country at large in order
that the railroad companies, packing
houses and box factories may make due
preparations for the coming crop to han-
dle it properly. It will also give the
grower an additional advantage that he
might know what price to Put upon his
fruit, and not be governed by haphazard
and ‘unreliable estimates that are being
madle, which mean considerable loss to the
State of Florida annually. We, there-
fore, recommend the following plan: let
the society appoint in each County not
less than three members of this Society,
or more, according to size of county.
These members should be carefully select-
ed as being conservative and responsible
growers, and each one shall report to the

132
Association direct, how much fruit there
will be in his own section and also in the
county. These reports shall be carefully
considered and} published; only those that
are considered the most conservative esti-
mates, or prorated by the Secretary from
each county as he may think will be the
best. The beginning of the estimates
shall not be earlier than the latter part of
July, and! the publication of same shall not
be later than the latter part of August,
usless conditions of the growing crop may
be required to do otherwise, and said re-
ports shall be published in all the leading
papers of our State and all the leading
fruit journals of the country, giving the
returns by counties.
\Ve further recommend that the Society
shall request of the railroad companies
carrying such fruit in the state. to fur-
nish the Society tabulated report from
each shipping point at the end of each
season, that we may compare with the
statistics and estimate made by the So—
ciety.‘ By doing so, we will readily see
at the end of each season whether or not
the Society is doing efﬁcient work. '
\Ve further recommend that should
such Railroad Companies refuse the So-
ciety the above reports, that the Society
should apply to the Railroad Commission
of the State of Florida and compel them
to do so.

Report of Committee on Legislation.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :
Your Committee on Legislation recom-
mends that our state legislation now in
session be urged to adopt the bill now be-
fore it providing for the erection of a
building for the experiment station, and
the appropriation of funds for institute
work.
They also recommend that active steps
be taken to bring our transportation facil-
ities and rates for fruits and vegetables
to the attention of the Interstate Com-
merce Commission, with a view to their
equitable and speedy adjustment, and that
this society, individually and collectively,
cooperate with any and all other organi-
zations in the State in their efforts to se-
cure these results.
To carry out above recommendations,
we suggest that a permanent committee
on legislation be appointed who shall be
authorized to raise funds and use all pro-
per means in their power to accomplish
these ends.

River, the ladies of the Town Improve-
ment Association for the elegant lunch
so generously served, and the citizens of

Question Box.
No. I—W'hat is the best method to de-
foliate?
Member—It is to take your thumb and
ﬁnger and pull the leaves off.
Mr. Hart—I would like to ask if you
think it is practicable to defoliate, say, '
four square miles of trees in this way?
Mr. Painter—A large per cent. of trees
or shrubs can be defoliated by spraying
with a strong solution of Bordeaux mix-
ture. By a strong solution I mean one
in which the copper has not all been neu-
tralized by the lime. Thrip juice in the
proportion of 1 to 500 will also defoliate
trees and shrubbery.
No. 2—Which is the best time to plant
cabbage palms; can they be transplanted
any time in the year?
Prof. Rolfs—I have seen them live
when transplanted during any one of the.
twelve months. The best time to trans-
plant is after a long dry spell and before
that dry spell has been broken.
Mr. Sperry—I contemplated setting out
a large quantity of palms. Before doing
so I talked with a man who had a large
experience in planting palms, and he stat-
ed the best time is during the wet season
in the summer.
Mr. Chilton—From my experience, I
would say February or March. We have
our wet times during those months. I
have been informed that in digging them
up it is well to trim off the small roots
and plant them deeper than when they
came out of the ground. Trim them close
to the ground and! plant them one foot

vertisers to call attention to their goods
at its annual meetings. Would it not be
well to let them exhibit in the hall, inas-
much as some of the improved machinery
would, if shown by salesmen who under-
stand it, prove interesting to us and we
would have a chance to compare the va-
rious styles in such a way as is not often
our privilege. They might even grant
a discount to us in return for the adver-
tising privilege.
Mr. Hart—I think our constitution
bars out anything of this kind. I do not
see how we could grant the room to any;
one to exhibit their goods even though
it would be of beneﬁt to us. They are at
perfect liberty to exhibit their goods out-
side the place of meeting. I do not. think
it would be policy to grant anyone this
privilege because it would unavoidably
disturb our meetings. ~
Mr. McCarty—I met two or three men
yesterday who are interested in irriga-
tion. It seems to me that with as much
space as we have here, it would be a goodl
idea to allow them to exhibit where we
could all get the beneﬁt of it. This space
could all be ﬁlled up with goods of the
fertilizer men, machinery men, nursery
men, etc., without detriment to the meet-
ing. It seems to me it would be a great
addition.
Mr. Painter—I think the gentleman has
a wrong idea of the proposition. He
thinks that the society does not want an
exhibit of fruit trees, machinery, etc. We
do want it. but we don't want it on the
ﬂoor where the meeting is held. By the
ﬂoor, I do not mean literally speaking. I
mean any particular wares should] not be
advertised during our sessions. Any per-
son or ﬁrm can bring or send anything
they wish to display or advertise to the
place where the meeting is held and make
any arrangements they choose outside the
place of meeting. The society itself can-
not take the position of endorsing or ad-
vertising any commodities.

No. 4—Do hard wood ashes actually
destroy or check the mildew on the to-
mato?
Prof. Rolfs—It is not likely that they
would have any effect.

No. 5—Is the 'white fungus of the t0-
mato transmitted through the tomato
seed? Is it continued from year to year
through the same soil?
Prof. Rolfs—It is transmitted from
plant to plant.

N0. 6—At what stage of the tomato
growth should the Bordeaux be applied
to check or destroy the white fungus or
mildew?
Prof. Rolfs—Three of these questions
appear to be asked by the same person.
The tomato in. Florida is rarely attacked
by mildew and it is probable that the
author of theSe questions had in mind the
condition that is produced by a small spid-
er mite. They should be fought by dry
sulphur. sulphur spray or sulphur com-
pound. They are easily killed and usual-
ly disappear by the use of potassium sul-
phi-te or soda sulphite.

ference. I think the more vigorous grow-
ing the tree is, the better it is.

No. 8—\'V'hat is the best month in the
year to plant an orange tree?
Mr. W aite—November.
Mr. McLain—I should say, December.
Mr. Hart—May, if wet, is a pretty
good month.
Member—.You would not approve of
May unless the rainy season had started
in, would you?
Mr. Hart-_In my part of the country,
it is sure to start about that time.

No. 9—1 would like to know if the So
ciety approves of cutting the trees back at
the time of setting out?
Mr. HamptonTCut them back every
time. And about that planting of trees; I
would prefer to plant them in the month
of December to any other month in the
year. Some say November. Don’t you
think that is a little too soon? They are
likely to start to growing and the January
or February cold snap will take them in.
If you plant them in December they are
not so apt to start to grow.

No. 10—1 would like to ask whether it
is best to use the Stringfellow method for
planting on low ground?
Mr. Hart—I have not had experience
in that, but if the ground is low, you can-
not push the roots down far. They have
to grow on the surface. If there is not
room above permanent water line for the
tap root, little can be made in that direc-
tion. I would- prefer fairly high land for
planting orange trees. '
Mr. Taber—In relation to that String-
fellow method, I want to say that I don't
think that the Stringfellow method is a
good habit to get into unless one qualiﬁes
every assertion that he makes. If you
take a great big tree like Mr. Hubbard
would recommend planting, you can’t suc-
cessfully treat it that way. _I have set Out
thousands of little nursery trees and taken
off all the ﬁbrous roots. It is the proper
way to plant them. Line up a row, open
it with a spade and stick in nothing but
little sticks. But you can't do that wit-h a
ﬁve or six year old tree.
Member—I think the success of a new-
ly set tree depends as much on the weather
following the time of setting, as the meth-
od of setting. As to the Stringfellow
method, I would say do not prune the
roots quite so close.
Mr. Hume—I have seen a few attempts
at setting trees by the Stringfellow meth-
od which were entirely successful. I have
seen some that were a dismal failure. It
requires careful study of the conditions-of
the soil, of the weather and of the kind
of tree you are planting before you de-
termine whether you are going to plant
by the Stringfellow method. He makes
absolutely no exception to the kind, char-
acter, or size of the tree, and I think any~
one 'who follows him implicitly is going
to get into pretty deep Water.
Mr. Hoard—Three years ago, I moved
600 bearing trees without losing a single
tree. Some of them 'had had a box of
oranges the year before, and I saved all
the roots I could get.
Mr. Hart—I am not advocating the
Stringfellow method in all cases, or any-
thing of the kind. I brought the subject
up to see what experience others 'had had.
I am interested in it. All my early ex-
perience was much in that line in the
planting of trees. \Vhen I came to the
east coast all of our groves were set out

from big, wild trees that we got from the
hammocks. Some of them had no tap
root and where they did. we dug down
and cut them off short. We cut the large
trunks 05 not over a foot high and cut
the roots off close up so that a tree with a
six inch trunk would go in a hole eighteen
inches to two feet across. and those trees
made strong, healthy and rapid growth
and were in proﬁtable bearing in three
years. The nursery trees were budded
when set, but these were allowed to sprout
and then buds were inserted in these
sprouts after the trees were set in grove
form.
I would tell you that it is best to set
out big trees. “Big” may mean six or
sixty years old. You can get a ﬁne bear-
ing tree very quickly if you put such out
when the conditions are favorable, w‘hile
small trees suffer seriously from every
adverse condition and it may take several
years to get them to a fair. bearing con-
dition.
Mr. Skinner—During the discussion,
Mr. Mason sat alongside of me, and he
says there is no question but that cutting
off the roots will make them grow deeper.
Mr. Taber—I do not think you can ap-
ply the same ruling to trees of all sizes.
Mr. Hart mentions citrus trees as being
transplanted at any size, but there are few
other trees that can be treated like a cit—
rus tree, and live. I claim that a citrus
root is one of the hardest things in the
world to kill. Take a peach or pecan tree.
for instance. Regardless of the age or
size of the tree. regardless of the season
it is put out—Stringfellow just makes the
sweeping assertion that it should be close-
ly root pruned, which I do not believe is
always proper or advantageous: and that
is the reason why I say that one should
be careful to designate what he is talking
about. If you put out trees at the begin-
ning of the dormant season, you can suc-
cessfully transplant a larger tree and you
can prune the roots harder than you can
at the time when growth should com-
mence. lHe makes no exceptions at all.
Mr. Hollingsworth—Mr. Hart, were
not those trees you spoke of transplanted
on very damp soil?
Mr. Hart—They were transplanted in
any kind of soil. In some places it was
eleven feet to water. and in others the
ground was covered with water a good
deal of the time.

No. II-q-Can anyone advise concern-
ing the soap tree. how it is planted and
what distance apart? WVhy does not the
California Pepper tree fruit here?
Mr. Stevens—I have seen a soap tree
growing wild around Orange Lake. That
is the only place I have ever seen one in
Florida.
Mr. Painter—The soap berry tree has
been grown near Tallahassee for years.

No. 12—1 would like to ask why the
olive tree grows ﬁnely here, but does not
bear any crop?
Prof. Rolfs— That is a question that is
as yet unsolved.
Mr. Wakelin—VVe have an olive tree
on our place. It bloomed very heavily
and when I left home for the North it had
small green olives. When I came back
they had all fallen off, except a few dried
up specimens. This year it has had no
bloom.
Mr. Hampton—The olive tree has been
talked over a long while, and some seem
to think they won't bear, and some con-

I37
tend that they will. I have more or less
olives every year. I believe I could raise
plenty of olives, but whether I could raise
enough to pay commercially or not I do
not know, but I have plenty for my home
consumption.
Prof. Rolfs——There is a place near San-
ford and one just east of Malabar and
Drayton Island, I think, where they fruit
quite heavily. I think that the probability
of making it a commercial success is a
small one.
Member—Does Mr. Hampton use any-
thing special in the way of fertilizer?
Mr. Hampton—No, I don’t use any-
thing special.
Member—Last year I gave my olives
slacked lime, and I think I am on the right
track to getting enough olives for our-
selves.
Mr. Hart—This matter has been pretty
carefully gone over by Mr. Rooks, one of
our members, who is much interested in
anything of the kind. I think the general
opinion is that there is but one variety of
olives that fruit well in Florida. I have
seen some with trunks nearly two feet
through, but they never bore what you
might call a full crop. I think there is
one variety that will produce a fairly good
crop, but do not remember what it is.
Member—I live close to Mr. Rooks and
see his olives, but I have never seen any-
thing like a full crop.
Mr. Taber—I have fruited some four
or ﬁve different varieties of olives, includ-
ing which are the Queen, and they do not
even get to maturity, but drop before they
mature. I have gotten olives from several
different varieties, but would not recom—
mend them for anything more than home
use. .
Mr. Hampton—I never had any trouble
with the fruit dropping. They stayed
pretty well to maturity.

CATALOGUE OF FRUITS.-
ADOPTED BY THE SOCIETY AT THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL
MEETING.
In making a complete Catalogue of the Fruits of Florida, indicating intel-
ligibly, in summarized and tabular form, the relative value of varieties for
different sections, the wide-stretching territory, diversity of soil and climate, and
the limited range of each of the numerous fruits, render it essential that the State
be divided, so that regions allied throughout in their adaptability to fruits may be
designated and referred to.
TO this end, four districts have been formed, as described below. Geographi—
cal lines cannot be made to indicate pomological conditions with accuracy. More
than approximate correctness could not be expected from an arbitrary division Of
this kind, especially where local conditions vary so greatly as in Florida. Work-
ing by general averages, some sections are unavoidably left in the wrong districts,
judging by the standard of local conditions. The divisions, however, will be found
to answer this purpose better, than any that could 'be made without further sub-
divisions. which would be impracticable.
\VESTERN NORTH FLORIDA-éThat part of the State west Of the Au-
cilla river.
EASTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State between the Au-
cilla river and a straight line drawn across the State from the mouth of the St.
Jlohns river to Cedar Keys.

ferred to and the counties constituting South Florida.

CITRUS FRUITS.




SWEET ORANGES—Citrus aurantium.
Note.——The development of orange culture in this State has given rise to a multiplicity
of varieties, many of which, while meritorious, have no distinctive qualities, or superiority as
compared with others. It has been deemed advisable to omit the names of many varieties
which have disappeared from cultivation. The list, however, is still large.
The names in heav type are designed to constitute a complete list for the State, em-
bracing varieties of the highest excellence in all the desired characteristics of season, quality.
distinctiveness, productiveness, etc. The names in light type are those whose characteristics
are possessed in an equal or superior degree by other varieties which appear in heavy type.
Some varieties in light type equal others in heavy type having the same characteristics but
where there is a difference it is in favor of the varieties in heavy type. In cases of equal
excellence, the best known has the preference. So that the varieties in heavy type, as a
whole, and without disparagemen-t to other excellent sorts, may be said to embrace the
leading kinds for general culture.
New, or comparatively unknown varieties also appear in light type; but for this
distinction see “Adaptability” column.
~
Note.—In referring to the time of ripening in the column headed "Season," “very
early" applies to varieties marketed in September and October; “early,” to October and No-
vember varieties; “early medium," November and December; "medium," December, Janu-
ary and February; “late medium," February and March; “late,” March and' April; “very
late." April, May and later.
Note. The region of orange production proper extends southward from Central
Florida, overlapping the upper portion of Scuthern Florida. Therefore, under “Adapta—
bility” below the varieties have been starred for “Southern Florida;” here, however, the
starring applies more particularly to the upper portion of the district.

VI CATALOGUE OF FRUITS.
Of Sweet Oranges, the leading fruit Crop of the State, and great staple of the Cen-
tral region, over ﬁve million boxes were produced in the season of 1894-95.
The Navel Varieties are much esteemed on account of the delicate texture and su-
perior quality of their fruit. They are usually shy bearers, although experience indicates that
they are much more prolific upon “rough” lemon and trifoliata stocks than, as generally
gr0wn, upon orange stocks.
The Blood Varieties are sweet, and thPrefore marketable early in season, as indicated
by the abbreviatiom in the “Season” column. At this time their distinctive character is
not apparent, and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts. As the season
advances, their ruby tints develop, until quite apparent on the exterior, and their quality
continues to improve until, at full ripeness, they are equaled by few and surpassed by
none. In locations sufﬁciently exempt from frost to permit their being held on the trees
until they reach perfection, they bring high prices and are exceptionally proﬁtable.
Other Varieties.—Excluding the Navels, Bloods and Satsuma, noted above, and with-
out disparagement to other sorts of equal merit, the following are suggested as a desirable
list for general planting, arranged in order of succession: Very Early, Boone, Sweet
Seville; Early, Enterprise Seedless, Parson Brown; Early Medium, Nonpareil, Centennial;
Medium, Pineapple, Jaﬁa, Homosassa; Late Medium, Majorca, Du Roi; Late, Bessie,
Maltese Oval; Very Late, Hart.
Varieties distinctly marked in their exterior appearance, like the Navels, Bloods,
Du Roi, etc., are, other things being equal, most desirable for market.

Satsuma is valued on account of its hardiness, which is increased by being budded on the entirely
hardy C. trifoliata. It is much planted in sections north of the usual range of oranges.

The Pomelo.—Growing the Pomelo for market is a development of the past ﬁfteen
or twenty years; but large quantities of this fruit are now shipped from the State and its
culture is rapidly extending. It has proved popular in the general market and its culture is
very proﬁtable. Its range of adaptability is about the same as that of the orange. Most
of the older trees were planted before named varieties were introduced. The above list
comprises the leading varieties now generally planted.

The Lemon—Lemon growing in Florida is an industry of some importance, the crop
of 1894 being estimated at 150,000 boxes. The tree stands less cold than the orange, and
planting is conﬁned to lower latitudes and locations of comparative frost exemption. The
foregoing varieties are highly esteemed and generally planted.

Remarks.—The Peach is successfully grown in localities throughout the greater part
of the State, and in some districts is extensively produced for shipment to Northern mar-
kets. As a rule, for this purpose, only those varieties are grown which are marked “early”
and "very early" in the above tabde, and which come in before the general crop farther
north. To this there are some exceptions, notably in Western North Florida, where some
mid-season varieties, like Elberta, are successfully grown for shipment.
While the list Of peaches grown in theState embraces many varieties, the various
Sections, covering a wide range of latitude and longitude, differ to such an extent in soil,
climate and conditions of local environment, that the varieties adapted to a particular region
are comparatively limited in number. A ﬁrst and vital essential to successful peach produc-
tion is the adaptability of v_ariety to locality; in general this is true of peaches to a greater
extent than other fruits, and especially so in Florida.
NO. 21 is of peculiar shape, being elongated, with deep suture, and sharp recurved
point. It is very sweet as its name “Honey” indicates: This variety comes from China
and is the progenitor of a race of peaches well suited to the central and northern sections of
the State. No. 38, the Peen-to, is also possessed of marked individual characteristics; its
shape being flat like a tomato, and unless grown with fertilizers rich in prosphorie acid
and potash is apt to be possessed Of a bitter almond or nOyau ﬂavor. It comes from South
China or Java and the varieties that have originated from it have given us a sub-tropical
race of peaches well adapted to Southern and Central Florida. It is safe to say that nine-
tenths of the commercial peach culture of peninsular Florida is conﬁned to the varieties that
have been originated from the above two introductions from the Orient. It should be
mentioned, however, that neither the varieties that have originated from the Honey or
from the Peen-to retain to such marked extent the shape of the arent. Those that have
originated from the Honey show a tendency to the recurved point - ut in a less marked de-
gree. Those that have orignated from the Peen-to are Of regular peach shape.

Grapes—In many locations throughout the State varieties (as indicated by the star-
ring above) succeed well, and are grown for shipment to Northern markets as well as for
local consumption and the manufacture of wine. I J
For Market.—Delaware, Niagara, and Ives (only)_ have proved a success as shipping
grapes for distant markets (when properly packed). Diamond, on account of its compact-
ness and tendency to crack, does not stand long shipment.
For Red Wine.—~Cynthiana, Norton and Ives are the red-wine grapes of Florida, as
they are the red-wine grapes of the United States. Especially is this true of the ﬁrst two
named; their juice is dark and rich in saccharine matter, and the wine made from these
two grapes is said to possess great medicinal properties, owing to its large percentage of
tannin.
For White Wine.——Elvira, Delaware and Niagara are, among the varieties above
named, the best grapes for white wine— especially dry wine. It is from Elvira that the
famous San Luis Sauternes are made, which have established the reputation of Florida
wines. Delaware is better adapted to the manufacture of sweet wine, and from Niagara a
good dry wine can be madeﬂmuch superior to the article made from Northern grovm
Niagaras, our Florida Niagaras being almost entirer free from that foxy taste so promi-
nent in all Northern Labruscas.
European Varieties (V. vinifera.)—The U. S. Department of Agriculture, Division of
Pomology, has established an experimental vineyard of European varieties, about 550 vines
of 175 varieties at Earleton, under the charge of Baron H. von Luttichau. They are all
grafted on V. riparia and V. rupestris, are now in their ﬁfth year and so far are remarkably
successful.

fruit. They are very popular in the South, where they are used for dessert and for making
wine and jelly, but they are not grown for Northern market.

The Kaki succeeds well throughout the State, and is generally, though not extensive-
ly, grown. For market this delicious fruit has the merit of shipping well and keeping long.
While new markets are often reluctant to take hold of it, wherever known it sells well.
Nomenclature—While there has been much confusion in regard to the names of
varieties, the above kinds are now as well known as the leading varieties of other fruit;
they embrace the most valuable kinds, and the names as given are correctly applied.
Characteristics—Some 0f the varieties have dark ﬂesh, others light flesh, still others
a mixture’of the two. The light and dark ﬂesh differ radically in texture and consistency
as well as appearance, and when found in the same fruit are never blended, but always dis-
tinct. The dark ﬂesh is never astringent; the light ﬂesh is astringent until it softens. The
dark-ﬂeshed fruit is crisp and meaty, like an apple, and is edible before it matures. Some
of the entirely dark-ﬂeshed kinds improve as they soften, like Hyakume and Yeddoichi;
others are best when still hard, like Zengi and Tabers No. 129. As they are good to eat
before they are ripe, it is not so important that the dark-ﬂeshed kinds be allowed to reach a
certain stage before being offered to consumers unfamiliar with the fruit. The light-ﬂeshed
kinds, and those with mixed light and dark flesh, are very delicious when they reach the
custard-like consistency of full ripeness. In some the stringency disappears as the fruit be-
gins to soften, as the Yemon, and in a less degree with Okame and Tanenashi; in others it
persists until the fruit is full ripe, as with TSuru. The light-ﬂeshed kinds should not be
offered to consumers unacquainted with the fruit until in condition to be eaten. A person
who has attempted to eat one of them when green and “puckery” will not be quick to
repeat the experiment. Seeds accompany the dark ﬂesh. The light-ﬂeshed kinds are seed-
less. The kind with mixed ﬂesh have seeds in pr0portion to the quantity of dark ﬂesh.
Hyakume, Zengi and Hachiya are usually overspread at the blossom end with penciling or
net-work of dark lines, and this sometimes occurs in other kinds.
Varieties.—Tanenashi, Okame, Yemon and Yeddoichi excel in quality, perhaps in the
order named. Okame (on account of the difﬁculty of getting the fruits all in the same stage
of ripeness) and Hachiya are not as good shippers as the others; the latter is valued for its
immense size and showiness. Okame, on account of its long season, exquisite beauty, and
superior quality, is the best for home use and local market. Zengi and Tabers No. 129 are
valued for their earliness, as are Tsuru and Costata for their lateness. Costata is very dis-
tinct and handsome in both tree and fruit. Hyakume is most generally grown of the dark-
ﬂeshed kinds. Tanenashi is, perhaps, most highly esteemed in the market.
Stock—The Kaki should be grafted on the native persimmon. on which it is much
more satisfactory than upon its own imported stocks.

tive; 14 and 15, superior quality acid; 16, most desirable.
Apples and Apricots—Are not recommended for general culture, although the varie-
ties named give fair results in the home orchard in the regions indicated.
The Fig—A most delicious fruit for the table and culinary use, thrives everywhere.
It is not grown for shipment, except when canned or preserved, in which form it ﬁnds a
ready market at high prices, but is one of the most valuable and generally grown home—
use-and-local-market fruits. All the varieties named are desirable.
Mulberries—Are well adapted to all sections. They are largely grown for swine,
poultry, and as a toll for birds; and. by some, the more acid kinds are esteemed for table
use.
The Pomegranate,—An agreeable fruit, desirable for occasional use. and especially
valuable as an ornamental shrub or tree, is not generally grown for market, but most plan-
tations have a few trees. There are several new choice varieties being tried.

Dewbeffiel, 8150 Blackberries in some varieties succeed admirably in the regions indi-
cated, but are not cultivated to any considerable extent, owing to the abundance of native.
wild berries. The Manatee Dewberry, and the Northey, presumably a hybrid, have proved
satisfactory in many localities.
Loquats—Are grown in a small way for home consumption. They are a desirable
fruit for table, as well as culinary use. At present the Loquat is propagated largely from
seed, and the fruit varies. greatly in size and quality. A number of varieties have been in-
troduced from California and are being tested.
Olivea.—Many trees have been planted. and there are some old groves. The varieties,
of which there are many, are not sufﬁciently known in this State to catalogue.

tion, though three-fourths of the acreage is unprotected and escapes in ordinary winters
withOut material damage from cold. In South Central Florida they require artiﬁcial heat
to protect them from frost during the winter. Further North they cannot be successfully
grown except under glass. '
The Spanish, Porto Rico, and Cayenne are grown most extensively for market. The
Egyptian Queen, and Pernambuco are grown for market less extensively. These remarks
apply to the East Coast.
In the numerous and extensive shedded pineries of Orange County and the West
Coast, which are cultivated on an intensive system, the Cayenne is planted almost exclu-
sively.

Remarks—On varieties as numbered above. Nos. 1, 2 and 4, general market; 3, 5 and
7, home use.
Commercial Banana Culture is conﬁned to the extreme lower portion of the penin-
sula.
Varieties—The Baracoa is the ordinary Red Banana of commerce. The Cavendish
(M. Cavendishii) is a dwarf species, also know as “Dwarf,” “Dwarf Jamaica," “Chinese.”
Except the Orinoco, Hart’s Choice has a mere northern range than the other sorts. The
Orinoco matures further north than any other variety, it is an ordinary plantain (M. para-
disaica sapientum) as distinguished from the Banana or Sweet Plantain (of which Baracoa
and Golden are varieties); when allowed to ripen on the plant, it is of good quality, and
desirable for home use, in sections too far north for other kinds.

cooking and preserving. There are numerous varieties, as yet unclassiﬁed. The hardy
kinds, Cattley and Chinese, have about the same range as oranges. r

Nuts.—The pecan has long been grown in the State in a small way; it ﬂourishes in
many localities and its culture is proﬁtable. In addition to 'the four varieties listed, other
good varieties as yet only of local repute, will undoubtedly become prominent in the near
future. The Japan chestnut, of comparatively recent introduction, has proved fairly well
adapted, but hardly worthy of extensive commercial culture. The Japan walnut, of still
more recent introduction, bears well and makes a remarkably handsome tree, but is not up
to the standard of the best English walnuts in quality.
Extensive Cocoanut plantations are to be found on the southern coast. Little or no
attention has been paid to varieties.

Remarks.—Since 1895 strawberry culture has been largely extended, especially on the
Western slope of the peninsula. The Newnan has been allowed to degenerate and the fruit
is now rather small for shipment. The Hoffman does better on clay than on sandy lands
and needs high fertilizing. The Cloud is vigorous in North Florida and stands drouth well;
proliﬁc early in the season. Not liked so well in South Florida. Rising is very vigorous
and proliﬁc, a ﬁrm berry and an excellent shipper. Its foliage, however. grows rather open
and it does not protect its fruit well against a frost, The Phenomenal seems to be al-
most identical with the Hoﬁman in physical characteristics, but it has a longer season in
South Florida. In Bradford county Aroma and Middleton's Early 'have been tested by in-
dividuals and reported on favorably. Glen Mary, Hood River, Dollar, Warﬁeld, Star,
Early, Splendid, Pride of Cumberland and Gandy have been tested and condemned. Klon-
dike is a recent introduction of great promise, and has been given a place in the list of de-
sirable varieties.

PROCEEDINGS
OF THE
Twenty-First Annual Meeting
OF THE
Florida State Horticultural Society
The Florida State Horticultural
Society celebrated its twenty-ﬁrst an-
nual meeting in the beautiful and his-
toric city of Gainesville. It can be said
of this meeting that it opened with
the largest attendance of any meeting
in the history of the Society. There
have been other meetings when the
total number in attendance was larger,
but at no time was the hall so ﬁlled
with horticulturists from all over the
state, and with townspeople, as greeted
the fall of the President’s gavel at the
opening session of this meeting. The
attendance through the entire session
was large and the whole time allotted
for the program was taken up. None
of the sessions were cut out or cur-
tailed, but the full time put in.
The members enjoyed the afternoon
session at the State University and
Experimental Grounds. They spent
the time very proﬁtably in going over
the ﬁeld and seeing what was being
done and at the same time seeing what
was needed to carry on the State work.
Many a member went home deter-
mined to appeal to his member of the
Legislature to give the Experiment
Station more consideration and a
larger appropriation for its work, at
the next meeting of the Legislature.
One address we are not able to give
in our report was the lecture by Prof.
H, Harold Hume on “Adorning the
Home Place," which was given com-
plimentary to the people of Gainesville.
This was a stereopticon lecture illus-
trating the good and bad effects of
different planting of shrubs and trees.
The printing of the address without
the illustrations would take away half
of its value. As we are unable to print
these this year, the members who did
not attend will have to lose the pleas-
ure and proﬁt of Prof. Hume’s lecture.
\Vhen the time for the next place of
meeting was brought up, Daytona, De-
Land, Orlando and Jacksonville were
in the race. On the ﬁrst ballot it was
left to DeLand and Daytona. and the
latter won out by a few votes, con-
sequently the next annual meeting will
be held at one of the prettiest towns

Address of Welcome.
By Col. Horatio Davis.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gmtlcmcn:
As mayor of this city, it gives me great
pleasure to welcome you to Gainesville,
and in the words of Shakespeare’s charac-
ter, “I say to thee and to thy company,
I bid a hearty welcome.” Horticulture,
as the dictionaries say, is that department
of agriculture which relates to the culti-
vation of ﬂowers, fruits and vegetables,
and where can such cultivation be more
important than in a state with twelve
hundred miles of sea coast, over seven
hundred miles long, and every acre of
land within that state tempered by sea
breezes?
The Bible tells us that one of the ﬁrst
commands given by God after He had
created the earth, was for it to bring
forth fruit, every tree after its own kind.
As soon as He had created man, He said
to him, “I give you the fruit from these
trees for your food.”
posed that when the trees came forth
from the hand of God, it and its fruit
were perfect, but as time passed, neglect
worked its inevitable result, and the tree
with its fruit deteriorated. As I under-
stand it, one of the endeavors of this so-
ciety is to learn how to bring back to
that tree and its fruit, its pristine per-
fection.
It has been said that Florida has eight
It is to be sup-.
months summer and four months warm
weather. we who live in Florida know
that this is not so. We know that we
have four months summer and eight
months pleasant weather, and there are
but few days in which the horticulturist
or agriculturist cannot work. “'here else
in the world have you such a ﬁeld for
your labor? Where else are such flow-
ers, fruits and vegetables awaiting scien-
tiﬁc research facing him as in Florida?
It is a public benefactor who causes two
blades of grass to grow where one grew
before. Is he not a public benefactor
who tells us how to make our fruit and
vegetables perfect, and how to adorn our
homes with beautiful ﬂowers, and that.
I understand. is one of the objects of
your association, and here, during thiﬁ
meeting, we will be told by a number of
gentlemen how that object is to be ac-
complished.
\Vith such objects in view by your
society. is it surprising that there is 110
city that is not proud to entertain you and
feel honored by your presence?
It is customary on occasions of this
kind for the speaker to present to the
guests. the key of the city, but as Gaines-
ville is hospitable, she keeps no keys. Our
doors are wide open. and I say to you a5
mayor of the city, “\Valk in and take p05-
session.”

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 21
THE RELATION OF THE UNIVERSITY TO THE HORTICUL-
TURAL SOCIETY.
Dr. Andrew Sledd.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlmncn:
I wish respectfully to endorse and sec—
ond the words of welcome which the
Mayor has extended to your body, in
behalf of your State University. We
are very glad indeed to have you in our
city, and esteem it a privilege and honor,
and trust you will feel that whatever we
have out there; whatever of buildings,
or faculty, or service, is entirely at your
disposal. \Ve hope to have the privi-
lege of having you out an afternoon and
evening. On that occasion we wish you
to take possession of the buildings and
grounds, and we would like for you to go
to and fro and see what is there so that
you may know what we are trying to do
in the cause of education.
I shall probably not be able to enjoy
the Association on that occasion, by rea~
son of the fact that I have had an en-
gagement out of the city for some months,
but Prof. Rolfs will show you every cour-
tesy and more than take my place, I am
sure.
Now, like the Irishman who wanted to
make a few remarks before he said any-
thing, I address myself directly to the
matter of The Relation of the University
to the Horticultural Society. I will not
presume in the preSence of these experts
who are versed in technical knowledge,
to enter into any arguments or discus-
sions of a technical nature. I know very
little about technical horticulture; but I
address myself to you as citizens of the
State, feeling that you are citizens before
you are horticulturists. I feel that you
are horticulturists as an incident, but that
your citizenship is your chief work and
one of the highest interests in your life.
Therefore, I think I can speak to you as
citizens ﬁrst and then horticulturists.
Agricultural interests, including in
them horticultural interests, are the great-
est single interests in the nation. Re-
cently I have been looking over some of
our agricultural statistics, and ﬁnd that
the amount of money that we get out of
the ground through crops and fruits will
amount to the amazing sum of over $6,-
5oo.ooo,ooo.oo; that our corn crop for
one year would more than pay the na-
tional debt, and would sustain the na-
tional government for two years or more,
paying all of its expenses. The vast ma-
jority of our people are directly or indi-
rectly dependent upon agricultural inter-
ests. Not counting the non-productive
elements of the population, such as chil-
dren under ten years of age and matrons
in the home, there are 30,000,000 of peo-
ple in the United States engaged in gain-
ful occupations. Of that number, nearly
forty per cent. are engaged in horticul-
tural and agricultural pursuits. This
does not include their dependents. In our
own state, forty-four per cent. of our
working population is engaged in agricul-
tural pursuits; by far the largest propor-
tion engaged in any one line or calling
in the state.
Gigantic as are the interests involved,


## p. 22 (#564) #############################################

22 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
enormous as are the numbers engaged in
those interests, but little attention has
been paid to reducing these interests to
a scientiﬁc basis, or equipping those en-
gaged in this occupation for perfection in
their work.
You will ﬁnd that the ﬁrst agricultural
society was started in Philadelphia in
178 5, and had the names of George Wash-
ington, Benjamin Franklin and others as
prominent on its lists. The ﬁrst profes-
sorship of agriculture was established at
Columbia University at about the same
time, in 1795. George \Vashington,
Benjamin Franklin and the others of
whom I might speak took an active inter-
est in scientiﬁc learning in this line. The
present interest, however, can be dated
from about the time of the Civil War.
The passage of the Land Grant Act in ’62,
may be said to institute the ﬁrst concrete
movement which still bears fruit for those
people engaged in this tremendous and
important work. It seems surprising
that school men should have so long neg-
lected the practical application of the
principles of education in this ﬁeld and
that this mass of our population should
not have had the beneﬁt of scientiﬁc study
and research. The schools did, however,
under the attractions of the Rennaissance,
devote the main part of their time to the
study of the classics, especially Latin, and
to the development of a type of educa-
tion which is known even today as “cul-
tural”—a part of which is a certain dis-
regard, amounting almost to contempt,
for the practical. For a long time there
has been, and is today in many commun-
ities a feeling that it is unworthy to
spend one’s time in the study of practi-
cal things, and a corresponding respect
for the man who is educated and trained
along the lines of so-called “culture, don't
you know.” This movement has not yet
expended itself, and there are more pu-
pils in the schools of the United States
today studying Latin than any other one
subject, with the possible exception of al-
gebra. Fifty per cent. of the pupils of
the United States still study Latin, and
Latin isrequired in nearly all college en-
trance examinations and in most curricula
of the colleges throughout the Union. 1
cannot quite appreciate the necessity for
a superﬁcial knowledge of Latin, when
a man’s life work is to be the growing of
tobacco or corn or cotton; and it seems to
me it would be far more beneﬁcial to the
individual and to society at large it such
a student would spend the time which he
devotes to “culture” in the scientiﬁc
study of the growing and curing of to-
bacco, or corn, or cotton; the prevention
of diseases and the cure for same, and
the wonders of germination and growth
and maturity.
My education has been a classical one,
if you will pardon a personal allusion,
so that it represents a mighty revolution
for me to say that in my judgment our
educational ideas are fundamentally
wrong, and whereas the majority devote
themselves to the study of the classics
and the small minority to the agricultural
studies. the majority should devote
themselves to a practical education, leav-
ing to the minority the dilettante pur-
suits of the so-called “culture.”
Since I862. there has grown up a num-
ber of institutions based upon that act of
Mr. Morrill whose duty it is to instruct
the mass of people in the practical affairs
of life. These institutions now number
50. one of which is your own State Uni-
versity. There are ﬁfty institutions aet-
ing under the Morrill Act, the Land
Grant Act. and other Acts supplementary
thereto. Of the students attending these
colleges, a large per cent. is women, and

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 23
there are altogether 44,000 men, a little
over 10,000 being engaged in non-tech-
nical, non-agricultural work. There is
a very large proportion, about 25
per cent. who are not engaged
in the strict lines of work for which
these institutions were established.
5,500 are engaged in some other course,
now and then taking a course in animal
husbandry or some such branch. 6,000
are in the preparatory department, 21,000
only are engaged in the practical agri-
cultural and mechanical pursuits for
which the institutions are intended. Now,
let us go a little further into the matter
and take this 21,000 engaged in the prac-
tical agricultural and mechanical pursuits.
Out of this number we ﬁnd less than 3,000
engaged in the special work of agri-
culture and horticulture at this time, after
forty years of effort in that direction. I
mention this to show the persistent tenac-
ity of the old academic ideas, the per-
sistence of the notion that the only edu-
cation worth having involved the study
of literature, especially the study of the
classics. It is a very hard matter to con-
vince the school men in the ﬁrst place and
the population at large, after the school
men have been convinced, of the advis-
ability of a change in any educational sys-
tem,
Now, as I said, the bulk of the popula-
tion is engaged in agricultural and hor-
ticultural pursuits. It seems to me that
the educational system should be laid out
upon those lines in which the bulk of the
population is interested. Less than four
per cent. are engaged in professional pur-
suits, and yet our school system in the
State of Florida, with the exception of
the State University, is designed with
reference to the four per cent, with al-
most total disregard of the remaining
Population. In other words, in none of
the schools of the State, except the State
University, will you ﬁnd any instruction
in horticultural and agricultural pursuits.
I wish to bring it to your attention that
igis high time some action is taken with
reference to changing this situation. The
State University, your University, is the
only institution offering instruction along
these lines, but there should be many oth-
ers. The main part of our current ex-
penses is provided by the Federal Gov-
ernment, and provided with reference to
the practical instruction of the young
men of the State, the vast forty-four
per cent. of the young men of the
State, who will be interested in agri-
cultural pursuits.
Our ideal out here is to serve the peo-
ple according to the people’s needs; and
these needs are not, as we understand it,
to be found mainly in the realm of cul-
ture, but the people’s needs begin with the
need to eat. We begin with this funda-
mental need, and go up, up with the needs
of the people, up and up to the needs of the
intellect and into the needs of the spirit
manifested in right living. But ﬁrst and
foremost is the all-dominant need, the
need to eat. I hold that it is a proper
function of the schools to raise the stand-
ard of living; and to do this, it is neces-
sary to improve the workman. Your in-
stitution is organized on that basis. The
farmer must be equipped with knowledge
of the whys and wherefores, he must
know the principles of causes and effects
and have a certain amount of scientiﬁc
knowledge with which to combat the evils
which are the enemies to successful agri-
culture or horticulture. Of the 15 of
this faculty, II are engaged under this
general head: to equip the worker with
the proper knowledge. I include the
Professor of Physics, the Professor of
Botany. and except only the Professors

of Modern Languages, History, Philos-
ophy, and Ancient Languages. We offer
four year courses in Horticulture, Agri-
culture, Mechanical, Civil and Electrical
Engineering in addition to four year
courses in General Science and four year
course in Literature, Philosophy, and
Pedagogy, which do not belong under
this head. \Ve also offer a two year
course in Agriculture, and a two year
course in the Mechanical Arts.
Under the Buckman Bill we are re
quired to maintain certain entrance re-
quirements which may be modiﬁed by
the Board of Control. They have been
so modiﬁed, and we now admit students
who have completed the eleventh grade of
the public schools. We accept actual
farmer boys in the department of Agri-
culture without their coming up to those
requirements. The young farmer boys
throughout the State who really want to
learn the scientiﬁc elements of agricul-
ture and horticulture and the elements of
mechanical arts have an open door and a
hearty welcome into the institution.
We hold, with the possible exception
of a few of our men who are still joined
to their idols of “culture,” that our ﬁrst
duty is to the largest body of our citizens,
'and the last duty to the smallest body,
and we have done all that we can to ac—
complish that result. .
Now I want to tell you some of the
results. I said it was a hard matter to
convince the people after you convince
school men. W e are convinced that the
methods of education which we represent
are the proper methods; we are howling
dervishes in our conviction. You can
hear us howl. If you listen you can
hear Prof, Rolfs and myself howl clear
down on the Gulf Coast and on the East
Coast and down in the Everglades. We
are convinced. The next proposition is
to convince the people that this proposi-
tion is true and that we are prepared to
serve them. Let me give you a few
*facts and ﬁgures. Before I give you
these, let me illustrate from the situation
in the State of Missouri. There are 555
high schools in that State which are re-
quired to give instruction in agriculture.
In these schools, how many do you think
were taking Latin and how many do you
think were taking the course in agricul-
ture? Out of the students in 555 high
schools which were required by the law
to have a course in agriculture, 28,000
students, who had the opportunity
brought to them in the schools to take
agriculture and at the same time the op-
portunity to take Latin, 14,000 were tak-
ing Latin and 1,180 taking agriculture!
Now, in our own State Institution, we
have an enrollment under the Agricul-
tural and Mechanical College Acts, of
college students amounting to ﬁfty-two.
That does not count two or three grad-
uate students or some 25 or 26 students
who are taking the literary course. The
total enrollment for the year just close-l
has been IO3—very small, but still the
largest college enrollment in the State.
\Ne include in this 31 preparatory and
some graduate students, but of those tak-
ing the regular Agricultural and Mechan-
ical College courses, there were 52.
Now, gentlemen, the doors are open
for a scientiﬁc education along the lines
in which you are most interested. Prof.
Rolfs and myself are going up and down
the State trying to convince the people
that what they want and need is educa-
tion along the practical lines of agricul-
ture and horticulture. There is no tui-
tion fee, no laboratory fee; board, fuel
and lights at $15.00 per month; and yet
we have under the agriculture college
professors, 52 students in agriculture and

the kindred subjects. This state of af-
fairs ought not to be.
It seems to me there are three reasons
for this condition. In the ﬁrst place, the
farmers of the State do not realize the
necessity for a technical education. They
do not realize that agriculture is a science
and that horticulture is a science. They
think if their grandfather plowed with '1
rope line over a lop-eared mule they
should not show disrespect to his mem-
ory by endeavoring to improve on his
methods. His antiquated methods were
agriculture, and agriculture is just simply
agriculture. Another difﬁculty is that
the rural population does not realize the
possibility of technical education in those
lines. It is a new idea. Agriculture used
to be regarded as a business which did
not need much, if any, apprenticeship.
It was simply a matter of “being brung
up to it.” The average farmer or fruit-
grower thought the “book—farmer” a fool,
——and perhaps they were sometimes right.
There is a general prejudice against the
“book treatment” of the subject. You
have undoubtedly observed this in your
own community. The average farmer
will say, “Oh, he is just a book farmer
and can’t teach me nothing.” Of course,
“the book farmer” in the early stages of
his career made mistakes, and is still mak-
ing them, perhaps; but, as a whole, the
fair-minded man is willing to concede
that he has more than made good. The
third difﬁculty that is observed is that
there is no movement in the State except
this one struggling enterprise looking to
this end. There is no high school in the
State representing this idea. There is no
school in the State teaching these things.
As a consequence, there is no stimulus
towards the University, and it is really
remarkable that we get more than ﬁve
or six to come up here to study.
This Society, in my judgment, might
be extremely effective in facilitating a
general movement in the State for carry-
ing horticultural and agricultural educa-
tion down into the graded schools. I do
not know anything more pitiful than to
see a little country boy going up to read
“Gallia est divisa in partes tres,” or some-
thing like that, and learning nothing and
caring nothing about the wonderful
branch of industry which he is to make
the work of his future life, knowing noth-
ing and caring nothing about the planting
and germinating and growth of a grain of
corn or wheat,—devoting a quarter of
his precious time to a study which will
not do him the remotest good which had
far better be spent in studying the science
of plant and vegetable life. Now, he
could at least learn that it is a science and
that it is to his interest and is his bus-
iness to study that science; and if he be-
gins the study he will follow it up through
the University,
Now, as I have before said, the run-
ning expenses of the University are met
mainly through the Federal Government.
In nearly sixty per cent. of the states in
the Union, the State is appropriating
more for its agricultural and mechanical
colleges than the Federal Government.
In some states they have practically as-
sumed the entire support of these institu-
tions. In our own State, the State gives
about one-third of the current income.
The institution could not be run three
months on the State appropriation for
current expenses. We are anxious to
serve the farmer boy. We are convinced,
and we want to convince the people and
we trust that this meeting of the Horti-
cultural Society may contribute to that
end. We believe that sooner or later we
will succeed; we know we must succeed,
because practical training is the only

training for a practical man living a prac-
tical life in a practical age. I do not
mean to depreciate true culture, but what
we need ﬁrst in this and every other State,
is an education which gets right down to
the practical phases of everyday life; and
the gentlemen of this distinguished So-
ciety can be of the utmost service in car-
rying forward that idea. We need more
practical education introduced into our
common schools, into our high schools;
and this University, your University,
gentlemen, needs and should receive the
co-operation and liberal support of the
State, in its campaign for the practical
education of the masses of the people,
and in its earnest efforts to serve all the
people of our common State according
to their needs.
RESPONSE.

Dr. W. C. Richardson, Tampa. '
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I certainly esteem it a privilege and
an honor to address an audience in this
great educational centre of the state. I
am afraid, however, that what may be a
source of pride to me may be an inﬂic-
tion to you before we get through with
it. If it is in the nature of an inﬂiction,
no one will be to blame but your Presi-
dent. When I got his notiﬁcation that
I was expected to respond to these ad-
dresses, I was on the eve of going to my
groves. I returned home last Friday
morning, but with my usual habit of pro-
crastination, had put of? writing my ad-
dress. When I got home Friday morn-
ing, the good Lord had seen ﬁt to send
a little grandchild to my daughter's home
and that upset me, naturally. So, in the
whirl of events, I did not have any time
to prepare my address. Then I thought
the best thing to do was to look over the
records of the proceedings of the last few
years and see what had been said and
patch up something extemporaneous from
that. \Vell, when I tell you what I
found, you will know what I was up
against there. We had, at the last meet-
ing, an address from our respected friend,
Dr. Kerr. The meeting before that we
had an address from our beloved friend,
Mr. Taber, and the meeting before that
we had an address from our revered and
lamented Mr. McCarty. No one can
compete in eloquence, style, ﬂuency and
interest with the addresses of these men.
But I am here; it is up to me, and
I am somewhat in the position of the hero
in one of Bret Hart’s little poems. He
was a preacher and a miner, and the bur-
den of the refrain was “He always did
his level best," and that is what I am here
to do.
I want to say that I am particularly
proud to come here to that which is es-
sentially ours; to our University and our
faculty. I am particularly delighted to
have heard the head of that University
speak as he has done. I have thought for
years, in my conceit, that I was one
of a few men who thought and talked
that the only kind of an education that

was worth having, is an education along
practical lines, but to hear it from the
President of a University is a surprise
and a pleasure.
I realize, as he realizes, that a techni-
cal education along technical lines is far
better, far more useful and far more ben-
eﬁcial in every way than a so-called clas-
sical education. I think it was Oliver
W'endell Holmes who wrote:
“There is many a one, though highly skilled
in hic, hac, hoe,
In arts and knowledge still a block."
When my children had grown up and
were in school, they laughed at this quo-
tation, saying that my Latin pronuncia-
tion was old style and wrong and that
it should be heck, hyke. hoke. I said,
“Let it go at that even, and it will still
be applicable as
‘There is many a one though highly skilled in
heek, hyke, hoke,
In arts and knowledge still a BLoxEl’ "
I am delighted to know that we have
this kind of an institution. I am delighted
to know that we have this kind of men
at its head. As has been said. “It is
ours,” and I am glad that we have come
to our own at last.
Now, Mr. Mayor, I want to thank you
for your courteous invitation to your hos-
pitalities, for your courteous welcome to
what you have here. and they are no
small things. \Ve appreciate this city
with its paved streets, with its great Uni-
versity, with its great men, and we es-
teem it a privilege to be here. We are
glad, and we realize that you understand
that Horticulture is more and higher than
a human institution. \Ve may come up
here with hard hands and hard heads,
perhaps, as sons of toil, but nevertheless
we are horticulturists, and horticulturists
are men who have something to be proud
of. The calling of horticulture is, as
you have intimated, of Divine origin. The
ﬁrst horticulturist was the Creator Him-
self. He prepared the garden, put fruits
and ﬂowers into it, and ﬁnally put man
into it. Man, in his usual manner, dis-
tinguished himself by getting into trouble
the ﬁrst thing, and then blamed it onto the
woman. Unfortunately for us, the Crea-
tor did the same thing that we are doing.
He put a tree of evil in there, and that
caused the trouble.
There was another reference made by
your Honor, about anyone being a bene-
factor who caused two blades of grass to
grow where one grew before. I want to
say that we are, on that proposition, mul-
tiple benefactors. There isn’t one of us
who has not beat that all to pieces. If
you don't believe it, try to dig up a blade
of Bermuda grass and see what follows.
These gentlemen who have preceded
me have not taken up all the time allotted
to them, and unlike the omnipresent poli-
tician, I have been “elected,'’ for the
evening at least, consequently I don’t
have to quit.
Isn’t it a wonderful thing that the Bi-
ble speaks so often of fruits and ﬂowers?
It refers to the rose, the lily, the pome-
granate, the olive and the ﬁg, but never
a word about the grosser productions
such as potatoes, carrots, cabbage, etc.
‘The most wonderful thing that has ever
happened, the greatest event that was
ever enacted in the world’s history, took
place in an olive grove; I mean that won.
derful scene that was enacted in the gar-
den of Gethsamene. ~ I was in that gar.
den about two years ago, therefore it
may not be amiss for me to say a word
in regard to it. _I can understand why
the peopleof Palestine take to horticul-
ture instead of agriculture. They \vOuId
not enjoy plowing with a lop-cared mule,

L'S FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
01' plowing at all for that matter. And,
by the way, they have no lop-cared mules
in Palestine, and no plows, but you see
them scratching along with a forked stick
drawn by a cow, or occasionally an un—
dersized donkey; that is the nearest ap‘
proach to a lopeared mule in Palestine.
It is the ﬁnest country for good or-
anges in the world. The JaFfa orange is
the best orange I have ever seen. It
has been my privilege to eat those oranges
right from the trees, but delicious as they
are, give me Florida every time. I would
not give a quarter section of Florida sand
for a township in Palestine. \Vhen I
stood in the hill country of Judea looking
out 'over the valley of the Jordan and
saw the mountains of Moab and Nebo’s
lonely peak in all its glory, the idea oc-
curred to me that the Lord was certainly
good to Moses to let him die before he
got into the land of Palestine. Perhaps
it is not today what it was in the day
of Moses. Today, it is a land of dirt,
ﬁlth, ignorance and Turkish misrule, and
nothing to commend it. Give me Florida
every time.
There is one other thing I want 'to
bring before you. I think we too fre-
quently neglect to live up to our oppor-
tunities and to make the most of our
immediate surroundings. \Ne come up
here to these meetings, resolving to do
and be done. \Ve come together, hop-
ing to do ourselves and our occupation
good, and we talk beautifully and make
plans, and resolute—and then we go
home and in a few weeks fall back into
our lethargic, indiﬁ'erent, indolent meth—
ods, and our good resolutions are all for-
gotten. Now, if we could carry some of
our enthusiasm home with us, if we
would carry some of our resolutions home
and act upon them, it would be better for
us, it would be better for the business in
which we are engaged, it would be bet-
ter for the institution of which you, Mr.
President, have spoken. Let us try to
do it; let us realize that here in Florida
we have opportunities such as are found
in few countries of the world, certainly
in very few states of the Union. Let us
work with the determination to make the
most of our opportunities. Let us do
the best we can to further the interests
of our Society and our great educational
institution.
I remember reading some time ago of
a ship in the days of sailing vessels. The
ship had met with contrary weather, and
had been partly dismantled, driven from
its course, and ﬁnally the water had given
out. At last, when the crew was about
to perish from thirst, a vessel was seen
approaching. The captain of the dam—
aged ship called through the trumpet,
“Give us water,” and the answer came
back, “Drop your buckets where you
are!" They thought it a strange answer
and repeated again, “Water! We per-
ish! Give us water.” Again the answer
came back, “Drop your buckets where
you are!" The third time they begged
for water, and the third time the answer
came back, “Drop your buckets where
you are!” They ﬁnally thought there
must be some reason for such an answer
and dropped their buckets which came
up ﬁlled and brimming with fresh, sweet
water. They had been driven into the
hundred-mile—wide mouth of the Amazon
and did not know that they were sur-
rounded with fresh water.
Now, when we are perishing with a

diversity of trials, when we are disman-
tled by freezes, droughts, white ﬂies, po-
litical campaigns, etc., we should drop
our buckets where we are, and bring them
up ﬁlled with the reviving water of re-
newed courage, prosperity and success.
In conclusion, let me say that
“This world is full of beauty like other worlds,
above;
And if we do but our duty, it will be full of
love."

President’s Annual Address.
By Prof. P. H. Rolfs.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
\Ve are here to hold our twenty-ﬁrst
annual meeting. The hand of fate has
guided us during these twenty years into
the most distant portions of the state;
from Pensacola on the west, to St. Au-
gustine on the east and Miami on the
south. It is quite probable that when
Key West shall be made the most south-
ern railway station in Florida we will
stretch out a hand of welcome to our
lusty young neighbor, the Cuban Horti-
cultural Society.
During our devious wanderings and
in the course of these two decades, our
membership has gradually increased.
Even the terrible freezes could not chill
the ardor for information. The meet-
ing of 1895, following the most disas-
trous catastrophe the state has known,
was characterized by the most earnest
attention to the program. While the at-
tendance was smaller than at some of the
previous ones, the membership was suf-
ﬁcient to enable us to print the annual
proceedings.
Of the members who took part in the
organization at Ocala, only four of the
original eighteen remain to us. Our
worthy and distinguished ex-president
was then a lusty youngster. You would
not know that he is a year older today,
if it were not for a slight intimation of
gray, and his dignity when in the execu-
tive chair.
CHAN GES IN VARIETIES:
Twenty years ago the list of varieties
of oranges was probably as long as the
list of today. Many that were at that
time thought to be the best have since
been discarded, and six varieties not then
recognized are ranked as among the best
today. The list of those that have orig-
inated in Florida is increasing, and it is
quite probable that in the course of time
the leading varieties will be those that
have originated in our state.
In our ﬁrst catalog of Florida fruits
only one variety of grapefruit was recog-
nized. There are now at least a score,
nine of which are catalogued by this So-
ciety. The old many-seeded, ﬁrst-known
grapefruit is rapidly being displaced by
newer and less seedy varieties.
The progressive changes in the citrus
fruits are however no greater than in the
deciduous fruits.
In the case of vegetables we have a
much more radical change. The old va-
rieties have been almost entirely replaced.
In fact, vegetables were grown only to
a limited extent twenty years ago. Even
celery was spoken of as an experiment
as late as the report of our ﬁfth meet-
ing.
CHANGES IN RAILROADING.
At the time of the founding of this
Society (1888) a large part of the state
was horticulturally unknown. Such rail-
roads as occurred in the state were poorly

equipped, and many were disjointed frag-
ments beginning in a hammock and end—
ing somewhere in the piney woods. How
horticulturists ever succeeded in making
a living under those conditions of trans-
portation is impossible for us of a later
day to understand. The following inci-
dent, which occurred in the spring of
1892, illustrates the indifferent way in
which business was done on some of the
plug lines then in operation. Some co-
operative experiments were being car-
ried on at Grand Island, and it was de-
sirable for me to make my way from Eus-
tis to a point on the Sanford 81 St. P. R.
R. By driving to Tavares one would be
able to take the T. & G. then popularly
known as the “Tag.” which left at about
sunrise. On the morning in question,
the train, probably the only one on the
road, was composed of a few box carsv
and a coach for accommodating passen-
gers. The train started about a half hour
late, but still early enough to prevent
the passengers from obtaining breakfast.
After running for an hour or an hour
and a half the train stopped suddenly in
the woods. The whole crew, from ﬁre-
man to conductor, abandoned the train
and started directly for a nearby water-
melon ﬁeld. We passengers discussed
among ourselves whether to follow or to
remain. To our surprise, the train men
went leisurely about to ﬁnd the choicest
melons, carried them to a fence, sat down
and ate until satisﬁed, and then each car-
ried back to the train one or two melons.
\Vell, to cut the story short, we got to
Clermont just in time to see the train we
wished to take pull out from the other
station. One train a day. Passengers
and perishable fruit left at a junction
point without any reasonable cause.
VV'hile we do not live under ideal condi-
tions at present, the passenger and freight
trafﬁc is fairly good compared with a
decade and a half ago.
THE PRACTICAL HORTICULTURIST AN AR-
TIST.
The progress made in the production
of ﬁne fruit is fully as great, or possibly
greater, than that in transportation. We
all recognize the fact, however, that we
still have much to learn. If it were not
for the strong desire to improve on our
present condition we would not be as-
sembled here.
The best horticulturists of today in
Florida are artists in their special lines.
It takes as much careful thought, and
as much application of this thought, to
produce an ideal tomato, or an ideal or—
ange or grapefruit, as it does to produce
a ﬁne picture on canvas, or to build an
engine. As there are only a few master
hands that can command a talent sufﬁ-
cient to produce a really ﬁrst-class paint-
ing, so there are only a few who produce
a really superior horticultural product;
and still fewer who have the commer-
cial instinct sufﬁciently developed to get
the highest price for their product.
The pioneer fruit and vegetable grower
lives under conditions that enable him to
extract a mere existence in exchange for
his toil and thought. It is quite natural
that he should become more or less dis-
satisﬁed with his lot in life. His sur—
roundings cause him to lose interest in
his work and home; he either sinks into
a careless and indifferent existence, or
drifts to a populous center where he be-
comes a mere atom in human existence,
and tosses about from one engagement to
another.
MIGRATION 'ro BUSINESS CENTERS.
Under our old routine rule-of-thumb
method of horticulture, the farmer and
his children were mere machines, which

32 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
did a certain amount of work at the ex-
pense of a certain amount of energy. The
thinking-mechanism was scarcely called
into action. Under such conditions it
is no wonder that our young men and
young women sought relief by migrat—
ing to the business centers. The evidence
from history is that our foremost states-
men, our foremost men and women in
literary pursuits, as well as our foremost
business men, were in the majority of
cases raised in the country. This migra-
tion to the business centers still continues.
It is not surprising to those who have
studied the matter, and who perceive
somewhat clearly the cause. You cannot
blame a young woman for hesitating to
accept the position of a wife in the coun-
try, when laborious drudgery, from early
morning until late at night, is the only
prospect in view. You cannot blame the
young man for shrinking from a life of
six days constant toil, and a Sunday of
only half rest. Under such conditions
we ﬁnd even the fathers and mothers,
who have spent possibly a half century
of constant vigil on the farm, moving to
the town or city to retire and spend the
rest of their lives in comfort. This
move to the city would never have been
contemplated if they had been perfectly
contented on the farm; or if the farm
were the ideal place it ought to be. They
move to town because their money will
there buy them the comforts that were
not obtainable in the country.
MIGRATION TO THE FARM AT PRESENT
l M POSSIBLE.
I have called attention to the fact of
history that a larger percentage of our
leading men and women were raised on
farms than was due to the rural popula—
tion. There must therefore be some vir-
tue in the country as such for producing
superior intellects, sturdy manhood and
womanhood. Let us for a moment look
at the extreme negative of this question.
In the tenement district of New York
City, which is the most populous center
in America, there hangs a diagram show-
ing the number of people to the acre of
ground. It is calculated that at the same
rate of crowding the world’s population
could be placed in the State of Delaware.
An accompanying diagram shows that
the average boy and girl in this crowded
section is far below the normal size.
These facts are so well known to my
hearers that it is useless for me to en-
large upon them. My speech has recalle-l
to you the well known fact that we have
a constant stream of migration from the
country to the town, and n0 counter-cur-
rent to the farm. It speaks volumes for
the thrift and strength of those who re-
main that this condition could have gone
on for decades. The stream has been all
one way—toward the town. It should
not be understood that I would raise an
argument against migration to the city.
It very often happens that a very poor
farmer would have made a ﬁrst-class mer-
chant, lawyer, preacher, or doctor. No
two of us are endowed with the same
talents and tastes combined in the same
manner. \Ve cannot readjust the ele-
ments that make up our talents and intel-
lects, but it is our divinely—appointed duty
to seek and ﬁnd the vocation for which
we have been best endowed.
BACK TO THE FARM.
Thousands of people, possibly hun-
dreds of thousands, in the United States
ﬁnd out when too late to change, that
they have taken up the wrong vocation.
The following is a composite of scores

of pathetic letters that have come to my
oﬁice for a reply:
Dear Sir :—I have twelve hundred dol-
lars that I have saved in the last ten
years and wish to start in farming or
fruit growing, as my health has .been
pretty badly broken by hard ofﬁce work.
There are three children in our family
who ought to be brought up on a farm.
I want to get away from town so that I
can enjoy the companionship of my
family.
\Vhere in your state can I invest and
make a living from the start?
Yours truly,
Can there be anything more pathetic?
After ten years of hard, unrelenting toil,
with health broken, and disappointed in
his highest ambition of providin'r for his
family. Ten years of the best of his life
spent in following the wrong vocation.
Ready, like the drowning man, to grasp
at a straw. he risks his future on the ad-
vice of a man to him unknown and in a
distant state. I must confess to you,
ladies and gentlemen, that when that prop-
osition is placed before me to answer, my
courage fails. It is too serious a mat-
ter. -
These letters, of which the above is a
composite, would not have made so deep
an impression on my mind; nor would
I have realized the magnitude of the un-
rest in the city population, but for one
incident that came to my attention rather
accidentally.
Mr. A, D. Shamel, a young friend of
mine, was asked to award the prizes in
the corn exhibit of the North-west. In
an interview with a Chicago newspaper
reporter he made mention of the fact that
many young men wanted to go back to
the farm. In less than ten hours letters
began to pour in, and for two days three
stenographers were unable to complete
the work of replying to the inquiries.
This happened just before the money
panic. The burden of all these inquiries
was, How to get back to the farm?
I do not contend that all of these men
would make a success of farm work. It
had been clearly demonstrated to them,
however, that they were misﬁts in the
city. They were eagerly seeking for an
opportunity to get away from the city,
but the way was securely blocked.
I have drawn out these illustrations at
length to show fully the present condi-
tion. (No one can say that he is not in-
terested, for it is our own children who
are swelling and will swell the throngs
in the over-crowded cities.)
Dr. Sledd, in his address tonight, has
shown most clearly that our public schools
teach our boys and girls away from the
farm and from the grove. Nowhere in
our common school system do we ﬁnd
anything that will make the boy more
efﬁcient on the farm or grove, or the girl
more efﬁcient in the house.
AGRICULTURE IN OUR COMMON SCHOOLS.
In discussing the matter of agricul-
tural education in various parts of the
state this year, a number of people have
told me that they could teach their boy
more agriculture and better agriculture
on the farm than he could learn in any
school. My natural retort is: “But do
you do it ?” The candid answer must be,
No. Every mother here is able to teach
her girls and boys arithmetic, spelling,
and geography; but she does not do it,
simply because it is much cheaper to hire
it done, and at the same time the teach-
ing will be much more efﬁcient. Let me
ask again: How many of ussend our.

children to hear the reminiscences and
war stories told from grocery boxes, and
call that history? The agriculture that
is taught in the ﬁeld while driving a mule
or “cussing” a laborer bears about the
same relation to agriculture that the gro-
cery-box reminiscences do to history. It
is not because the subject is too intricate
or difﬁcult, but no parent can afford to
take the time from his busy day of labor
to assume the role of a teacher. and give
his son a systematic and rounded course
' in agriculture, any more than he can af-
ford to give his son a course in arithme-
tic or bookkeeping. It takes no longer
to teach a dozen students in the same
class than one; consequently, it is much
cheaper to hire some one to teach a whole
class than it is to spend all the time on one
student. '
Probably the most potent reason why
agriculture is at present so imperfectly
developed in that adequate systematic
effort for its advancement has not been
made. Organized and concerted ef-
forts for its advancement have been
practically unknown until very re-
cently: and at present even higher edu-
cation in agriculture cannot be said to
be well organized. excepting in those
states that are most advanced.
\Ve are entering a period where or-
ganized and systematic effort will be re-
quired to accomplish anything even of
moderate proportion. Agriculture, the
newest of the sciences, is being rounded.
out and brought into tangible shape.
Our sister states, Georgia and Alabama,
have made provision for district high
schools in which are taught agriculture
and domestic science.
This is well enough so far as it goes,
. but it stops too high up. The very pu-
pils who need the education most are the
ones that are denied the privilege of at-
tending the high schools. It is only a
small percentage of our Florida boys and
girls that receive any training above the
eighth grade. These young people need
to get some insight into the plants and an-
imals they see and handle every day.
Books have been, and are being, pub-
lishetl bringing our knowledge into a
concrete and teachable form. What if
they don’t learn quite so much about the
number of planets, or recite fewer deﬁni-
tions from a so-called grammar!
It is not necessary to over-burden the
course of study with agriculture in order

There are many thousands of children

who would gladly avail themselves of a
chance to learn something that appeals
to them as being worth the while.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen. I wish
to say that we have left our homes and
labors at no small sacriﬁce. \Ve are here
not for the mere pleasure we get out of
the trip—that is a mere incident to the
annual pilgrims: nor are we here that we
may accumulate a few more dollars by
some sordid method; but we expect to
go back better men and better women;
better equipped mentally and morally for
the unceasing struggle of life. We ex-
pect to return home with newer and bet—
ter ideas of how to equip and beautify
the home; and above all, we expect to
be better women and men for having
met our distant friends and neighbors on
common ground for argument and dis-
cussion.
As your presiding ofﬁcer, I hope that
the arguments will be strong and force-
ful, and the discussions vigorous and t0
the point, sparing neither colleague nor
adversary: for it is the heated furnace
that separates the gold from the dross.

Climatology of the Citrus.
By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson.
1V1 r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject of climate has in all ages
and all countries furnished a vast and
highly important ﬁeld for the considera-
tion of the horticulturist.
This is especially true of those engaged
in citrus fruit culture, for it is a thor-
oughly demonstrated fact that the orange
is limited in its proﬁtable commercial
production to certain well deﬁned climatic
zones.
The study of airs, waters, places and
soils may fairly be said to embrace chieﬂy
that which is included in the climatology
of a locality or territory. On the north-
ern hemisphere the isothermal line of
seventy may perhaps be said to be the
centre of the orange growing districts,
and the isotherms of sixty and eighty
practically, though not exclusively, the
limits. The isotherm of seventy is not
conﬁned to latitude but extends, in belt—
ing the earth, north and south more than
ten degrees and may be said to range be-
tween the twenty-ﬁfth and thirty—ﬁfth
parallels. Within this belt are found the
orange-growing districts of California,
Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, Spain, Mo-
rocco, Algiers, (Italy, Egypt and Asia
Minor.
These are not the only countries in
which the orange thrives. as there are
many other places in the transitional
zones, both north and south, in which it
may be found doing fairly well, but they
include nearly all the districts that are
chief factors in the commercial produc-
tion of this fruit.
The orange does not attain its great-
est perfection or productiveness in tropic
heat and can stand little or no freezing
cold, hence any place where the tempera-
ture ranges for any length of time below
twenty or above one hundred is not a
suitable climate for its culture. In South-
ern Europe, Northern Africa, \K'estern
Asia and in California the cold is greater
than in Florida, but is more evenly dis—
tributed and continuous. In Spain,
Southern France and Northern Italy or-
ange groves are often covered with snow_
In these countries, and in California as
well, temperatures ranging as low as
seventeen or eighteen degrees Fahrenheit
are not infrequent and result in no seri-
ous harm to orange trees. In Florida
owing to more warm davs. such extremes
would be disastrous. Continuous cold
weather hardens the trees. but alternate
warm and cold periods (10 great damage.
Under the head of water in relation
to orange culture it may be said that it
is a necessity in liberal quantities.
As to location, it is a fact worthy of
note that the most thriving districts are
clustered around large bodies of water.
as the Paciﬁc, Mexican Gulf and Medi-
terranean Coasts.
The most extensive orange districts of
Mexico are perhaps an exception to this
and are found on the table lands, at ele-
vations of from three to ﬁve thousand

feet; but even here they are rarely more
than seventy-ﬁve or one hundred miles
from the Gulf or Paciﬁc Coasts.
I saw no large or thrifty looking trees
in Mexico, and in fact I have never see'n
trees anywhere as large and vigorous
looking as we have in Florida.
Oranges grown to maturity in the
tropics are frequently wormy and us-
ually sweet, almost to insipidity; hence
they are generally harvested when
intended for shipping before ripe. The
delicious, snappy subacid ﬂavor that
makes the orange so attractive requires
some cool weather.
Long, continuous heat without cold
snaps which we, perhaps wrongly, dread
so much, has a tendency to encourage
all kinds of predatory insects, described
and indescribable and some others be-
sides.
If there is a deﬁciency in precipitation,
mean or relative humidity, to get the
best results it must be made up by irri-
gation. In those places, as Florida and
Mexico, where there is a summer rainy
season, the ripening of the fruit is some-
what accelerated and it reaches maturity
shortly after the close of the wet season.
On the other hand, a dry summer and
rainy season in the winter, as in Cali-
fornia, has a tendency to retard the time
of ripening.
As to soil, it may be said that a littoral
alluvium rich in sand is the best. The
writer’s observations lead him to say that
he has seldom seen a proﬁtable orange-
growing district in which there was not
a rich supply of sand in the soil,
There have been so many scares re-
cently that it may be worth while to say
a few words as to change of climate,
about which of late years we have been
talking so much. but perhaps no more
than people have feared and discussed
for the past ﬁve or six thousand years.
There is a probability susceptible of
proof that within the period of recorded
history there has been absolutely no
change of climate, with the exception of
slight local changes due to destruction
or planting of forests, cultivation of
crops, irrigation, etc.
In the marvelously storied land of
Egypt the same cereals, fruits and veg-
etables are planted and harvested at the
same time of the year they were thou-
sands of years before the time of the
Pharaohs. In Palestine, if not since the
antedeluvian period, certainly and posi-
tively since the time of Moses there has
been no change. The seed time and the
harvest time of the same staples, includ-
ing seasonal festivals of the Syrians are
still on the same dates. The same is true
of Europe, and the brief history of Amer-
ica offers no other kind of evidence.
Meteorologists have from time to time
advanced many plausible theories as to
the causes that operate to produce sudden
changes and extremes of weather. Solar
heat is thought to be the main, if not the
only source of warmth. Planetary in-
ﬂuences as disturbing causes have had
many advocates and a Frenchman has
recently suggested that the earth revolv-
ing in its orbit has a motion like a spin-
ning top, and from time to time wobbles
nearer to or farther from the sun, with-
out any possible regularity; hence the
absence of periodicity as time in the oc-
currence of severe changes. All theories
so far advanced, it seems. are almost
purely speculative, and probably extremes
of temperature are caused largely. if not
solely, by local disturbances and move-
ments of the atmosphere. It is scarcely
two hundred years since accurate instru-

ments, careful observations and detailed
records have been in use, but these show
no change. Speaking from a geological
standpoint, the climate is indeed grow-
ing warmer. There is evidence of glacial
drift with Arctic weather as far south
as Ohio, and the same is true of Central
Europe. These geological changes, how-
ever require thousands of years for their
manifestation and we need not suffer
any fear that our citrus isotherm will
move far enough north to make it too
tropical for any orange groves that may
be planted near it within the limits of
our present civilization.

DISCUSSION.
Prof. Rolfs—We have cords of sta-
tistics on records of weather and cli-
mate, but we have not a single man
who can interpret them or make any
use of them. \Ve are now getting our
climatological records in a little more
accessible shape than they were twelve
or thirteen years ago.

Methods of Shipping and Packing.
By w. s. Hart.
Mr. President, Ladies and chtlcnu’n:
It has been wittily said, “To train a
child, commence with his grandfather.”
So to market fruit easily and proﬁtably,
one should commence by so cultivating,
fertilizing and handling the grove as to
produce good fruit, i. e., fruit of desira-
ble sizes, good color, ﬁne appearance,
heavy weight, leathery rind and with
juice qualities of the highest type; but,
as all this has been and will continue to
be discussed in these meetings by other
committees, I will pass on to the time
the fruit is taken from the tree.
By a careful study of Prof. G. Harold
Powell's very valuable report. “The De-
cay of Oranges While in Transit From
California” (Bureau of Plant Industry,
Bulletin No. 123), and the report of
Prof. Tenny before this society last year,
all orange growers should become con—
vinced of the important part that careful
and profier handling of the fruit bears
on the matter of successful marketing.
\Vith the best product of its kind, put on
the market in the best possible shaﬂc there
remains little in the way of “marketing
problem” that need tax the ability of any
able business man.
Every handler of fruit wants the out-
put of him who furnishes the best. To
the dealer it means high prices, the most
proﬁt, the best trade and the ﬁnest kind
of advertising at no Cost whatever; for
every grower wants to get in where high
prices are being steadily realized, no mat-
ter what the quality of his own fruit may
be, and the consumer able to pay for the
best goes to the high-priced merchant,
feeling assured that there is where he
will ﬁnd it.
I propose in this paper to give special
attention to that branch of the subject
covering the preparation of oranges so
that they may command the attention of
the best trade on arrival in market. leav-
ing the broader but not more important
phases of marketing to other members
of this committee, whose experiences
especially ﬁt them for the work.
Hire all help by the hour, except, pos-
sibly, the foreman and box-maker. \\'hen
sending the pickers to the grove they
should be well equipped with plenty of
the best tools for their work that the
market, or the employer, can provide.
A strong draft animal, with nose cov-
ered so that he cannot browse even a leaf
from the trees, a good, three-reach plat-
form wagon so made that the hind wheels
will follow the tracks of the front ones,
plenty of good ﬁeld boxes made to rest
one on top of the other in a way that
will not allow of slipping. and with sides
lower by three inches than the tops of
the end heads, with openings at the sides
near the bottom to allow of the free cir-
culation of air and easy cleaning, with
sides not too thick or heavy, and the box
to hold no more or less than from one»

half to a full packed box of oranges
according to the system of handling, and
provided with good hand holds at the
ends. Never use bags for picking. Either
baskets, tin or galvanized iron receptacles
are the only ones on the market that are
safe. The latest make of basket leaves
little to be desired in that line.
Send a light but strongly made step-
ladder for every picker and a good ex-
tension ladder to about every three men,
if the trees are of good size. Most im-
portant of all, send clippers that are
strong and durable so that each picker
can afford to own and care for the one
he uses, and so made as to render it as
near to an impossibility to clipper-cut or
puncture an orange as possible and yet
allow of cutting the stem snug to the
calyx, or even slice a part of it from the
fruit.
Until within a very short time, there
has been no really good orange clipper
on the market. Now the need is fully
met. It is best always to send an extra
' pair of clippers along, and also a jug of
water, that time may not be wasted in
trips back to the packing house in case
either is needed. No man should be al-
lowed to use a pair of clippers that is not
in perfect order so as to do good work
rapidly.
With the foregoing equipment and a
piece of chalk for putting their number
on each box they pick, the pickers should
start their work at the bottom branches
and wOrk up as high as they can easily
reach: then take the step ladders and.
without leaning them against the tree,
clean it of its fruit to fourteen or ﬁfteen
feet from the ground. Above this, long
ladders will have to be used: but the
utmost care should be exercised not to
jam the limbs and fruit out of place more
than can be avoided; as where that
is done much fruit is injured by thorn-
ing, crushing, scratching, or being shaken
from the tree. Do not allow pickers to
pull on an orange to get it within reach
of the clippers. Every orange should be
so clipped that if the stem end should be
ﬁrmly pressed against another orange, it
could not injure it.
The picker should be trained to clip
three or four oranges, where hanging
handily, before putting them in the bas»
ket; which must be done carefully and
without a drop of over a half-dozen inches
at most. Don't leave scattering fruit,
but pick clean as far as you go, unless
selecting for size or ripeness. Turn the
fruit into the ﬁeld boxes with care, keep
all dead twigs and trash out of all
receptacles and keep the fruit shaded
from the hot sun while waiting to be
hauled. In loading, see that no box is
so full as to permit of injuring the fruit
by placing another on top of it. or that
any may roll off. .
If oranges drop so that injury is pos’
sible, lay them out as culls. There are
many methods of handling fruit at the-
packing-house. They should be studied
and the one best suited to the individual
needs adopted: but there are some gen—
eral directions that may apply to all cases.
The packing—house should be arranged
for the careful and economical handling
of fruit, as little carrying from place to
place as possible; as little lifting of heavy
weights as need be and above and over
all, plenty of light. The house, bins and
runways should be kept reasonably clean
and no rotting fruit be allowed to remain
in them or in out-of-the-way corners to
ﬁll the air with blue mold germs. Every-
thing that fruit comes in contact with—-
receptacles. runways, spouts or ﬁnger

40 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
nails—should be often inspected to see
that no rotten fruit, slivers, nail heads,
rough trash or sharp edges can, by any
possibility, come in contact with it. If
oranges could squeal like a pig when hurt,
there would be noisy times in some pack-
ing-houses and about some pickers.
The markets have had washed fruit
and like it, if washed without injury.
No washer will do good and safe work
in the hands of careless workers; but
there are some now on the market that,
properly handled, will rather add to than
injure the keeping qualities of our fruit
while doing nice work. I wash all my
fruit, though it is as clean and bright as
that of any grove probably, and I could
hardly be hired to give up the practice.
After washing the fruit should be dried,
being but one layer deep before being put
into bins or crowded together in any
way. A wet skin does not hurt sound
citrus fruits if all parts are wet. Drying
on one side and soaking on another is
not recommended. My own packing-
house is so arranged that if fruit has to
be taken in wet from the outside drying
rack, it will dry evenly in the trays where
it is graded.
All citrus fruits should be carefully
graded into at least two grades. My
own practice is to make three grades:
Fancy, No, I Bright and No. 2 Bright.
I have few russets. While grading, I
have the scale insects, where there are
any, removed by scraping with a light
spatula of hard pine. Any orange that
is even doubtful as to soundness is put
in the cull box.
I prefer to pack after the fruit has been
off the trees at least twenty to thirty
hours and has lost its rigiditv.
If the system of handling is in deep
masses of fruit, then the quicker they are
packed and shipped the better their con-
dition on arrival in market. If the nights
are cool and the days warm, it is ad-
visable to close the packing—house tightly
before the air warms up much, as
otherwise it will deposit its moisture on
the cold fruit so that they become drip-
ping wet and unﬁt to be handled for the
time being. With this exception a good
current of pure air through the packing-
house is always desirable.
From the grading trays, the fruit goes
to the large hopper holding many boxes,
and from there to the sizer and through
the spouts to the packing-bins, The slope
of the hopper should be a little greater,
but for drying rack and spouting, three-
fourths inch to the foot is about right.
There are many sizers on the market and
several do good work. I should choose
one that by no possibility could injure the
fruit, that would size by the largest
diameter, would be lasting, simple in con-
struction and easy to run.
The bins from which the fruit is packed
should be of good size; those likely to
receive the greatest quantity should be
the largest; those taking the largest and
smallest sizes can be of less capacity.
They should be so constructed as to avoid
the necessity of pulling the fruit about
with the hands and should have either
canvas bottoms or be well cushioned
where the oranges are to drop more than
four inches.
Use strong but not heavy tissue paper
for wraps. The so—called Japanese is
good, but a little too transparent. Paper
that will give a reddish tinge to the fruit
is best, if not too tender. Have your
private- brand printed on each wrap.
and not so large but that the whole of
it will show plainly on a zoo-size orange.
Wrap with brand opposite the stem and

pack as closely as possible without injury
to the fruit. If the pack runs too high
or too low, don’t pass the box until it is
made just right by changing some of the
fruit. The sizer must be set according
to the shape of the fruit and will occa-
sionally require re-adjusting where the
average shape changes, as it will do when
running on different varieties or fruit
from different soils,
Close packs will not stand to pack as
high as the looser ones. From half to
three-quarters of an inch above the heads
of the box, necessitating considerable
pressure in putting on the cover, is about
right if packed properly in the layers. If
the boxes are trimmed with lace paper,
it is best to paste it at the bottom of the
box and pack the ﬁrst two or three layers
with the brand next to it, then stencil
so that in opening, that side will be the
cover. If an attractive display card for
the retailer to hang in his store is put
in, it helps the marketing. Everything
that tends to give the impression of care
and neatness about a packed box and its
contents adds to the price the fruit will
bring and increases the demand. I have
my material gotten out to orders sent in
May for fall delivery. Bead the edges of
every side, use a handsome strap thick
enough to allow air to circulate between
the boxes, and a neat and tasty stencil
or printer. Don’t hesitate to put time
and labor into preparing your fruit for
market, for there is where a good portion
of the proﬁt lies. Every large city con-
tains one, two or three, seldom more,
fruit dealers who handle only fancy stock
and they have customers who care little
for the price they pay but are only satis-
ﬁed with the very best fruits obtainable.
These are the houses that purchase from
the man who puts intelligent work into
his products; they are the ones that pay
a dollar, two dollars or even more above
the top quotations and never ﬁnd more
than they want of the kind that pleases
them. There are only about three houses
of this kind in New York, our largest
city. The others pay the prices quoted,
but they will pay more for the second
grade or for the poorer sizes of the man
who supplies the best trade than they will
for the best fruit of the careless shipper.
The shipper who caters to the best
trade is not apt to be the one who ships
one, two or more cars a day, but he may
employ as many hands as one who does
and give them work four months each
season, help his town as much and net
as much proﬁt as his neighbor who has
several times his acreage and crop. The
man who makes and markets his crop at
a cost of $1.25 and gets $1.50 for it makes
a clear proﬁt of 25 cents. He who sells
for $3.00 makes five times as much net
gain, if we allow 2 5 cents for added com~
mission and cost of preparation, and there
will be a short time almost every season
when he will gross six or seven dollars
per box for his best grades and sizes.
At these prices, the small grower of only
a few thousand boxes, and groves not
so large but that he can handle them prop-
erly and protect them in case of danger,
may have quite a satisfactory income,
while he escapes much of the anxiety and
loss of the large grove owner who can—
not give the close personal supervision
necessary to the very best work. I am
a believer in small groves, but there are
individuals who are built for big things
and can carry them on successfully.
though they seldom reach the top of the
market.
The matter of agencies through which
to market is one that I will leave mostly

to other members of this committee to
present; but I wish to say this much:
if you put your fruit in the hands of com-
mission houses, look them up carefully
before-doing so, both as to reliability and
courage in naming prices. To put hun—
dreds, or thousands, of dollars' worth of
your products into the hands of strangers
at a distance, with no security or guaran-
tee of a square deal, is one of the stran-
gest customs of our business system. You
would not loan money to them without
careful consideration and ample security,
Why should we throw such fearful
temptation in the way of our fellow man
and give him so many chances for fraud-
ulent gain with little chance of punish-
ment until, whether honest or not, he gets
blamed when results fall short of our ex-
pectations? If we must do this, let us at
least take every means possible of elim-
inating temptation and assure ourselves of
the integrity of those who sell our pro
ducts. Some salesmen have little trouble
in asking 25 cents above the market for
something extra nice; but for the shipper
of the choicest oranges there must be
salesmen who know a good thing when
they see it and who can‘ ask ﬁfty cents,
a dollar or two dollars above the market
with absolute assurance that it is not an
over-charge.
Much condemnation has been heaped
on the heads of those who make early
shipments of green fruit. It is often
claimed that such shippers get meagre re-
turns and ruin the orange market for
others for the season; that it should be
frowned upon by every citrus grower or
handler and stopped by law, if possible.
The ﬁrs-t claim is seldom true, for the
worst of these sinners. It is those who
compromise with their conscience and fol-
low the bolder ones, who take the low
prices. For instance, a neighbor with
groves alongside of mine shipped his tan-
gerines in early November and got, gross,
$6.00 and $7.00 for them. I commenced
November 20th, and they sold for $5.00
and even lower later in the season. I am
no lawyer, but I don’t believe that the
law can touch the matter, except it be
through Boards of Health at the north-
ern end; not would I advocate it if I
could, for I believe there is and always
will be legitimate demand for a small
quantity of early green fruit at good
prices, and just so long as this is the case,
just so long as growers are hungry for
money in the fall, just so long as the fear
of loss through drought, cold or other
disaster is upon him who has a crop for
sale—just so long will there be a rush
of green oranges to market early in the
season, a few condemned by health au-
thority, a few high prices realized and
then a slump and disappointment for the
laggards. As these things will continue,
why rant over them? Let the early ship-
pers have their experiences. They cannot
all be happy ones, and the more there are
the sooner will every consumer get to
know the true conditions, and the lover
of sweet oranges will be taught to wait
for them until Nature has had time to
ripen their sugars and temper their raw
acids.
Though oranges grow in size through-
out the shipping season and very high
prices are often realized in March and
early April, the danger from cold to
the fruit of unprotected groves, the great
dropping that commences when growth
starts in the tree, the tendency to crease,
to get puffy, to dry out and lose ﬂavor
late in the season, make it questionable
whether it is best to hold even a part of
the mid-season varieties later than the

ﬁrst week in March. After this, the
later varieties may be shipped at good
prices and fair proﬁt from groves well
south in the state or farther north if the
groves are protected from injury from
cold.
Load your own fruit into cars wher-
ever possible, even though there be but
a few boxes in the shipment, and see
that the ventilators are all open.
As between express and freight, for
sound fruit I prefer the latter, believing
that the rougher handling and stealage
by express more than compensate for the
difference in time of delivery, to say no-
thing of the greater difﬁculty in collecting
just claims. '
The lesson, then, that I would teach
is carefulness that should run, like the
red strand in the cordage 0f the English
navy, through all our operations and re-
lations with our fruit. This, coupled
with honesty and loyalty to ourselves and
the handlers of our products, will allow
of our shipping our fruit to the north
in ventilated cars and there hold more
than our own against the pre-cooled and
iced fruit of our worthy rival, California;
but the lack of it during the past season
has cost us dearly in both money and the
reputation of our fruit.
I also have some rules posted in my
packing-house, and if you would care to
hear them I will read them to you. They
are for the guidance of help, and N0. I8
is for casual visitors as well.
I.
Care must be taken when picking or-
anges not to clipper-cut, bruise or thorn
them. -
2.
Every picker must put his number on
the boxes he picks.
3.
Do not let oranges remain in the hot
sun when waiting to be hauled, or for
long when on the drying rack.
4.
Every orange must be washed, and
sponges used regularly when washing,
5.
Keep plenty of water in the washer
to hold weight of fruit so as to wash
clean,
6.
All oranges must be examined for long
stems and all found must be closely clip-
ped before the fruit goes into the washer.
7.
WVhen curing, oranges should not be
over two layers deep.
8.
Keep a constant and careful lookout
for anything that will injure the fruit,
such as nails, slivers, sharp edges or long
ﬁnger nails. All persons handling fruit
for shipment should keep their ﬁnger
nails closely cut.
9.
Be careful to have cushions in place
when pouring oranges into bins or hop-
per, and see that no injury is done to any
that may be already there.
IO.
Look out for blue mold about bins or
boxes and for rotten oranges in the pack-
ing-house. These should be removed at
once.

II.
Care in picking, washing, grading,
packing and all work connected with pre-
paring fruit for market is of greater im-
portance than speed,
12.
Every doubtful orange is a cull.
I 3.
Citrus fruits should remain in this
packing-house to cure at least thirty-six
hours.
14.
Pack true to grade, size and quality,
and so that when the cover is put on the
fruit will be tight in the box.
15.
Each packer must put his initials or
number on every box he packs; also grade
and number of fruit in the box. Cus-
tomers will be requested to send us the
packer's mark on every box badly packed,
so that the packer can be held responsi-
ble.
16.
The W. S. Hart brand must be known
as an honest brand.
17.
No excuse is a good one for careless-
ness or waste of time.
18.
All persons, both casual visitors and
help, must bear in mind that this is a
place of business and not for loaﬁng, long
stories or gossip; nor must visitors divert
the attention of the help from their work
for long at any time.
No one but the undersigned has au-
thority to change these rules.

By F. G. Sampson.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
\Vhen I learned of my appointment on
your Citrus Packing and Shipping Com-
mittee, I wondered what I could say at
all worth while, but from shape of mar-
ket the past season, it does seem as if
the time were right now when we should
take counsel together for the bettering of
conditions. \Ve can start with the fact
that if we are calculating to hold any
position worth while in the markets, we
shall be obliged to adopt the most im-
proved methods all the way through from
growing to marketing our fruit. The
citrus plantings in California, Porto Rico,
Cuba, Arizona, and Mexico are enormous
and add to that the yearly planting in
Florida makes an increasing supply that
leaves no possible room for proﬁt, for
anything but the best work of which we
are capable. The production of all other
kinds of fruit is year by year being
brought to greater perfection in quality
and attractiveness, and any orange to get
preference over other kinds of fruits must
be both good to look at and to eat. Flor-
ida does produce such fruits; but those

very qualities (thin skin and full to burst-
ing with delicious juice) calls for extra
care all the way through, and in that, I
am afraid, most of us are not doing our
best at all. The past season was opened
with shipments of fruit as green as‘the
leaves on the trees; it is no trouble at all
to color an orange, but it is impossible
to make an unripe fruit ﬁt to eat, and
pretty nearly so to get a buyer for second
lot after sampling ﬁrst. Some early or-
anges are ripe enough inside before the
rind is fully colored and should be ship-
ped and so prolong the season; but until
you yourself enjoy eating them they
should be left on the trees.
Then, unless you have been in the mar-
kets and actually seen condition on arrival
of many of the shipments, you have no
idea of the amount of decay. The per-
centage of shipments arriving in bad or-
der is responsible for continual lowering
of the markets; for you can bet your last
dollar that if the buyer sees any decay
at all (and he will see it if it is there), he
will buy at a price allowing for double
what he suspects is there.
Now, it is not enough for oranges to
arrive sound; they must stay so until the
retailer can sell them and the consumer
eat them. Our fruit not standing up is
responsible for the tremendous margin
the retailer exacts.
Then, again, no orange that has been
in contact with a decaying orange has
the fresh, inviting ﬂavor that we must
furnish our customers in order to secure
consumption at good prices for the size
of crops in sight.
The wide range of prices the past sea-
son shows that the buyers are ready to
pay well for what they want. For in—
stance, auction market sales New York
February 26th Florida 1.20 to 3.25, Feb-
ruary 27th 1.25 to 5.20, and 29th Florida
1.25 to 5.65, California 1.65 to 3.10,
Porto Rico 1.10 to 1.55 for oranges and
grapefruit, these date from 1.12% to
8.62%. The growers getting 3.10 to 5.65
for oranges and 8.6212 for grapefruit
were getting rich; the others, I guess not.
Part of our marketing troubles the past
season were from causes beyond our con-
trol, national ﬁnancial troubles and
drought causing summer-bloom fruit of
different ages; but this trouble was in-
creased by many shipping all ages to-
gether, which, with decay, soon brought
our markets too low for any proﬁt.
The Agricultural Department, in bul-
letin 123, clearly shows the cause and the
Practical—not theoretical, mind you, but
entirely practical remedy for most of the
decay and we had best be getting busy
studying and following.
Putting me on this committee means,
I suppose, that I am to give my own
packing methods and so help start the
discussion. \V e use the cloth-lined, rattan
picking baskets, strap that goes over
shoulder, of wide webbing, hung low
enough so the elbow just clears the bas-
ket, which is then where the forearm
reaches the bottom of the basket; the
fruit is placed in basket, not dropped. \Ve
round off ends of bent-blade scissors
blunt, and pick all bottom fruit before
using ladders. The picking “boss” sees
that a picker slips his basket off his shoul-
der, laying a dozen or so oranges in bot-
tom of box and then tipping basket with
one hand eases fruit into box with the
other, and he puts his ticket in box as
ﬁlled. Hand holes in ﬁeld boxes are not
cut clear through and so avoid ﬁnger-nail
cuts, and boxes set down, not dropped at
all. At the packing-house the fruit goes
to grading bench, cloth-lined, and with

heavy duck apron at the ends, with one
side nailed down. The box is placed on
a shelf four inches lower than the table,
and the grading boss gathers end of
apron in each hand and holds tight over
box of fruit while he upsets the box and
then lifts box off. As the fruit spreads
out, if it shows long stems, they are cut
and word is sent to the grove to
straighten up that picker.
Have short side benches that hold boxes
for two grades bright and one russets,
and cull box under bench and try, and do
not forget to use cull box. Trucks hold-
twenty—eight boxes carry graded fruit to
different piles to cure a couple of days.
Sizer-hopper has shelf and apron. We
use sizer made by Alfred Ayer, Ocala,
that sizes, and is set so that in packing,
each tier has to have pressure to get last
row in, and so the box will stand tipping
at quite an angle before the fruit would
roll out.
we use \Varner wrapping machines that
twist paper tight and get box packed tight
all the way up, and so avoid so much
pressure on top as box is nailed up. As
boxes are nailed up they are stood on
end, two high, and have trucks with 11-
inch axle and wheels inside, so the two
boxes are put right in place in car without
further handling.
\Ve hire by the day, for I fully believe
that piece-work is responsible for very
much of the decay; at any rate it is cer-
tainly easier to get the extra care from
a hand when you are paying him for the
extra time that may be required; but
really when once the habit is formed, it
requires very little more time to handle
right, but it is certainly a day’s work to
make our hands understand we will have
careful handling.
My paper is too long already, but I
want to say that I think our marketing
methods must be improved, or our in-
creasing crops will bring us no proﬁt. The
buyer and packer who did not lose money
the past season was exceptionally f0r~
tunate, and, naturally, all will contract
very carefully this fall. I believe we must
have a central distributing headquarters
at Jacksonville, so the crop can be handled
so as not to have each packer competing
for every sale in each and every market.
To handle the present crop in sight, the
packers ought to get together for thor-
oughly systematic distribution. We ought
to have very much lower freight rates to
nearby states. We could then sell fruit
very good to eat but not quite up to stan-
dard—cheap, and still get more than with
distant freightage and so relieve the large
markets of so much off-grade fruit. It
is the accumulation of off-grade fruit that
breaks our markets. Our Southland i5
prospering and will take lots of our fruit
if we could deliver at reasonable freight
rates. Unless our shippers organize and
use quite a little judgment, we are likely
to see our markets go to smash in a hurry
this fall. The early markets paid so much
better than the later, the past season, that
the last one of us will probably think it
smart to work-all night and Sunday, too,
to swindle someone with our unripe fruit.
I believe the situation a very serious
one, needing the most intelligent handl-
ing. If we continue our present policy
of “each one for himself and the Devil
take the hindmost,” my judgment goes on
record right here, that he will get a good
big bunch of us this fall,

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 47
By 0. W. Sadler, Jamestown, Pa.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I want to call the attention of the
society to the extreme importance of a
most thorough study and discussioﬁ of
means and methods for the sale of our
products of Florida. The extremely low
prices obtained for everything this Year,
- should have touched every grower in his
tenderest point—his pocketbook—severely
enough to make him think and act.
Since the collapse of the panic
before Christmas, except a few cases
of especially fancy stock, oranges
have not netted, on the trees. over
25 to 50 cents when consigned; at
least that has been my experience with
several cars 'to various markets reported
as the best; $1.25 to $2.00 being the av-
erage limit for good oranges. The
causes preached to us were the “panic,”
and the “large crop.” By investigation
on my trip north, and since I have been
here. has given another cause,—green
fruit early in the season. The green-fruit
proposition is brought about by two main
facts or conditions. The ﬁrst is, on ac-
count of the comparatively few Florida
oranges since the big freeze, the great
mass of orange eaters have not learned
what a good ripe Florida orange is, and
do not know a Florida from appearance, or
where it comes from, so have not sufﬁcient
knowledge to judge by. \V hen there are
few, if any, other oranges, the green stuff
is offered for sale. They make a ﬁrst pur-
chase of “ﬁne sweet Florida oranges,”
and Oh! the awakening; and straightway
their opinion of Florida oranges is de-
cidedly expressed in—“VVell, if that is a
S'ZW’C! Florida orange, I never want
any more.” By the time they get
over that disappointment, they venture
to try some other kind, and they ﬁnd
a colored green California and try it. [t
is not real sweet, but as a Florida green
colored orange is always very much more
sour and rank than a California of the
same stage of development, without fur-
ther trial, remembering how awfully sour
the Florida was, he remains a California
chooser.
This experience was told me by sev-
eral people from several states and mar-
kets, and positively asserted that the sale
of green fruit had injured Florida's repu_
tation for good oranges to an enormous
extent,
As speculators were the chief cause of
the shipment of green fruit the past year,
and as the majority got left to the tune
of 50 cents to $1.00 per box, after the dis-
tribution of the ﬁrst car in a commun-
ity, they cannot work the “early sweet
Florida” game in the same places again,
at least to the consumer, it is to be hoped
the state may redeem its name in part the
next crop. Until this season I have al—
ways been able to sell my Florida oranges
in competition with Californias at an av-
erage advance of 50 cts. over Californias.
This year the reverse is the case, except
with people who know the difference. Our
greatly increased foreign population who
have not yet had the opportunity to learn
the difference, make up a majority who
buy through ignorance and looks—bright
Californias.
The dealers have proclaimed loud and
long that “the poor, the laboring class
eat the oranges, and they are out of work
and can not buy.”
Is it true they can not, and do not buy?
We are all aware the crop has been sold,
and consumed—somebody ate the or-

anges. Did the consumer get any advan-
tage of the low prices paid the grower?
A few ﬁgures from my own sales on
consignment of about 1,500 boxes, mostly
car lots, will give one example of the very
small returns to the grower. The average
sales returned was $1.78. The average
freight, cartage and commission, was 89
_cents, leaving 89 cents f. 0. b. at packing-
house. Taking from this the usual pick-
ing, packing and shipping 50 cents, leaves
39 cents on the trees. This was during
January, February and March. Those
sold f. 0. b. at home did better, bringing
$1.30 to $1.40, showing considerable ad-
vantage of f. 0. b. at home, over consign-
ment. But this year there were very few
f. o. b. buyers, and not all could be relied
on to carry out their contract.
Now, let us see if these low prices were
necessary to the retailing of the fruit with
a reasonable proﬁt.
I have inquired carefully as to many
places, from Georgia, North, East and
West, and in my own town, and ﬁnd that
retail sales were 15 cents to 20 cents for
the smaller sizes, progressively upward to
25, 35, 40, 50 and 60 cents as to size,
and one gentleman living in New York
said he paid 75 cents per dozen for 150-
size. Averaging all prices would give 37
cents per dozen. If oranges run all sizes
in equal quantity, the average dozens in
a box would be 15%, giving an average
retail sales price of $5.73 per box. If we
only include 250s, 216s, 1755, 1505 and
126s, we get an average of 18% dozens,
and averaging per-dozen prices at 15
cents, 2o, 30 cents, 35 cents, 40 cents and
50 cents, we get an average of 31 23
cents per dozen, 31 2-3x18%—$5.85 per
box, average all sizes and prices.
If we grant a loss of 16% per cent.
for decay, there is still left $4.90 as the
retail price per box. The above average
commission house return price of $1.78
leaves a net proﬁt of $3.12, while the
grower has received the generous sum of
39 cents, including his investment, and
proﬁt P—where is the proﬁt?
Suppose we add one dollar more to the
cost to the small and interior town retail-
ers, he still has $2.12, or over ﬁve times
more for selling than the grower for pro—
ducing.
Fruit-growers of Florida, are you will-
ing to continue this unequal division of
the products of your labor and expense,
without an effort to change?
Let us take another example in the veg-
etable line—cukes. The ﬁrst week in May
cukes selling in the chief markets at $1.00
to $1.25. The average express charges
in less than car lots not less than 75 cents,
commission I 1 cents, hamper, picking and
packing 30 cts.—$1.16, average consign-
ment sale $1.25; loss, 3% cts. for grower.
Consequently none but those who can ship
in car lots have any chance of coming out
even.
Investigation as to retail prices, by per-
sonal inquiry at large and small stores
and fruit stands, I am told cukes average
—small, medium and large—6 dozen per
basket; averaging the prices 30, 40 and
60 cents per dozen—43 1-3 cents or $2.60
per basket, or $1.38 net Proﬁt for selling,
against nothing or a loss for growing.
What is the use discussing how best to
grow our products if we can get nothing
for them? The few commission men I
have talked with about the matter, who
should be the grower’s agent to see that
he got his share of what the consumer
pays, say they do not see how they can
change conditions. Although they have
a society, they make no concerted effort
to get our equalshare, but, on the other

hand, compete with each other in selling
OUR products, thus favoring the retailer,
practically giving us over into his power,
as the foregoing ﬁgures demonstrate.
Is there no way to remedy this con—
dition? This is the great problem for our
society to solve. Can we do it? Can the
growers come directly to the consumer
and cut out the middlemen who now are
only agents for_our undoing?
The consumer pays enough for our pro-
ducts, but we get very little of it.
The result of my study of the question
is, ORGANIZATION OF oaowans SELLING
DIRECT TO CONSUMER.
That there will be many difﬁculties in
its accomplishment, goes without saying.
But that there are business men in our
society to devise a plan and work out the
details, I am certain; and when done,
taking present conditions as a basis, I am
sure there will be much more proﬁt in the
selling than in the raising.
As I cannot be present at the meeting
to discuss the matter with you, I will give
you a few of my thoughts as to a plan.
Let every district or section organize
and establish a common packing-house at
the most convenient shipping point, so as
to ship in car lots. A packing-house im-
plies a competent picking and packing
crew.
Elect a competent man as grader and
inspector of the fruit, either on the trees
or as delivered at the packing-house, and
each grower be given a credit certiﬁcate
for the number of boxes of different
grades, or a more exact way, the number
of pounds, and then let his fruit lose its
identity as his special lot.
A manager for each packing house or
board of managers representing several
or all, are then ready to sell f. o, b. at
packing house. Or, having organized and
opened a sales house or houses in places
capable of taking—consuming a car load
a week and upward, keep these sales
houses supplied through telegraphic com-
munication with a general head as they
need. The details of retail distributing
houses can certainly be worked out by
successful business men. Each grower,
each manager of packing-house, and of
sales store, should be a stock owner, or
interested ﬁnancially, and partake of the
proﬁts. The organization could by vote
ﬁx starting price for fruit on the trees,
or the proportionate percentage of the net
proceeds at stated times.
As it is now, the grower must pay the
cost of shipment before they leave, and
gets no money until the consignee gets
ready to remit—from ten days to three
months, and by drawing no money from
the organization for the same average
time the capital need not be large.
I have not the time nor the capacity
to go into all the details, but hope I have
suggested enough to introduce the sub-
ject, and certain that together, a success-
ful way of beneﬁting ourselves and the
consumer can be devised.

By W. E. Bryan.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Starting at the beginning of the sea-
son the ﬁrst problem is the packing of
fruit that is not thoroughly mature; this
fruit requires to be kept in the packing-
house several days until the water in the
rind has sweated out. If this is not done
before the fruit is packed it will sweat
in the box and undoubtedly cause decay,
which will not develop until after it has
left the packing house, and the grower
will often be astounded when he gets a
letter from his commission merchant in-
forming him Ithait his fruit, 'which he
knows left his packing-house in good or-
der and condition, has arrived in bad or-
der, and has had to be sold at a sacriﬁce.
The grower often thinks the commis-
sion merchant is deceiving him and try-
ing to cheat him when the true reason
is found in the fact that the fruit having
sweated in the box, has caused the wrap-
ping paper to become thoroughly wet and
the whole contents of the box are in a
very moist state, which is a condition
highly conducive to very rapid decay.
Let us beware, then, of shipping or-
anges with moisture in the rind,
SIZING AND GRADING ORANGES,
When packing fruit it is well to re-
member that most of our fruit is packed
to be sold to some stranger, who in turn
will probably sell to somebody else; there-
fore it is necessary that he should have
some idea of how many oranges he is
getting in each box and of what quality
they are. The number and grade, then,
should be put on each box plainly and
the contents should be strictly accord-
ing to stenciling both in number and in
grade. Any irregularity in this respect
will make the buyer suspicious of the
fruit not being equal to the markings
and in future ‘buying he will feel unwill-
ing to pay full market prices, and hold a
general distrust of orange packers. It
is necessary, if each person concerned in
marketing oranges is to get their full
quota of proﬁt, that each and every one
does his share of the \work and that all
should be in sympathy. When all can
be trusted there is an economy in the
marketing that should be an extra proﬁt
to all concerned. I have known of well-
known brands of fruit fetching higher
prices because it was known to be exactly
as represented by the markings on the
box. Such fruit often passes through the
hands of the middlemen without the de-
lay and cost of inspection.
Let us, then. be careful to mark and
grade our fruit correctly.
PROPER PACKING.
One of the worst features of poor or-
ange packing is the putting of too much
fruit in the box; in some instances so
much is put in as to cause the top and
sides to bulge out. This is done to such
an extent that the top of the box cannot
be nailed in the middle; the fruit in such
a packed box is nearly sure to be very
much bruised by pressure from other
packages in transit and from handling.
If dealers ﬁnd much damaged fruit
in their purchases, they have to sell the
good fruit at (very advanced prices to
make their purchase proﬁtable, and thus
materially restrict the consumption of or-
anges, which restriction results in glut-
ted markets and poor returns to the
grower, whilst the consumer is complain-
ing of the high price of retail oranges.


## p. 51 (#593) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 51
These results are brought about by loss
of damaged fruit caused by putting too
many oranges, or too large oranges, in
too small a space and than subjecting
the box to outside pressure from other
freight, both in the railway car and on
the transfer trucks.
SIZE OF ORANGE BOX.
What size should an orange box be?
The size should be regulated by economy
for the grower and availability to the
consumer. The packing will be most eco-
nomically done by having a box large
enough and not too large for one man
to handle and lift without other aid than
his own physical strength, and large
enough to keep a man of ordinary
strength in good exercise, thus handling
a good many oranges at one time and at
the same time keeping up a high degree of
manhood amongst the orange fraternity.
' The size of the box from the seller’s
point of view should be that which is most
available to dispose of in the market.
The present size of the box, viz.: 12x12x
24 inches, would seem to be large enough
and not too large for one man to handle;
and if the commission merchants do not
' complain of the size as being awkward to
dispose of, I do not think we should
change. We should pay no attention
whatever to any size of box that some
other orange section may produce, know-
ing fully well that the orange buyers will
pay just so much, that the fruit will bring
them a proﬁt and that their price will be
regulated by their ability to make their
proﬁt out of the contents of the box.
The unit of economy in the size of the
box is that it should be large enough to
tax the strength of an ordinary man, and
not larger, and if the present size of the
box fulﬁls this condition, any other size
would make the cost of handling greater,
which extra cost would have to to be paid
by the grower when the fruit was in
abundance and low in price, and by the
consumer when the fruit is scarce and
high and always means money paid to the
middleman either by the producer or con-
sumer.
Some sections may ﬁnd it advisable to
have a very small box, as possibly not
much of their fruit is wanted; but if
Florida fruit is classed as being equal to
the best, let us send it out in abundance,
and 'not try to restrict our output by
contracting the size of our box.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Hart—Now, there is a great
deal of difference in white papers.
Some white papers will give you the
proper color. The mandarine orange
is of much better quality than the tan-
gerine, but the latter brings nearly
double the price of the other. The
Japanese paper does not give that
pretty tint and it is so transparent that
it shows up the blemishes badly. but
it is tough and does not break or tear
easily. I also think the print is of much
importance. Your private b r a n (I
should not be too large. I have seen
some so large that on a 200 orange you
could only see some confused printing.
in the middle. A good print can be
made small. yet plenty large and plain
enough to show the whole of it on a
200 orange.
Before the fruit goes into the washer
the thumb, ﬁnger or the eye comes in
contact with every calyx, and if any
stem is left on them they are carefully
clipped off. It would be almost im-

possible for a long stem to get by my
men as far as the washer.
Mr. Skinner—I have heard it said
that Mr. Sampson puts up the best
pack in the state, not excepting any.
I think it will do us a great deal of
good to listen to these men and learn
what they have learned by experience.
The great trouble with me is labor.
We have to import from 100 to 200
hands every year and we have to get
green hands and when you have to deal
with these fellows and get them to pare
their ﬁnger nails, etc., we are up
against it. I have one thing in my
packing house that is of great help to
me, and that is truck boards. When
the boxes are nailed up they are set
on this truck board and we have a
special truck that is slipped under it,
and the boxes are moved right into the
car and are not touched at all. The
truck board protects the fruit entirely.
I was struck by a little article I saw
in the paper not long ago. The writer
said he set his fruit over some steam
pipes so that it could not get cold and
attract outside moisture. He also said
he washed his fruit with a little sali-
cylic acid, and he said the wounds that
it had received dried over. I have been
thinking of that. I use a washer with
a great deal of satisfaction except
when the burlap breaks loose, then I
have a good deal of trouble in getting
it ﬁxed. I think my washer is the best
washer there is, but it is necessary to
have good burlap.
Mr. Hart—I would like to ask Mr.
Skinner what becomes of the boards
he speaks of?
Mr. Skinner—The fellows that are
trucking run the truck to the end of
the car where the man is loading, and
he lifts the boxes off and sets them in
place. The truck boards are thrown
to the side of the car and a man sets
his truck under them when a pile ac-
cumulates and carries them back into
the packing house.
Mr. Hart—I saw them in California
used for plums and I thought they
would be ﬁne for oranges. The point
I mean to bring out is that you would
have to handle your oranges once more
than you would without them.
Mr. Skinner—\Ve use them when
the fruit is brought into the packing
house, in fact, we use them every-
where. You see, our station and pack-
ing house are together.
Mr. Hart—Most of the trucks that
are used are so made that the arms are
so high that it comes right in the mid-
dle of the section where it can do the
most harm. I think them very bad.
indeed, to handle fruit. I once put an
iron bar across them to prevent .that,
but if these boards can be used. I think
it wise to do so. Do you use one board
to three boxes?
Mr. Skinner—Yes. You see. you
have to have two cleats underneath
the boards. These cleats ﬁt right over
the prongs on the truck. and you can
lift them up and carry them without
the least difﬁculty or danger.
I might speak of another thing.
Perhaps you are familiar with the Cali-
fornia load. In refrigerator cars espe-
cially it is a ﬁne thing. You put six
boxes across the car, standing them up
on end, and there is a space of about
four inches between each box in an
ordinary car and six inches in a vent.
Then two strips are nailed across.
leaving a vent clear through. each box
by itself. There is a straight line of

boxes from one end of the car to the
other. The cost of the stripping
never exceeds $I.25. To show you
how well it holds, I had a car handled
by the Atlantic Coast Line in its
usual careful way. They were going
about forty miles an hour when a
wreck occurred.~ That car turned over
on its side and rolled down a hill. How-
ever, each layer of boxes settled down
against the next one, and only about
six boxes in the car were broken.
I think Dr. Inman might be able to
tell us a good deal along this line, if he
will.
Mr. Inman—Mr. President, Ladies
and Gentlemen: Had I known that I
would be called upon, I might have
formulated some ideas which would be
of interest to my fellow fruit growers.
I am not a good talker, and if I had
any ideas, I fear that I cannot present
them in a very interesting way. But
I can probably tell the story as it ap-
pears to me.
First, let us cast about and take an
inventory of what we are doing in the
way of growing and harvesting citrus
fruits in Florida. Are we producing
as much or of as good quality of fruit
as we should do? And after it is
grown, are our methods of harvesting
in keeping with the spirit and pro-
gress of the times? I am free to say
that we are growing but little over
one-half of the fruit that the groves of
the state are capable of producing un-
der a more through system of care and
cultivation. But. upon this subject I
do not propose to dwell. as it, within
itself, would require a volume. How-
ever, I will say right here that I have
visited a good part of the world where
citrus fruits are grown, and have come
to the conclusion that, so far as I have
seen or acquired knowledge of, there
is no country or region which affords
the advantages for the growing of or-
anges, tangerines and grapefruit that
we possess right here in Florida; no
place where fruit grows to such perfec-
tion or the groves produce so abun-
dantly, and no place where an enter-
prising man can engage in the busi-'
ness with the same certainty of being
well compensated for his labors.
Harvesting—This is one of the all-
absorbing subjects of the day, and the
one demanding the most thorough in-
vestigation and thought, followed by
energetic action upon the part of every
one engaged in the fruit-growing in-
dustry. Our careless and rough hand-
ling is costing the state thousands, yes,
hundreds of thousands, of dollars every
year. I make the assertion that fully
ninety per cent. of the Florida fruit
which arrives in market in bad order
is attributable to careless clipping and
careless handling. All of us ﬂatter
ourselves that we are taking extra
pains and doing better than'our neigh-
bors, and that if our fruit does not reach
its destination sound, the fault lies with
the transportation companies and not
with us; when, if the truth were
known, fully one-fourth of the oranges
were either punctured by the clippers,
scratched by the ﬁnger nails or bruised
by dropping, jamming against the lad-
ders. pouring into the ﬁeld boxes,
rought treatment by teamsters, empty-
ing and piling up in the hoppers, or
falling from the sizers into packing
bins. All of these matters seem to be
of small moment until they are care-
fully looked into. When that is done,
the result is simply astounding. We

must awaken to the importance of
these little details, and bear in mind
that fruit should be handled with the
same care that we would give eggs,
and will actually stand no more rough-
ness without great damage. Stop and
consider. Is there one of the abuses
mentioned that we cannot correct and
entirely eradicate?
I am not making these statements
at random, nor without abundant evi-
dence to substantiate every word or
assertion. They have all been con-
ﬁrmed by actual tests, made by gov‘
ernment experts, both in this state and
California, during the past season. Re-
member that the slightest scratch upon
the rind of the fruit is just as surely
fatal as a deep puncture or severe
bruise, provided the fruit is exposed to
the rot spores, which are never want—
ing in every one of our packing houses.
Every small inch of atmosphere con-
tains thousands of them.
Marketing—Here comes the business
part of all of our undertaking. the,one
that must be revolutionized very soon. or
the business of the growing of citrus
fruits in our fair state will soon fall into a
more chaotic and helpless state than
it is at the present time. Who is to
,blame? No one but our dear selves.
and no one but the growers can ever
correct the existing evils. We can and
must do it.
Let us take the state of Florida as a
whole, and make it a business proposi—
tion. applying to each one of us singly;
for what concerns any one of us, ap-
plies to every one in Florida engaged
in the growing of fruit.
Let us see if we are acting as busi-
ness men should—are adopting good
business methods. What are we
doing, and what are our methods, and
what must we do? If you will bear
with me, I will enumerate some of our
follies. To begin with, we are sup-
porting about one thousand solicitors
and drummers, representing commis-
sion houses from almost every city in
the North, South, East and \Vest. Add
to these one thousand men about
ﬁve hundred livery rigs and drivers.
These are all high-priced men, and ex—
pensive livers. This army of itself
costs us hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars annually. But this is but the be-
ginning of our extravagant manage-
ment, for we are supporting, in a good
part, an equal number of commission
houses in nearly every city in the
Union. I do not wish to be under-
stood as casting any reﬂection upon
these men, nor upon the fruit houses;
for I acknowledge that the great ma-
jority of these men. also the houses
which they represent, are doing a legi-
timate business. and at the same time
doing the very best they can for our
interests. But, is our way or system
of marketing correct and in keeping
with good business principles? I would
answer, most emphatically, No! No!
You will ask, “Is there any remedy
within our reach. any system of econ-
omical marketing upon which we can
all unite. one ‘WllllCl‘l shall be just to all.

kinds of citrus fruits. will fare as well
and receive the same price (quality the
same). as the most shrewd and com-
petent business man ?” To this I an-
swer. with the same emphasis and con~
ﬁdence, Yes!
You inquire by what authority and

ways I have arrived at these positive
conclusions, and how I am able to talk
as though these were established facts.
To answer and prove that I am not
dreaming or theorizing, I will tell the
whole story as I know it.
I have been in Florida twenty-two
years, and during all of that time have
been engaged in the growing of fruit,
and that, too, with very good success
and results, which I do not complain
of. But, for the past two or three sea-
sons, I have been convinced that our
methods were not the best, and that
the orange growers of California were
outdoing us, both as to harvesting and
marketing of their crops.
On April fourth I decide to go to
the Paciﬁc coast and investigate, not
alone for myself, but with the hope of
beneﬁting my neighbors as well. By
appointment with Prof. Tenny, a gov-
ernment employe, I was met at River-
side by Professor Powell, who has
been engaged, through the Horticul-
tural Department at Washington, for
the past ﬁve years in making a thor-
ough study of conditions existing
there, and teaching, by a vast number
of experiments, the growers how to
correct the evils and errors, which he
discovered existing there, which were
many, yes, even more and worse than
are besetting us at the present time.
The growing and marketing of their
oranges was affording almost no proﬁt
and, in many cases, an actual loss
to the producer. Their methods of
harvesting were very crude, and when
it came to selling their fruit and get-
ting it to market, the results were such
that a great many of the orange groves
were abandoned, or cut down and the
land planted to other crops. It seemed
impossible for them to get their or-
anges to the Eastern markets without
their arriving rotten. How to remedy
matters was the task undertaken by
Professor Powell, and that, too, almost
single-handed, for he was supported
with an appropriation of only $3,500
annually, out of which he had to meet
all of his personal expenses, as well as
to pay his assistants (when he had
any). This season the appropriation
is $6,700.00 and he has seven men to\
aid him. It seemed a Herculean task,
and one almost without hope. But,
what has been the result, what has this
one man achieved? How plainly has
he demonstrated that men. not money,
are the powers which are moving the
world at the present time.
In the ﬁrst place, he demonstrated
that the harvesters, and not the trans-
portation companies, were at fault for
the rotting of the fruit. He showed
the growers, by actual experiments,
that in some cases over ﬁfty per cent.
of their fruit was hopelessly damaged
before it was delivered to the railroad
company. This was his ﬁrst key to
the solution of the problem, and. with
all of his experiments before the grow-
ers, the remedies were easily found,
and all enterprising growers set about
jointly to correct and remedy every
bad feature in the harvesting, until to-
day oranges in California are handled
with the same care as eggs. And
claims upon the transportation have
been reduced about seventy-ﬁve per
cent.
Next, as to the methods of market-
ing, and the organization known as the
California Fruit Exchange, which is
today, I believe, the most thorough
business organization in the United

56 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
States, not excepting the Standard Oil
Company or the United States Steel
Company; and, more, it is one without
graft or fraud, and to which I can see
no probability of fraud creeping in.
The California Fruit Exchange has
only about or less than $20,000; If I
remember correctly, it is $I5,000 capi-
tal, upon which it never pays a divi-
dend. I will try to tell you something
of the Fruit Exchange. This organ-
ization consists of numerous packing
houses, or associations. These asso-
ciations are usually made up of neigh-
bors, for whom it is convenient to do
their packing at one packing house,
and of these associations there are a
great many, and each one of these as-
sociations is entitled to one share of
stock (no more) in the Fruit Ex-
change. This share of stock entitles
the association to one representative
to or in the Fruit Exchange. The
Exchange is made up and controlled
entirely by these representatives from
associations (who do not draw pay).
These representatives elect the board
of directors; the board of directors
elect the ofﬁcers, and the oﬁicers elect
the President and employ the execu-
tive force. The Fruit Exchange is al—
most a complete duplicate of our Fed-
eral Government.
All business is transacted at head-
quarters at Los Angeles. and it is sur-
prising how much can be done by a
few men when well systematized. For
instance, and to illustrate some of their
methods and their success, only ﬁve
years ago the Fruit Exchange was or-
ganized, with only a few associations.
It then only controlled a small per-
centage of the fruit. But, by thorough
business methods and advantages
which co-operation afforded. It has
grown very rapidly, until this season
The Exchange will handle fully sev-
enty-ﬁve per cent. of all the citrus fruit
grown in California, amounting to
over thirty thousand (30,000) car-
loads. And all of the sales are man-
aged 'by two (head sales-men, with only
six traveling salesmen to help them.
How does this compare with our force
employed for the selling of our small
crop? It is not ﬁve per cent. of our
expense. In fact, the whole expense
of managing associations, Fruit Ex-
change. collections, buying and all,
does not amount to ﬁve per cent.
Losses, defalcations and non-payment
of accounts, as shown by the books
of the Exchange, which are open to
all, amount to less than three hundred
($300) dollars, and this, too, upon
sales amounting to over thirty millions
of dollars ($30,000,ooo.oo). Payments
for fruit to the growers are made in
cash every thirty days, no losses, no
‘Zt'OffiL’S. You might inquire if there
are any other beneﬁts or advantages
to be derived from such an organiza-
tion as the California Fruit Exchange.
Yes, very many. For instance, before
this organization was effected, the
growers were paying nineteen (19)
cents each for orange boxes. Today
they cost them 12 to 12% cents.
Paper, machinery, the price of help,
and the supply are managed by the
Exchange. Freight rates are all man-
aged by the oPﬁces of the Exchange,
and the rates which they pay on fruit,
considering the broad distribution
which they enjoy, is very much less
than we pay from Florida, notwith-
standing that we are two thousand
miles nearer to the markets.

A very small proportion of the Cali-
fornia fruit is re-shipped from point to
point, as the Florida fruit is. The Cali-
fornia rates are all made to Denver,
Colorado, and beyond. It costs no
more for them to place a car in Boston
than in Denver, freight the same to
all points east of that city.
Shall I tell you how the labor is
done by the Californians? This might
be of interest and may be a help to
you in getting down to a proper way
of doing the work, with the object in
view of correcting the present errors
and abuses.
To begin with, all labor is employed
by the day. except the wrapping of
the fruit. This work is nearly all done
by women, and the price per box is
two and one-half (2%) to three cents.
In all packing houses which I visited
they were paying two and one-half
centsper box. The picking is done
by man. not exﬂert pickers such as we
employ, but Mexicans, Chinese, Japs,
Indians or white men, under the eyes
of a Superintendent, whom they must
obey to the letter and in the proper
spirit. This ﬁeld superintendent is sup-
plied by the association for which the
work is being done, and all gathering
must be done under the supervision
of their ofﬁcers, and not according to
the taste or ways of the growers, for
here is the beginning of the careful
work, and of very vital importance,
for an error here is past remedying.
\Ve cannot patch up a damaged or-
ange.
Hauling—This is all done upon
spring wagons, and the ﬁeld boxes are
carefully set upon the wagon and when
taken off are carefully set down, not
shoved or thrown. They never use a
ﬁeld box larger than a common orange
box, and they ﬁll these boxes about
two-thirds full and carry about sev—
enty-ﬁve to ninety boxes upon each
wagon.
I am asked how it would be possible
for us to form such an organization
in Florida, where our matters are in
such a state of confusion. You say
that it would not be possible to get a
sufﬁcient number of growers to unite
to control a majority of the fruit; too
many ﬁrms and individuals with pri-
vate interests would oppose and work
against us. Yes, they would do their
best; but we would not need any cer-
tain percentage of the fruit. The prin-
cipal object should be to do the work
in such a manner and at such a saving,
and show such results, that the ques-
tion would be not as to who wished
to join the associations, but as to who
the associations would take in; for all
who become members of the Exchange
have to submit to the positive rules
of the same. Remember, and do not
confound the terms Exchange with
that of associations. The latter is
made up of an association of neigh-
bors for the better gathering and
packing of their crops. The Exchange
is composed of representatives, one
from each Association. Every grower
is in reality a member of the Ex-
change. How could we proceed to or-
ganize an Exchange? What steps
should we take? To this I will say
that nearly all present are orange
growers, and among us we have a
large number of enterprising, _loyal
men who could be appointed by this
Society for the purpose of forming an
organization. They would proceed as
follows: Say three be chosen to go

to California and fully familiarize
themselves with the workings of their
Exchanges and Associations. The
Californians send you through me an
invitation to come there, and they will
warmly welcome and aid you. Get a
copy of their Articles of Incorporation.
The California Fruit Exchange is an
open book, and they are with us and
are very anxious that we organize,
which would mean much to them, and
do away with our glutting and ruin-
ing every market within our reach.
You never hear of a glut of California
oranges. They were willing to give
me a copy of their Articles of Incor-
poration, which I have, also by-laws
governing several of their associations.
This Committee would return and re-
port to their fellow members. The
next step would be to secure a lec-
turer and organizer—a teacher; the
same one who did the work (or nearly
all of it) for the Californians. (I was
told by their President he thought he
could be had.) Set him at work and
as soon as half a dozen neighborhood
organizations were effected, proceed
to incorporate the Florida Fruit Ex-
change. And, by the way, we have
now in this state quite a number of
these local organizations, which are
ready and waiting to organize an Ex-
change. This work would go on very
rapidly and with a positiveness of suc-
cess, as we would have all of the ex—
perience of our California neighbors,
the full beneﬁts of their system, from
beginning to end, which has cost them
thousands of dollars and ﬁve years of
hard work.
After a great deal of study, I am
in favor of an organization in Florida,
with the California organization as
our pattern. \Ve must do this if we
wish to remain in the fruit-growing
business for proﬁt; if we wish to avoid
the greater calamity which confronts
us. Conditions are becoming worse
every season, and the coming season
will experience worse gluts and rot-
outs in the markets than ever before.
Not that there is too much fruit; no.
\Ve cannot grow too much fruit. That
is not the trouble, and is not a fault
to be remedied. The faults are these:
Too great an expense is allowed to ac-
cumulate upon our fruit between the
tree and the consumer. This is an
old song, but we are going to remedy
it. I speak again with positiveness,
for where our pocketbooks are
touched, the same thrust pierces our
hearts also.
\Ve are going to organize and that.
too, soon. The time is at hand, and
within ﬁve years seventy-ﬁve per cent.
of our crop will be handled in a busi-
ness way, and the same per cent. of
our expenses will be cut off.
It may seem like a big undertaking
to get us in line, but it would not
be. But it must be done by men with
an honest and pure motive, with no
graft to be anticipated, for none can
exist. If I were a young and strong
man, I would be only too glad to do
this work for the good of our state.
and could do it with but very little
money to start with.
Dr. Richardson—I have been very
much interested in these papers and
the discussions. \Vhile they have all
been instructive and beneﬁcial, it does
not seem to me that any suggestion
has reached the bottom of the situa—
tion. What the Harts and Sampsons

can do as individuals, does not beneﬁt
the average grower. These gentle-
men haVe found out how to raise or-
anges and how to contend with the
natural and unnatural enemies of the
industry and meet them successfully.
They represent themselves and per-
haps ﬁve per cent. of the orange grow~
ers outside of themselves in the state
of Florida. Let me tell you how the
situation is in my own neighborhood,
and I think it is a typical neighbor-
hood. Seventy—ﬁve per cent. of the
fruit grown in that neighborhood is
neither picked nor packed nor mar-
keted by the grower. The buyer
comes in and he hires men to pick it
and pack it and ship it. The men that
we have to hire to do this work for
us are a set of irresponsible men, and
if they got their just deserts they would
all be hung. I can’t stay to see my
oranges packed. I have got reasona-
bly fair prices for my oranges and the
men who have bought them have suf-
fered perhaps more than I have. \Vhy
do we sell our fruit this way, though?
\Vhy are we compelled to sell it to
people who have no interest in his
reputation as an honest grower, whose
only idea is to sell the fruit at the best
possible price? It is simply because
of the lack of co-operation; simply
from lack of willingness to exercise
conﬁdence in our neighbor and fellow
man. \Vhen I talk to my neighbor
about co-operation for our mutual
good, he simply draws into his shell
and says, “My business is my own, and
your business is your own, and if you
will leave mine alone, I won’t bother
yours.” Now, we know what is
the proper thing to do, but how are
we going to get seventy-ﬁve per cent.
of the growers to know what we know
and what should be done for their
own good? It is bound to come after
a while, as Dr. Inman says. It may
not come in his time or in my time.
as he has so unkindly intimated that
he and his contemporaries are past the
ﬁrst ﬂush of youth; but it is to the
gentlemen who are on the platform—
Prof. Rolfs, Dr. Sledd, and the others
—to whom we must look. It has to
be done through education. It must
be taught to the coming generation:
not only horticultural-and agricultural
methods that will be successful. but
they must be taught that intelligent
co-operation is the only way to make
a success of the orange or any other
business. We expect you to teach the
coming generation how to do this. but
we know you can’t do it alone. \Ve
cannot get all the orange growers to
come into this association, and how
can we teach them to pack and ship
oranges to get the best results?
Through education. That is the key-
note, and until we educate them up to
seeing their own interest and realizing
the fact that “united we stand, and
divided we fall," we never can expect
anything in the way of results. \Vhat
does the man coming here from
Cleveland or Baltimore or New York
care about our success or our reputa-
tion? He wants to get the most he
can out of the crop. \Ve have to pay
his expenses and. in fact, everything
comes back on the grower. The only
way to restore Florida’s reputation as
the best orange-growing country in
the world, is to co-operate with that
end in view. Send out men to organ-
ize local organizations, and let the
members of these local organizations

obligate themselves to practice meth-
ods that will protect us all. Let us
bind ourselves together in organiza-
tions that will hold, and then we will
succeed.
Dr. Inman—I also want to tell you
that under the California organization
the man who produces ten boxes and
'the man who produces a hundred
boxes stand on a parity with the
largest growers in the association.
This organization is not incorporated
for the purpose of making money for
itself. It nevertpays dividends. The
men who operate the California Fruit
Exchange are salaried men. They are
employed by the association. I would
not advise our people to organize an
association here in Florida except on
this strictly and purely democratic
basis.
As Dr. Richardson has said, we are
supporting too many men at too great
an extravagance.
Mr. Reaves—I just wanted to ask
Mr. Inman to explain a little further.
We had experience down at Sarasota,
some years ago. We had an Orange
Growers’ Union in this state then and
local unions were organized, one at
Sarasota and one at Oneco. I was
president of the one at Sarasota and
felt so much interest I also attended
the meetings at Oneco. The union
saw the necessity of properly distrib—
uting the fruit and for that reason
they had adopted the fruit exchange
as a medium through which to ship.
In order to get the fruit properly dis-
tributed we tried hard to get all the
growers to ship through the exchange;
we knew that fruit shipped to com-
mission men was not properly distrib-
uted. One prominent shipper at
Oneco said that he had a good-com-
mission man and he was going to ship
to him. Another shipper by the name
of Marshall hesitated, but ﬁnally
joined and shipped through the ex-
change. \Vhen the returns came, the
man who had shipped to his commis-
sion man said, “Well, Marshall, how
are your returns? Ha, ha; mine are
way ahead of yours.” Marshall looked
at them and said, “Doggone the Fruit
Exchange, the Orange Growers’
Union and the whole business; I am
going to ship to commission men af-
ter this.” Commission men are sharp
enough, and if they see that things are
going against them, they are willing
to make a little concession. His com-
mission man saw the point and he used
his opportunity to do us up there. Of
course, a lot of the men who were ship-
ping through the Exchange could not
see through the little scheme and said
to themselves, “Well, if the commis-
sion men give so much better returns.
we will ship to them_after this and let
the Exchange go.” That one man
broke up the whole thing: everybody
went back to patronizing the commis-
sion business.
The time has been when commis-
sion men were necessary, but I believe
that time is past. We have rapid com-
munication to all points to which we
ship, which makes it possible for us
to sell if the commission business were
out of the way, and I believe if this
Horticultural Society would co—op-
crate with the Association in Califor-
nia, we could get a United States law
against the commission business. As
it is, hundreds of growers may ship
to some one point, the market may
become glutted and prices correspond-

ingly low. In many cases, we all
know it would be cheaper to let the
crop stay in the ﬁeld to make fertil-
izer than to ship it.
Dr. Inman—If you people would
only be in earnest about forming this
organization, we would not have as
much to contend with as the Cali-
fornians did. Prof. Powell, in two
months, would organize the state of
Florida into as solid an organization
as that of California, if you would only
co-operate with him. There is no
question about the commission men buck-
ing hard and trying all their methods and
schemes, but they will be very easily
overcome if you listen to the advice
of men of ability and experience like
those in California. They have driven
the commission men out of busi-
ness out there. There would be no
trouble to get these men of ability;
the trouble is to determine deﬁnitely
and positively what we want. I don’t
want you or ask you to take my in-
vestigation of the matter. Send some
men out there to see for themselves
and make you a report. The fruit ex—
change is composed of such men as
Dr. Richardson, Mr. Boardman, Mr.
Skinner, Mr. Hart and all you other
gentlemen whose names I do not
know.
Mr. Sampson—Don’t you think we
needit particularly this year? What
price do you expect the buyers are go-
ing to offer for fruit if there is not
some better methods of packing? I
think one great need is to standardize
the packing.
Dr. Inman—So do I. I don’t think
it would take very long to organize if
we can strike while the iron is hot.

year that we are going to have a good
fruit market and that we are going to
get our money for the crop with the
least possible expense.

AFTERNOON SESSION.
Professor Rolfs—“le had this morn-
ing a little talk about packing and
shipping oranges, and Dr. Inman and
some others cited the methods that
were employed in California in pre-
paring the fruit for market and ship—
ping the oranges. It was suggested
that you, Mr. Tenny, be requested to
give us a little talk about the organ-
ization out there.
Mr. Tenny—I will not talk long
now, since the society asked me to
give a paper this evening on a some-
what similar subject and as this will
require nearly an hour I do not wish
to weary you this afternoon. The
Doctor has possibly given you an im-
pression that the organization that has
been known up to a couple of years
ago as the So. California Fruit Grow-
ers’ Exchange, now known as the
California Fruit Growers’ Exchange
is a pretty large affair. This year they
are shipping approximately sixty per
cent. of all the oranges and lemons
from Southern California. This great
organization did not come into being
It has been a
growth. Its beginnings were back
about 1895. The organization grew
out ‘of the fact that it was realized
that the citrus growers were not in-
dependent of each other, but depend-
ent. especially as to marketing of their
fruit, with regard both to a systematic
distribution of the fruit over the ship-

ping season and to the geographical
distribution. The Exchange has grown
steadily from 1895 when it handled
about one—third of the crop until the
present time when its shipments
amount to something like sixty per
cent. No better account of the work-
ings of the exchange can be given than
is found in Bulletin 123, recently pub-
lished by the Bureau of Plant Indus-
try, Department of Agriculture. which
says, “Among the co-operative organ-
izations, the California Fruit Grow-
ers’ Exchange packs and sells through
its own district agents in the markets
somewhat more than ﬁfty per cent. of
the entire citrus crop. This organiza-
tion is formed to regulate the distrib-
ution of citrus fruits throughout the
country and to give to its members
the beneﬁts that arise from its co—
operative efforts of various kinds.
This Exchange represents about 4,000
growers, who are organized into more
than eighty local incorporated associa-
tions, the primary function of which
is to prepare the fruit for market. The
associations in the different producing
regions combine into one or more
local incorporated district exchanges
or selling agencies. which sell the fruit
through the district agents or at pub-
lic auction and receive the money
therefor through the medium of the
California Fruit Growers’ Exchange.
There are thirteen of these district ex-
changes. Each local district exchange
selects a representative to act for it on
the board of directors of the California
Fruit Growers’ Exchange, which is an
incorporated body acting as an agency
or clearing house for the district ex-
changes in the marketing of their
fruit and which operates for the grow-
ers without proﬁt to itself. It takes
the fruit of the district exchanges after
it is packed, and with their co—opera-
tion and advice places it in the differ-
ent markets of the country, sells it.
collects the proceeds, and turns them
over to the district exchanges, which
in turn pay the growers through the
local associations. The California
Fruit Growers’ Exchange is the
agency through which the grower is
able to control the larger business
problems and the general policy of the
handling and marketing of the citrus-
fruit crop.”
This description gives you a good
idea of the management of the gen-
eral exchange; but you may be inter-
ested in a more detailed account of the
relations of an individual grower to the
Exchange and the way his fruit is
handled. A group of men, possibly
one hundred or it may be a much
larger number. living in a certain 10-
cality form an association. They build
a packing house and elect a general
manager, who has the running of the
house. The shipping season is divided
into periods varying in length from
two to six weeks, and these periods
are known as pools. As the fruit of
the individual grower comes into the
house it is usually weighed; at the
time of packing, this fruit is put into
the several grades and each grade is
weighed automatically. A record is
kept of the individual loads, and this
gives the weight of fruit of each grade.
At the end of the pool the total
amount of each grade of fruit shipped
from the house is determined and also
the selling price of this fruit. In this
way, the manager is able to determine
what each pound of fruit of each grade

for that pool is worth. He is then
able to ﬁgure the amount due to each
grower
pool. By this method of shipping fruit
under brands selected for each grade,
the individual grower loses his iden—
tity as far as the market is concerned,
when the fruit is graded.
Mr. What has been the result?
Mr. Tenny—It has been satisfac-
tory. The fact that the Exchange has
grown from handling a small portion
of the crop to sixty per cent. shows
that it has been successful.
Mr. \Nhat per cent. of Californa
is Southern California in the shipping
of fruit?
Mr. Tenny—This year the state of
California is shipping somewhere in
the neighborhood of 30,000 cars of or-
anges and lemons. About 2,000 of
these come from north of the Teha-
chapi Range of the Sierra Madre
Mountains. The largest plantings are
in Tulare County, and these plantings
are sufficient so that under favorable
conditions 10,000 cars may be ex-
pected. Some co-operative houses are
in operation in this section.
Mr. Skinner—Is the exchange still



growing?
Mr. Tenny—Yes.
Mr. \Vhat is done with the
other fruit not included in the sixty
per cent?
Mr. Tenny—There are several large
co-operative houses that are not con-
nected with the California Fruit Grow-
ers’ Exchange. Then there are cer-
tain individuals who ship direct to
eastern markets. There is also con-
siderable buying by eastern men who
have their fruit packed in private
houses.
contributing fruit for that-
Mr. About how much does the
cost of maintaining this organization
tax the grower? How much per box?
Mr. Tenny—I can’t give you that
ﬁgure, but the tax per box is not large.
Dr. Inman—It is about ﬁve cents a
box, if I remember correctly.
Dr. Inman—Are you able to give
the ﬁgures showing how much the or-
ganization has been able to save its
members by the purchase and trans-
portation of supplies?

Mr. Tenny—No, I cannot give these
ﬁgures either, but I do know that the
saving has been very large. They have
been able to secure a rate on box ma-
terial that is very satisfactory from
the growers’ standpoint.
Mr. Reaves—Do you think it would
be possible to have the same organiza-
tion run on the same principles in
Florida?
Mr. Tenny—No, I doubt if an asso-
ciation exactly similar to the Califor-
nia exchange could be worked in Flor-
ida. The scattered condition of the
orange sections in Florida make it
harder to co-operate. The industry in
Florida appears to be more in the
hands of the packer and the shipper
rather than in the hands of the
grower. I see no reason, however,
why a co-operative body of ship-
pers or shippers and growers could
not be made successful in Flor-
ida. The essential feature would
be to have people that are will-
ing to work together. The suc-
cess of such an organization depends
very largely on the character of the
men who are selected to be at the
head. These need to be high-class
business men, who. of course, will

have to be secured at a good big
salary.
Mr. Does the association dis-
courage the selling of oranges at the
packing house, or do they do all the
selling through agents in the east?
Mr. Tenny—No oranges except the
culls are really sold at the packing
house. If a person wishes to buy fruit
from any individual packing house,
f. o. b., he can make this purchase
through the agent of the exchange.
Of course, in all these matters, the
managers of the individual houses are
consulted and, to a very large extent,
they determine where their fruit shall
be sold.
Dr. Inman—VVhen a person wants
to come into the exchange, is it done
for the life of a crop or for a series
of years? For violating the rules it
costs them a penalty of about ﬁfty
cents a box. It ceases to be boys’ play.
A man might become dissatisﬁed, but
it would make no difference about the
marketing of his fruit. The associa-
tion of packers come in, and take his
fruit just the same. That is the better
way; not to be bothered at all by the
individual growers.
Mr. Tenny—As I understand it, any
grower may withdraw from the ex-
change house at the end of any fruit
season. I would not be sure about
this matter, however.
Mr. Grifﬁng—Does the local as-
sociation look after the picking or just
the packing of the fruit?
Mr. Tenny—The usual method has
been for each individual grower to do
his own picking. Recently, however,
we have been doing a good deal of
work on the methods of picking and
we ﬁnd it much easier to eliminate in-

juries made in the picking when the
association does the picking than when
it is done by the individual growers.
When the house picks the fruit, it is
possible to obtain an efﬁcient foreman,
who properly superintends the pick-
ing.
Mr. \Vhat is the output per day
from one of these packing houses?
Mr. Tenny—From one to ten cars.
The average house ships four or ﬁve
cars a day.
Dr. Inman—The packing houses are
run under perfect discipline. Each man
has a certain work to do, and pays
strict attention to business. It is
just like clock work. There is no
racket at all. ‘
Mr. Gritﬁng—Do they have much
trouble with labor?
Mr. Tenny—They have all sorts of
labor. There are many Japanese,
Chinese, Mexican Greasers and a good
many hoboes. Women do a large por-
tion of the packing. The Chinese are
also used in the packing houses. but
not much in the ﬁelds. The ﬁeld work
is done largely by the Japanese, Mexi-
cans and whites.
Dr. Inman—The wrappers were get-
ting 2% cents per box. Some were
paying as high as 2%, and it was a
rare instance where the limit of three
cents was paid for the wrapping.
Mr. Skinner—How many boxes per
day will the average packer pack?
Mr. Tenny—'—I have seen packers
who would wrap and pack over 100
boxes. A great many wrap and pack
from seventy to seventy-ﬁve.
Mr. Hart—My experience has been
that the packers will only average
about ﬁfty boxes per day. I consider
that good work for an average packer.



## p. 65 (#607) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 65
That is about the limit of my pack.
It costs me about four cents a box;
that is an allowance of $2.00 per day
for packing. If the packing went up
to the average of the California packer
it would cost me about $4.00 a day for
packing.
Mr. Von Engelken—Is the grower
expected to clean his fruit when it is
infected with scale or other diseases?
Mr. Tenny—All washing and brush-
ing of the fruit is done in the packing
house. Practically all the fruit is run
over brushes which clean it of dust.
In case the fruit has to be washed in
the packing house, this is charged up
extra against that lot of fruit.
Mr. Did the Department have
anything to do with the -organization
of the exchange?
Mr. Tenny—VVe have had nothing
whatever to do with the organization
of the exchange and have done no co-
operation with the exchange other
than what we have done with in-
dividuals. The fact that the Exchange
handles its own fruit and handles
such a large quantity of fruit has made
it advisable for us to do a large part
of our experimental work in their
houses. \Ve have shipped much fruit,
however, in cars that have been
packed by individual shippers, or in
co-operative houses that are not con—
nected with the Exchange.
Dr. Inman—Through what agency
was the fruit exchange organized and
put into operation?
Mr. Tenny—I cannot give you the
details of the organization of the ex-
change.
Mr. Reaves—Does the Exchange
use the commission men in any way?
Mr. Tenny—All sales are made

through their own agents or at auc-
tion.
Mr. C. L. Reaves—I located in Ma-
natee county in the vegetable and fruit
business in the spring of 1874. I have
orange trees that are nearly forty
years old from which I shipped the
ﬁrst fruit, and have been shipping
fruit from them ever since. \Vhen I
settled in Manatee county near the
Sarasota Bay in the spring of ’74. I
had only $15.00 in money and no prop-
erty at all. Now, I have an orange
grove, a little stock farm coming on
(about eighty acres); I have a store
and the postofﬁce and my credit is
good everywhere except with my wife.
I must tell you about that. At the
time I was married, I married a lady
down here, there was nobody in the
country except cattle men, and they
were having very little work done and
it was hard to get money in any way.
I gave $11.00 for oranges to get the
seed and managed somehow to get rid
of the other four dollars, so that I did
not have any money. I had a little
muzzle loading riﬂe that was almost
‘the only property I possessed. I
pawned that to get money for the
preacher. My wife had forty dollars
and I borrowed money enough from
her to pay for the license, and she de-
clares to this day that I have never
paid it back. I don’t believe now she
would lend me money to buy license
to marry any women.
Now. about the vegetable growing
and shipping. I have had experience
along this line as well as the fruit busi-
ness. I don’t expect to say very much
about the growing of it; that would
be enough to take up all the time. I
would advise anybody who goes into

the vegetable business to ﬁrst try to
learn the methods of doing it right.
Now, the shipping is the main thing.
I remember yesterday one gentleman
said, in telling about the rules posted
in his packing house, that one of them
was that his brand must be an honest
brand. If you can make your brand
an honest brand, you can sell your
fruit and vegetables and you don’t
need commission men to sell it for
you. Now, you know the commission
men do not sell direct to the people
very much. The commission houses
I have seen sell only at wholesale.
About the only good they do you, is
to have you dump in your stuff and
then they show it for you.
One day I was in Bradentown in
company with some of the best fruit
and vegetable growers. They were
talking about the shipping of to-
matoes. One fellow said, “If I ship
my tomatoes, I would like to put up
good stock in good shape. If I were
selling here, it would not make so
much difference.” Another said,
“Well, I don’t know so much about
that. I think if I were selling here I
would like to put in good stock, be-
cause I would like to build up a good
reputation at home.” I listened to
these men and was amazed. Not an
honest expression. It was simply a
question of doing right because it was
good policy. Not a single one said he
was going to do right because it was
right. That is what we should do;
we should make our fruit and vegeta—
bles something that can be depended
upon: make it so that when anyone
buys from us, they know they are go-
ing to get their money’s worth and
they are going to be done by as we
would like to be done.
I asked several questions yesterday
while we were talking about the Cali-
fornia Fruit Exchange, with a view of
ﬁnding out their methods. I learned
that sometimes' this Fruit Exchange
sells the fruit at auction where it is
an auction town, but if not, they sent
a man all the way from California to
sell the fruit, which is expensive. Not
only that, but when they send a man
they have to trust that man to some
extent, just as we have to trust com-
mission men. I noticed some time ago
that there was a man in the United
StatesTreasury Department who had
grown old in the service, having been
there since he was a young man, and
had established a reputation for h0n~
esty. In some way, he got into a little
tight place and there was a $1,000.00
bill missing out of the Treasury. One
man came very near paying the
amount back because the suspicion
was directed to him. A lady learned
the truth about it, and the guilty man
ﬁnally acknowledged having taken it.
What we need to do, is to arrange it
some way so that we will not have to
trust anybody only just as far as busi-
ness methods go. It is asking too
much to found an Exchange and put
men in charge and ﬁnd some among
them who will not work to their own
advantage. There is bound to be
graft in any organization, and we will
have to pay for it.
In Manatee county we have men
who for years have been buying,
packing and shipping fruit and vegeta-
bles. The rule in their packing
houses is “Honesty.” They have built

up a reputation for honesty. They
use the wires, which is less expensive
than sending a man. They get a man
to buy, and when the man sends an
order they ship the car and send a
sight.draft on the man’s bank, with
the bill of lading attached. If the man
who gave the order will honor that
draft, the fruit is his, but if he won’t
honor the draft, he can’t get the fruit.
The shipper is notiﬁed by wire and he
at once places the fruit with some
other man. They sell it right from
Manatee county, and they get their
money, too.
I have had considerable experience
along that line. Some years I sold
everything, some years have shipped
to commission men, and the years I
have sold are the years I made the
money. I have known some men to
get rich in a year sending to commis-
sion men, but, as a rule, they have
come outat the little end of the horn.
In many cases, they use rented land,
pay rent, pay for fertilizer and pay for
labor; then after they have a crop they
ship it hundreds of miles away to a
man they know nothing about and say
to him. “Take my stuff and do just
what you please with it. Send me
some money if you can.”
Last fall, one of the best tomato pro-
ducing men in that part of the country,
who had as good land as there is, de-
cided to raise a little crop. The
weather was dry, and we didn’t raise
very much, fortunately. We got
about 400 boxes and they were care-
fully put up and carefully selected,
and vegetables were quoted pretty
high. \Ve shipped to several commis-
sion men and they all said, “Your fruit
came in bad condition;” or this, that
and the other; and after shipping
about four hundred crates, we had to
foot the bills, but the returns we re-
ceived’were just a little more than
enough to pay for the crate material.
It would have been better for me to to
have let those tomatoes rot in the
ﬁeld.
The question with us is, whether the
commission man is a necessity at the
present time. I think the time has been
when he was. One man said yester-
day, “I think it is necessary to have
the commission man to buy the fruit.”
Now, if that is the commission busi-
ness, I am in favor of it; but what I
understand to be the commission busi-
ness is for a man to sit up and ask the
people to send him goods on the con-
signment plan, and if you send them
to him he shows them to the public,
sells them if he can, takes his com-
mission out, and sends you the rest,
if there is any. If he does not sell it,
he loses nothing, but you do.
I believe the commission man hin-
ders our business. For instance. you
want to buy fruit in one of the cities
and you invest in a car of it. You
buy from a commission house and
they don’t know and you don't know
what is going to be dumped in within
the next few hours. You pay your
money and in a few hours perhaps a
dozen cars of fruit come in, and what
are you going to do? You have spent
your money and the fruit is on your
hands and perhaps no market for it.
The commission man is going to put
you out of business if he can.
\Ve buy goods frequently from the
manufacturer instead of the middle
man. and why cannot the people buy
direct from the grower instead of

through a commission man, who is
going to get a proﬁt from both sides?
Down where I am, there used to be
a, large number of alligators. All we
knew how to do with the alligator
skins was to buy them and ship them
to commission men. Of course. freight
would be so much, commission so
much, available portions of the skin so
much, and we never could tell just
what we were going to get for them.
Now we don’t have to do this. I
have here a letter from a certain ﬁrm
who are getting alligator skins direct
from the merchants. They guarantee
us‘a certain price for a given length
of skins.
I think that nine-tenths of the fruit
and vegetable growers patronize the
commission business; perhaps even a
larger percentage. The Bible says,
“Lead us not into temptation.” This
commission business will lead us to do
wrong. and it certainly leads the com-
mission man into temptation. I have
known many a commission man who
had enough consignments in one sea-
son to set him up in business. And,
as I have said all along, though the
time may have been when the com-
mission man was necessary, that time
is past. and it is up to us to discover
some way that we can get along with-
out dealing with him.
One man sent well-gotten-up letters
and quotations to‘all the growers in
South Florida and offered the ship-
ping agent at Sarasota a large per-

centage of his commission to solicit
consignments for him. A lot of our
most intelligent shippers sent oranges
to him. He sent quick returns and
large checks, which caused us to think
that he was all right and we shipped
him more oranges, but his checks
Mr. Mont-
gomery, of Palmetto, Fla., let one of
his checks go to' protest and employed
a lawyer in the city where the com-
mission man was located to try to col-
lect something. but he failed. Then
I reported him to the Post Ofﬁce De-
partment for using the mails for
fraudulent purposes. His case was
presented to the United States Court
at Macoana“ but they neglected to

limitation was nearly out and then
they did not give us time enough. I
was the only witness that got there
in time and they said that one witness
was not enough and that the time was
too near out for them to subpoena us
again on that complaint, but that he
had been reported later by a man near
Jacksonville, which would give us an-
other chance. The next time, my sub-
poena got to my postofﬁce the day that
I was to be in Macon. I sent them a
telegram at once that I would be there
and took the ﬁrst train, but when I
got there the grand jury had ad-
journed. so the whole thing was lost
and nothing accomplished.

Is Decay of Oranges in Transit Necessary?
By Lloyd S. Tenny,
(Pomologist, U. S Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The ultimate end of commercial fruit
growing is to make money. With a very
limited supply and a large demand for
any particular fruit, no difﬁculty is found
in realizing this end. This has been true
in the citrus industry. But with the
growth of refrigeration and the extension
of the railroads, production has increased,
and the tendency is for proﬁts to dimin-
ish. There comes a time ﬁnally when
the minutest details must be looked after
in order that the proﬁts may be large
enough to keep the industry alive.
In 1894 when Florida reached high
water mark in citrus production, South—
ern California was shipping annually less
than two million boxes of oranges and
lemons. The Tulare district in Cali-
fornia was then unplanted. Shipments
from Cuba and Porto Rico were so few
as to inﬂuence but little the market con-
ditions. Then came the' freeze and F lor-
ida was practically eliminated for the
time being as a large producing state.
Fourteen years have passed and once
again Florida looks forward to a rec-
ord-breaking crop. During these years,
however, great changes have been made
in the orange producing sections. South-
ern California is, this year, shipping
nearly or quite 30 thousand cars or over
II million boxes of oranges and lemons.
Tulare county has now an annual pro-
duction of about two thousand cars; new
plantings have been made which, under
favorable condition, may increase the
production in that section to IO thousand
cars, or about four million boxes. Cuba
has been pushing forward in its planting,
and while no reliable information is at
hand, doubtless between 8 and 10 thou-
sand acres have been planted. Porto
Rico, also, has extensive plantings that
run up into the thousands of acres. I do
not wish to discourage you orange grow-
ers, or to make you think there will be
no market for your fruit. With the in-
crease of production, there has come a
large increase of demand. Hundreds of
small towns over the country that now
have oranges in their stores throughout
the season scarcely saw a box of the fruit
in 1894. The quantity eaten in the large
cities has also been very largely increased
during these years. It is safe to say
that with a proper distribution of the
fruit, fair proﬁts might be made by all
growers, provided only the fruit could be
placed on the market in a sound condi-
tion, and with a feeling in the minds of
the buyers that they could hold the fruit
ten days or two weeks with only a rea—
sonable amount of decay.
This leads us to ask the question, “Is
it necessary to have decay of oranges in
transit P” or “What is the length of time
that oranges should be expected to keep
after being packed P”
Two years ago the Department of Ag-

riculture at Washington began the study
of conditions in this State to see if these
questions could be answered. Previous
to that time considerable work had been
done in California, and some very deﬁnite
results obtained. These have recently
been published in Bulletin 123, Bureau
of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of
Agriculture, entitled, The Decay of Or—
anges While in Transit from California,
by G. Harold Powell and several assist-
ants. At the last annual meeting of this
society held at St. Petersburg, I had the
pleasure of outlining our experiments in
Florida and giving the results we had
secured up to that time. The investiga-
tion has been continued during the past
season and valuable additional data se-
cured.
Brieﬂy stated, the losses from decay of
oranges while in transit from Florida
amount annually to one-half or three-
quarter million dollars. The principal
loss is due to a decay or rot which is pro-
duced by the growth of a mold or fun-
gus within the tissue of the orange. The
most common fungus is a species of peni-
cillimn. This trouble cannot be called a
disease for sound, healthy fruit is not at-
tacked by the fungus and seldom rots. It
seems to be necessary ﬁrst to puncture the
rind of the fruit, or to bruise it in some
way sufﬁcient to kill the tissue. If now
the seed of the fungus are present at this
injured place, the ﬁrst step toward decay
has been taken and if the temperature
and moisture conditions during the fol-
lowing few days are suitable for the de-
velopment of the fungus, the orange is
sure to rot. On the other hand, large
quantities of fruit have been held experi—
mentally under weather conditions most
favorable for the development of decay,
yet when the fruit has been carefully
handled and the skin of the orange has
been uninjured, there has been practically
no loss, even when the spores or seed of
the fungus have been purposely placed
over the surface of the fruit.
This belief is not a theory or a labora-
tory scheme. In 1905, experiment work
conducted in six packing houses in Cali-
fornia, holding the fruit for two weeks
under the most trying conditions, fre-
quently in a lemon-curing room, so that
often from 50 to 100 per cent. of the in—
jured fruit decayed, yet the average de-
cay for all the sound uninjured lots was
only 4.9 per cent. In 1906, the experi-
ments were in I 5 houses and the average
decay for the carefully handled fruit was
1.5 per cent. In 1907, the number of
houses where work was done was in-
creased to 31 and the average decay for
sound fruit was 2.0 per cent. In addi—
tion to these experiments, where the
fruit was held in the packing houses, last
season 186 cars were shipped from Cal-
ifornia in which there were placed exper-
imental lots of oranges. Under ventila-
tion the sound fruit shipped immediately
arrived in New York City with 1.4 per
cent decay; under ice with 1.1 per cent.
decay.
While these ﬁgures are for California
oranges, yet we are ﬁnding that the same
principles hold true in Florida. An or—
ange without a cut or scratch on the skin
and which has not been bruised in pick-
ing and packing, almost invariably keeps.
Last season the carefully handled fruit
held packed here in the Florida houses
for two weeks, contained 2.9 per cent.
decay. This present season the same lots
showed 2.1 per cent. waste. This has
been the ﬁrst season for any shipping ex-
periments from this State and the results
show the very encouraging average of

only 0.4 per cent. rot on arrival at mar-
ket for carefully handled sound fruit.
The work has now been carried far
enough so that it seems safe to say that
the Florida orange inherently is a good
keeper. \Ve can go even farther than
this and say that it has been possible to
pick, pack and ship the fruit in a way
that has practically insured its safe ar-
rival on the market. Judging from the
past season’s shipping experiments, it
seems safe to say that any large percent-
age of decay in transit is not necessary.
The question then does not seem to be,
“Is it possible for the Florida Orange to
carry to market ?” but rather “Is it prac—
ticable to handle the crop in such a way
that the carrying quality has not been in-
jured ?” The ﬁrst question seems to be
well solved in our investigations and we
have now turned our attention to the
practicability of careful handling.
THE HANDLING IN THE ORCHARD.
Before there can be good carrying
quality, there must be careful work in
harvesting the fruit. Under the present
conditions, a premium is placed on the
amount of work done, rather than on the
quality. In handling a tender perishable
product, it is false economy to reduce the
cost of an operation at the expense of the
keeping quality. A laborer picking 75
boxes of oranges per day at ﬁve cents a
box and injuring a quarter or more of it,
and dropping the oranges several feet
into his picking bag 0r box, is far more
expensive than the one who picks 30
boxes for $3.00 a day, but who does his
work carefully.
There are three points that need care-
ful attention by the picker. (1) the
oranges should not be cut or punctured
by the clippers, (2) the stems should be
cut short, (3) the fruit should be put in
its place by hand and not thrown or
dropped.
CLIPPER CUTTING.
The smooth round Florida orange can
be cut from the tree with a short stem
without injuring the fruit with the clip-
pers more easily than can the California
navel, which has a depression around the
stem. Notwithstanding this, considerable
damage is being done by clipper cutting.
The amount of injury varies widely in
different picking gangs.

Chart I shows the work of the in-
dividual pickers in one gang in Florida.
Of the nine pickers, not more than one
or two were doing satisfactory work.
The average for the nine was over 12 per
cent. cut fruit. Not all of these injured
oranges would decay under ordinary
shipping conditions. \Vith conditions fa-
vorable for rot, however, a large percent-
age would go down. As a matter of
fact, several boxes of the fruit picked by
the two men showing the high percent-
ages of clipper cuts, after being packed
fourteen days, contained 21 per cent.
waste, and the beginning of the decay
could almost invariably be traced to the
injury made by the clippers. Another
lot of fruit selected from the more care-
ful pickers and packed and held the same
length of time and under the same con‘
ditions had 3 per cent. decay.
The clipper cutting indicated in Chart
L is above the average for Florida. In

one small district counts were made at
one time in four different orchards, with
the following percentages of clipper cuts.
1.4 per cent., 1.6 per cent., 3.8 per cent.,
and 10.4 per cent. It is rather sugges-
tive that of these, the ﬁrst gang was
paid by the day, while the last one was
on box work. ‘In another orchard two
men were working together. Two boxes
of fruit from each were examined. The
ﬁrst picker had cut but four oranges,
while his companion had literally slaugh-
tered 65,
In another place, the average injury
done on a ranch, where the owner had
everything under his direct control was
slightly over 6 per cent. At a nearby
packing house where the owner pur—
chased all his fruit and had his picking
done under the supervision of a fore-
man, the total injury found at one in-
spection was only 1.6 per cent. The dif—
ference lay in that on the ﬁrst place the
pickers worked largely by themselves,
without proper instruction and inspection.
The second foreman had been trained by
us to watch for injury and had person-
ally instructed each picker and inspected
his work, until almost uniformly good
work was done.
INJURIES OTHER THAN' THOSE MADE BY
CLIPPERS.
It is not necessary that the injury be
made with the clippers in order to cause
the fruit to decay. Any other abrasion
through which the seed of the fungus
can enter the fruit does the same dam-
age. Frequently there are found or-
anges in the b0x that have been thorn
punctured, scratched on the branches of
the tree, cut by nails or splinters in the
box, or injured by the ﬁnger nails, Many
of these are made through carelessness
and haste on the part of the picker and
therefore vary with individual pickers.
The amount of thorn puncturing done
while the fruit is still on the tree is sur-
prisingly small or at least the decay
which results from such puncturing is
small. After a heavy wind decaying or-
anges may frequently be seen hanging on
the trees. If the fruit is picked soon after
such a storm, some punctured oranges
are found. But more damage is done
by “thorning” as the pickers pull the
fruit from among the branches. In the
gang referred to a short time ago as hav-
ing a careful foreman 3 per cent. of the
fruit had body bruises. In the different
boxes there were all the way from 2 to
8 injured oranges. The fruit from four
other pickers in another locality showed
the following high percentages of body
injuries, 7.6 per cent., 15 per cent., 22.4
per cent., and 23.6 per cent. Add to
these injuries two or three oranges per
box cut by the ﬁnger nails, and another
two or three and frequently more bruised
by nails or splinters in the box. A large
amount of damage is possible therefore,
before the fruit has left the grove on its
journey to the market.
LONG STEMS.
Considerable emphasis in the past has
been placed by orchard men on having
the fruit cut with the stems short. It
has been realized that an orange with a
long sharp stem was capable of doing
much damage. The long stem in itself
causes no trouble; it is only when the
stem has been brought into contact with
another fruit and the rind punctured that
damage is done. The amoun’. of injury,
therefore, depends largely on the extent
and the nature of the handling of the
fruit after picking. More puncturing is
done if the fruit is dropped 18 inches or

two feet into the picking bag and then
for an equal distance into the box, than
would be if it were possible to lay the or-
anges carefully into the bag and box.
A long haul over a rough road with a
considerable number of oranges with long
stems in boxes will do plenty of damage.
It is not necessary to have much shaking
of the fruit in the box in order to do
puncturing, for the ﬁeld crate used almost
universally in Florida is so large that the
weight of the fruit in the box is sufficient
to force a sharp stem through the peel-
ing of an adjacent orange near the bot:
tom of the crate.
The number of long stems left by dif-
ferent pickers varies largely. Some pick-
ers work steadily without leaving scarcely
a long stem. Others cut practically all
the stems too long. The following ﬁg-
ures show the percentages left by differ-
ent individuals, 5.9 per cent., 14 per cent.,
18.8 per cent., 8.7 per cent., 15 per
cent., 7 per cent., 14.1 per cent., 0.7 per
cent., and none. The following are av-
erages for gangs: 2.9 per cent., 2.3 per
cent., 16.1 per cent., I per cent., 9.7 per
cent.
As in the case with the clipper cutting,
when the attention of the picker is called
to the number of long stems he is leaving
and when he knows his fruit is being
inspected the number cut incorrectly gen-
erally decreases,
CAREFUL HANDLING.
The third point in connection with
good picking has to do with careful
handling. There is nothing in connec—
tion with the citrus business of Florida
that impresses a person accustomed to
handling different fruits than the rough-
ness with which the oranges are treated.
To see the fruit dropped several feet into
the picking bag or basket as the laborer
holds the branches with his left hand and
clips the fruit with his right, starting it
toward the mouth of the basket at a lively
speed with his clipper, one would think
an imperishable product was being
handled instead of a very delicate living
fruit. \Vhen the picking basket is full,
the fruit takes another severe fall into
the ﬁeld crate, and the usual method of
locating the gang in the orchard is.to lis-
ten a moment for the rattle of the or-
anges in the box. I need not call your at_
tention to all the places in harvesting and
packing the crop where rough handling is
practiced. If anyone doubts the state-
ment that a large percentage of the fruit
falls somewhere at least 18 or 20 inches,
a trip with this in mind through his own
grove and packing house will probably
satisfy him about the matter. At least
such a trip through his neighbor’s grove
will convince him. On his journey let
him stop for a moment at the side of the
hopper, one of those real large ones,
holding ﬁfty boxes or more, and watch
the results. Let him place his hand on
one of the fruit, and allow the other or-
anges to hit against it. Just then have
him forget that he is watching oranges
and imagine that they are apples or per-
haps Georgia peaches. I wonder how
successful a shipper of such fruits would
be if the handling was as rough as that
to which the oranges are subjected. Yet
the experiments last year indicated that
with oranges dropped once 18 inches one
out of every ﬁve would rot within a
short time. This year the skin of the
fruit seemed rather thicker and tougher
and but ten per cent. rotted. But in test

dropped 18 inches decay developed where
it did not where the fruit was carefully

periments made this past season, where

The sound carefully handled lots were
picked under our personal supervision
and the fruit was not dropped in any
way. It was drawn to the packing houses
usually on spring wagons, and packed
without any machine handling. The
dropped fruit was handled in identically
the same manner, except that just before
packing each orange was dropped sep-
arately 18 inches on to the ﬂoor of the
packing house or into the empty ﬁeld
crate. The series indicated by the words
“through machinery” were handled in
the grove as the carefully handled lots,
but before packing the' oranges were
poured into the empty hoppers and were
- then graded and sized in the usual man-
ner, and generally by the labor in the
packing house. In all cases, the hoppers
and bins were empty so the maximum
amount of injury from the machinery
was obtained. For this reason it was not
uncommon for our experiments to show
greater decay in the fruit carefully picked
but run through the empty machinery
than we secured in the regular commer-
cial pack which had been picked and
packed without any attention on our
part. The boxes that made up the “Com-
mercial Pac ” were selected after they
had been packed and were taken from the
fruit coming from the same orchard in
which we had obtained the other experi-
ment boxes. The “Mechanically In-
jured” lots were those in which each
orange showed some abrasion. Clipper
cuts, box injuries, ﬁnger nail scratches
and stem punctures were the most com-
mon.

MARKET STORAGE TESTS.
Aside from the experiments, where the
fruit has been held in the packing house,
about ﬁfteen shipping experiments have
been made. These lots have gone by ex-
press, freight, and water and have been
shipped to Washington. The average
length of time in transit has been about
7 days. Upon arrival the fruit was ex-
amined and the percentage of decay
noted. The fruit was then repacked and
held in a common storage room and re-
examined at the end of one week and
again' at the end of two weeks. At that
time most of the lots were discarded, yet
some boxes of carefully handled fruit'
were held for some time longer.
The results of these shipments showed
that all the lots except the injured fruit
arrived at market in a fair condition.
Chart V gives the data in detail.

did not have time to decay and it reached

At the end of the ﬁrstweek the decay in
the carefully handled lots has but slightly
increased while that of the bruised fruit
jumps up to over 5 or 6 per cent. The
commercial pack has reached the high
ﬁgure of over IO per cent. The injured
fruit shows 38 per cent loss. At the end
of the second week the carefully handled
series remain still practically sound. All
other lots show heavy losses. The com—
mercial pack at that time had nearly one—
ﬁfth waste while over one-half of the in-
jured fruit has decayed.
Among the results shown by this chart
there is a conﬁrmation of the belief hel.l
by the fruit trade in general that it is not
a safe thing to handle Florida oranges
for even if there is but little decay on
arrival, the fruit will not hold sufficiently
long for the retailer to sell his stock.
There is probably no other one thing
that has more to do with low prices or
small demand for Florida fruit at any
time than this. The quality of the fruit
is such, and the texture and general ap-
pearance so good, that there should be
a healthy demand for your fruit through-
out the season. But as long as the buyer
must ﬁgure on losing perhaps one-quar-
ter or even one-half of a box by 'decay,
if it is necessary for him to hold it some
days, he cannot afford to handle such
fruit if there is on the market a brand
which he is sure will hold an equally long
time with but a slight amount of waste.
The sound, carefully handled lots shipped
this season answer all his requirements.
Is it possible then, to handle your fruit
in any better way than is being done at
present? Chart VI gives the results of
some educational work done among the
pickers.

weeks later the total was reduced to 4
per cent. This large reduction was made
by a little quiet educational work by
showing the different pickers where they
were doing had work, and by telling them
of the damage this kind of work was do-
ing. This particular lot of pickers was
on day pay, so it was easier to work with
them than it was with pickers paid by the
box. Notwithstanding the better work
done, the quantity picked remained about
the same and was perfectly satisfactory
to the owners. This was in a community
where I had been told less than a year be-
fore that it was entirely out of the ques-
tion to pay by the day. Decided improve-
ment may be made, however, with men
working by the box. One crowd under
a good foreman after some help by us
was averaging only about 2 per cent. in-
jury at several inspections.
Those who think it is impossible to
handle the fruit with care should visit a
large peach ranch in Georgia, where un-
der one general foreman and with col-
ored help, ten cars and more of peaches
are shipped in one day, and the fruit is
so delicate that a heavy pressure by the
ﬁnger in picking damages the carrying
quality.
The outlook, then, is hopeful. Decay
—at least damaging decay—is not neces—
sary. Fruit, sound and carefully han-
dled has been held in the packing houses
two weeks with but slight decay. Other
lots have been shipped and arrived on
the market with almost no loss and have
stood the market holding test remarka—
bly well. On the other hand roughly
handled and injured fruit should not be
expected to keep, and it does not. The
methods of harvesting and packing at
present in operation are extremely rough
and should be expected to produce a poor-
carrying product. Experiments show
that this is true. It is not impracticable
on the other hand to change these meth-
ods sufﬁciently so that a great improve-
ment in keeping quality may be expected.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—I note in your paper
you speak of the oranges going
through machinery. To what do you
refer?
Mr. Tenny—All the machinery
found in the average packing house:
the hopper, the elevator (if there'is
one), the sizer and into the bins.
Mr. McClung—How long after the
fruit was picked before the dropping
of it was done?
Mr. Tenny—\Ve tried it at various
times. As a usual thing, within
twenty-four hours: almost certainly
within thirty-six hours after picking.
Mr. McClung—And you found the
same results after the fruit was wilted
a little as when perfectly fresh?
Mr. Tenny—Very much the same.
The majority of the dropping that
causes damage in the commercial
handling is done at the time of pick-
ing, hence most of our experiments
were made with fruit that was drop-
ped immediately after picking.
Mr. \Varner—I think it would be a
good thing for Mr. Tenny to give us
a lecture next year on the methods of
packing and shipping oranges from
California. using the stereopticon
slides so that we can see for ourselves.
I make a motion to that effect; that
is, that Mr. Tenny give us an illus-
trated lecture at our meeting next
year showing just how these matters
are handled by our California brethren.
Motion seconded, put and carried.

and after long waiting. Thus it is with
the whiteﬂy investigations. This matter
has been investigated before. Riley and
Howard write: 1 “Our ﬁrst acquaintance
with the species was in June, 1878, when
we found it occurring in profuse abun-
dance on the leaves of the citrus trees in
the orangery of this department. Some
observations were made upon its life-his-
tory during that summer, and all of its
stages were observed. During the fol-
lowing years we observed it in Florida, ~

upon the ability of 'w-hiteﬁy to survive
on detached and partly dried leaves; the
varieties or species of whiteﬂy represented
in the State which attack citrus seriously,
the amount of honeydew excreted, and
a few other points.
METHODS OF INTRODUCING THE FUNGUS
PARASITES.
It has been repeatedly demonstrated
that the red and yellow Aschersonias can
be successfully introduced by spraying
their spores (germs) suspended in water
on to the under surface of white ﬂy-in-
fested leaves, or by pinning leaves hav-
ing these fungi upon them to the under
surface of the leaves of white fly-infested
trees. Both methods are also applicable
to the cinnamOn and whitefringe fungi.
The spraying method is probably not
generally applicable for introducing the
brown fungus, and pinning fungus-bear-
ing leaves is therefore recommended.
This fungus has, however, been several
times successfully started by spraying a
mixture of water and fungus, obtained
by agitating fungus-bearing leaves with
water. A better way would be to scour
the fungus from the leaves with a little
sand and water. Use one to several
leaves to a quart of water and strain the
liquid if necessary.
EXPEIMENTS FOR INTRODUCING TIIE
FUNGUS PARASITES OF VVIIITEFLY
LARVAE.
Actual experiments and observations
in the ﬁeld have again demonstrated that
the period of summer rains is a most fa-
vorable time in which to introduce the
several fungus parasites of whitetly lar-
vae. Introductions of the red and yel-
low fungi made during October and No-
vember were successful only to the extent
of getting a small start of fungus, but
were sufﬁcient to insure a good spread of
the same during the following summer.
T hus, sprayings with spores of the red
fungus in the R. S. Sheldon Grove at
New Smyrna, on October 3, 1906, de-
veloped but a few pustules of the red by
the ﬁrst of December of the same year,
and no more by the ﬁrst week of May,
1907. The fungus spread, however, dur-
ing the summer of 1907, so that by the
fall of that year the trees sprayed had
the foliage of many small branches lit-
erally clotted over with the red pustules,
besides which the fungus had spread to
perhaps all of the trees of the grove not
sprayed with spores. This fungus will,
no doubt, quite control the “ﬂy” in this
grove during the coming summer, and
from there will spread over all the white-
ﬂv-infested citrus trees of New Smyrna.
Why sprayings with spores of the red and
yellow Aschersonias (fungi) made in
the Ronnock groves at New Smyrna, at
the same time (October 3, 1906), failed
to produce a start of fungus can only
be surmised; it may have been due to
a more arid condition in these groves
at that time, but more probably to poi-
soning of the spores by the use of an old
spraying outﬁt previously used for spray-
ing Bordeaux mixture. There being
much less “ﬂy” in these groves, of course,
also lessened the chances of getting a
start,
Sprayings with fungus spores made in
the F. W. Edison grove at New Smyrna,
on November 29, 1907, have given a
promising start of red Ascheronia [trees
examined April 23, 1908]: but other
trees sprayed with spores at the same time
in New Smyrna (some in the Ronnoc
groves) show but a very poor start of

either the red or yellow Aschersonia after
a period of ﬁve months (November 29,
1907, to April 23, 1908). Again, spore-
spraying operations in some trees-of" Mr.
B. F. Hampton’s grove near Gainesville,
made on October 6 and November 16,
1907, resulted in promising starts of
both the red and yellow Aschersonias.
Spores of the red and yellow Ascher-
sonias, together with some brown fun-
gus material, scoured from the leaves
with a little sand and water, were
sprayed into some citrus trees at DeLand
on january 17, 1908. Examination of
the trees on April 20, 1908, revealed no
certain growths of fungus. Introduc-
tions of the red Aschersonia made into
thirteen trees on April 21 and 22, 1908,
at the same place, by the spore-spraying
method have produced an excellent
growth of this fungus [trees examined
june 17, 1908 and paper revised to this
date]. In two trees, Mr. H. B. Stevens
and the writer estimated that from 30
to 40 per cent. of the white fly larvae
had become infected by the fungus and
were dead. In two other trees the writer
estimates [estimate was based on actual
counts made upon leaves] that at least
50 per cent. were dead. Fungus intro-
duced into two other trees by the leaf-
pinning method resulted in only very
poor growths of fungus; the growths of
fungus produced by the spore-spraying
method are estimated at from several
hundred to perhaps a thousand times as
great as those produced by the leaf-pin-
ning method in the two trees referred to.
At the time of introducing the fungus
the spring brood of adult “flies” had
about disappeared and larvae of the ﬁrst,
second and third stages were in abun-
dance beneath the leaves. These spray-
ing and leaf-pinning operations at De-
Land on April 21 and 2-2 are regarded as
of great signiﬁcance; because they indi~
cate so clearly that the best time in
which to introduce the red Aschersonia
by the spore-spraying method is when
young larvae are abundant. It appears
that young larvae are more easily infected
than the older ones of the fourth stage
and pupae. The fact that rains immedi-
ately followed or preceded the operations
may also be of signiﬁcance; the moisture
favoring the germination of the spores.
The comparatively very poor growths of
fungus produced in the two trees into
which leaves only had been pinned, are
believed to indicate that the presence of
an abundance of adult “ﬂies” is necessary
in order to obtain good growths of fun—
gus by this method. [See: The Whiteﬂy
SPreads the Fungi] \Vhat has been
stated here for the red Aschersonia is
also believed to hold good for the yellow
Aschersonia; both are very similar in all
their characters except color. The same
principles, with one or two exceptions,
probably apply to all the fungus parasites
of the whiteﬁy larvae.
The experiments enumerated demon-
strate quite clearly that the red and yel-
low Aschersonias can be introduced in
whiteﬂy-infested trees during the fall
months with fairly good success by the
spore-spraying method, but leave us in
doubt if we may ever be able to success-
fully introduce them during the winter
and early spring months. Some other
sprayings made at Gainesville with the
red and yellow Aschersonias and the
brown fungus during january and
March indicate more clearly, however,
that this may be impossible since not a
single growth of fungus has so far re-
sulted from any of these sprayings. The
absence of the easily infected young lar-

vae at this time is believed to be the ex-
planation. If the absence of young lar-
vae is the explanation for the failures
during January and March, this barren
period is believed to also include Decem-
ber and February, since in neither one
of those two months are there any but
but a few [in December] young larvae.
In other words, the barren period for
introducing fungus will extend from De-
cember through March or until the
young larvae of the spring brood of
adults become abundant either in late
March or in April. If larvae of the
fourth stage and pupae are practically
immune to the attacks of fungus as the
January and March experiments indicate,
then we may expect another barren period
of a few weeks immediately preceding
the appearance of the second brood of
adult “flies” sometime in June or some-
times earlier. Preceding the appearance
of the third brood of adults, there may
also be a barren period, when the white-
ﬂy is in the fourth stage and pupae; but
generally the separation of the second
and third broods is not so well deﬁned;
larvae of all stages continuing to exist
during the interval of the greatest abun-
dance of adults. Some few trees in Mr.
\Vm. E. Heathcote’s grove at St. Peters-
burg were sprayed on May 17, 1907,
with spores of the red Aschersonia A
good growth of this fungus had devel-
oped from this spraying by the end of
last summer, although in the beginning
only a few fungus pustules could be
found. This experiment clearly indicates
that we can begin operations in May;
and earlier as the DeLand experiments of
April 21 and 22 have shown us. Better
stated, the time to begin to introduce
fungus in spring is when the young lar-
vae of the spring brood of adult “ﬂies”
are becoming abundant (that is by the
dozen) beneath the leaves.
Operations were begun last spring in
1\er Heathcote’s grove for the main pur-
pose of demonstrating what can be done
in one season with the spore-spraying
and leaf-pinning methods of introducing
the fungi. The frost of the previous
December together with the prevailing
drought having defoliated so many citrus
trees in sections where fungus had been
abundant, that only small quantities of
fungus could be obtained. However,
continued efforts on the part of Mr.
Heathcote, together with some supplies
of fungus and aid from the writer, re-
sulted in giving a wholesome sprinkling
of the fungi, especially the red Ascher-
sonia, together with some yellow Ascher-
sonia and brown fungus, by the end of
1907. Mr, Heathcote has recently writ-
ten, stating that the fungus does not ap-
pear to be as abundant in his grove this
spring as it was last winter. This is
quite what I expected, since it spreads
but little if at all during the winter, and
of course what has previously developed
becomes weathered; besides some leaves
drop, thus reducing the amount of fun-
gus present in the trees.
It would be consuming an unnecessary
amount of time were I to undertake to
say something about all the experiments
that I have started in different parts of
the State. Sufﬁce it to say that I have
Started spore-spraying and leaf-pinning
operations for introducing fungus in the
following places: Lake City, Leesburg,
New Smyrna, Kissimmee, St. Petersburg,
DeLand and Gainesville, in all seven 10-
calities. Taking a single grove or yard

eral localities as the unit and also count-

ent times at which operations were be-
gun in the same grove or yard, we have
in all something like forty or ﬁfty exper-
iments made by the writer for introduc-
ing the fungi parasites of the white ﬂy
during the past two years.
TWO OTHER FUNGUS PARASITES.
Since appearing before you a year ago,
two other fungus parasites of the white-
ﬂy larvae have been discovered in Flor-
ida. These are described by Professor
H. S. Fawcett in Press Bulletins 68 and
76, Florida Agricultural Experiment
Station, and are the whitefringe fungus
(Mic-rocera sp.) and the cinnamon fun-
gus (Verticillium. heterocladum) re-
spectively. The whitefringe fungus has
been observed mainly at Sutherland, but
specimens have been sent in from other
parts of the State; so that it appears to
be quite widely distributed. The cinna-
mon fungus has hitherto been mistaken
for the brown fungus, and is probably
as widely distributed as the latter, though
not so abundantly. Both of these fungi
being new discoveries, we are not pre-
pared to make speciﬁc recommendations
as to their efﬁciency in reducing the
whiteﬂy or as to the best methods for in-
troducing them. Professor F awcett, who
has so far done about all of the work on
the whitefringe and cinnamon fungi, suc-
ceeded in starting both of these upon
whiteﬁy larvae by spraying the spores of
the fungi suspended in water. The cin—
namon fungus has also been started by
pinning leaves, and this method, no
doubt is applicable to the whitefringe
fungus.
SIX KNOWN' FUNGI PARASITES.
Following is a list of the six known
fungus parasites of whiteﬁy larvae given
in their order of discovery in Florida:
Red Aschersonia- (Aschersonia aleyro-
dis Webber) 1893.
Brown Fungus
1896.
Red-headed Scale Fungus (Sphaeros-
tilbe coccophila Tul.) 1903 [P]
Yellow Aschersonia (Aschersonia_
flavo-citrina P. Henn.) 1906. _
VVhiItefringe Fungus (Microcera sp.)
1907.
Cinnamon Fungus (V erticillium hete-
rocladmn. Pensig) 1907.
The red-headed scale fungus has been
observed upon white ﬂy larvae only a few
times and cannot be said to be of much
signiﬁcance in its relation to this insect.
It is, however, a most efﬁcient fungus
parasite of scale insects in nearly every
part of the State.
The following table gives the present
distribution in Florida 0f the six fungus
parasites of white ﬂy larvae: R, Red
Aschersonia; Y , Yellow Aschersonia; B,
Brown Fungus; W, VVhitefringe Fun—
gus; C, Cinnamon Fungus; S, Red-
headed Scale Fungus:
(spores unknown)

THE \VHITEFLY SPREADS THE FUNGI.
Observations made during the past
year indicate that the whiteﬁy itself is
instrumental in distributing the fungi
after once they have been started in a
tree or grove. The adults, as they walk
over the leaves, no doubt get many of
the fungus spores attached to their feet,
and as they ﬂy away to other trees de-
posit them upon whiteﬂy larvae; thus un-
knowingly carrying disease with them.
Other insects, such as ants, and ordinary
ﬂies and beetles, may also be instrumen-
tal in disseminating the fungi. This
probably accounts for the fact that pin-
ning fungus—bearing leaves has not re-
sulted in much success in starting the
fungi during the cool and dry periods
of the year, or when few or no adult
whiteﬂies were about. It is therefore
advised only to use the leaf-pinning

method for introducing the fungi during
the period of summer rains or at other
periods when abundant whiteﬂies are in
the trees. Most excellent results have
been obtained with the red and yellow
Aschersonias by pinning fungus-bearing
leaves during June, july and August.
The spore—spraying method can be used
at any time, but it will probably be difﬁ-
cult to start fungus in winter and early
spring by any method. There are indi-
cations that larvae of the fourth stage
and pupae (in which two stages the “ﬂy”
exists from about December until March
and April) are not readily, if at all, in-
fected with fungus.
PLAN OF CAM PAIGN‘.
The writer’s plan of campaign, based
upon experiments in the ﬁeld, is as fol-
lows :—If a grove is thoroughly infested
with whiteﬁy, and sufﬁcient “seed-fun-
gus” is available, introduce fungus into
all the trees; but if the supply of seed-
fungus is limited, distribute it here and
there thrOughout the grove, so that there
will be a great many centers of infection
from which the fungus can spread. It
may be considered advisable to treat only
a few trees in each row with fungus, and
it may only be possible to treat some
branches of each of these trees; but any
scheme of distribution that will give the
fungi a good chance to spread to all parts
of a grove will sufﬁce. Later on, when
more seed-fungus is available, the trees
or parts of trees not previously treated
may be attended to. A second, and even
a third or fourth treatment may be given
to the trees in order to get the quickest
possible dissemination of fungus. So
long as only a few fungus pustules are
visible on those leaves of a tree which
bear the most fungus, it will be advisable
to introduce more fungus, especially
should an abundance of seed-fungus be
readily available. The greater the
amount of fungus growth which is
successfully started in a grove by
artiﬁcial means, the more rapid will
be the destruction of the whiteﬁy. \Vhite-
flies have the habit of congregating on
water-sprouts and other tender growth
of citrus, consequently we should give
particular attention to introducing the
fungi into such parts of the trees. The
work should be done methodically and
not in a haphazard way.
The plan of campaign for a grove just
becoming infested with whiteﬂy; or only
infested in part, would be to introduce
fungus into all those trees sufficiently in-
fested (that is, whiteﬂy by the dozen
on the leaves), and later on into other
trees as soon as they become sufﬁciently
infested. Incidentally, the trees should
be fertilized a little more heavily.
“Seed-fungus" becomes abundant
about midsummer and lasts until midwin-
ter and later, although some can gener-
ally be obtained somewhere at all times.
The best weather conditions for intro-
ducing fungus are met with from about
June to the end of August. Since the
period of summer rains is also the time
when “seed-fungus" is abundant it is
about the best time in which to introduce
fungus. It is advisable, however, to in—
troduce fungus at other times when “seed-
fungus” is available, using onlv the spore-
spraying method when young larvae are
abundant and adults not plentiful
but employing either one of the
two methods (spore-spraying or leaf-
pinning) during the warmer months, or
when adult “ﬂies” are swarming abun-
dantly about the trees. It will, of course,
be evident from a perusal of the preced-
ing pages that it would probably be use-
less to try to introduce fungus from

December to April, or until young lar-
vae become abundant immediately follow-
ing the ﬁrst brood of adults in spring.
It is best to use fresh fungus, although
the writer has succeeded (during the
rainy season) with fungus that had been
collected and dried for a month.
For further particulars in regard to
methods for introducing the fungi the
reader is referred to Bulletin No. 88 and
Press Bulletins 68, 76, 8o, 82, and 88,

Fungus can probably be obtained at
the following places :—Manatee, Braden-
town, Palmetto, Sarasota, Fort Myers,
Buckingham, Orlando, Oviedo, Apopka.
and Titusville.
0TH ER OBSERVATIO NS.
IVhiteﬂy Matures on Dead Leaves.—
On November 20 and 21, 1907, Mr. R. Y.
\Vinters, Assistant in Botany, and the
writer made a very careful inspection of
some of the trees at DeLand that had
been defoliated the previous February,
but in which the whiteﬂy had reappeared
during the summer. Careful inspection
of the vegetation in the neighborhood
of the infested trees revealed no plants
infested with whitefly which could have
acted as carriers during the period of
defoliation of the citrus. (It does not
necessarily follow, however, that such
carriers did not exist.) But whiteﬁy in
abundance existed in the citrus and Cape
jasmine that had been defoliated the
previous February. Where had it come
from? The writer ﬁnally decided to
carefully examine the dead leaves accum-
ulated under a certain Cape jasmine, es-
pecially any that had collected in small
hollows near the trunk. Something like
several peeks of such leaves were exam-
ined by Mr. \Vinters and the writer with
the result that well matured larvae and
pupae, apparently healthy and alive,
were found on some leaves that were
dead and brown, but had either retained
or been supplied with enough moisture
to keep them ﬂexible. Finally, the writer
found an adult specimen about half
emerged from the pupa case on such a
leaf. The specimen appeared fresh but
inactive, and with a little effort was
freed from its case and found to be un-
doubtedly alive, since it could move its
legs and feelers.
In the afternoon Mr. \Vinters went to
carefully inspect the fallen leaves of cer—
tain citrus trees. with similar results.
Seemingly live and healthy pupae were
found upon dead and dried leaves gen-
erally with enough moisture; however. to
remain ﬂexible. Some of these leaves
were taken to the laboratory at the Ex-
periment Station by Mr. \Vinters, and
after a few days, live adults were found
moving about under the bell jar. Two
days later the writer found apparently
live specimens of pupae on a few partly
dried and curled leaves of citrus in an-
other yard at DeLand. On january I7,
some of the fallen leaves under the Cape
jasmine above referred to were again ex-
amined, when semi-dried leaves with
plump, live larvae were found, also a
pupa on a leaf that was dried and brown.
It was further observed on the Cape jas-
mine in question, and on two citrus trees
(all of which had been defoliated in the
preceding February) that the greater
number of whiteﬂy larvae were low down
in the trees (about the lower third) and
also that the empty pupae cases of pre-
ceding brood were on the lower leaves
of the trees, possibly indicating that the
“ﬂy” came up from the ground.
When at DeLand on January 17 and
I8, 1908, I brought back to Gainesville

several small twigs (with leaves) of the
Cape jasmine before referred to, and well
infested with whiteﬂy. A portion of
this material was placed in a small cloth
sack and slightly buried at the foot of
a large magnolia tree near the Univer—
sity. The magnolia was chosen because
no citrus or jasmine was near at hand.
On March 22 live adults were emerging
and some of the leaves were still green.
Another portion of this material was
placed under a bell jar (with open top
and covered with cheese—cloth) on sand
in the greenhouse. Live adults were ob-
tained as before at the end of two months
and a few of the leaves were still green.
In both experiments, however, the lar-
vae on the leaves which had turned dark
or dried, soon died,
These observations leave no doubt in
my mind that some whiteﬂy can be car-
ried through the winter on dead, partly
dried and browned leaves, scattered un-
der trees, especially when so placed that
they do not dry sufﬁciently to crumble,
although some of the leaves examined
were quite dry. It was not possible to
know how long these leaves had been in
the condition in which we found them,
and whether the larvae there could have
matured; for when leaves are allowed to
dry in the laboratory all larvae have been
observed to die. In regard to the pupae
there can be no doubt about their matur-
ing, as one adult at least was caught in
the act of emerging from its case while
others developed into adults when taken
to the laboratory, as previously stated.
It is estimated that the leaves in question
had fallen from the trees two weeks to
two months previously, but they may
have been older. The experiments with
the fresh green jasmine leaves indicate
furthermore, that it is possible for such
leaves to become buried in the sand or
otherwise protected, so that they remain
green for at least two months, allowing
whiteﬂy larvae to mature upon them
in time to infest the early new growth
of the trees.
Extermination by Defoliation.—The
previous observations and experiments
indicate pretty clearly why the attempts
at exterminating the white ﬂy at DeLand
in February, 1907, by defoliating the
trees have failed, notwithstanding that
precautions were taken to burn all the
leaves. Some of the trees had been
banked with earth, and as the “ﬂy” ap-
peared in greatest abundance in these
trees after the defoliation, this again in-
dicates the possible source of the re-in-
festation, since these banks of earth about
the stems of the trees would be ideal
places for preserving leaves, as the pre-
viously stated experiments show. That
the defoliation of all the trees at De-
Land at the time referred to was never-
theless useful can hardly be doubted,
since it must have been at least equiva-
lent to a season’s spraying or fumiga-
tion in keeping the "ﬂy" in check. The de-
foliation was completed after the partial
defoliation by the December freeze of
1906, so that the burden of it was much
less. I believe that defoliating whiteﬂy-
infested trees after a partial defoliation
by a freeze may frequently be advisable,
but doubt if the wholesale butchery of
the trees at Marysville, California, of
last year was advisable, and doubt, fur-
thermore, if they will be successful in
exterminating the white ﬂy there unless
they keep up the extreme vigilance now
exercised for at least ﬁve or six years.
No doubt the growers at Marysville, Cal-
ifornia, would have done better to have
checked the “ﬂy” as best they could dur-

ing last summer by spraying or fumigat-
ing, and then in winter have undertaken
to exterminate it by fumigation in the
citrus trees, and by destroying all of its
other food plants possible. The injury in
winter caused by even large overdoses
of hydrocyanic acid gas would have been
trivial in comparison to the injury done
to the trees by cutting off their large
limbs in order to get rid of the leaves.
Honeydew Excreted.—Leaves with an
abundance of whiteﬂy larvae were
placed between glass plates, and it was
found that the honeydew ejected by the
insects was deposited in small drops on
the glass above or below them, in some
instances the liquid being precipitated up-
ward a distance of 1-8 inch or more. Pu-
pae ready to have the adult emerge se-
crete honeydew as well as larvae of all
stages. A lot of larvae of perhaps the
third and fourth stages of growth ex-
creted at the rate of .0005 gram each in 48
hours. At this rate 1,000,000 larvae (in
round numbers) could excrete one pound
of honeydew in 48 hours, which would be
at the rate of 15 pounds per month or
180 pounds per year. Since no doubt a
large percentage of this sweet excretion
is sugar (let us assume 50 per cent.,
since we have not had an opportunity
to test it or have it tested), at this rate
100 trees of good size on an acre of
ground would lose something like 50
barrels of sugar per year, allowing 1,-
000.000 whiteﬂy larvae to a tree. These
50 barrels are the equivalent of 10,000
pounds, or 5 tons; at 5 cents per pound,
this would amount to $500.00. Of
course. this is not the actual loss per
acre, since carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,
the components of sugar, come from
the air; but it does represent an unneces-
sary amount of work that the trees are
required to do, granting that they bear
a full crop besides, which they probably
never do. This great amount of loss of
sugar and water, however, does account
for the insipid and dry fruit of whiteﬂy-
infested trees, and suggests the necessity
of giving the trees an extra allowance
of fertilizer and, of course, sufﬁcient wa—
ter.
Two Species—Are there two species
of white ﬂy seriously affecting the citrus
trees in Florida? The writer has several
times observed that the eggs of the white-
ﬂy in certain localities in Florida had a.
different appearance from those in other
localities. Last fall and winter, while
Prof. H. S. Fawcett and Mr. R. Y. \Vin-
ters were doing some work with the mi-
croscope under the writer’s direction on
the whiteﬂy larvae and eggs. our atten-
tion became further directed to a peculiar
delicate net-like covering to certain eggs.
After examining material from different
localities, I found that only whiteﬂy
eggs from certain localities had this cov-
ering, eggs from other localities being
perfectly smooth and shiny. A like ex-
amination of eggs of this spring’s brood
from the same localities revealed the
same differences, together with decided
differences in the external structure of
the larvae of the ﬁrst stage. At the
time of writing this no literature on the
whitefly has been found which takes
note of differences such as have just been
stated,
It istrue that Professor H. A. Morgan-
in his bulletin (previously cited) ﬁgures
the reticulated type of egg for the white-
ﬂy in Louisiana in 1893, and in his de-
scription of the egg mentions “a ﬁlm-like
covering arranged in hexagons—;” but
it is evident that he was not aware of the
existence of two types of eggs represents

ing two species of whitefly seriously
affecting citrus. Professor Morgan gives
the name of the whitefly observed by
him in Louisiana (bulletin cited) as Aley-
rodes citrifolii, giving for his authority
Riley (unpublished manuscript). This
is presumably the manuscript which was
later published in Insect Life (previously
cited), the name of the insect in the
meantime being changed to Aleyrodes
citri. The description in the article in
Insert Life clearly refers to the species
with smooth eggs, since it is expressly
stated that the eggs are perfectly smooth,
although sometimes pruinose, while the
description of the larvae of the ﬁrst stage
also agrees with the character of the lar-
vae which hatch from the smooth eggs,
and not with those hatched from the
reticulated eggs. At ﬁrst it was thought
that either Aleyrodcs aurantii Maskell, A.
Marlatti Quaintance, or A. spinifera
Quaintance, reported on citrus from the
N. W. Himalaya Mountains, Japan, and
Java, respectively, might be the species
in question. However, a careful compar-
ison with the descriptions of these species
has ruled them out, as well as many
other species. The writer is therefore
quite satisﬁed that the citrus whiteﬂy of
Florida with the reticulated egg is a new
species, distinct from the citrus whitefly
of Florida with the smooth egg (Aley-
rodes citri); the differences in the eggs
alone are considered sufﬁcient to make
the distinction. Careful comparisons
have also revealed distinct differences be-
tween the pupae and perhaps also be-
tween the adults of the two species as
well as between their eggs and newly-
hatched larvae. -
What is the signiﬁcance of this dis-
covery? The species with the reticulated
egg is found at Clearwater, Largo and
Sutherland on the \Vest Coast, and at
Mims, Titusville and Geneva on the East
Coast. It also occurs at Orlando and
probably in other localities. The species
with smooth eggs is at present known to
occur at St. Petersburg, Largo, DeLand,
New Smyrna, Gainesville, Manatee
County, Apopka, Chiplcy, Leesburg, Bay
Ridge, Daytona, jacksonville and other
places. One conclusion immediately fol-
lows: that there have been at least two
separate introductions of the whitefly
into Florida; assuming, which is proba-
ble, that the \vhiteﬂy of Florida is not
a native here. It indicates, also, that the
whitefly in the upper part of the Sub-
peninsula is not altogether an introduc-
tion from St. Petersburg as is generally
believed, but has had its origin in part
elsewhere, probably over at Safety Har-
bor. Whence came the “fly” at Safety
Harbor cannot at present be told, but it
is believed to have infested citrus trees
there for many years. On the other
hand, the \vhiteﬁy at St. Petersburg, in
all probability, has been brought from the
Manatee Country. Further research may
determine many important points of dif-
ference in the life history, effectiveness
of the fungus and other parasites, spray-
ing or fumigation in the control of each
species.
[This paper was followed by a dem~
onstration with stereopticon views illus-
trating the eggs and ﬁrst stage larvae of
the two species of white ﬂy discussed, to-
gether with views of the fungus, para-
sites, lacewinged flies, and excretion of
honeydew]

DISCUSSION.
Dr. Inman—I would like to ask how
much~ damage we are likely to do this
fungus by spraying with insecticides.
Dr. Berger—That would depend

38 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
upon the nature of the insecticide.
Kerosene and soap solution would do
very little injury unless you keep the
trees sprayed all the time. Of course,
very caustic insecticides and those con-
taining fungicides may do very much
harm.
Dr. Inman—Thrip juice,_ which is a
solution of arsenic—what about that?
Dr. Berger—I do not know the in-
gredients of thrip juice. I cannot an-
swer deﬁnitely whether the arsenic
will do harm or not, but probably not.
I have never seen arsenic recom—
mended as a fungicide.
Mr. Mote—How about the sulphur
solution?
Dr. Berger—It may be very injuri—
ous to fungi if used too frequently. Of
course, one spraying or dusting of the
trees with sulphur will do very little
damage, especially if the spraying is
not too thorough and applied only to
the parts of a tree affected. The Rex
lime and sulphur solution is now re-
commended and sold as fungicide.
Mr. How about the resin wash?
Dr. Berger—I imagine it would be
injurious, because it is generally quite
caustic. but one or two sprayings in
winter will probably do little harm to
the fungi.
Mr. Henderson—Do you know any-
thing about the Gold Dust solution?
Dr. Berger—If Gold Dust is nothing
but powdered soap, as I believe it is,
it will do very little, if any, injury to
the fungi.
Mr. Henderson—I also wish to say
that I visited thirty or forty orchards
in thestate and in every one, but one.
there was scale, somewhere. I intro—
duced the fungus into all the orchards
and so far as I know, the scale is dead

in all of them. My experience has
shown that the fungi is not only the
cheapest but the best remedy for San
jose scale and orange scale. I believe
that the black fungus is really more
effective and stands more hardship
and spreads more rapidly than the red.
The application is very simple. You
just tie a small piece of wood contain-
ing the fungi to about every tenth
tree, and your work is done. It is
much less trouble and expense to get
the fungi and apply it than it is to
spray one time. One man can go over
about twenty acres in a day.
Prof. Rolfs—I might say, in open-
ing this discussion, that to use the
fungi requires courage and intelli-
gence. I know the results of Mr.
Henderson’s experience must be espe-
cially gratifying to Mr. Hart, since he
has been harping on that for ﬁfteen
years. It must be gratifying to him
to see that a large number of citrus
growers are coming around to see that
the fungi are of invaluable assistance
to them.
Mr. \Varner—I would like to ask
whether it is better to combat the rust
mite with a spray or dust.
Mr. Skinner—The liquid spray just
hits the outside of the tree, but the
dust goes into the whole tree, and I
think it is more effective. Besides,
liquid spray is so unpleasant to use
that ordinary labor will shirk their
work to get through quicker. The
lime is hard on their hands and faces
and gets into their eyes and they don't
like to use it.
Mr. Stevens—If you use the dust
spray, try sulphur and no lime. It does
not increase the scale at all. The liquid
spray, in my judgment, injures the

fungi working on the spray, while the
dust does not.
Mr. Painter—A good many com-
plaints have come in the same as Mr.
Skinner’s, and one man told me he
overcame that by giving his men olive
oil with which to rub their faces and
hands.
Mr. Longley—I don’t think the sul-
phur solution brings scale. I spray
with a sulphur solution and have been
for a number of years, and in my case
it killed the scale. I never have a
scale even on the grapefruit, and we
all know that it is a great breeder of
scale.
Prof. Rolfs—I will say in connection
with this subject that the lime in the
dry spray is not necessary for it to be
efficacious. It is pretty apt to kill the
fungi and let the scale come out.
Mr. Longley—In order to keep the
scale down and the rust mite down, I
have found that unless you spray thor-
oughly you had better not spray at all.
Consequently, it is necessary almost
always to personally supervise it or do
it yourself.
THE WHITE FLY INVESTIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
By Dr. A. W. Morrill.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen.-
I spoke to you last year on the subject
of fumigation for the White Fly, describ-
ing the methods of procedure and dis-
cussing in a general way the results ob-
tained up to that time. As most of you
know, the present investigations of the
Department of Agriculture have for their
object a thoro study of all phases of the
White Fly problem. Such work naturally
divides itself into: ﬁrst, studies of life
history and habits; second, control by
natural enemies, including parasitic in-
sects and fungi, third,‘c0ntrol by spraying
or fumigation; fourth, studies of miscel-
laneous factors in their relation to White
Fly damage and control.
The early history of the \Vhite Fly is
rather obscure and its origin not
positively known. The evidence at hand,
however, seems to Show the pest to have
been an imported rather than a native
species and much support has been given
to this theory by its recent discovery in
China. The ﬁrst investigation of Citrus
pests in Florida was by H. G. Hubbard,
who was doubtless known to many of the
present members of this society. As a
special agent of the Division of Ento-
mology of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture he published in 1885 a valua-
ble report entitled “Insects Affecting the
Orange,” based on three years’ work be—
gun in August 1881. In connection with
the White Fly, it is interesting to note
that at the time of Mr. Hubbard's in-
vestigations this insect gave no promise
of developing into a pest, although its

existence in Florida was not unknown to
the author. The ﬁrst investigations of
the Orange White Fly were made by
Riley and Howard, of the Division of
Entomology, and the results published in
1893. The scientiﬁc name Aleyrodes
citri was given the insect at this time,
and its different stages—egg, larval,
pupal, and adult—were described in de—
tail The subjects of life history and re-
medies were also considered in as thoro
a manner as the opportunities for the in-
vestigation permitted. The next in-
vestigations of the Citrus \Vhite Fly were
by Dr. H. J. \Vebber, who, as an agent
of the Division of Vegetable Physiology
and Pathology, stu'die'd’the problem from
the standpoint of the sooty mold which
follows the attacks of various honey dew
secreting insects. Of those insects‘ the
White Fly was recognized as the principal
pest and in his bulletin published in 1897
important experimental work with sprays
was reported and the two mOSt useful fun-
gus diseases of the ﬂy were carefully de—
scribed and their importance discussed in
some detail. Aside from the reports pub—
lished by the Department of Agriculture,
the Florida Experiment Station has pub-
lished two valuable bulletins, in addition
to the records of the observations on the
White Fly published in annual reports.
Bulletins on this subject have also been
published by the California and Louisiana
Stations.
The investigation of the \Vhite Fly by
the United States Department of Agri-
culture was again taken up in July 1906
as a consequence of the urgent demands
for such an investigation from Florida
orange growers. Five thousand dollars
was appropriated by Congress for this
work for the ﬁrst year. ending June 30,
1907, and for the work of the present
year $10,000.00 has been available.
These provisions by Congress have per-
mitted extensive experimental work and
the detailed results will be published in
bulletin form from time to time as con-
clusions are reached concerning the vari-
ous phases of the subject of White Fly
control. My purpose at this time is to
present a general outline of the scope of
the investigations at present in progress,
with a summary of some of the more im-
portant results thus far obtained.
The paper here presented is based on
the entire work done in connection with
the investigation, including that by the
various men associated with the writer
during the past two years, more especially
Messrs. E. A. Back and \V. W. Yothcrs.
LIFE HISTORY.
In working out any important problem
in econOmic entomology a thoro knowl-
edge of the insect concerned is of prime
importance. Successful control must take
advantage of the more vulnerable periods
in the insect’s life history, while on the
other 'hand a knowledge of the insect en—
ables us to avoid useless efforts. Studies
on the life history of the Citrus \Vhite
Fly extending over a period of nearly two
years, have reached a point where the
most important features are well under-
stood.
During the summer months the eggs
hatch in from nine to nineteen days, av-
eraging about eleven or twelve days.
This variation is quite remarkable, inas—
much as eggs deposited upon the same
day are subject to this wide range in the
duration of the egg stage. The larval
stages are even more remarkable in their
range of variation. Dr. Back has found
that the larvae hatching from eggs de-
posited in July will reach the adult winged

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 91
stage in a period varying from a little
over four weeks to a period of thirty-ﬁve
weeks, the maximum period being more
than eight times longer than the min-
imum period. The total periods from the
deposition of the egg to the appearance
of the adult in these two cases are 41
and 256 days respectively. In other
words, eggs of the White Fly deposited
by the adult on July 15 may result in a
few adult ﬂies as early as Aug. 25, while
some of the larvae will winter over and
produce adults the following spring as
late as the 20th of March. Our observa-
tions show that the adult life under nor-
mal outdoor conditions is about ten or
twelve days, altho occasionally an indi—
vidual may live for more than three
weeks. 'Egg—laying usually begins within
a few hours after the adult females reach
maturity and continues usually at the rate
of ten or II eggs per day throughout
life. As near as we can estimate the av-
erage number of eggs deposited by each
adult female under normal conditions is
in the vicinity of I00. In exceptional
cases, however, individuals have been
known to deposit more than twice this
number. Previous to these investigations
it has been generally considered that
adults deposit twenty—ﬁve eggs or less and
usually die in the course of three or four
days. If this were correct the destruc-
tion of adults would be of slight con-
sequence even tho accomplished incidental
to remedial work directed primarily
against the larvae and pupae. As it ap-
pears from our studies, however, the de-
struction of an adult even tho it has been
depositing eggs for ﬁve days previously.
will probably prevent “the deposition of up-
wards of ﬁfty eggs. This statement
should not be considered as advocating
the giving of particular attention to the
destruction of adults; but only as show-
ing the value of this when it can be ac—
complished in connection with spraying.
The foregoing facts concerning the life
history of the \Vhite Fly are simply a
brief resume of our records on some of
the more important features. A bulletin
will soon be prepared, giving full details
of these studies and showing their prac-
tical bearing on remedial work.
NATURAL CONTROL.
The subject of natural control is one
of more than usual interest in the case
of the insect under consideration. Its
exposed condition, apparent vulnerability
to attack by natural enemies, and the
high degree of humidity in the citrus-
growing regions of the Gulf states, favor-
ing the effectiveness of fungus and bac-
terial diseases, all give basis for the hope
that complete control by natural enemies
will be the eventual conclusion of the
\Vhite Fly problem.
So far the fungus diseases of the ﬂy
have been the most useful of the natural
enemies; in certain favored sections of
Florida, offering assistance to the orange
growers amounting in a series of years
to about one-third of a complete remedy.
The important problem in this connection
is to develop methods whereby thru arti-
ﬁcial means these fungus diseases can be
relied upon to give satisfactory control.
The experiments of the agents of the
Bureau of Entomology, while extensive.
and useful as adding to our understand-
ing of the nature of these \Vhite Fly
enemies, have not thus far contributed
anything of value as a satisfactory
method of this kind. The introduction
into groves of these parasitic fungi is a
comparatively simple operation under fa-
vorable climatic conditions, and is to be

92 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
recommended in all cases where they do
not already exist. It is a long step, how_
ever, from the introduction of these fungi
into a grove to the propagation of them
on an entirely satisfactory basis, and our
records and experiments have not as yet
led us to conclusions justifying complete
reliance upon the fungus diseases in any
section of the state.
The subject of parasitic and predaceous
insect enemies of the White Fly are be-
ing given attention in connection with the
present investigations. No true parasites
have thus far, been discovered, al-
tho efforts have been made to test the
parasites attacking other species of white
ﬁies, as to their ability to parasitize this
species. The known species of VV-hite
Flies in the United States number more
than seventy; and many of these are
kown to be held in check and prevented
from developing into pests by these min-
ute parasites. ,
The recent discovery of the Citrus
\Vhite Fly in China furnishes strong evi-
dence concerning its probable origin, and
opens up the possibility of discovering
natural enemies in that region. Pre-
datory insect enemies of the Citrus \Vhite
Fly are not numerous and are of no con-
sequence as far as observed.
DIRECT REMEDIES.
The success of direct remedial meas-
ures against the \Vhite Fly is largely de-
pendent upon concerted action among the
Citrus growers. Frequently several
groves form a natural group isolated
from other infested territory in such a
way that a local organization only is
necessary. In other cases concerted ac—
tion may be best obtained thru County
Horticultural commissions. It is grati-
fying to note that in several instances
organizations of one kind or another have
already been affected, or are planned,
with the object in view of conducting a
systematic campaign against the \Vhite
Fly.
Spraying is not practised by any large
proportion of the owners of infested
groves but as a remedial‘ measure against
the \Vhite Fly it is of considerable im-
portance. Spraying is proﬁtable when
properly conducted, but it is in many
cases impracticable on account of the difﬁ-
culty of obtaining labor which can be re-
lied upon to make the application with
the necessary thoroness. When applied
with care and in liberal quantities the
best sprays give results considered suc—
cessful by numerous orange growers.
The observations of the agents connected
with the present investigation and the ex-
perience of numerous owners of infested
orange groves show that spraying is
especially useful in connection with
the checking of the spread of the
ﬂy when it ﬁrst becomes estab—
lished in a grove or in a new local-
ity. In such cases money and time
spent in spraying will bring manifold re-
turns. It is evidently proﬁtable to spend
$100.00 a year on a single acre, if neces-
sary, in order to delay to the utmost the
time when it may be necessary to expend
$500.00 or an average of only $25.00 per
acre in controlling the ﬂy in a twenty-
acre grove. From the outlook it seems
probable that spraying for the \Vhite Fly
will continue to be desirable under certain
circumstances. The subject of spraying
constitutes, at present, a minor phase of
the investigations, inasmuch as it has al-
ready been demonstrated by the experi-
ence of numerous orange growers that
this can be practiced with success; and
inasmuch as other means of control are

either known to be more economical or
are in greater need of investigation. The
matter of discovering new spraying ma-
terials is not an important one since there
are several already in use, which are en-
tirely effective in that, when properly
mixed, all of the larvae and pupae hit by
the spray will be destroyed. Ineffective-
ness, in most cases, is due to poor
methods of application and failure to ap-
ply the spray in sufﬁcient quantities. The
report, soon to be prepared, to which I
have previously referred, will give the
results of experiments in spraying and
will discuss fully those things which are
concerned with obtaining the greatest ef-
ﬁciency from the practice.
Fumigation is far more economical
than spraying and at present can be most
strongly recommended for general use as
a reliable method of controlling the \Vhite
Fly. The principal advantages of fumi-
gation over spraying are: ﬁrst, greater
thoroness: second, less expense; third,
easier and less disagreeable labor. The
work of the Bureau of Entomology has
resulted in placing the process of fumiga—
tion for the \Vhite Fly under Florida con-
ditions on a basis such that Florida or—
ange growers will be able to use this
method more intelligently and with more
uniform results than California growers
have used it heretofore. The so-called
expert fumigators, relied upon in Cali-
fornia to estimate the dosage, are un-
necessary in Florida. The experimental
work conducted during january and Feb-
ruary 1907 serves as the basis for a bul-
letin on fumigation which will be ready
for distribution in the course of a few
weeks.
During the past winter more than
4,000 citrus trees have been fumigated
under the direction of the writer and his
associates. The complete results of the
past winter’s work cannot be obtained for
several months; but it may be said that
they have been most satisfactory, both
from the standpoint of the experiments
and from that of practical results in con-
trolling the \Vhite Fly. In one small
grove of two acres the results are already
so striking that it is very evident that the
treatment would have been very proﬁta-
ble even tho the expense were twice as
great. The results obtained in destroy-
ing citrus scale insect pests by fumiga-
tion, conducted primarily as a measure
against the ﬂy, have fully justiﬁed the
writer’s assertion made at the last meet-
ing of this society to the effect that the
beneﬁts derived from destroying the va-
rious scales in most groves are of suf-
ﬁcient value to offset the entire cost of
the fumigation, leaving as clear gain the
beneﬁts resulting from the destruction of
the ﬂy. The agents connected with the
investigations have been making careful
inquiry into the matter of damage in
Florida due to scale insects. Without the
aid of the fungus diseases and insect
parasites of these scales, it seems
evident that frequent spraying or regular
'fumigations would be necessary to pro-
duce proﬁtable citrus crops. \Vith their
aid the damage is reduced to an
estimated average of between ﬁve and
ten per cent. ,In some cases, however,
the damage is as high as ﬁfteen or twenty
per cent. of the value of the crop. while
in others there is no appreciable damage.
Usually the damage by the scale itself
does run justify the expense of direct
remedies, but the effect on them of fumi-
gations for the White Fly is an extremely
important consideration.
In addition to the foregoing main sub-
jects of investigation attention is being

given to numerous subjects of less im-
portance, or narrower scope. Among
these may be mentioned the study of the
effect of food plants, other than citrus,
on the efﬁcacy of remedial measures; the
study of the result of removing water
shoots from citrus trees at advantageous
times; the collection of data concerning
the losses from the ﬂy; and data con-
cerning the distribution. The results of
the investigation thus far indicate that
conclusive results can be obtained from
most lines of the experimental work in a
shorter period of time than is usually re-
quired for insects of a like prominence
and destructiveness. At the present time,
from the results we have obtained, we are
unable to predict the results of the efforts
to control the White Fly thru its natural
enemies, but whatever the results obtained
this line of work should be continued un-
til every practicable effort has been made
to substitute natural control for the more
expensive direct means.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—Do you have different
size tents, or the same tents?
Dr. Morrill—Tents for the largest
trees will do, if necessary, for the
smaller trees, but if a grower has one
grove of large seedling trees and an-
other of medium-sized budded trees,
it would be better for him to have two
sizes of tents.
Mr.—-—Do the tents have to be
black?
Dr. Morrill—That is not necessary.
Most of our work has been done at
night and after a little experience this
is not as objectionable as it would ap-
pear. It is much cooler, and much
pleasanter. '

Mr. What effect does the fumi-
gation have on fungi?
Dr. Morrill—So far as I have ob-
served, no effect whatever. It is gen-
enerally considered by plant patholo—
gists that hydrocyanic acid gas is not
fungicidal. I believe Prof. Rolfs will
agree with this.

Prof. Rolfs—It has no effect on
fungi.
Mr. At what stage is it best to
fumigate?
Dr. Morrill—It is best to fumigate
in the winter time, because at that
time there are practically none of the
ﬂies on the wing. As Dr. Berger has
said, there is no time when you can-
not ﬁnd a few adults, but there are
comparatively few in the middle of the
winter; too few to be taken into con-
sideration. Occasionally, there is more
or less shedding of leaves following
fumigation, but of the four thousand or
more trees fumigated under our super-
vision during the past winter, in no
case was the tree injured more than
was offset by the beneﬁts of destroy-
ing the insects. In one case in Man-
atee county we fumigated a tree that
was shedding its leaves from some un—
known cause, 'and I believe only ﬁve
per cent. of the leaves were left on
the tree, but there were trees near by
which were not fumigated which shed
their leaves to nearly the same extent.
Mr. How long does it take to
fumigate a tree?
Dr. Morrill—The tents are left on
about forty minutes.

I would like to say, in connection
with the injury from fumigation. that
there is some misunderstanding with
regard to this. owing to injury some-
times caused by emptying the contents

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 95
of the jars known as “residue” on the
roots of the trees after fumigating.
Of course, this should not be charged
to the fumigation of the trees any
more than we would charge against
the cost of spraying the injury that
would result from emptying against
the base of a tree a half barrel of spray
mixture left over at the end of the
day. Such carelessness must, however,
be guarded against.
Mr. What is the cost of fumiga-
tion?
Dr. Morrill—The cost of fumigation
for the average size tree, is about 50
cents. For large trees, the cost may
go up to $I.oo,_or more. But, as I
have said, it is better and cheaper to
fumigate than to spray, and spraying
will cost more in one year than a sin-
gle fumigation that will last two years
or more. The eggs of the insect will
probably hatch out by the middle of
December, and the best time for fumi-
gating, I would say, would be from
the ﬁrst of January to the time of the
appearance of new spring growth of
the citrus trees in February.
In connection with the scale insects
question, I would say that in one case
where we have made pretty careful
observation, we have been unable to
ﬁnd a single live pupae or red scale
in any of the trees in a ﬁfty-acre grove,
though in previous years they had
caused much trouble and caused injury
to the extent of several hundred dol-
lars per year.
Mr. In your cost of fumigating,
do you include labor, etc.?
Dr. Morrill—\Ve ' include every-
thing; the work, material, and the
wear and tear on the tent as well.



Mr. It seems to me the tents
should be mildew proof.
Dr. Morrill—That should be done if
it can be done without increasing the
weight too greatly. However, I know
one preparation that will do it.
Mr. Did you ever use sugar of
lead and alum?
Dr. Morrill—That is what I speak
of.
Mr. How much would it add to
the weight of the tent?
Dr. Morrill—It would not add ap-
preciably to the weight.
Dr. Inman—What is the size of the
tents you use?
Dr. Morrill—The largest tents are
about eighty feet in diameter, and
octagonal in shape. These are large
enough for seedling trees thirty-three
or thirty-four feet in extreme height.
Budded trees twelve feet high require
tents about thirty-ﬁve feet in diameter.
Mr. Mote—After you have thor-
oughly and carefully fumigated a
grove that is badly infected with
white ﬂies, do you consider that you
have done away with the white ﬂies
for two seasons?
Dr. Morrill—From our observation
of the groves we have fumigated, we
believe it will take at least two years
before the ﬂy will increase to the point
of smutting the leaves or fruit. By
fumigating it thoroughly every other
year, I'think you can keep your fruit
entirely free from smut, unless sur-
rounding conditions are unfavorable.
I refer to neighboring groves where
no attempt is made to control the ﬂy.
Mr. Does it kill the rust mite?
Dr. Morrill—It kills the adult, but
not the eggs.





## p. 96 (#638) #############################################

96 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. In spraying, how often dur-
ing the season is it necessary to spray
to get good results?
Dr. Merrill—Not less than three
times a year. I would recommend two
in the winter and one later on, about
the middle of June. There are no two
men who spray alike and good results
are dependent upon thoroughness.
The results from spraying would not
be as satisfactory as by fumigation,
but I believe, personally, that I could
spray a grove three or four times
a year and keep the white ﬂy from
smutting the fruit. The average or-
ange grower has to depend on care-
less hands to spray, and it is not done
carefully and thoroughly, and half the
good results are lost.
Mr. Mote—\N’hat do you think will
control the rust mite?
Dr. Morrill——-To control the rust
mite, you would have to add sulphur
to the spray.
Mr. Did I understand you to say


that one fumigation would equal the
results of four sprayings?
Dr. Merrill—Yes, sir. The four
sprayings in one season would not be
as effective as one fumigation, and
they would have to be repeated each
year. Fumigation has been done so
thoroughly that it was impossible to
ﬁnd a single white ﬂy on more than
two hundred trees, but absolute ex-
termination should not be expected.
Mr.—Can you fumigate during the
summer months?
Dr.Morrill—We fumigate very little
in the summer time, but two or three
weeks ago we fumigated some trees
that were heavily laden with fruit, and
while it seemed to cause quite a large
percentage of the fruit to drop, we
found that surrounding trees contin-
ued to shed their fruit, and altogether
the fumigated trees have not shed as
much fruit as the unfumigated trees.
However. it is not desirable to fumi-
gate for scales or the ﬂy while the
fruit is green.

Rep0rt on Plant Diseases.
By Ernst A. Bessey.
Afr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Owing to lack of the. necessary time
in which to prepare a more extended pa-
per I shall conﬁne my remarks to two
topics, viz.: withertip fungus and nema-
todes.
In taking up the ﬁrst—named topic I
realize that I am entering upon a ﬁeld
. well worked by our respected President,
but I am sure he will pardon me if I ap-
pear to trespass upon his preserves.
As Professor Rolfs demonstrated some
years ago and made known in addresses
before this society, as well as in Govern-
ment publications, various citrus diseases
including withertip, blossom blight and
tear-staining of pomelo, lemon spot, and
several other troubles are caused by the
fungus Colletotriehum gloeosﬂorioides.
Of course, not all cases of dying back of
twigs, nor of the rotting of fruits are
due to this cause, for other organisms as
well are capable of causing these injuries,
but in a large proportion of cases the
fungus above named is responsible.
Under Professor Rolf’s direction, be—
fore he severed his connection with the
Subtropical Laboratory, inoculation ex-
periments were begun, which have been
continued with some interruptions under
my direction since I assumed charge of
the Laboratory. These have demonstrated
that this fungus is the same one that
causes the blossom-blight, leaf—spot and
fruit-rot of the mango and avocado, the
tear-staining Of'the mango and leaf-spots
and fruit-rots of various other plants.
These investigations make it almost cer-
tain, furthermore, that this fungus is, if
not identical with, at least but a slight
modiﬁcation of the fungus that causes the
bitter rot of apples. We see, therefore,
that it is not a fungus conﬁned to but
one or two hosts in a limited area with
which we have to contend, but one of
wide distribution, and capable of attack-
ing a great many kinds of plants. I have
found apparently the same fungus on over
ﬁfty plants at Miami, some of them com-
mon weeds. This explains why, when
the weather conditions or other circum-
stances are favorable, the disease springs
up everywhere all at once, without any
very apparent center of infection. Fur-
ther complicating the matter is the fact
that the fungus is not conﬁned to living
plants, but will grow with great readi-
ness—I will not say equally well—on
dead parts of the same or other plants.
Often we ﬁnd that citrus trees dying
back from some other cause, e. g. die—
back or blight, show this fungus in abun-
dance on the dead branches, although in
this case the fungus has appeared after
the death or weakening of the tissues by
the other disease.
In view of the above mentioned facts,
we see why it is so desirable to keep the
grove clean, trimming off and burning
all dead branches, and destroying all

trash near the trees. Even this will not
prove sufﬁcient to entirely prevent the dis-
ease from gaining a foothold unless we
take other factors into consideration also.
One of the most favorable factors for
the spread of the disease is moist
weather, but since this is beyond our con-
trol it will need no further consideration
except to point out that by allowing the
trees 'to be planted .too [closely and to
branch too low, an artiﬁcial condition of
extreme moisture may be maintained in
the grove that is very favorable to the
spread of the fungus. In such groves
the disease can be combated only with
difﬁculty and cannot be conquered. An-
other factor that we can control to a large
extent is the condition of health of the
trees. My observations have shown me
that anything that tends to weaken the
tree makes it more susceptible to infec-
tion by this fungus and so reduces the
power of resistance that when it has once
gained a foothold it progresses much fur-
ther than is the case with a healthy tree.
Among the causes of weakness may be
mentioned excessive moisture, or ex-
cessive drought, starvation or overfeed-
ing with nitrogenous fertilizers so that
the new growth is soft and ﬂabby. In-
jury from insecticides and even from
fungicides may favor the entrance of the
disease, while the presence of scale in-
sects on leaves and twigs, or of lice and
mites, is also very undesirable. Many
of you have no doubt noticed the dead
areas at the margins of the citrus leaves,
sometimes occupying half or more of the
leaf surface—marked with concentric
lines of minute dots. These are mostly
caused by this fungus and will in a great
many cases be found to center in a group
of scale insects that have weakened the
tissue so that at that spot the fungus was
able to gain an entrance—a thing that
it does with difﬁculty in an uninjured ma-
ture leaf. On the other hand, any treat—
ment that keeps the tree growing vigor-
ously with a ﬁrm, hard growth, reduces
its susceptibility to the disease and en-
ables it, in the majority of cases, to
check the progress of the fungus before
very much injury has been accomplished.
One frequent source of entrance of the
fungus is through wounds—especially if
the tree be in a weak condition, so that
it may often happen when one starts to
prune withertip out of his grove he ﬁnds
to his dismay in a few weeks that he has
more of the disease than before, infec-
tion having taken place at every cut sur-
face and having followed down without
any apparent check from the pruning.
In a case like this, I would advise that
a second man follow the pruner right up
and spray the trees thoroughly with Bor-
deaux mixture within a few hours after
pruning. In this way the cut surfaces
will be coated by a layer of Bordeaux
mixture which will prevent the spores
of the fungus from germinating
and reinfecting the plant. If the disease
is not abundant in one’s trees and they
are in vigorous condition, it may not be
found necessary to spray.
Recently there have come to my notice
a number of cases where avocado trees
have been very seriously injured by this
disease. Three or four years ago a large
grove of budded avocados was set out
in the southern part of the state. The
owner fertilized it with a great excess
of phosphoric acid (18 to 25 per cent.)
while but two or three per cent. of am-
monia and three or four per cent. of
potash were applied. The trees did not
make any too vigorous growth and a year
ago this spring, although not yet old

enoughmto blossom much, came out into
excessively abundant bloom. The wither-
tip fungus attacked the ﬂowers and, the
trees being in a weakened condition, fol—
lowed down the ﬂower clusters into the
twigs, destroying a great many twigs,
many of the larger branches and, in a
good many cases, the whole tree, the fun-
gus continuing down the trunk to the
surface of the ground. In another ,case,
more recently, several hundred budded
trees were obtained from a nursery and
kept for several weeks in a lath shed be-
fore being set out. At the time they
were set out the man in charge noticed
brown spots near the bases of the cions
on a good many of the trees. These rap-
idly enlarged and ﬁnally girdled the trees,
destroying quite a large percentage of
those set out. In this case also the with-
ertip fungus was to blame, having gained
entrance either through some wound
made at the time the top of the stock
was lopped off, or through some of the
little lateral shoots that started shortly
above the bud on the cion, or through the
wounds caused by their removal. An-
other case was that of a little avocado
tree growing in very poor, rocky soil,
with no water except the scanty rainfall
we had last year. No fertilizer of any
kind was given to the tree and it made
a very weak growth, losing its leaves this
past winter before the new leaves came
out. It blossomed quite abundantly and
the fungus passed on into the twigs
and is now entering into some of the
large branches.
I have contiued my work on nematodes,
on which I made a report before the So-
ciey two years ago, and have a few things
that I would like to add. I have made
several extensive trips to determine the
distribution of the rootknot, and ﬁnd that
it is more widely distributed than any—
body supposed, occurring as far north as
New York, West Virginia, Michigan, In-
diana, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah and
California, thus being found in parts of
the country where the winters are very
cold, at times with the ground freezing to
considerable depth. It also occurs in Eu-
rope, Africa, Asia, East Indies, Australia,
New Zealand, Hawaii, \Vest Indies,
Mexico, Brazil and Argentina and
doubtless elsewhere in South America.
According to the reports of others
and my own observations, it occurs on
over 375 species of plants and if careful
observations were made wherever it oc—
curs, this number would doubtless be mul-
tiplied many times. Nearly all of the
large families of ﬂowering plants are
represented by plants that are subject to
rootknot, while even the comptie, which
is not a ﬂowering plant, is not exempt.
Of the cultivated plants, as I mentioned
two years ago, beggarweed, peanuts, and
velvet beans seem to be about the only
important leguminous crops that are not
injured, while among the grains, corn,
sorghum, wheat and rye seem to be
exempt. Oats, on the other hand, which
in all my previous observations showed
no signs of the disease, I have found to
be subject in certain cases. I have tested
further the effects of different fertilizers
on the rootknot injury. Those fertilizers
containing large amounts of potash I have
found to be of value in that they reduce
the amount of injury and seem to act—
ually reduce the amount of rootknot pres-
ent, the plants not only having a more
vigorous appearance, but actually show-
ing smaller and less numerous knots.
Kainit and Potassium magnesium carbon-
ate are superior to sulphate of potash.
Formalin treatment of the soil I have

found to be of some beneﬁt, using one
part of commercial formalin to I00 parts
of water; but it is necessary to apply sev-
eral gallons of this solution to the square
yard, and it is impossible to get the
ground thoroughly and evenly soaked so
that its use is entirely out of the question.
Carbonbisulphide, about a teaspoonful
poured into a hole six inches deep, at
intervals of about I 5 to 20 inches, the
holes being immediately covered with soil,
is very efﬁcacious, but is entirely impac-
ticable except for very small areas, on
account of the expense which would
would amount to $60 to $100 per acre
for the chemical alone, not including the
cost of applying it. I do wish, how-
ever, to report success with certain rota-
tion experiments that were conducted at
my suggestion in Denison, Texas. A
gentleman was very much troubled by
rootknot in his muskmelons, it becoming
so abundant that he lost his whole crop
in 1904. At my suggestion he planted
his ﬁeld that fall with winter grain. The
following spring, 1905, he sowed Iron
cow peas on the land, this variety, if pure
seed is obtained, being absolutely immune
to rootknot. In this connection, however,
I must emphasize the fact that it is
necessary to have pure seed, for I have
observed, and so have others, rootknot
in seed alleged to be Iron, though in the
pure bred Iron cowpea I have never seen
it. The owner of the land carefully de-
stroyed all weeds that came up among
the cowpeas until the latter covered the
land so thoroughly that all weeds were
smothered out. In the fall the land was
again sown to grain and in’the following
summer Iron cowpeas were planted the
second time; in the fall of 1906 the land
was again put in grain and in the spring
of 1907 was planted partly to melons and
partly to other crops. All proved to be
absolutely free from rootknot. Another
piece of land in which he had Iron cow-
peas but one year was found to have very
many less nemaclotes than before, but was
not yet entirely free from the trouble.
Regarding the methods of introduction
and spread of this nematode, my observa-
tions lead me to believe that to a large
extent nursery stock has been responsible
for the introduction. Once introduced in-
to a man’s farm, the disease is easily
spread by his tools or the dirt clinging
to his feet or the feet of his animals, and
even by washing rains. If the proper pre-
cautions were taken on new land that
had never been cultivated before to use
only clean tools and to see that the horses,
wagons and plows did not bring dirt with
them, the disease would not prove serious.
When once introduced, however, it does
not take very long, if susceptible crops
are grown, for it to become thoroughly
established and injurious, .for from the
time that the egg is laid until the mature
worm is laying eggs herself‘is only about
four weeks, and one worm is able to lay
from 400 to 500 eggs. ,

SCALY BARK DISEASE OF CITRUS.
By H. S. Fawcett.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Scaly bark, a recently discovered dis-
ease of the orange tree, is becoming a
serious menace to many growers in that
part of Hillsboro county which is known
as the Pinellas peninsula. The year be—
fore last it was estimated that from 35
to 75 per cent. of the fruit in many old
groves was injured by the spotting due
to this disease, and this was in addition
to the injury to the limbs and trunks by
the killing of the bark. Last year the
disease was not so severe on the fruit.
Scaly bark has been known to the Exper-
iment Station for not more than three
years, and the Serious nature of the dis-
eaSe has been recognized for scarcely
more than a year and a half. According
to the older growers in the Pinellas pen-
insula, however, it has been known there
to some extent for many years. Whether
it occurs in any other part of Florida, or
in any other part of the world, I have as
yet been unable to determine,
About a year and a half ago I was del-
egated by the Experiment Station to
take up, along with other plant disease
work, the investigation of this trouble;
in order to ﬁnd the cause, if possible,
and also a practical remedy. When I
ﬁrst took up the work the older growers
told me that the disease was thought to
have originated near Safety Harbor, on
Old Tampa Bay, in what is known as the
Phillippi hammock. In following up
these reports I found that nearly all the
older groves in which the disease was
worst could be traced back as coming
from trees that had ﬁrst grown in a nurs-
ery owned by Mr. Phillippi. It was in
a large tree next to this nursery
as reported by Mr. Phillippi’s grand—
son, that the disease was ﬁrst noticed
at about the year 1860. These trees had
been planted about 1840, and were
twenty years old when the disease was
ﬁrst noticed. Just how the disease got
into the grove and where it came from,
no one knows.
As to the varieties affected, I ﬁnd it is
only serious on the sweet orange. Grape-
fruit is very resistant. Tangerines are
almost immune, as is also the Mandarin.
I found Tangerine trees surrounded by
diseased sweet orange trees, but could
ﬁnd no'trace of the disease upon them.
This disease has three fairly distinct
appearances on the tree:
(I). On the bark of the trunk and
larger limbs there appear roughened,
ruptured areas, in which the old bark
cracks and scales off with more or less
gumming, and a new bark forms under
the old; and this again cracks and scales
off in the same way later on. This ap-
pearance has suggested the name Scaly
Bark.
(2). Another manifestation of the
disease is apparent on the small branches
and twigs. Small lemon-colored areas
on the bark are ﬁrst noticed. They turn
reddish-brown, and the bark becomes
brittle and cracks. They develop quite
slowly, and scarcely ever appear on wood
that is less than nine months to one year
old. New spots form between the old
ones, until in a year or two the limb be-
comes girdled at some point. As the

limb weakens, the ever—present wither-
tip fungus comes in and kills it back very
rapidly.
(3). A third manifestation of the
disease is seen on the fruit, on which
there appear, usually in July or August,
faint rings. These rings slowly become
colored and sunken, while in many cases
the interior of the ring remains green
and apparently uninjured. The fruits so
attacked color prematurely, and many
of them drop before picking time.
About a year ago I began experiments
on a grove near Bayview on about 175
trees, with the view of getting some def—
inite information that might lead to a
remedy. It is too soon to report def-
initely on these experiments, as they
must be continued another year before
any conclusions can be drawn; but I
might say that experiments with Bor-
deaux mixture were made every two
months through the year, in addition to
other experiments of a different nature.
I found that the spraying diminished
the amount of spotting on the fruit to
some extent; but that where it was used
every ti-vo months three times or more
in all, the Purple Scale increased so rap-
idly that it was a question whether these
scale insects did not do more harm than
the disease would have done if let alone.
Considerable progress is being made in
learning how the disease develops and
spreads, and it is hoped that in time we
shall have worked out a remedy for the
trouble. Such scientiﬁc work is usually
quite slow. As you know, the die-back
of the orange was ﬁfteen years under
investigation before a practical way of
controlling it was worked out. The Fed-
eral Government has spent $30,000 to
$40,000 in the investigation of the blight
of citrus; and although considerable
progress has been made in ﬁnding out
the nature of this disease, no practical
remedy has as yet been found. In most
diseases it requires years for such investi-
gations. In rare instances a remedy may
be worked out in a short time. Profes-
sor Rolfs worked out a remedy for the
phytoptosis of potatoes in ten days, and
this remedy has never been improved
upon; but this is a rare case. It cannot
be known in advance whether it will re-
quire ten days or ten years to ﬁnd a
remedy for any given disease.

ORANGE TREE SCALE.
By Cyrus W. Butler.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I was surprised to ﬁnd myself upon our
program for a paper upon Scale, for hav—
ing sold my grove interest and even left,
temporarily, at least, the land of the best
orange, I had considered myself dis-
charged from the army of those who bat-
tle against the enemies of the citrus;
but I feel pleased to be remembered by
my companions of old and, being at pres-
ent in the land of that best orange, will
take one more shot at the enemy, even
though it is a “hot air” one and along
lines that have often been over before.
In approaching the subject, I do so with
a sense of incompleteness of knowledge;
but when I recall one orange grower,
whom I found killing lady birds, and who
offered me one dollar apiece for every
scale that I would ﬁnd upon his badly
infested trees, and again another who.
in advocating a certain insecticide, stated
that when applied to orange trees, the
scale could at once be seen leaving the
tree in clouds,—I reﬂect that there are
degrees of lack of knowledge of this, as
well as other subjects.
!,
By the word “scale, the Florida or-
ange grower usually means the purple
or oyster shell scale (mytilaspis citri-
cola), which is the only species that oc-
curs throughout Florida in sufﬁcient
numbers to constitute an important fac~
tor in the culture of the citrus, but is
not now so dreaded a pest as it was be-
fore its natural enemies had become
numerous, for we hear the oldest of
growers tell of a time when orange
groves were not only killed by them, but
the entire business threatened.
\Vith its life history most of us are
more or less acquainted, but all of us are
most interested in methods of making
their lives entirely historical, and I will
mention such methods as are known to
be of value.
These methods come under three
heads: ﬁrst, Prevention; second, Natural
Enemies; and third, Insecticides.
PREVENTION.
In the multiplication of scale, like that
of all life, food is one of the great fac-
tors, which the orange tree best furnishes
these parasites when the bark is soft and
juicy, with large pores, this condition is
most often brought about by using an ex-
cess of nitrogen, and most especially when
of an organic nature, such as stable and
hen manure. Even a moderate amount of
nitrogen of this class is almost certain to
cause an increase of scale, and quite cer~
tain to do so if used in connection with
clean culture, which by admitting the air
to the soil, causes rapid nitriﬁcation of
the ammonia present in the manure.
Also we remember how, after the
freezes of ’94 and ’95, the fast growing
sprouts from the roots of the frozen-
down trees were afflicted with scale
throughout the State.
As to the idea of this pest being in-
creased by poverty of soil and neglect of
cultivation, I must differ even with such
authorities as our much respected Hub-

104
FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
bard, as such conditions produce a close
bark, not favorable to scale; but what is
better proof, is that I have never been
able to ﬁnd any neglected trees that
showed any unusual amount of scale,
unless around some old barn or hen
house, where the ammonia may linger
longer than one would expect. Of course
cultivation will cause and increase scale
by increasing the nitriﬁcation of any am-
moniates that may be in the soil and thus
causing a more sappy growth; provided
the ammoniates are in the soil.
Any covering, greatly increases scale,
and this true, not only when immediate,
as in the case of spider webs, birds’ nests,
etc., but when the cover is much above
the trees, as in the case of overhanging
forest trees, and is well illustrated in
shedded groves. Also, in shedded piner-
ies scale abound in proportion to the
amount of shade.
In addition to the above causes, we
must admit, that at times we have a gen-
eral increaSe of scale, probably owing to
climatic conditions. _
For instance, last year we had a long
spring drouth, followed by a meager
rainy season, thus seriously handicapping
the fungoid enemies of the scale, which
are now very numerous.
But the worst of all attacks of scale is
that following the white ﬂy, the usual
dead wood inside of Whiteﬂy trees,
being less due to the whiteﬁy than to
the scale that follows them.
NATURAL ENEMIES.
Upon our Sub-peninsula, at least, I
would give the ﬁrst place to the black
fungus ( myrangium duraci), which is
well distributed with us; and, while it
conﬁnes itself mainly to the trunk and
larger limbs and does not become abun-
dant until the scale are also in sufﬁcient
numbers to injure the trees, still I think
it our best ally against the scale. I ﬁrst
saw this fungus some eighteen years ago,
in the grove of Mr, Moffet McClung, of
Dunedin, and scraping it from the trees,
got a mixture of fungus, bark and scale.
When my trees were still wet from a
summer rain, I'rubbed the above pow-
dery mixture along the upper sides of
such large limbs as showed scale, being
careful to work high in the tree, so that
the rains would wash the spores of the
fungus down the limbs. All conditions
must have been favorable, for every tree
treated got a good start.
While we have long heard of the white
fungus (ophionectra coccicola), it did
not appear in our vicinity until the last
two years, and was ﬁrst noticed in the
grove of Mr. W'. E. Heathcote, and is
now spreading. It works upon smaller
limbs than the black fungus, and will
thus supplement the effect of the latter.
Considering that it has been doing good
work during the past dry year, it prom-
ises well under more moist conditions.
As Cuba has one or two species of fun-
gus preying upon scale that I do not
think that we have, it might pay to make
some importations.
Of lady birds, the only species numer-
ous enough to be of value is our common
twice stabed one, which, like our lady
friends, are ever with us, and are ever
busy, both in larvae and adult form, de-
stroying what scale their stomachs will
admit, but (again like our lady friends)
are not quite equal to the occasion of ac-
complishing all desired results for our
good. Incidentally, I might say that inat
least one shedded pinery I found this lady
bird to be a speciﬁc for the pineapple
scale. The covering of this scale being

105
quite thin, the lady bird forces its man-
dibles through the covering and into the
scale, then drags it out through the roof
of its house, eating at times as many as
three scale per minute. Cuba has a small
steel blue lady bird that might be of use
to us.
While we always ﬁnd many micro-
scopic, but predacious appearing mites
running around among scale, I have
never been able to detect them in prey-
ing upon the latter.
Also, if hymenopterous ﬂies attack the
purple scale, I have never noticed it, but
have seen them clean up a tree badly in-
fested with' wax scale.
INSECTICIDES.
\Yhere man interferes with the bal—
ance established by Nature, he is quite
apt to bring about a series of reactions,
often unlooked for by him, and this is
especially true in spraying orange trees,
where the insecticide used not only often
directly injures the tree, but usually de-
stroys the natural enemies of the scale,
and the grower thus places himself under
obligations to do much work that Nature
would otherwise do for him; but upon
the other hand, where the grower is sufﬁ~
ciently informed, he can keep his trees
clean of scale and rust mites by spraying,
and without injury to the trees, but at
a cost justiﬁed only by a fair price for
oranges,
Of the most effective insecticides for
scale, we would ﬁrst place either resin
compound or resin wash, but the former
is apt to gum the pump: this can, how—
ever, be remedied by adding, say ﬁve per
cent. of kerosene to -the compound in
making and thoroughly incorporating
the same. Both of these washes, if used
two or three times during one season,
\
will show bad results upon the trees,
probably by gumming up the pores of the
leaves and bark.
Second comes kerosene emulsion,
which is rather less effective upon scale
than the resin washes, and is quite varia-
ble in its effect upon the trees, depending
upon whether the weather be clear or
cloudy and also whether the trees are
thrifty or not.
During clear weather the oil evaporates
quicker, and thus affects the tree less,
and a thrifty tree will withstand much
more kerosene than a hardened up one.
Besides, kerosene emulsion has killed
many large trees by being carelessly
made, the oil separating and being
sprayed upon the trees unnoticed by the
workman.
Third, and safest of all our scale spray-
ing compounds, comes the various pot—
ash ﬁsh oil soaps, often called whale oil
soaps. At the strength advisable to use
these soaps are not as effective as the
above resin washes; however, its non-in-
jury to the tree enables the grower to
use it so repeatedly as to thoroughly
clean a tree of all insect enemies, except-
ing rust mites, which for some reason
seem proof against the soaps, perhaps
because of their diet of oil; this can be
remedied, however, by adding some sul-
phur and caustic potash compound to the
soap. Many of these soaps are made
with caustic soda, which makes a hard
soap, while caustic potash makes a soft
one, which is to be preferred to that made
from caustic soda, for its fertilizing prop-
erties, if for no other reason, but again
it mixes with water more readily than a
caustic soda soap.
Personally, we have not sprayed for
scale but one season during the last
twelve years of our orange growing, and

that one season was after using Bor-
deaux mixture; but, needing bright or-
anges, we did spray with a sulphur and
caustic potash compound that not only
was effective on rust mites, but was al-
most equally so upon young scale, even
after they were partially covered.
Ever since we have been in Florida
we have heard of using salt around trees,
as a scale insecticide to be administered
through the sap, but have made only one
trial, and that on but six two-year-old
“trees, giving them from three-fourths of
a pound to two and one-half pounds
each, and for want of rain, soaking it
in once per week with water from a hose.
The salt did kill nearly all the scale; but
it also hurt the trees so that they dropped
most of their leaves, even when I used
less than one pound of salt; and where
I used the most salt, the small limbs died
back for a few inches and the tree was
a long time without foliage.
To recapitulate: We would say, ﬁrst,
avoid conditions favor-able to a multipli-
cation of scale, by hardening up the
bark by a maximum percentage of potash
and a moderate amount of nitrogen
from inorganic sources—preferably sul-
phate of ammonia, and avoiding any un-
necessary cultivation of trees.
Second, encourage all natural enemies.
such as scale destroying fungi and lady
birds.
Third, if justiﬁed in spraying and in-
tending to do so but once during the sea-
son, use one of the resin washes, but do
not use it while the fruit is quite small.
If continued spraying is intended, use one
of the ﬁsh oil potash soaps; and where
rust mites are also to be destroyed, add
some potash sulphur compound,
But preferably get the natural ene-
mies of the scale to work, and do not ex—
pect immediate results; for, while the
mills of the gods grind exceedingly ﬁne,
they are unusually slow, in the time ideas
of man.
SAN JOSE SCALE.
By F. P. Henderson, Gainesville.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The general subject of Diseases and
Insects has been so thoroughly and ably
discussed by persons more competent
than myself that I think it more proﬁtable
to this body that I give very brieﬂy my
experience with the San jose Scale. Per-
haps no one in the State has had more
loss by the San Jose Scale or succeeded
better in its destruction than I have.
In 1901 I planted at Arno, Fla., a 60-
acre peach orchard. In 1903 nothing
could look more promising, when the San
Jose Scale appeared in two or three
places. I immediately cut down and de-
stroyed the ﬁrst trees infected. But this
failed, as by winter several hundred trees
were affected. During the winter of 1903
to 1904 I sprayed all the infected trees
and all the trees around them with the
Lime-Sulphur Salt solution. This seemed
to destroy most of them, but during the
summer and fall of 1904 they spread very
rapidly. I again sprayed the whole or-
chard very thoroughly during the winter
of 1904 and 1905, with only temporary
results. so that by the fall of 1905 al-
most every tree in the orchard was in-

fected so much that three-fourths of the
trees died back to the trunk.
I had read the bulletin written by our
Honorable President about the destruc-
tion of the San Jose Scale by the Sphae-
rostilbe Coccophila or Red-head Fungus,
but I did not know how or where to get
it. But I succeeded in getting three or
four small pieces of what was told me
was black fungus. I put this on some
of the worst infected trees early in 1905.
I paid no more attention to it. At this
time I did not know the red or black fun-
gus when I saw it. Early in the winter
of 1905 I began spraying again and I
kept seeing trees covered with the red
fungus and I began to examine and I
found where the trees looked red the scale
was dead. I very carefully re-read the
bulletin and found I had the red and black
fungus both pretty well distributed over
my orchard, I immediately quit spraying
and wrote to Prof. Rolfs and stated the
facts to him and asked him if I could
safelv trust the orchard in the hands of
the fungus, and he replied I could: and I
have not used my spray pump since. By
January 1906 I could not ﬁnd a live Scale
in my orchard.
Earlv in the spring of 1906 I cut al-
most all the trees back to the trunk and
by the fall of 1906 I had almost as good
an orchard as ever. The Scale were so
completely killed that I almost lost the
fungus.
During the fall of 1007, during a long
spell of dry weather. the Scale appeared
in large numbers, sufﬁcient to do a little
damage; but as soon as we had some rain
the fungus verv soon appeared again and
destroved the Scale.
In May 1906 I introduced both the Red
and Black fungus into the 300-acre or-
chard of the Gainesville Orchard Com-
pany, near Archer, which at the time was
very badly infected with the Scale. The
fungus spread very rapidly and within a
few months the Scale were all dead, and
the trees put on a nice fall growth of
healthy wood_
In June 1906 I introduced both the
Red-head and the Black fungi into the
5oo-acre orchard of the Grifﬁng Florida
Orchard Company at Komoko, with the
same results and the fungus has held the
Scale down completely ever since.
During the summer of 1907 I visited
nearly all the peach orchards in the State
and I only found one orchard that was
not affected with the San Jose Scale. I
introduced the fungus in nearly all, with
the same results, so far as I have learned.
My experience has shown conclusively
that the fungus is not only by far the
cheapest, but also the most effective re-
medy for both the San Jose Scale as well
as the orange Scale.
After obtaining the genuine fungus, of
either variety, the application is very sim-
ple. Just tie a small piece of wood con-
taining the fungus, in about every tenth
tree, and your work is done not only for
one year but as long as you have an or-
chard. One man can make the applica—
tion on about twenty acres per day_
I very seriously doubt if spraying is
the best means of ﬁghting any of the in-
jurious insects of Florida. What we need
to do is to ﬁnd out through our Experi-
ment Station what the natural enemy _of
these insect pests is and .then use it to
exterminate it.
And here permit me to say that I do
not believe we, as horticulturists, appre—
ciate the work our own Experiment
Station is doing for our fair State. They
have redeemed the peach, plum and Ja-
panese persimmon industries from com-

plete destruction from the San Jose Scale,
and I feel sure that the orange industry
will be saved thousands of dollars from
the ravages of the orange Scale as soon
as it is learned that these same fungi will
eradicate the orange Scale. Besides,
they will yet deliver us from the ravages
of the white fly.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Hart—I want to again call at—
tention to what I consider the most
serious matter of all. It seems to have
been slighted and has been mentioned
only once or twice in an incidental way
in this convention. That is, blight of
the orange trees. I consider that is
the most serious disease we have to
contend with, and it should be given
ﬁrst attention. This disease is so bad
and so hard a problem that it seems
our professional men shy around it
and do not want to say anything about
it. We will have to hold them to it.
It is to them that we look for relief,
and without doubt they must give it
to us, if we get it. But, as orange
growers. we must help them.
Professors Weber and Swingle came
down here from Washington because
of the action of this Society, and if it
had not been for the freeze I think
they would have accomplished valua—
ble results. This disease never attacks
a tree until it is seven years old, or
older. and it requires expert study for
years to work out the necessary ex-
periments to locate the cause of the
trouble. Our professional men must
work the problem out for us. We. as
individuals. cannot afford to put the
time and study into it that it requires.
Now. can’t we take some action right
here and now that will bring about
more effective work on that line?
Our president has worked on it, but
he had a whole lot of other work to
do that took up his time, and although
he put good study into it, we have not
got the results we hoped to have. We
must do all we can to get hold of this
question of blight, and ﬁnd out what
the remedy is. If it is going to take
twenty years, let’s begin this year and
that will cut off one of the twenty.
The government is ready to help us
on anything that we need help on, but
we must ask for it; we must make it
known to those having these matters
in charge that we need help, and then
we will get it.
It is perfectly astounding to me that
year after year goes by, each season
we dig out some of our most valuable
trees spoiling the symmetry of our
groves, yet little effort is made to ﬁnd
a remedy. It certainly does a great
amount of damage. The best trees
we have will show blight, and then
they are gone. All you can do is to
dig them up, leaving great open spaces
in your groves, and plant anew. It
knocks off a third of the value of the
grove if you wish to sell. The buyer
won’t pay within a third of the value.
Now, we have here those who have
suffered with blight and those who are
bound to suffer sooner or later. It
seems to me that we should make an
effort to get good work started on the
matter, and we should begin where
Weber and Swingle left off.
Mr. Mote—I am not suffering with
it very much, but I am interested in
the subject. If Mr. Hart will offer a
suggestion, I think this whole body
will take it up.

Mr. Hart—I have been offering sug—
gestions, and have got the matter so
far along that the Society has en-
dorsed it, passed the resolution I have
oﬂered each year for several years in
succession, and that is about all we
have heard of it, except that Mr.
Painter conferred with Secretary Wil-
son at one time concerning it. The
thing for us to do is to press the mat—
ter as individuals. If our Secretary
writes to the Secretary of Agriculture
and that is all that is done, it will re-
main just as it is. we must pass a
resolution that means business, and
then we want to get right after it and
stir up those in authority and get the
matter before them and keep it before
them so that they will say as the
Southern Express agent at Savannah
said of a man who had paid express
at both ends of the line. The man
found out what was being done and
that express charges had been col-
lected from him and from the people
to whom he had shipped oranges as
presents, and he grew tired of it. He
started in and made such a noise with
no cessation that after awhile the Ex-
press superintendent said to the agent
at this man’s station, “For the Lord’s
sake; do something to stop that d——
man’s mouth.” If we can talk to them
'like that, maybe we can get them ,to
think we are in earnest.
Mr. Mote—I move that a committee
of ﬁve be appointed, and that Mr. Hart
be made chairman.
Mr. Painter—If you will refer to the
report of last year, you will see where
I made a report of this matter. I did
not trust the mails, but saw the Sec-
retary of Agriculture in person and
presented our resolution to him.
About the ﬁrst question he asked was,
“What are you people doing?” He
said, “We are willing to help you if
you help yourselves along any of those
lines. just now, however, all the ap-
propriation is used up and we cannot
do anything at present.” His intima-
tion was that they were willing to help
us, but they were not going to do it
all.
Mr. Rose—I would suggest that it is
necessary for the whole body as a body
to move in this matter. The depart-
ments will receive with courtesy a let-
ter from the secretary, but it is nec-
essary for us to act together. If you
will remember a little while ago, there
was considerable agitation about the
white ﬂy, particularly in the Second
Congressional District. Our Congress-
man was talked to by a large number
of growers and the necessity of action
being shown to him, he exercised him-
self and got an appropriation and sent
a white-ﬂy man to the state. Now,
in this instance here we have repre-
sentatives in Congress who are anx-
ious to represent the people, and it is
the duty of every member of the So-
ciety to correspond with his Congress-
man and the Secretary of Agriculture.
When it is known that a people re-
presenting the orange industry of
Florida require assistance in scientiﬁc
work. when it comes up in the proper
shape, it will be attended to. There is
no doubt but that after this meeting is
over. we will lose all interest; we de-
pend on the secretary or upon a com-
mittee for effort to be made, and the
body as a body does not support the
men who should be supported. The
thing to do is to show that you want
these things, make it clear to your

Congressman, and he will help you
to get them.
Mr. Gaitskill—I would suggest that
Mr. Hart get up a resolution to be
passed by this meeting, and the secre—
tary do as he has done—present it to
the Secretary of Agriculture. At the
same time, we, each and every one, get
our friends and neighbors and all to
write a letter to the Secretary of Agri-
culture and to both Senators and to
the Congressmen, asking them to see
that this thing is attended to. By that
means there may be something done.
It is the constant dropping of water
that wears away a stone. If you can’t
write a letter, write a postal card, but
let’s do something, _
I move that Mr. Hart prepare a re-
solution and present it to the meet-
ing, we pass it and put the matter be-
fore the Congressmen and the Secre—
tary of Agriculture in the regular way.
Then each and every member of the
Horticultural Society, and not stop—
ping with the members, but get all our
friends who are interested in the mat-
ter, to write to the Secretary of Agri-
culture, to the Senators, to the Con—
gressman from his district, and see
that this resolution is acted upon.
Mr. Hart—I don’t think that I could
formulate any better resolution than
that which has been passed repeatedly
by this Association, and I think most
of you remember what is in it. It
states our needs and states the effect
of the disease; it states the conditions
that make it difﬁcult to combat in-
dividually and without the organized
effort. and I think to just readopt it
would be all that is necessary. I could
not, on such Short time, undertake to
write anything near so good.
I think, Mr. President, that Mr.
Gaitskill’s motion is a good one, and
I second it heartily, only I am afraid
that if we merely pass the resolution
nobody will do anything. I would sug-
gest that we have a show of hands of
those who will act in the matter.
Prof. Rolfs—You have all heard the
resolution, and those of you who are
in favor of the motion, and who will
write to the Congressmen and the Sen-
ators as suggested, please rise to your
feet.
(Nearly every member responded
by rising to his feet, thereby promis-
ing to urge it on our representatives
in person or a letter.)
Mr. Hart—Now I am sure we will
get something done.
Mr. Gaitskill—I know that our Con—
gressmen are glad to help us in any
way; and if they are not, we can do
a lot to keep them from being sent
back.
The resolutions were adopted and are
as follows:
WHEREAS, The orange growers of
Florida are annually suffering the loss of
many thousands of dollars in the reduc-
tion of their fruit crop and still more in
the market value of their groves through
a. disease known as orange tree blight.
which usually selects the largest and most
productive trees for the attack; and
WHEREAS, Though the disease has
been carefully studied for many years by
very table Department experts, it is not
'yet well enough known to allow of its
positive identiﬁcation, in many cases, be-
fore the second or third year after its
appearance, while investigations pretty
surely prove that the disease is con-
tagious, which makes each diseased tree

others when caring for or working the
grove; and
NVHEREAS, Progress has been made
that encourages the belief that if addi-
tional help with special ﬁtness can be sent
here and allowed to devote their whole
time assisting in this select work, we
have reason to hope that the cause may
be found for it; therefore, be it
RESOLVED, That the Secretary of this
society be instructed to correspond with
the Florida Representatives in 'Washing-
ton and earnestly request them to call
upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon.
Wilson, and urge upon him the import—
ance of this 'work and the pressing need
-that we feel for further assistance from
his Department. Be it further
RESOLVED, That each member of this
society exert his or her inﬂuence as an
individual to secure increased appropria-
tion for this work and its more vigorous
prosecution.

Report of Committee on Fertilizers.
By E. O. Painter.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The most expensive form of plant food
that the horticulturist and farmers have
to buy is ammonia. Therefore I deem a
little information as to the different kinds
and sources of ammonia would not be out
of place with the members of the Florida
State Horticultural Society.
Ammoniates should be divided into
three different classes: Chemical, Animal
and Vegetable. The chemical sources are
the most expensive per ton but as a rule
are the cheapest per unit. Being soluble
they are the quickest available and can
be used to great advantage where quick
crops are grown.
CHEMICAL AMMONIATES.
There are some chemical ammoniates
that are high in plant food but are very
seldom used as a source in fertilizer
mainly on account of the small quantity
produced.
NITRATE AM MONIA.
Nitrate ammonia contains the highest
percentage of ammonia of any material
that is offered as it contains on an av-
erage of 38 per cent. This nitrate am-
monia is a byproduct in the manufacture
of high explosives and for years has been
thrown away as the manufacturers were
not appraised of the value of it as a plant
food. Recently 40 tons of these goods
were sold for $100.00 per ton. This ni-
trate ammonia is made by mixing and
neutralizing nitric acid of a high grade
with a good grade of aqua ammonia in
the same manner that sulphate ammonia
is manufactured. It is very high because
it not only contains ammonia from sul-
phate but also the nitrate from nitric acid.
As stated above this article has been a
waste product for years but is now bring-
ing the manufactures a clear $100.00 a
ton. It would be an excellent form for
the farmers to use if it was to be had in
sufﬁcient quantities, but as the whole
amount made in the entire United States
is probably less than 100 tons there is
not very much danger of the market be-
ing stocked with this article.
SULPHATE OF AMMONIA.
ISulphate of ammonia is another one
of the valuable byproducts in the manu-
facturing interest of our country. For-
merly the ammonia from the gas works
and coke ovens was all allowed to escape
into the open air but now it is caught and
combined with sulphuric acid producing
sulphate of ammonia, for the beneﬁt of
the farmer and mankind generally. In
making gas, the coal undergoes a process
of destructive distillation in the closed
retort or oven. This liberates the am-
monia which passes away with the gas
and is absorbed by water through the
scrubbing or cooling process. The liquid
containing the ammonia is heated and the
ammonia liberated by lime water which is
led through a bath of sulphuric acid
through a bath of sulphuric acid where
where the ammonia combines with the

113'
acid forming the white crystals, known
as sulphate of ammonia. The crystals
are then taken out. and by means of cen-
trifugal forces are dried and are then
ready for the market.
\Vhile a large amount of sulphate of
ammonia is made from coal in the pro-
cess of making coke there is a large quan-
tity made from bone while making bone
charcoal. The process is practically the
same as when it is made from coke.
The difference being that the bone is
used in the retorts instead of the coal.
After the bone is treated in this way it
is used in the sugar reﬁneries for puri-
fying sugar.
NITRATE OF POTASH.
Nitrate of potash is another very high
grade chemical and has the advantage
of not only containing a large percent-
age of ammonia but is very high in pot-
ash and this makes it doubly beneﬁcial to
the grower. Nitrate of potash which is
usually called salt peter is found in In-
dia, Egypt, Persia and Spain where it
frequently appears as a white incrusta-
tion on the soil and is sometimes mixed
with the soil to some depth. To extract
the nitrate the earth is leached with water
and the solution evaporated either by the
sun or artiﬁcial heat. This develops the
impure crystals which are exported as
impure salt-petre. Nitrate of potash is
formed wherever nitrogenized organic
substances decompose in the presence of
potassium hydrate. It is also manufac-
tured artiﬁcially by exposing to the air
a mixture of animal matter with wood
ashes and lime moistened with stable
drainings or stale urine.
The greater part of the nitrate of pot—
ash, however, is made from nitrate of
soda. The recrystallized nitrate of soda
is dissolved in water and an equivalent
quantity of potassium chloride, is added
to the mixture and the solution boiled
down. \Vhile the water is hot the chlo-
ride of sodium is deposited and separated
from the nitrate of potash which crystal—
lizes while cooling.
Any one who has ever seen nitrate of
potash can recognize it at once by the pe-
culiar form in which it crystallizes. It
forms into long six—sided prisms and
when freed from impurities is nearly
transparent and has a cool and slightly
bitter taste. Nitrate of Potash is very
soluble in water, the solvent power of
water increasing as its temperature rises.
While 100 parts of water at zero dis-
solves only I 3.33 parts, at 100 degrees it
dissolves 246 parts, -
Nitrate of potash is used for a good
many other things besides fertilizers. It
is used in the manufacture of gunpowder,
matches and as a preservative for meats.
The pure nitrate of potash contains 13.87
per cent. nitrogen which is equivalent to
16.84 per cent. ammonia and 45.31 per
cent_ potash as K20.
Until within the last ten years all the
nitrate of potash used in the United
States was imported. It is however,
manufactured in the United States now
in limited quantities by the sheep dip
manufacturers. It comes to them as a
byproduct in the process of extracting the
nicotine from the tobacco stems. For
years the nitrate of potash would settle
in the cans of sheep dip and became a
source of annoyance until a process for
eliminating it was discovered. At ﬁrst
this deposit was considered to be a use-
less product and a large quantity of it
was offered to the writer at a very nom-
inal price, which was quicklv accepted,
but he was unable to renew the contract
two years later when the true nature of
the goods was known to the manufactur‘

ers. Nitrate of potash manufactured
from tobacco stems does not usually an-
alyze as high as the imported article on
account of the impurities in the Shape of
ﬁne particles of tobacco that accompanies
it. It could be made as pure as the im-
ported goods by ﬁltering and recrystalliz-
ing but the increased price would not
warrant the increased expense. The to
bacco contained in the nitrate of potash
is not detrimental as a fertilizer conse-
quently the manufacturers have no
trouble in selling their entire output at
a good price without going to the trouble
of recrystallization,
NITRATE OF SODA.
Nitrate of soda is more largely used
than any other form of commercial am-
moniates because of the large quantity
obtainable and the fact that the Chilian
government several years ago instituted
a nitrate of soda propaganda which has
spread over the United States by adver-
tising and otherwise, information in re—
gard to the use of same.
All the nitrate of soda used in fertiliz—
ers and the arts comes from Chile al-
though it has been reported at various
times that nitrate has been found in other
parts of the world. On the high elevated
plateaus of Chile the nitrate of soda is
found in beds varying from a few feet
deep to 25 or 30 feet mixed with earth
and other foreign material. The mining
is a simple process of blasting the earth
and sorting it out and hauling to the mills
where it is run through the crusher and
dissolved with boiling water in tanks.
When the material reaches the desired
temperature it is run off into huge vats
where it crystallizes. It is then taken up
from the evaporating pans and stored in
immense piles where it is ready for sack-
ing and shipment abroad. The nitrate of
soda is left out uncovered and no ware-
houses are built for its keeping. There
is no fear from loss on account of rains
or dews as it has never been known to
rain on the plateaus and they are not
troubled with dews. If the case had been
the reverse Chile would not be giving us
this valuable plant food because the rains
would have dissolved it and carried it
down and out to the sea,
The use of nitrate of soda is increasing
wonderfully and will continue to increase
more and more as the people become fa-
miliar with its value. In 1844 there was
14,646 tons of nitrate of soda shipped
from Chile and in the year 1903 there
was 1,384,349 tons, the average increase
being about 50,000 tons a year.
There are two grades of nitrate of
soda imported to the United States, one
called the 95 per cent. goods and the
other 96 per cent. The former is used
more exclusively by the fertilizer trade
while the latter is used in the arts and the
manufacture of sulphuric acid.
ANIMAL AMMONIATES.
It was only a few years ago when the
present forms of animal ammoniates were
a waste product and it was a burden on
the producer to get rid of same. Now it
is a source of revenue that is adding not
only wealth to the producer but aiding
the farmer to acid to his wealth.
DRIED BLOOD.
It is hardly necessary for me to go
over the different stages that lead up to
the separating and manufacture of dried
blood, tankage, blood and bone, etc.
The enormous amount of blood that
comes from the slaughtered animals is
now saved and is used as a source of


## p. 115 (#659) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURALSOCIETY. 115
ammonia in almost every section where
fertilizer is used. The blood is run
through presses which extract a large
amount of the moisture and the residue
is put through a drier and screened. The
value of the blood depends on how care-
fully the separation of other materials
is made in the slaughter houses. Dried
blood frequently analyzes as high as 17.75
per cent. ammonia and it’s not unfre-
quently as low as 14 per cent. Dried blood
is one of the best sources of animal am-
moniates and is considered by chemists
and agriculturists to be ﬁrst on the list
of value as an animal ammoniate.
BLOOD AND BONE.
The name blood and bone is familiar
to the users of fertilizers but to the man—
ufacturers and trade the name is tankage.
All blood and bone is tankage but all
tankage is not blood and bone. In the
slaughter houses every scrap of meat,
bone and blood that cannot be used for
some other purpose is gathered together
and put into a large tank and cooked.
The cooking process is continued for
some time or until all the matter is so
broken up that the grease will ﬂoat on
top. The grease is then drawn off and
the residue dumped into large hydraulic
presses and the water squeezed out and
the remaining material run through a
drier, ground and screened. Then we
have tankage or blood and bone.
The value of the blood and bone de-
pends of course on what goes into the
tank. The more bone that goes into it
the higher in phosphoric acid and the
lower in ammonia and vice versa. The
many uses to which bones can be put out-
side of the use for fertilizer has made a
valuable market for same consequently
but a small proportion of the bone pro-
duced at the slaughter houses goes into
the fertilizer and the tankage now pro-
duced usually runs high in ammonia and
low phosphoric acid. The most popular
kind on the market now is what is known
as 10 and 10 tankage, that is 10 per cent.
ammonia and 10 per cent bone phosphate
of lime.
The small slaughter houses, however,
do not as a rule produce as high grade
tankage because they do not have ma-
terials enough to warrant close separa-
tion, consequently their tankage contains
more bone and less ammonia, usually
running 6 to 6 1-2 per cent. ammonia and
25 to 30 per cent. bone phosphate of
lime.
When the slaughter house managers
found an outlet for their waste material
they thought their troubles were at an
end, but the enormous amount of water
that was pressed out of the tankage found
its way into the city sewers and polluted
the streams, which soon called for a
change. This was brought about bv put-
ting in large evaporators and evaporating
the water that comes from the presses.
When this water is evaporated it leaves
a thick substance in the pans which is al-
most equal to dried blood in its value as
an ammoniate. It has a very objection-
able quality, however in not being “con-
sistent.” It will not remain in a me-
chanical condition any length of time
after it is made up, without the addition
of foreign material. From its stick na-
ture and tendency to dissolve and become
solid it has been called “Stick” or con-
centrated tankage. In recent years, how-
ever. methods have been discovered for
handling this concentrated tankage so it
is added to the other tankage and remains
in a good mechanical condition and makes
in every way a very desirable source of
animal ammoniate.

STEAM ED BON E.
Notwithstanding every piece of bone
in the animal that is large enough for
buttons or knife handles is used for that
purpose there is a large accumulation of
knuckle bones and bones from the head
that are put into tanks and thoroughly
cooked to extract the grease and glue.
This cooking not only puts the bone in
a better condition for grinding but it
also adds to its value as a fertilizer. The.
value of steamed bone depends entirely
on how the material is graded when it
goes into the tank. The average steamed
bone will analyze 3 per cent. ammonia
and 45 to 50 per cent bone phosphateaof
lime. “here the bone is carefully sep-
arated the analysis will average I to 1 1-2
per cent. ammonia and 60 per cent. bone
phosphate of lime. The latter is usually
termed degelatinized steamed bone.
RAW BONE.
The demand for bones by the farmers
has caused the ends of the earth to be
searched for this article. For years the
plains of the West gave up carloads after
carloads of buffalo bones. South Amer-
ica and India have also been the source
of large quantities of bones. These
ﬁelds however, have been pretty thor-
oughly gone over so that the supply of
bones from that source in the future
promises to be very small indeed. At
present the raw bone that is on the mar-
ket is made from bones gathered from
the small butcher shops and slaughter
pens scattered over the country. A car-
load here and a carload there, not very
much at any one place but all together
making a considerable quantity.
“'hile the raw bone analyzes higher
in ammonia than the steamed bone it is
not considered as valuable owing to the
fact that the grease and glue is still in
the bone. The grease retards decompo-
sition consequently delays the time when
the plant food will become available, For
crops that are a long time growing or
for fertilizing orchards the raw bone is
not only a good source of ammonia but
also of phosphoric acid. On crops that
are grown in 60 or 90 days_.raw bone
would be of very little use as a fertilizer.
GARBAGE TAN KAGE.
The demand for fertilizer of all kinds
and.the continued increased prices of
same has caused the manufacturer, chem-
ist and any one interested to be on the
alert for some material which would fur-
nish plant food.
One of the articles that comes in this
line is garbage tankage. For years the
garbage of the large cities has been gath-
ered and dumped into waste places, the
sea or burned. Now nearly all the up-to—
date cities have large garbage plants
where all the garbage of the city is gath-
ered together. The tin cans, glass, china-
ware, rags, etc., are all separated from
the kitchen garbage. This latter is put
into large tanks along with any dead an-
imals, spoiled ﬁsh and meat and cooked in
the same manner as the blood and bone
in the slaughter houses. The grease is
skimmed off and the residue pressed and
dried and we have what is known as gar-
bage tankage. This tankage is usually
low in plant food containing 3 to 4 per
cent ammonia and 5 to 6 per cent bone
phosphate of lime and about I per cent.
potash. The farmers who live close to
the city have an opportunity to get their
source of ammonia cheap, as the price the
tankage is sold at is usually below the
market price of ammoniates of higher
grade. It is also a cheap source of am-
monia where freight rates are not high
Whenever the goods are shipped any dis~

tance the freight rate makes the cost per
unit run up so the goods cannot be used
to advantage very far from the garbage
plants,
FISH SCRAP.
Fish 11 5 been used as a fertilizer long
before any other material. The New
England Indians were the ﬁrst to discover
the value of ﬁsh as a source of fertilizer.
They buried a ﬁsh at the base of a hill of
corn with the idea that the spirit of the
ﬁsh would enter the corn stalk and en-
courage it to produce a larger yield. They
were satisﬁed of this fact because they
knew that a hill of corn under which re-
posed a good-sized ﬁsh gave a more
abundant yield than when no ﬁsh was put
there.
The ﬁsh scrap produced now is quite
a different article from what it was ten
years ago. The old method of handling
the ﬁsh was so crude and the stench so
great that the factory was almost un-
bearable to all except those constantly
working in it. Their methods were
crude and the ﬁsh was usually dried by
the sun after coming from the kettle. It
frequently happened that before the ﬁsh
was thoroughly dried a rain would come
and wet it and the ﬂies would blow it
and it would become a putriﬁed mass.
\V hen this class of material was ﬁnally
dried and sacked it is no wonder that
the odor was not only penetrating but
very objectionable to anyone. Under
the present method for quick handling of
the ﬁsh and the quick process of drying
it. it is delivered in perfect shape with-
out an objectionable odor, no more ob-
jectionable than the smell of dried her—
ring.
Fish scrap is a byproduct in the manu-
facture of Manhattan and ﬁsh oil. The
oil is the ﬁnest article sought after but
the scrap has proven to be of such value
as a fertilizer that the revenue from same
goes a long ways towards keeping the
balance on the right side of the ledger.
Fish scrap produced at the present time
very seldom analyzes below 9 per cent.
ammonia and frequently as high as 12
per cent. So great has been the demand
for ﬁsh scrap that whale meat from the
whaleries has been saved and made into
whale tankerage or whale meat, which
like ﬁsh makes a splendid source of am-
monia for general farm crops, especially
where it can be applied and worked into
the ground. Anyone who has once be-
come acquainted with the odor of ﬁsh
scrap or whale meat tankerage can read-
ily detect it, not only when they are us-
ing it themselves but when their neigh-
bors are using it some distance away.
HOOF AND HORN‘ MEAL.
Hoof and horn meal has been used for
a long time as a source of ammonia and
yields in the neighborhood of 18 per cent.
If the ammonia were quickly available,
this would be an excellent source, but un-
fortunately it takes some time for hoof
meal to decompose and give up its am-
monia. The hoofs and horns of the
slaughter houses, after being steamed and
ironed out and the better parts cut out
and saved for the manufacture of “tor-
toise-shell” combs, the balance is ground
and sold as hoof meal. It is sometimes
mixed with blood and bone to bring up
the percentage of ammonia. For long-
feeding crops, or for use on moist land,
the hoof meal is an excellent source of
ammonia. It decomposes slowly and
there is no danger of its being leached out
by moisture, consequently it can be used
on land where nitrate of soda or sulphate
of ammonia would be a loss. On the
other hand, if it were applied on quick

growing crops or on soil that was dry
and inclined to be thirsty, very little good
would be derived from its use.
IEATH ER SCRAP.
There is always some one on the look-
out for something that they can put on
the market at a less price than the market
is paying and still give them a good proﬁt.
It has been known for a good many years
that leather contained a considerable
quantity of ammonia and it was also
known that a piece of leather will re-
main in the ground for years and the
plant would be no better [or its being
there as the ammonia was Fi‘ert. The
demand for ammoniates has caused a
number of experiments with leather to
be made and different methods have been
used to put it into marketable shape. This
has been effectually done during the last
few years. The leather is scorched and
pulverized and treated in different ways
so from the appearance you would never
recognize it as once being leather. The
nostril is the only means of detecting it.
Notwithstanding all the treatment you
give it it still holds the leather odor. In
some states it is against the law for
fertilizer manufacturers to use leather
scrap as a source of ammonia in their
goods and it is well that it is so. A man-
ufacturer who uses leather scrap can
guarantee a given analysis and the chem-
ist will bear him out in the guarantee by
showing the fertilizer to contain that
amount but the plant _w0uld be unable to
' assimilate any very large portion of the
ammonia. As ammonia in leather scrap
is sold considerably below the market of
other ammoniates it is very easy to un-
derstand why a brand of fertilizer can be
cheaper than another and yet have the
same analysis. \Vhile an analysis is a
good method of recognizing the value of
a fertilizer the true value is the ability
of the plant to utilize or assimilate it un-
der climatic and soil conditions in which
it is used. 10 per cent. ammonia from
leather scrap would not give the grower
of lettuce and cabbage one-half the ser-
vice that 5 per cent. from nitrate of soda
or dried blood would,
Q
GUANO.
One of the ﬁrst fertilizers used to any
extent in this country in a commercial
way was Peruvian guano which was ini-
ported from Peru. The ﬁrst deposits that
were discovered had been hundreds of
years in accumulating and were thor-
oughly rotted, frequently analyzing as
high as 12 per cent. ammonia. \\'hcn
this grade of guano was used on the gar-
den the results were wonderful as the
ammonia, owing to the long time the de-
posits had been there was iii an available
form. The demand for Peruvian guano
soon exhausted the supply of the higher
grade goods. It is now very seldom that
we ﬁnd guano analyzing IO per cent, am-
monia on the market. There are guanos
offered that analyze from 2 to 8 per cent.
ammonia, from 8 to 18 per cent. phos—
phoric acid and from I to 2 per cent.
potash.
At different times we hear considerable
about bat guano that has been discovered
in caves on different islands. This guano
when it is in caves that are perfectly dry
is a very valuable article often analyzing
as high as I7 per cent. ammonia, but
there are very few caves of this kind, in-
deed nearly all of them, contain more or
less moisture. When the guano becomes
wet with lime water the chemical action
is to free the ammonia, consequently it is
of very little value. Those buying bat
guano should only buy it on a guaranteed
analysis as one ton may be worth $40
while another would be dear at $5.

VEGETABLE AMMONIATES.
corron SEED MEAL.
Among the most valuable of the veg-
etable ammoniates is cotton seed meal.
This like other fertilizer products for
years was a waste product but now is a
source of~much proﬁt not only to the oil
mills but to the farmers themselves. The
process of making the cotton seed meal is
a very simple one. The seeds are
crushed and passed into a hot tank or re-
ceptacle and heated and from there it
goes into a hydraulic press where the oil
is pressed out and the cotton seed cake
is the result. This cake is then ground
and we have cotton seed meal.
The value of the meal depends on how
much lint is ground in with the meal and
also on the general condition of the seed
when they were ground. Bright cotton
seed meal will average 8 per cent. am-
monia when properly made but the in-
creased price of meal of all kinds has been
a great temptation to the mill people to
increase their tonnage by increasing the
amount of hull or lint in the meal. This
reduces the percentage of ammonia and
where the meal should analyze 8 per cent.
it frequently goes as low as 6 1-2 and 7
per cent. During the last few years the
demand for meal has increased and the
price advanced so the mills are not very
particular about making 8 per cent, goods
and are satisﬁed with 7 1-2 per cent.
The bright meal is made from the
short staple cotton while the dark meal is
made from the long Staple and does not
contain as much ammonia at any time
as the bright meal owing to the hull being
much harder and forming a larger pro-
portion of the hull. The analysis of the
dark meal is from 5 to 6 per cent. am-
monia. The dark meal is as good as the
bright for fertilizing purposes unit for
unit.
CASTOR POMACE.
Castor Pomace is now very largely
sold as an ammoniate and is made in a
similar way to cotton seed meal, that is
the castor beans are ground and the 011
pressed out and the cake pulverized. The
analysis of castor pomace varies from 5
1-2 to 6 I-2 per cent, ammonia with a
small percentage of phosphoric acid and
potash. It is considered a valuable source
of plant food where crops are long feed—
ers. This is especially the case in rais-
ing pineapples.
TOBACCO STEM S.
In former years tobacco stems were
used more largely as a fertilizer than
now. Formerly they could be purchased
at $2.00 per ton in bulk at the stemeries
and now their value is placed at from
$16.00 to $20.00 according to the kind
of tobacco. The nicotine extract has be-
come so valuable that the manufacturers
can afford to pay a much higher price
for the stems than the farmer. They are
considered a very good source of fer_
tilizer where the price will warrant their
use.
TOBACCO DUST.
In the manufacture of all kinds of to-
bacco there is more or less 'dust which
heretofore has been thrown away but is
now carefully saved and sold to the grow-
ers. Besides containing ammonia and
potash it is also used as an insecticide
and is considered of considerable value
for that purpose. The ammonia, how-
ever, of the average tobacco dust does
not exceed 4 per cent, and frequently is
not over -1 1-2 to 2 per cent.
GROUND TOBACCO STEMS.
The sheep-dip manufacturers had an
accumulation of soaked tobacco stems on

their hands which were very hard to get
rid of and learned men were put to work
to devise a means by which the nicotine
could be extracted and the remaining
stem handled without loss to the com-
pany. This work resulted in the pulver-
ized or ground tobacco stems that is now
on the market which is very high in pot-
ash and contains a good percentage of
ammonia. This was somewhat of a sur-
prise to everyone as no one supposed that
the tobacco stern could be so manipulated
as to give an analysis of 3 per cent. am-
monia and IO per cent. potaslr yet this is
a fact and today hundreds of tons of
ground tobacco stems are used and it is
considered one of the best sources of am-
monia and potash. It is easily applied
and quickly available,
Besides the information gathered above
we should take a lesson from what has
been said, not only from a fertilizer view,
, but from an economical standpoint. There
are only a few of the products mentioned
above that are not byproducts. The great
wealth of the fertilizer business is from
byproducts or things we are now saving
that were formerly thrown away. If one
goes to the slaughter house he cannot
help being impressed with the carefulness
with which everything is saved even to
the minutest piece of bone, drop of blood
and even the hairs. Everything is pre—
served to add to the proﬁts of the com-
pany. If our growers and farmers were
as careful in preserving everything on
the farm as the slaughter house people
are to save and care for the waste pro-
ducts, they would be able to live closer
at home and not have to ask the fertilizer
men for credit for his yearly supply of
fertilizers.

DISCUSSION. ,
Mr. Kilgore—I would like to know
if there is not a commercial value on
our muck beds on account of the am-
monia there is in muck. It seems to
me there should be plenty of by-pro-
ducts to render the investigation of
this phase of the question proﬁtable.
Mr. Painter—The problem has been
looked into, but the trouble is that
there is no main product that can be
derived from the muck that would
make the by-product proﬁtable. There
is about 3 per cent. ammonia in a ton
of muck when it is thoroughly dried,
but that ammonia is inert; almost as
much so as in the leather.
we are getting sulphate of ammonia
in a ton of coal varying from one to
one and one—half per cent. I do not
from coal. The amount of ammonia
think we can ever get any ammonia
from the muck except to use it on the
farm and let the ammonia be freed by
decomposition. Lime applied to the
muck will hasten that decomposition.
Adjourned.

SOME PROBLEMS OF FERTILIZING.
By E. S. Hubbard.
Zl/I r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In presenting this individual report as
.a member of the standing committee on
fertilizers I shall depart from the ques-
tion of fertilizers as mixtures to their ef-
fects in fertilizing.
The A. B. C. of fertilizers is well un-
derstood by all intelligent horticulturists.
The nature of the various materials, their
percentages and the proportions neces-
sary for complete or special fertilizers
have been fairly well worked out in prac-
tice but our knowledge of the physiolog—
ical effects and defects of their action
on plant life is in its infancy and I wish
to suggest a few of the problems that
have occurred to me on which exact sci-
entiﬁc knowledge would be of great value.
The primary elements of plant growth
are nitric and phosphoric acids. Nitric
acid to nourish and stimulate the life
principle and phosphoric acid to act as
a clarifying and transferring medium in
the interconversion of carbon dioxide
into fluid gums and sugars to the ﬁxed
forms of starches and cellular tissue.
These acids, however, are corrosive
and unstable. They can only be assim-
ilated as acids in a high state of dilution
in small quantities. They must be neu-
tralized by combination with alkaline
bases when they are gradually dissolved
or absorbed by the plant rootlets.
They are most healthfully assimilated
as nitrate of potash and phosphate of
lime. This is the ideal condition of plant
fertilization. The other salts found in
plants are either accidental or of small
tonic value. Unfortunately, however,
our soil conditions are hardly ever ideal
and we have to use many commercial
materials that must undergo chemical
changes either by bacterial nitriﬁcation
in the case of ammoniacal compounds or
of decay and disintegration in the case
of phosphates before they can be most
healthfully assimilated by plants and
there are several commercial chemical
salts one element of which is unnecessary
or detrimental.
In a state of nature the equation of
plant nutrition is self-regulating. Given
a soil with sufﬁcient mineral bases, moist-
ure and drainage, all the plant waste and
decay remains as humus to hold the ni-
trogen and other food elements and the
soil increases in fertility till limitations
of room, light and air deﬁne the amount
of vegetation that can flourish.
In agriculture and horticulture all this
is changed. Plants chieﬂy foreign to the
soil and climate are grown and the mar-
ketable products are removed, thus car-
rying away the stored-up fertility of the
soil, while the remaining fertility is often
still further dissipated in the air and
drainage by improper exposure and cul-
ture.
Here man, to continue growing crops,
steps in with artiﬁcial fertilizers com-
posed largely of unassimilable, unneces-
sary and even detrimental materials and
often applies them far in excess of the
plant’s needs or requirements.
The commercial results are then meas-
ured by the endurance or tolerance of the
plants.
I consider this the great unwritten

chapter of the agricultural chemistry of
the future, for which only scattered and
unharmonized data have been gathered,
the tolerance of plants for unsuitable
fertilizers.
To illustrate: Some twenty-ﬁve years
ago when I ﬁrst began orange culture
on my own account, when the spring
growth was pretty well matured, some
time in April, I dumped about four quarts
of brine from a mackerel kit near the
trunk of an orange tree that could carry
a box of oranges, as an experiment, to
see what effect it would have as a fer-
tilizer.
In a week's time all the leaves had
dropped from that tree and most of the
new growth was dying. It was two
months before the tree had got back half
its foliage again and the effect was as
bad as a severe freeze. This was a most
striking example of the tolerance of an
orange tree for chlorine and soda. I say
chlorine and soda because it is a well
known chemical fact that there are points
of saturation in common salt solutions
in which the chlorine and soda are in
very loose combination and there might
be some separation in the sap of a tree.
Some people have an idea that plant
rootlets have considerable power of se—
lection of the solutions with which they
come in contact and take only what they
need or is beneﬁcial. This experiment
convinced me plants have to take what-
ever is offered them in the soil water
and that plants with green foliage or in
a growing condition are continually sus-
ceptible to sap poisoning.
In the case of the orange tree and the
brine it is evident that as the brine as-
cended in the sap to the leaves and was
evaporated from them a point of satura-
tion or crystalization was reached that
killed the life principles of the sap and
the leaves dropped off.
In this most simple case a chemical
analysis of the leaves for salt and a com-
putation of the total foliage on the tree
would have determined the extreme tol-
erance of a tree of that size for chloride
of sodium. After the leaves were all
fallen there still remained the salt solu-
tion in the twigs, branches, trunk and
roots. As the fresh growth of twigs had
an evaporation function partly as great
as the leaves the solution was strong
enough to kill most of them also.
The solution in the branches, trunk
and roots being weakest of all had proba-
bly to be mostly excreted by the roots
and the solution in the soil leached out
at one-half the cost of imported nitrate
by rains before the tree could grow again.
This brings us to the root excretions of
plants.
Root excretions of plants have long
been recognized but so far as I know no
exhaustive experiments have been con-
ducted to determine their character and
effects. It is well known that many
crops cannot be grown successively on
the same ground without losing so much
vigor as to be unproﬁtable or suffering
from disease.
In my opinion the study of diseases has
drawn attention away from the speciﬁc
salts and humic acids these plants may
leave in the soil that are poisonous to
succeeding crops of the same variety.
' There is also, of course, the natural
acidity of some soils that is detrimental
to many crops unless corrected with lime
and it may be lime would be a good ap-
plication for root excretions. Lime has
succeeded in some cases where tomatoes
grown successively have been affected
with blight. Tomatoes will not do well

on very acid soils and lime is not a cure
for blight. An acid soil is not very de-
trimental to Irish potatoes, and stable
manure or lime favors scab, of Irish p0-
tatoes in Florida grown successive
winters seems to fall off even with inter-
mediate summer crops.
There are a great many questions in
plant nutrition that ought to be settled
and as to which we can only conjecture.
Rev. Lyman Phelps discovered that
an excess application of sulphate of am-
monia in summer or a spray of bi-sul-
phate of soda prematurely sweetened or-
anges. W inognadsky of Zurich, the dis-
coverer of nitrifying bacteria, found that
liquid grown plants would healthfully
assimilate considerable sulphate of am-
monia. The ammonia of sulphate of~am-
monia takes the place of an alkaline salt
like lime or potash combining with the
sulphuric acid.
\Vhat becomes of the sulphur?
sulphate of ammonia solution is ab-
sorbed by orange trees? Small percent-
ages of sulphur are found in the nitro-
genous protoplasm of the sap of the
plants.
Reasoning from analogy, is it not pro-
bable enough sulphuric is freed to have
a similar effect in sweetening oranges to
sulphuric acid in the manufacture of glu-
cose or grape sugar from starch?
There must be considerable sulphuric
acid excreted by the roots. Is a small
yearly application of lime to orange trees
indicated to neutralize the unstable sul-
phur acid compounds if they exist?
I found premature sweetening of or-
anges with sulphate of ammonia depress-
ing to the trees.
Nitrate of Soda—In an Irish potato
fertilizer experiment years ago on the plot
using nitrate of soda alone, the foliage
\Vhen
had a sickly, gray color and the tubers
a soapy taste. A recent German experi—
ment shows that grains and grass largely
absorb the soda of nitrate of soda, but
Irish potatoes, beets, etc., excrete it from
the roots, leaving soda in the soil.
Organic Nitrogen—The albumens of
organic nitrogen compounds in decay split
up into poisons similar in chemical com-
position to strychnine and morphine and
decompose still further to ammonia. The
soil must not be too acid and nitrifying
bacteria must be present under favorable
conditions of tillage, moisture and alka-
line bases to secure nitriﬁcation. Who
has not had plant roots burned by organic
ammonia?
Die-back and foot-rot of the orange
tree are often traced to the use of or-
ganic nitrogen and there is no doubt in
my mind that the trees absorb so much
of these decomposition poisons that the
sap is wholly or partially paralyzed, the
sugar, starch and wood forming func-
tions deranged and similar symptoms ex—
hibited to animal blood poisoning.
Phosphoric Acid—Experiments have
shown that a small percentage of the
phosphoric acid needed by plants can be
absorbed in its water soluble state. A
full ration of soluble phosphoric acid in
pineapple culture on the East Coast
spruce pine ridges is corrosive and
poisonous. There is little lime or humus
in these soils to revert or hold the acid
for root acid action. On the other hand,
I consider the partial sterility of hog ore
iron hard pan soils due next after their
acidity to the immediate iron basis re-
version of the soluble phosphoric acid of
fertilizers, so that quick-growing plants
cannot get phosphoric acid fast enough
to harden and perfect their growth.
Potash—Potash, besides forming a

base for nitric acid before entering the
plant also forms a base for the plant's
organic acids after being separated by
the sap from the nitric acid and is carried
along till it ﬁnally forms part of the
plant's tissues. Impure nitrate of potash
can be bought as fertilizer, but the sup—
ply is limited. It leaches so rapidly as
to be desirable only for fractional appli-
cations.
Nitrate of potash can be formed by
mixing heated solutions of nitrate of soda
and muriate of potash and recrystallizing
the resulting nitrate of potash and
chloride of sodium. It would be a boon
to horticulture if this could be done with
little increase in cost. We need informa-
tion as to the effects of the sulphuric
acid and chlorine of sulphate and muriate
of potash both before and after nitriﬁca-
tion.
The cheap nitrate of the future prom-
ises to be the electrolytic nitrate of lime. It
is said a 20,000 horse water power will
soon be used for this purpose in Sweden,
and that nitrate of lime can be produced
of soda. Experiments on the efﬁciency
of these new lime nitrogens are being con-
ducted in Germany with results averag-
ing about the same as nitrate of soda and
sulphate of ammonia. There is no doubt
moderate quantities of nitrate of lime can
be healthfully appropriated by most
plants and that its use will open up new
problems in plant nutrition.
In this paper I have touched on only
a few of the more prominent problems
of fertilizing but enough I trust to stim-
ulate thought on this subject. There is
no doubt in my mind that we are entering
an era of soil and fertilizer specialization
in plant growing that in thoroughness
will compare favorably with the intricate
manufacturing processes of the industrial
arts.
By B. M. Hampton.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
For some reason unknown to me I have
been asked to contribute a paper on “Fer~
tilizers” to be read before this meeting.
Now, I can assure you I would very much
rather have sat still and listened to the
other fellow, and let him have written
this up. You have, or a good many have,
had a trial at this fertilizer business; and
while it is something that is vital to every
farmer, truck grower, and especially so
to those who make a specialty of Citrus
culture that I am loath to attempt to write
on a subject that is of such vast import-
ance to one and all. '
But, after all. perhaps I am not ex-
pected to tell what I know, or rather what
I might think I know about fertilizing,
and was perhaps expected to write about
what I didn’t know; but that would be
a still greater task, so I will strike a hap-
py medium between what I don’t know
and what is just possible I might know,
and what those have known before me.
There is one point I think you will all
agree with me on, and that is, it is one
of the most vital questions of the day.
and one that after all the centuries that
have rolled away since man became
a tiller of the soil, the least understood:
still we are gaining ground a little, a ray
of light here and one there, in time it
will become of much more of an exact
science than it is today. It seems strange
when we come to think of it that so little
was known by the ﬁrst settlers of this

country of the importance of fertilizer,
even of the three main ingredients, Ni-
trogen, Phosphoric Acid and Potash;
these three ingredients did not seem to
be understood at all by our Pilgrim
Fathers when they ﬁrst landed on the
rather bleak shores of the New England
coast. It must have humbled their pride
and lowered their self—conceit when they
had to turn to the Savages, as they
termed them, for assistance to keep from
starving; for it seems that a friendly
Indian came to their aid and show-ed them
how. not only to prepare the ground, but
to fertilize it as well. So here was the
beginning of “How to Fertilize,” so far
as the people of this great nation are
concerned. The advice as to how to pre-
pare the ground was crude and the fertil-
izing was then meager; but meager as
it was then, it was in advance of what
the colonists themselves knew: at least,
they had not been able to raise corn, the
great staff of life, even more so then than
now. So they were compelled to turn to
the aborigines and learn of them, so when
one Squanto, an Indian well versed in
the mode of corn culture, came to their
aid and gave them a practical lesson of
the land to choose, and how to prepare
it. then how to use the fertilizer so as to
produce corn as well as stalk. This may
be said to have been the ﬁrst practical
Farmers’ Institute ever held in America,
and it seems odd to think that it was the
Indian teaching the white man the art
of successfully raising corn on the New
England coast. Even at that day the fer-
tilizing question was of great importance
as it is today, for without the fertilizer
the corn was so slow of growth that it
failed to mature in their short season.
It was much in knowing what kind of
soil and where to locate it and how to
prepare the land, crude though it was,
yet it was vital to the colonists to learn
even this much, and even more so to learn
how to fertilize it; so you see the fertil-
izer question was a vital one then, as it
is today. The clearing of the land and
burning of the brush on the ground was
part of the fertilizing, but this did not
seem to be thoroughly understood even
by the teacher of the “Institute ;” yet he
did know it was necessary that the brush
should be burned 011 the ground intended
for corn, but the wherefore neither he nor
his pale-faced pupils understood that it
was the Potash and the Phosphoric Acid
in the ashes of the hard wood burned on
the ground that caused the grain to ma-
ture; but he did know it was needful to
burn the brush, and in this he was ahead
of the Pilgrims.
Then, again, he knew that ﬁsh was a
good fertilizer for the corn, and while-
he did not understand, as we do today,
that it was the nitrogen they contained
that was needed to give the grain a more
rapid growth, he did know and so taught,
that “no ﬁsh, no corn.” This latter as-
sumption on his part, it seems, was re-
sented by the settlers at ﬁrst, but after
failing they were glad to take the advice
from this ﬁrst Institute and Experiment
Station Instructor. So Squanto taught
them to fertilize the hill for the corn with
a couple of ﬁsh, ﬁrst placing the ﬁsh in
the soil, then covering it with dirt, then
to drop the corn and cover with the ﬁne
soil, then to ﬁrm the soil with the foot
and the operation was completed, and in
due time the harvest, and thus ended the
ﬁrst Institute. '
And so the colonists thus had learned
all there was to be learned in the art of
fertilizing and growing corn: but once
more they had to go to the Experiment

Station to ask for further information as
to the cause of their once proliﬁc ﬁelds
failing to bring forth their usual yield
of the precious grain; and once more
Squanto came to their rescue and proved
equal to the occasion after hearing their
story. He held another Practical Insti-
tute, showing them that though they put
an extra quantity of ﬁsh in the hill for
the corn, and though they still had ﬁne
stalks but no corn, that the land was worn
out as we say today, and they must
clear new land, burn the brush as before,
drop their ﬁsh and corn as before and
all would be well. This they seemed loath
to believe, but they had but one experi—
ment station to go to to get information
that was so vital to their very existence,
and so they started anew as before, and—
lo l—Squanto was right, as at ﬁrst, just
as our Experiment Station should be to-
day. It must have been humiliating in
the extreme to the Pilgrims to get their
information from such a source, but they
must learn or starve.
But time rolled on and the Pilgrims
taught their instructor; for they noticed
that the corn was always the best where
there had been the most ashes left on the
ground near some large brush-heap; this
gave them an idea perhaps, after all, it
was just the ashes, as they had learned
from the Indians that a ﬁeld worn out
would be as good as new after it had
been allowed to grow up again with a
young growth of timber, this in turn cut'
down and burned as before, and presto!
the land yielded crops as before, with the
aid of the ﬁsh to supply the nitrogen.
When they ﬁrst noticed the fact that the
corn was the best near where an extra
large brush-heap had been burned, that
was a step forward in the art of fertiliz-
ing; the next step was to save the ashes
from their log piles and from chimney cor-
ners, and in the following spring these
ashes were applied to their worn-out land
and the usual amount of ﬁsh to each hill,
when—lol—a better crop of corn than
they had grown at the start was produced
on this worn-out ﬁeld by applying Nitro-
gen in the form of ﬁsh, Phosphoric Acid
and Potash in the form of hard-wood
ashes, and thus a long step in advance
in fertilizing had been made. But neither
the colonists nor the Indians knew the
why or wherefore; they knew such was
the fact and so were content. So for a
long period but little advance was made
in the art of fertilizing as a science, that
is, in furnishing the crops with the com—
mercial fertilizer as we know it today.
But some ﬁfty years ago or so an awak-
ening seemed to take place, then came
Guano, Bone Meal, and such like. more
into general use. I remember quite well
when both were introduced in my im-
mediate neighborhood in Pennsylvania.
Lime and Plaster had long been used in
a haphazard way; I don’t think any of
the farmers of those days had little, if
any, idea why they used Lime, Guano,
Fishescrap, Bone Meal, etc.
They knew, like Squanto, that such
and such things gave certain results, and
I think that was about all there was to
it; but the use of these various ingredi-
ents showed they were feeling their way,
slowly but surely, so that in the last
twenty-ﬁve years there has been a tre-
mendous awakening, until today the art
of fertilizing is becoming more of a
science, not an exact one by any means.
but far in advance of what it was a few
years ago. But we have much to learn,
we are just in the A. B. C.’s as yet so to
speak, and it is of this uncertainty that
I hesitated to produce this paper before

this assembly of progressive farmers and
fruit growers today.
Had I been called on twelve or ﬁfteen
years ago to write this article, I would
have given vastly more information on
the art of fertilizing than I can today,
at least I thought so. If you want to
know just how to fertilize an orange
grove for any purpose under the sun, al-
ways go to some novice, some one that
has not been in the business more than
ﬁve or six years, and you can generally
ﬁnd out just what you have been striving
for all these years to learn; rank ignor-
ance on your part. But in a few years
go to this same person and broach the
subject, and he is mute as a clam.
Squanto and the Pilgrim Fathers would
be outclassed by him for a lack of exact
information, and yet he is learning.
I very much doubt if we could ﬁnd half
a dozen in this house who could agree
as to the exact way to treat a grove for
the best results; some would stand out
for a clean culture the year round, and
others seem to think to get best results
from your grove and from the commer—
cial fertilizer applied there is nothing
like Humus.
stand for all decaying vegetable matter in
the soil; to my way of reasoning it is the
storehouse of Nitrogen, one of the most
expensive and most necessary of all plant
foods. It contains the food upon which
the soil organisms live, whose function is
to convert organic nitrogen into nitrates
in order to be available for the use of
plants. It even assists in decomposing
the mineral constituents of the soil, thus
making them available for plant food. It
serves to increase the drouth-resisting
power of sandy soils; it also conserves
the fertilizer we apply to the soil and
holds them within reach of plant life to
Humus is a term we under- ~
feed in; so I can’t help but think that
Humus is especially needful to our high
pine lands. You all know the history
of the grove of Dudley \V. Adams, how
he took an old worn-out farm and by the
use of all kinds of vegetable matter
changed the soil from a barren waste to
one of the most proliﬁc tracts of land in
that vicinity.
Of course, he added Phosphoric Acid
and Potash. Of 'the many ingredients
that enter into plant life, from carbon to
iron, none of them are so vital to the
average fruit grower as Nitrogen, Phos-
phoric Acid and Potash. I wish our
experiment stations would go to work
and analyze a box of oranges, for instance
grown on the average sandy soil in Flor-
ida, and let us know in plain English just
how many pounds of Nitrogen, Phos-
phoric Acid and Potash that box con-
tains; give it to us in plain ﬁgures in the
pounds and ounces, so those not versed
in chemistry may understand at a glance
just what that box contains. Don’t carry
out the analysis in the hundredths and
thousandths of parts, but just say a box
contains so many pounds or so many
ounces of each ingredient, without any
technicalities attached to it at all; then
send this broadcast over the state, and a
long step will be made in the art of citrus
culture. I well remember when I was in
the West, engaged more or less in the
mining business. I used to analyze the
different samples of rock for myself and
others. Now, it would have been useless
for me to have given an analysis as a
rule of a sample of rock in the technical
terms that I used in the ofﬁce.
What they wanted to know and paid
for was to ﬁnd out just how much of the
valuable minerals the rock contained, and
wanted that in dollars and cents, or in

pounds and ounces, as the case might be.
I very much doubt if I could make out
one of my own certiﬁcates today as I took
them down in my book at the time. So
now let the Experiment Station give us
one, two or three analyses of a box of
citrus fruit from different sections of the
state, grown on different soils and, as I
said, give it to us in plain English; just
say right out: box No. I, for instance,
contains so many pounds and ounces of
each of the ingredients, then we will
know what we are doing.
We will know for every box of oranges
we expect to get from a tree we must ap-
ply to the soil so much Nitrogen. Phos-
phoric Acid and so much Potash. Of
course, we must give the soil enough to
supply not only the fruit, but the natural
growth of the tree as well. After we
have learned just how much to apply. we
can soon ﬁnd out when to apply it. I
used to think I knew just what to apply
to make my fruit small or large, sweet
or sour. or to make it bright or other-
wise. I am not so sure now, so we will
pass that by.
Again, as to the time when to apply,
if the season is normal I prefer November
for the fall application, and of late I have
been using a fertilizer heavy in Phos-
phoric Acid and Potash, with a low per
cent. in Ammonia: in the fall this has
given me quite satisfactory results. But
so many questions spring up that I am
loath to set any cast-iron rule. But if I
were going to apply it myself, little and
often, ﬁrst when the tree seemed to need
it; but if I were going to hire it done,
and only give one application, then I
should give it in November. For one
application, I think, this would give the
best satisfaction.
Here in South Florida, if you apply
the fertilizer much earlier and weather
continues warm, the trees are likely to
start to grow and in the end cause an
injury. Farther north it might be ap-
plied earlier, but as I said before, there
are so many sides to this question that it
is hard to give any iron-bound rule that
will apply to every section or locality. The
seasons often are so different that what
would suit one year might not the next;
then again there is so much we don't
know for sure, as intimated at ﬁrst; we
are just in the a b c department as to-
fertilizers and fertilizing. But I must
draw this, to me, interesting subject to
a close, and yet I have just begun. But
the time is precious. You notice I have
departed somewhat from the beaten track
usually followed on this subject and gone
out into the by-ways, so to speak, think-
ing a little variety might not be amiss to
one and all.
I am like the Pilgrim Fathers, Still
seeking light on this most vital question-
up before the American farmer and fruit
grower of today.
So, thanking you for your kind atten-
tion, I am sincerely yours, seeking for
more exact knowledge on this subject.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 129
By Mrs. Nettie M. G. Prange.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am assured it is the wish of the
Society to have a plain talk on fertilizer
and its value, by a beginner, to those
even newer to the work, so I will make
no excuses, but gladly relate my humble
experience.
When I decided to make a grove I
wrote to several prominent orange grow-
ers to ascertain which was, in their opin-
ion, the best nursery in the state. In
the spring I engaged the best trees in,
that nursery, to be delivered the next fall.
My land lay beside a ﬂourishing grove,
so I thought, after securing my trees
properly, I had settled all vexing ques-
tions, for, of course, all good groves
were made with "Smith’s" fertilizer.
A valued correspondent w r o t e :
“Though ‘Smith’s’ fertilizer is good, he
asks more per unit of plant food than
‘Brown’ does.” About all I understood
of this sentence was that there might be
a chance to save some money; and you
know that idea appeals to any of us. But,
was “Brown’s” fertilizer as good? I felt
the need of being able to judge for my-
self. My ﬁrst step was to take prices
from a list of agricultural chemicals, and
get cost of contents in the two formulae
under discussion. I struck all the av-
erages, ﬁnding price per pound of each
ingredient, and worked it all out in reg-
ular schoolma’am- fashion. The ﬁgures
showed my correspondent to be right, but
for further information I submitted the
work to a person experienced in that line.
I do not begrudge his quiet smile, for he
wrote me the kindest of letters, tell—
ing me the easy way to reckon fertilizer
values, and many other things of interest
and importance. Neither do I begrudge
the work I did. Try it yourselves and you
will see it is just what one needs to make
him realize that fertilizer is not just fer—
tilizer!
\Vhen one sees it is a combination of
plant foods, mixed in stated proportions;
that three of these nutrients, ammonia,
phosphoric acid, and potash, have a mar-
ket value, and only these three; and that
the name of Smith, Brown or Jones has
nothing to do with it beyond his relia-
bility as to work and materials, and that,
as we shall see later on. we do not have
to trust him very far even in this—one
next wonders which of the numerous
formulae presented is best suited to his
purpose. ‘This calls for a knowledge of
the effects of the different plant foods .
There are many good books on this
subject for sale, but I will speak only of
those to be had for the asking, though
I am to append a list of the others I have
found useful.
Send to German Kali Works, 93 Nas-
sau Street, New York, for their “Orange
Culture,” and then for the other dainty
booklets listed in it. Peruse carefully the
pamphlets from all the fertilizer ﬁrms.
There is something to be learned in every
one. To be sure, one must always bear
in mind, the ﬁrms issue these books to
sell their goods, and while all presented
may be facts. yet each emphasizes that
fact which is to its own interest; also
remember, no law controls these state-
ments, and if a company wants to mis-
represent its goods in the pamphlets, it
can do so. It is the tag on the fertilizer
that has to tell the truth.

on the monthly mailing list. Also to the
Experiment Station, Gainesville, Fla., for
a list of the publications issued from
there, and to the Commissioner of Agri-
culture, Tallahassee, Fla., for the Quar-
terly Bulletins sent out from that ofﬁce.
I secured a copy of every availabke bul-
letin, circular and press notice, pertaining
to this subject and have learned from
each one.
From our State Bulletins, Nos. 22 and
43, both by A. A. Persons, we gain a
very good knowledge of plant food, its
sources and effect on different soils. But
they were written years ago and the pro-
portions given were based on chemical
analyses of the soil and the crop desired;
so it was a pleasure to ﬁnd in United
States Farmers’ Bulletin, No. 238, by
our Prof. Rolfs, statements of the effect
the different foods have on trees and
fruit, and other necessary knowledge. In
fact, it is a description of the citrus in-
dustry in a nut shell. While in Farmers’
Institute Bulletin No. 2, which will be
sent from our Experiment Station on re-
ceipt of postage, I marked on page 23,
in the interesting address of Chemist
Rose, his statement of the need of— ’
“Nitrogen to produce foliage, suc-
culent leaves, * * * and immature
wood.
“Phosphoric acid * * * to produce
mature wood in fruit trees.
“Potash to assist in formation of
starch and sugar * * *”
Later I learned farther that while ni-
trogen is most essential, it has to be used
with the greatest of care, for too luxuri-
ant a growth means weakened tissues,’
and weakened tissues are prey to insects
and diseases, organic nitrogen being es-
pecially likely to produce bad effects on
the citrus family.
Too much phosphoric acid may bring
about abnormal conditions, such as pro-
fuse bloom, or an over-supply of seeds,
and thus be detrimental to the general
health of the tree; while too much potash
may retard growth somewhat by harden-
ing the ﬁbers too soon; but the worst ef-
fect of an excess of either phosphoric
acid or potash is on the pocketbook. When
we pay for more than we need we are
out just so much money.
The discourses by Brother Painter in
Farmers’ Institute Bulletin No. I, and
by Brother Wilson in our Annual Re-
port 1906, are instructive; especially the
latter. Study carefully United States
Farmers’ Bulletin No. 44 by Dr. Voor-
hees. It is a thorough discussion of com-
cial fertilizers. I could name many
more free helps, but time is passing.
Without cost one can lay a good founda-
tion upon which to build the real knowl-
edge which comes only by experience.
“lhen needing help on any point, write
to our advanced brothers. They show
unfailing patience and kindness in
helping the weaker ones. Up to
the point I have taken the study
of plant foods in this talk, all au_
thorities are practically agreed. Beyond,
there is a great diversity of opinions of
those seemingly equally well—posted, as
to proper formulae and methods of cul'
tivation. It seems to me that this is
caused by different situations,-and that
we must each adapt the general principles
to his own need.
But we all have to pay for our fertil-
izer. Now we come to this:
How are we to know we get what. we
order, and which formula gives us best
value for our money?
The state protects us in this if we avail
ourselves of the privileges given. Our

worthy Commissioner of Agriculture at
Tallahassee will send you copies of the
fertilizer law and bulletins containing just
what we are looking for. The law al-
lows us to have the fertilizer analyzed
free of cost, so we need never be in doubt
of what is sent us; but read instructions
carefully and send samples for analysis
just as 'they direct. Florida is the only
state in the Union that gives this chance
for free analysis. The out-of-state fer-
tilizer companies have striven hard to
have the Legislature strike out this
clause. \Ve, as horticulturists, ought to
see that the law remains as it is. The
inspection costs us an exceedingly small
amount. I say “costs us,” for since the
fertilizer com-panies‘add the inspection
fees to their expense accounts, we, who
use the fertilizer, pay the bills, so why
should a company object unless it wants
to hide the true content of its product?
The honest manufacturer is protected as
well as the consumer_
If the statements on the tag are proven
untrue there is trouble ahead. Study the
tag and believe exactly what it says.
Don’t think “animal matter” on the tag
has to mean what is described in the pam-
phlet. It means “animal matter” and
probably the cheapest animal matter ob-
tainable. or the description would be
more explicit. Study the tag for all these
points and doubt any obscurity; for trade
does not “hide its light under a bushel.”
Well, if the materials are all right, let
us see about the formula. It reads: Mois-
ture, 8 to IO per cent. “Ah ha!” says
our neighbor, “Jones' fertilizer has only
5 to 8 per cent moisture. You must like
to buy water!”
\Ve tell him with a superior air that
one pays only for actual plant food when
he buys fertilizer; and never “let on”
that a few weeks ago we made the very
same mistake ourselves. Next comes:
“Ammonia, 4 to 5 per cent.” and we re—
member? that ammonia is sort of an in-
ﬂated nitrogen. Sounds like they give
us more for our money, when they call
it “Ammonia.” “Available Phosphoric
Acid, 6 to 7 per cent.” That’s the phos-
phoric acid we get. “Insoluble Phos-
phoric Acid, I to 2 per cent.” That’s
the phosphoric acid, we don’t know sure
whether we get or not. “Potash, Actual
K20, 5 to 6 per cent. H’m, this has it
all in “Potash, Actual KZO." Another
calls it “Potash Actual,” and another
“Potash KZO;” but we have found out
it’s all the same.
Those scientiﬁc fellows Would have a
good laugh could they look into our
minds and read our “translation” of the
formula; but so long as we understand
the meaning, our crude expression does
not matter.
Now, let us see what this ton of fer-
tilizer is worth. \IVC have learned to use
the smallest per cent. given; 4 to 5 per
cent doesn’t guarantee a bit' better content
than a plain 4 per cent.. so our formula
is:
Ammonia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 per cent.
Available Phosphoric Acid . . 6 per cent.
Insoluble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. I per cent.
Potash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 5 per cent.
Perhaps we “hate to ﬁgure,” but any
of us can turn to the State Chemist’s
work and read: “A unit is 20 lbs. or I
per cent. in. a ton,” and ﬁnd prices he
gives per unit.
Ammonia . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$3.30 per unit
Available Phosphoric Acid 1.00 per unit
Insoluble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .20 per unit
Potash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.10 per unit


## p. 132 (#676) ############################################

132 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Therefore:
4 units of Ammonia are worth. . .$I3.2O
6 units Available Phosphoric Acid 6.00
I unit Insoluble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .20
5 units Potash
5-50
The least plant food that can be in this
ton of fertilizer, legally, is worth at sea
board jacksonville, $24.90; and we take
. this value in comparing with other for-
mulae. But when comparing with the
catalogue price, we must remember the
analysis runs above the lowest ﬁgure,
really, and every ounce of plant food has
costrthe manufacturer and is worth mo-
ney to us. Then there are the handling,
storage. mixing and bagging, the inspec-
tion fees, the general ups and downs in
trade, and so forth. Don’t for a minute
think the manufacturer can sell the fer-
tilizer at this price, still he must not ask
too much, for now we know when he
claims too big a proﬁt and save many a
dollar by that knowledge.
But the ﬁnancial saving is the lesser
gain from our study, after all; for as one
learns he looks more and more to the
how’s and why’s, and his whole life is
broadened by the study of Nature’s won-
drous ways.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—I notice this lady
made a Statement in her paper that
potash Stopped growth.
Mrs. Prange—I do not claim to
know anything by experience. What
I have presented here is gathered from
authorities and experts on the subject.
Mr. Skinner—I might give you a
little experience I had in the potash
line. It was the ﬁrst lemon crop I
grew. I thought I would mature that
lemon crop early and get it on the
market in nice shape; so I gave it a
dose of high-grade sulphate of potash.
Well, my neighbors gathered and
shipped their lemons, and while my
lemons looked nice, they kept on
growing, and they grew, and they
grew, and they grew, and they grew.
I was not able to market them until
the ﬁrst of December, but I got a good
price for them. My experience has
been to Show that too much potash
makes late ripening fruit.
Mr. McCarty—In pineapple culture.
in the summer application of fertilizer
we do not use much potash. but
in the fall application we use a higher
percentage of potash. we ﬁnd that
the more potash we use. the closer the
texture of the fruit and the better are
the carrying qualities. It is said that
it hardens the pineapple, but I don’t
know.
Mr. Grifﬁng—The peach also carries
much better. We know that an excess

133
of potash for peaches will retard the
ripening. This we know by sad ex-
perience, as when we used too much
of it we came in a week or ten days
later than some of the orchards ad-
joining us. But potash does materially
aid in the carrying quality of the fruit.
Mr. Hart—My experience with or-
anges in the free use of potash is that
it has a tendency to prevent softening
of the fruit. _
Mr. Longley—My experience in us—
ing potash was in the fall. I fertilized
in the fall and didn’t think there was
enough potash, so I sent to Brother
Painter and got a carload. The next
summer we got the ﬁnest crop of le-
mons I ever saw. They were big and
ﬁne looking, and brought a good price
in the market. I think a good deal of
it was due to putting it on in the fall.
I also put on an extra amount.
Mr. In the spring, my trees set
a good crop of fruit, and I gave them
a good application of potash. As the
result, I lost nearly the whole crop of
fruit. A friend of mine said he had
the same experience. It was just about
this time of year that I put the potash
on; perhaps a little earlier.
Mr. Hart—“’as it a dry year? Per-
haps that was the cause of your losing
the crop instead of too much potash.
Mr. No, it was not a particularly
dry year. I saw no reason except too
much potash. The season was an av-
erage season.
Mr. Jones—One fall we had drops
to the tune of 500 boxes. They began
to drop in September. Somebody told
me what the ground needed was pot-
ash, so I got ﬁve tons of high-grade
potash and put it on the grove, which


was about nine acres, and the next
year I could not get a box of drops.
They were ﬁne oranges; clear and
smooth and ﬁne.
Mr. Did you put on in the fall?
Mr. jones—No, it was put on in
June.
Mr. Griﬂing—I understood the lady
to say that potash had a tendency to
harden the wood ﬁbre. Now, take it
in the growth of nursery trees. In the
early season we use fertilizer more
largely composed of nitrogen, and in
the fall we increase the potash very
materially, running up to eight and
nine per cent. \Ve ﬁnd the trees will
carry better and stand more cold
than trees that have been given more
nitrogenous matter. In the fall we
leave out one per cent. of the ammonia
and increase the potash three or four
per cent.

For the orange nursery trees, we
fertilize them in the early part of the
season, then give them about two
more applications during the season;
in all, about three or four times a
year, increasing the potash every time.
We fertilize the peach seedlings as
soon as they are about four or ﬁve
inches in height, giving a strong pot-
ash fertilizer in the fall, and it un-
doubtedly hardens the wood ﬁbre.
Mr. Skinner—Why do the formulae
run so high in phosphoric acid for
young trees? All the formulae run
very high.
Mr. Rose—I can only surmise that
it is a business proposition. The phos-
phates are the cheapest source of plant
food that we have, particularly in
Florida, and it is the predominating

material in all fertilizers, and is used
as a ﬁller. It is the basis of fertilizers.
Mr. It seems to me there have
been many conflicting statements
made. Now, suppose I fertilize this
year's crop; does this \year's crop or
next year’s crop get the beneﬁt of it?
Mr. Hubbard—You fertilize both
crops. That is, if the application is
put on before the fruit has matured.
The fruit keeps on growing and ma-
turing and the sap takes up the food
elements and carries them to the fruit
already on the tree. If you use a well-
balanced fertilizer, you fertilize the
present crop and also put in the foun-
dation for the next year’s crop.
There has been a good deal of ex-
' perimenting done since we have be-
gun using commercial fertilizers, both
as to discovering what constituents a
complete fertilizer should have, and
with the different elements used sep-
arately. It is generally agreed that
the ofﬁce of phosphoric acid in the sap
is to assist in the transference of su-
gar and starch to build up plant tis-
sues. I believe the general experience
in using potash alone after midsum-
mer or early in the fall after the trees
have stopped growing, is to increase
the acidity and retard the ripening of
the fruit. Liebig, the father of agri-
cultural chemistry. stated in substance
that after the alkaline salts had served
as bases for nitrates, they were used
by the plant as bases for the organic
acids that are transferred into the
starches which build up the plant.
Potash without nitrogen misses its
ﬁrst ofﬁce in plant growth.
Mrs. Prange—As I understand it.
it is better to start the growth with
the an'monia anl harden it with the

potash. My father's grove was af-
ﬂicted with die-back until he used
more potash.
Mr. Rose—In .the last few years we
have gradually increased the potash
until now we are using ten per cent.
in many instances. The method of
applying is the question. It depends
very much upon the condition of the
tree, the location of the grove, etc. No
two are alike any more than two cases
of illness present the same aspect to
a physician. Now, we have fought this
out at session after session ever since
I have been a member, and we will
never agree upon a general proposi-
tion. If a speciﬁc case were given
where the condition of the tree, the
season, the former treatment of the
tree. its present growth, and every-
thing known about that tree. it might
be possible to tell just exactly what
that tree needs, and when and how to
be applied. The general supposition,
as our Professor Hubbard has said, is
that potash is a vehicle for the trans-
ference of sugar and starch from the
root to the foliage and tree.
Mr. Longley—I have been fertiliz-
ing my trees in November, usually.
for the next year. and have met with
very good success. My trees bear a
good crop right along. This year I
fertilized in October. for the reason
that help is very scarce and I had
get my trees plowed before the or-
ange packing began.
As Mr. Hubbard says, he thinks it
retards the growth to put on too much
potash. I think it retards the ripen-
ing of the fruit.
Mr. Reaves—I fertilized with potash
after the fruit had set. the blooms had
shed and you could see little oranges.

The prices were good and we thought
it would be a good thing for us to get
some oranges in to market right away.
So we put on a good application, and
lost the fruit.
Iylr. Painter—That experience has
been had by a good many, not only
with potash. Some time ago, a man
wrote me that his trees had just put
out a ﬁne bloom and wanted to make
an unusually ﬁne crop of fruit. He
ordered an extra amount of fertilizer,
applied it, harrowed and worked it in,
and the result in due course of time
was that the young fruit dropped. You
can do that without the fertilizer if you
happen to have a good rain about the
time you do the cultivating. It is the
stimulating effect given to the tree
that causes the dropping. My experi-
ence has been that the orange trees
ought to be left severely alone during
the setting period.
Mr. How long do you consider
the setting period?

Mr. Painter—Until the orange
reaches the size of a good-sized
marble. Of course, up to that time
there will be a good deal of fruit drop-
ping on account of being imperfect.
Mr. \Vill the cultivation of trees
alone, without fertilizer, cause the
fruit and foliage to drop?
Mr. Painter—I have known of cases
of that kind.
Prof. Rolfs—I congratulate the au-
thor of the paper, which has brought
on more discussion than any other we
have had.

Controlling Capilliary Moisture.
By A. w. Blair,
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
When rain falls upon ﬁelds and groves
a part of it runs off to the lower places,
and a part sinks into the soil and per-
meates it. The amount which runs off is
determined by the condition of the surface
and the rapidity of the rain. If the sur-
face is hard and compact and also some-
what sloping, much of the water will run
off. If the surface soil is loose and mel-
low, and contains much organic matter,
it will absorb much of the water that
falls on it._ When the rains are heavy
and continue for some time, a part of this
absorbed water will continue its course
downward until it reaches the water-ta-
ble or ground—water.
Another part remains distributed in the
soil,‘ and it is this part that is thus held
in the soil against the force of gravity
that we call capillary water. As the sur-
face of the ground dries out, some of the
water that has ﬁltered through to the wa-
ter-table may be drawn up into the soil
again and become capillary water. This
may be illustrated as follows: Close one
end of a glass tube by tying over it a
piece of muslin, then partly ﬁll the tube
with soil, and pour on water; the entire
mass of soil becomes saturated and :1
part of the water runs through, provided
a sufﬁcient quantity has been added. If
now the soil in the tube is allowed to dry
for a few days, and then the end over
which the muslin was tied is dipped into
a basin of water, the water will slowly
rise in the tube, being lifted up by cap-
illary attraction against the force of grav-
ity. The water in the basin may be com-
pared to the ground-water in the soil;
though the cases are not strictly parallel,
since under natural ﬁeld conditions the
soil is constantly in contact with the
ground-water. The principle however is
the same. It is from this capillary water,
for the most part, that trees and plants
obtain the water necessary for- their
growth. We can readily see then the im-
portance; of knowing how best to control
this source of water supply. The prin-
ciple on which the water, known as capil-
lary water, rises in the soil, is a well-
known law of physics. \Vhen small glass
tubes of different internal diameters are
placed in water, the water will rise high-
est in the smallest tube. That is, the
height to which the water rises is in—
versely proportional to the diameter of
the tube. A knowledge of this law helps
us in the study of the movements of soil
moisture. The small spaces between the
soil particles or grains, may be likened
to ﬁne tubes: though in this case the
tubes are neither straight nor of uniform
bore. By capillary attraction water is
drawn up through the pore spaces or ﬁne
tubes, to take the place of that which is
lost by surface evaporation or used by
plants and trees.
The size of these tubes will be deter-
mined by the size of the particles or
grains that make up the soil; that is,. if
the soil is composed largely of coarse
particles, the capillary tubes will be

large,-and if it is composed of very ﬁne
sand or clay loam, the tubes will be much
smaller. Then, according to the law al-
ready stated, the water will rise highest
in the soil that is made up of the ﬁnest
grains. This is well illustrated bv tying
muslin cloth over the ends of glass tubes
as described above, ﬁlling each tube with
a different soil, and letting the ends of
the tubes dip into a basin of water for
a few days. The results of such an ex-
periment are shown in diagram I. In the
coarse sand from Saint Lucie county the
which compose the Hillsboro county soil
are one-half millimeter (about 1-50 inch)
or less, in diameter. However, the odds
are not all against the coarse soil. True,
it does not lift the water so high as the
ﬁner soil, but neither does it allow this
water to evaporate from the surface so
rapidly. It has been shown that a mulch
of coarse, dry sand is more effective in
preventing surface evaporation than one
of ﬁnely pulverized clay loam.
Furthermore, we have shown by exper-
iments similar to those already described

been made of the
water by surface
evaporation. The loss of water in
this way is great, but it is pos-
sible to very materially reduce this loss.
This may be accomplished, as is generally
known, by plowing and frequently stir-
ring the surface. King, in \Visconsin,
has shown that a piece of ground lost in
seven days, in consequence of not having
been plowed, no [less than 9.13 pounds
of water per square foot more than an ad—
joining piece that had been plowed; an
amount equivalent to 1.75 inches of rain,
and to more than 198 tons of water per
acre. Hilgard, in California, reports
some investigations of moisture condi-
tions in adjacent orchards differently
treated in regard- to cultivation. In one
case investigated, two orchards of apri-
cots were separated by a lane only, and
the soils were identical; but one owner
had omitted to cultivate while the other
had cultivated to an extra depth in view
of a dry season apparently impending.
Table I shows the difference of the two
ﬁelds in moisture content in July to
the depth of six feet. This difference of
244 tons of water per acre he regards as
quite sufﬁcient to acoount for the observed
difference in the cultural results. These
results were that on the cultivated ground
the trees made about three feet of annual
growth and the fruit was of normal size,
while the trees on the uncultivated ground
made barely three inches of growth, and
the fruit was stunted and wholly unsal-
able. Hilgard adds that, instructed by
the season’s experience, the owner of the
uncultivated orchard cultivated deeply the
following season. His trees then showed
as good growth and fruit as his neigh-
bor’s. Hilgard attributes the cause of
this difference to the fact that in the un-
cultivated ﬁeld there was a compact sur-
Mention has
loss of capillary
face layer of several inches in thickness
which forcibly abstracted the moisture
from the substrata, and evaporated it
from its surface; while the loose surface
soil on the cultivated ground was unable
to take moisture from the denser subsoil.
In diagram II I have undertaken to rep-
resent this condition graphically. In the
unplowed ground the capillary tubes or
openings, through which the moisture is
brought from the deeper subsoil, extend
all the way to the surface, and thus permit
the evaporation of this moisture.
W' here the ground has been plowed, the
capillary tubes are broken a few inches
below the surface, and much of the moist-
ture is thus prevented from escaping
into the air. However. the movement
of capillary moisture may take place in
any direction, even downward. if the
conditions are favorable.
NOTE—The diagram is necessarily
very much exaggerated, and represents
only very imperfectly what takes place
in the soil. It is not intended to convey
the idea that cultivation will entirely
prevent surface evaporation.
At the Experiment Station we have re-
cently determined the moisture in plowed
and unplowed land with the results shown
in table II. The plowed land selected is
a cotton ﬁeld that was plowed about
March 24, and harrowed twice between
that date and the time of planting the
cotton on April 16. The unplowed land
lies just across a path from the cotton
ﬁeld, and has not been plowed since last
December. Samples for moisture deter—
minations were collected on April 18, 24.

eighth of April, 0.86 inch of rain

on May 6, 0.70 inch fell; making a total
of 1.86 inches from April 28 to May 6.)

in favor of the plowed land, which is
equivalent to 1.45 inches of rainfall. If
we consider for a moment what it would
mean to have missed 1.45 of the 1.86
inches of rain that fell during this period,
The low moisture content in Grove A
at Lake \Veir may possibly be explained
by the fact that here the roots of the
trees are unusually near the surface of
the ground, and as a consequence cultiva-
tion has been shallow; and by the further

Report of Committee on Tropical Fruits.
THE EAST INDIAN MANGO IN FLORIDA.
By John
M -r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The East Indian Mango, with its spicy,
resinous sap and luscious pulp, stands
pre-eminent the king of all fruits. The
only reason it has not assumed the posi-
tion that belongs to it centuries ago in
the markets of \Vestern civilization is the
fact that it cannot be reproduced true
from seed. Consequently it has been con-
ﬁned to its home, Hindustan, and ad—
jacent countries to which trees could be
transported. For the past ten or ﬁfteen
years, with the aid of fast steamers“, the
fruit has been ﬁnding its way into the
London markets from Bombay via the
Suez Canal. Its remarkable keeping
qualities render this long journey possi-
ble, yet the fruit surely cannot develop
its full ﬂavor when gathered so long be—
fore maturity. as is necessary in this in-
stance. For the past twenty years I have
made a hobby of the East Indian mango,
and have ridden it pretty hard at times. I
rode it into the ground at Melbourne in
1894. Then I moved to Palm Beach and
conducted pretty exhaustive experiments
for ﬁve summers in propagation methods,
assisted by Mr. F. Bergin, who is now
manager of the Tropical Fruit Associa-
tion’s mango plantation at Bayamon,
Porto Rico. It was our object to ascer-
tain the cheapest and most feasible meth-
B. Beach
od for commercial production of East
Indian Mango trees. I am informed that
the results of our work have proven
the same as those conducted in the green-
houses at Washington. We have fallen
back on the old East Indian principle,
though we greatly improve on the method
of marching. Under certain conditions
budding is perfectly feasible, also root-
grafting or root inarching. But when it
comes to turning out a maximum per~
centage of healthy, vigorous trees, ﬁtted
for long—distance transportation at a min-
imum cost, inarched pot-grown trees take
the lead. A half-inch seedling tree can
be grown in a ﬁve-inch pot, a two or
three-foot vigorous East Indian top can
be grown on it in six or eight weeks, and
this tree properly planted and cared for
will in three years produce several dozen
fruit. They can be packed very light
with sphagnum and oiled paper in pine-
apple crates and will readily stand four
or ﬁve weeks’ shipment through the
tropics in the Spring and Fall.
Up to the last few years the only speci-
men of this wonderful fruit that had ever
been produced in Florida was a Mulgoba
tree (and its descendants) which was im-
ported with a number of others by the
Government. This tree was the only one
that survived the cold of ’94 and ’95 and

is growing on the place of the late Rev.
A. Gale at Mangonia. I have just seen
the tree (April 25th) and it has enough
fruit set to make ﬁve bushels if
they all mature. Mr. Geo. Gale has or-
ders for all he can produce at 25 cents
each f. o. b. The tree is two feet in
diameter and has a spread of twenty-ﬁve
feet. It is on the very poorest kind of
spruce pine land, coarse and white, with-
out fertilizer or irrigation. It is wonder-
ful that anything could live and grow
under such conditions, and speaks well
for the vigor of the East Indian Mango.
I have a tree budded from this ten
years ago, that stands twenty-ﬁve feet
high. and has yielded from 500 to 1,000
inarches per year, since I began to pro—
pagate from it. Before I began this it
had produced two crops of fruit, but since
then I have been working it so hard on
propagation that it only sets a few fruit
each year. It is on spruce pine land, but
I give it fertilizer and water, which
everything here needs to produce max-
imum results. If Mr. Gale’s tree had had
the same treatment that mine has had,
it would undoubtedly be yielding 25 to
30 bushels of fruit per year. All the
imported trees that we have bearing pro-
duce fruit that is free from ﬁbre. There
is a little down on one side of the seed,
but no ﬁbre at all in the body of the
fruit. You can cut around the seed and
lift off a fruit cup just as you would
I
with a free—stone peach or an avocado
pear. The pulp is far richer than the
ﬁnest peach, melting and juicy with a
spicy ﬂavor not to be found in any tem-
perate fruit.
The Mulgoba weighs fourteen to six-
teen oz., has a ﬁne red cheek, and is a
ﬁne market fruit. Shape is often nearly
cylindrical, and never very lopsided. The
Alphonso, one of the recent importations
via Washington, is considered in India
the best of all. It is superior in ﬂavor
to the Mulgoba but inferior in size and
appearance. Sundersha weighs from two
to three pounds, but is not equal to Mul-
goba in quality. Fernandez, one of my
own importations, has a distinct subacid
ﬂavor, unusual in mangoes, and which
will make it popular when known, though
the size is only 6 02. It is a most pro-
liﬁc bearer, and I have to pick off half
the fruit to give the rest a chance. Young
trees just inarched will often start to
bloom the ﬁrst year. There are quite a
number of other varieties imported by the
Department, by Mr. E. N. Reasoner and
by myself that have,n0t as yet fruited,
selected from the ﬁnest in India that may
develop other qualities that may appeal
to the taste of the public, but it will be
hard to beat the Alphonso. The develop-
ment of these we await with interest, and
next year expect to hear from some of
them, as many have blossomed and set
fruit.

PINEAPPLE GROWING AND SHIPPING.
By B. K.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Growing and shipping—these two
words represent the nucleus of the pine-
apple industry, upon them rests success
or failure; and I will treat the subject as
fully and clearly as it is possible to do in
a limited address.
The ﬁrst and most important step in
the growing of pineapples is the choosing
of the land. There are two kinds of this
that are best adapted to pineapples, viz.:
Spruce Pine and Hammock. Spruce
Pine, as the name implies, is high dry
land covered with spruce pines, the best
having an undergrowth of scrub oak and
hickory. Hammock land is more densely
grown with larger timber usually of
hickory and oak. Opinions differ as to
which is the best, but it is generally con-
ceded that the hammock land raises the
largest pines both as to plant and size;
the spruce pine land does not seem to
have as much humus in the soil, but the
plant seems to last a greater number of
years upon it. A combination place con-
taining some of each kind of land is de-
sirableif you can obtain such. After
the careful choosing of the land, the next
step is the clearing, i. e. placing in proper
shape; this is done by ﬁrst removing the
tree’s brush, etc. The process of grub—
bing the land consists in taking a tool
known as a grub hoe about six inches
wide and shaped like a mattox; with this
implement all the roots are removed to
a depth of about fourteen inches. Ground
should be grubbed during the winter for
the summer planting; do not, however,
McCarty.
remove the roots and brush until sum-
mer when you fork the land, because
this shades the ground and prevents the
sun from baking the same. Pine stumps
are not grubbed out, only the roots are
cut up to the stump and the tree is cut
down. This stump soon rots and makes
humus for your land. Hickory, Bay and
all other stumps are dug out either with
a grub hoe or a stump-puller. All brush
and large roots are forked into the trails
which are from four to six feet wide, six
feet preferred; here it is burned. The
land is now ready for raking. Before
this is done, in order to level, a harrow
is run over, thus removing all bumps; the
land is now raked; all the ﬁne trash and
rootlets are raked into where your trail
is to be,‘ or the same place that the trash
was burned. When these rootlets and
ﬁne trash are worked into the ground
by rolling over it with the wheelbarrow
and other work done in the trail, it forms
a hard path which enables the man who
wheels to carry bigger loads. we have
now reached the point of setting.
Select good plants; of whatever va-
riety you wish to plant, the universal
opinion is that Red Spanish are the most
desirable both from the commercial and
safety point of view. The slips range
in length from eight to fourteen inches;
the stocky heavy-butted ones are the best
growers; slips are shucked or the hard
butt is cut off, and the ﬁrst eight or ten
shucks are removed, thus allowing the
roots to be exposed so when the slip is
planted they will start quicker and be

rooted ﬁrmer. Usually about 12,500 Red
Spanish slips are planted to the acre;
twenty inches square being the proper
distance.
The ground is laid off with a marker
which is pulled by a man, thereby giving
you an even and symmetrical ﬁeld. Plant-
ing is done by the use of a trowel; the
ground is simply broken and the slip is
inserted to the depth of about one inch.
Be sure not to set too deep. A slip set
too deep becomes choked by the sand
working into the bud and the plant does
not make the proper growth. Equally
as bad, however, is shallow setting, be-
cause the wind blows the unrooted plant
from its place. The point of proper set-
ting cannot be overestimated and should
receive the careful attention of every pine-
apple grower. We have three methods of
working pineapple plants; the most pop—
ular as well as the best is shufﬂehoeing.
This is done by means of a shufﬂe-hoe.
When the plant is young you work care-
fully up to the base of each plant, being
sure to stir all of the ground. Opinions
differ as to how often young plants
should be shufflehoed; as for me, I do
this early and often, every three weeks,
if the ground is in the proper condition,
until the plant becomes too large to per-
mit. A small plough is used also to stir
the ground in young ﬁelds; a rake is also
used by some people, but it is much
slower and more expensive,
The shuffle-hoe is our most used tool,
for with it are the trails kept clean of
weeds and stirred, as well as the ﬁelds.
Upon our sandy soils we have to fer-
tilize extensively, almost from the time
the plant is set, and continue to do so
until the ﬁeld has grown too old to bear
properly. The question of fertilizing is
an intricate one,‘ requiring a great deal
of study and close attention to details.
I have used Painter’s fertilizers for some
time, with the best of results. It seems
' to be the census of opinion that a bearing
ﬁeld of pines should be fertilized twice
a year._ What is called the summer ap-
plication is usually put on about July 10th
to 30th; and the fall application is put
on about October 15th to 30th. It is
almost impossible to tell formulas, be-
cause of the differences in ﬁelds, age of
plants and, last, the difference in land;
there are not any two- pieces of land which
would require the same kind of fertilizer;
climatic conditions change the whole
status of affairs,
The watch-word in shipping pineapples
is carefulness in handling. Let it ever
be the foremost idea in your mind, that
a fall which will injure an egg will do
the same to a pineapple. The ﬁrst thing
in shipping pines is the picking; upon this
point lies success or failure; i. e., how
to pick, when to pick, color and methods
of picking. There are two ways to pick;
ﬁrst to snap the apple from the stalk; this
is done by placing your knee or wrist
against the stalk at the base of the ap~
ple and giving a quick downward motion
toward the body. If there are slips around
the base of the apple, one should be re-
moved. The snapping process is a very
good one where the slips are not thick
and when there has been rain, thus mak-
ing the stalk brittle. The second method
is by cutting with a knife; an ordinary
all-metal oyster knife is the best; one or
more slips, if necessary, are pushed off
from the top of the stalk, the point of
the knife is here inserted and the apple
is removed by this method, the slips are
saved, and it also prevents the apple from
becoming plugged so it leaks and rots
while in transit. The census of opinion
is that the ﬁrst-named method is the best,
although many of the best growers use
IO

both; the grower will have to use his own
judgment in this matter to a large extent.
When to pick the fruit so as to get it to
the market in the best possible shape is
one of the all-important points of the in-
dustry. The apple should show a light
greenish cast around the base. It should
always be remembered that a Red Span-
ish pineapple always ripens from the out-
side in; also from the base to the top of
the apple. When pines are picked in this
condition they will keep for some time,
even in the heart of the summer, if they
are not bruised.
Step number two is the method of get-
ting the apple from the ﬁeld to the pack-
ing house. Some people use a wheel-
barrow with a rack; into this the apples
are placed where they are then taken to
the house; others use pineapple crates
that are ﬁlled by the wheeler as they are
thrown by the picker. These crates are
picked up and hauled to the house with
a wagon, where they are carefully laid in-
to the bins, being now ready for wrap-
ping. Baskets are also sometimes used
in place of crates on the wagon, When
the pines arrive at the packing-house they
are placed in long bins about four feet
wide and three feet deep; from this they
are packed. If the fruit is wet when it
is brought to the house, it is always let
dry in order to save spotting the paper.
Pineapples are packed in crates 10%, by
12 by 36 inches; they are wrapped in
strong paper 15 by 20 inches. Most grow-
ers use plain white, because it is stronger;
still many growers use the colored paper
with varied success.
Sizing is all done with the eye and is a
most particular job; the crate must be
packed snug but not full enough, so when
the covering is put on that it bruises the
apples. The point should be carefully
borne in mind, that the apple in transit
shrinks a triﬂe, so that what seems to be
a perfect package on leaving your pack-
ing-house will not be so when it is re-
ceived by your commission house. Ex-
perience is one’s only teacher in the mat-
ter of packing and the man who feels
that he is shrewd enough to beat the
buyer on his pack will ﬁnd, to his sor-
row, that he is receiving from 10 to 25
cents less for his fruit than his neighbor.
Pineapples run in size from 18 to 48
to the crate; they are laid in the crates
crossways, alternately apple and crown;
this is done to prevent bruising if one
apple came in direct contact with an-
other. The crate is made the wide way,
so as to give the apple more room, Each
package should be packed with carefully
selected fruit both as to size and quality.
Never pack an apple that is the least bit
doubtful, because you not only lower the
price on that crate, but you lower the
reputation of your brand which is price-
less.
An ordinary packer packs Ioo crates
a day and does it well. Of course, size
has a great deal to do with the number
a man can pack, but for all season’s work
100 crates a day is plenty.
Your crate should be stenciled or, if
you prefer, stamped with your name, va-
riety, etc., so as to present a neat and
attractive appearance. _
My whole article has dealt with the
Red Spanish Pineapple, which is king of
all varieties; it has won its place justly
in the great markets of the world against
the bitterest competition. Cuba with her
immense crops of pineapples combined
with both Florida’s and Porto Rico’s form
a stupendous business. It is SUITICICHI to
say that if we are to retain our enviable
position as producing the ﬁnest pineapple

I trust I have in some small way cast
a little light on the methods of growing
and shipping pineapples.
PLANTING OF FRUIT TREES.
By Aubrey Frink.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Early in April I received a letter from
President Rolfs asking me to prepare a
paper for the Horticultural meeting, but
he did not suggest a topic. After some
correspondence with Prof. Rolfs, we de-
cided upon the subject of Planting Fruit
Trees.
My reason for selecting this topic is
that there seems to be a very general de-
sire for information along this line.
Scarcely a day passes during the planting
season that I don’t receive inquiries as
to when to plant, how to prune for plant-
ing, about fertilizers and fertilizing, best
sized trees to set, etc. And, no wonder,
for the success of an orchard depehds
to a considerable extent on proper meth-
ods in planting.
WHEN TO PLANT.
The_ best time for setting fruit trees
is one of the ﬁrst things to be considered.
As a general rule fruit trees do better
when set during late fall or early winter
—,as soon as they have hardened up their
growth and become dormant. Trees
planted then will have time to become
established in their new positions and
nearly all of them will have put on feeder
rootlets before time for growth to start
in the spring; thus enabling them to start
promptly and make and sustain a good
ﬁrst growth in the spring, as well as suc-
ceeding growths, an d to withstand
drouth.
Many people suppose that when a tree
is dormant, it is dormant in root as
well as in top, but if you care to test this,
dig up a few trees during the late fall
and heel them in or transplant them, and
then during late winter or early spring
before top growth has started, dig them
up and examine the roots. You will
nearly always ﬁnd small rootlets long be-
fore the top shows any signs of starting.
If planting is left until spring, the top
will start out immediately and before the
roots have time to throw out feeders,
thus drawing severely upon the stored-up
sap within the tree, with the result, too
often, that the vitality of the tree is
weakened and not infrequently it suc-
cumbs, especially in case of a severe
drouth. -
Deciduous trees can be planted success-
fully only when dormant, during the late
fall, winter or early spring. But Citrus
trees can be planted at almost any time
when conditions are favorable; that is,
when the ground is moist and weather
cloudy, although they, too, generally do
better for being planted during late fall
or early winter. Some planters like to
plant during the rainy season of mid—
summer.

It is desirable always to plant all kinds
of trees only when the ground is in good
moist condition.
'PRUNING.
The pruning of fruit trees at time of
planting, or before, is a matter that is
given entirely too little attention. A very
large percentage of trees are set out
exactly as received from the nursery,
whether pruned at all or not, in an en-
deavor to save as much of the top as
possible. This oftentimes results in los-
ing a large percentage of trees, for the
root system of the tree has been deranged
while the top is left as it originally was,
with the result that the tree has to draw
upon the sap stored up within itself to
support the top and, if evergreens, all
the foliage, while the roots are getting
started. This heavy drain upon the vital-
ity of the tree not infrequently causes it
to die. Nearly all fruit trees should be
severely pruned when planted. They will
start__out better, make better and quicker
growth, and actually‘ form good heads
sooner than when planted with all their
tops left on, besides materially reducing
the percentage of loss in planting. Fruit
trees should nearly always be cut back
to a straight stem of about twenty to
thirty inches. This gives the point at
which the top will form, thus making a
low branched tree, giving a larger fruit-
ing surface than would be possible were
the top started four or ﬁve feet or higher.
It also allows 0f the fruit being picked
with greater ease and less expense than
from high-topped trees, because a good
portion of the fruit can be picked with-
out the use of a ladder.
The roots should also be primed to
some extent. but I do not believe what
-
is known as the Stringfellow method of
pruning off all the roots is good practice;
in fact, it has not proven so in my own
planting of many thousands of trees an-
nually, except in some instances where
trees are very small and the top is also
cut to within a very few inches of the
ground.
In pruning citrus trees, it is advisable
to cut out the ﬁbrous roots almost en-
tirely, the belief of many planters to the
contrary notwithstanding. These ﬁbrous
roots are but feeders and are an annual
growth, and when a tree is transplanted
with these ﬁbrous roots left on it, they
will simply rot off before new rootlets
will start, thus hindering the starting of
new feeders. If anyone doubts this as-
sertion, let him heel in a few orange trees
during the early winter, and then examine
them during the late winter. He will
ﬁnd the ﬁbrous rootlets rotted OH. and
new rootlets starting. In making the
test, try a few with ﬁbrous rootlets cut
out and see if he does not ﬁnd that they
have started new feeders much sooner than
those with the ﬁbrous roots left on them.
A pretty good plan, when ordering
trees from a nurseryman, is to instruct
him to have the trees pruned ready for
planting. He will seldom make any
charge for this’ and the plan has several
advantages. In the ﬁrst place the trees
will be properly pruned; with many plant-
ers it takes considerable nerve to prune
as hard as trees should be pruned.
In the second place, this will save you
the trouble and expense, and will save
considerable useless weight and, con-
sequently, transportation charges. And
in the third place, evergreen trees will be
the better for being pruned and defoliated
immediately when dug. This stops, to a
large extent, the evaporation of sap. a1-

ways going on through the foliage,and re-
duces considerably the drying out in tran-
sit that would otherwise be hard to over.
come. Evergreens should nearly always
be defoliated when transplanted, for
otherwise the evaporation of sap is so
great through the foliage that the trees
have a hard struggle for life, and if ship-
ped during hot weather they are apt to
scald in transit, especially if out for some
time.
PREPARATION OF THE GROUND, AND
FERTILIZING.
The preparation of the ground for the
tree is of great importance and is too
often neglected. The ground should have 1
been broken up very deep with a turn
plow And thoroughly pulverized some time
in advance of planting. If the land is
new, this will enable it to mellow and
sweeten up, that is, lose the acidity which
so often occurs in our Florida soils. And,
right here, I want to say that new land
should always be used for trees subject
to attacks from the root-knot nematode,
such as peaches, mulberries, ﬁgs, etc. The
root-knot nematode is generally plentiful
in old lands, while new lands are fairly
free from it. By using new land your
trees have a chance to get started well
before this pest becomes sufficiently
abundant to do any damage, and then
the tree is generally able to resist its at-
tacks.
It is a pretty good plan to use half a
pound to one pound per tree of some good
high grade commercial fertilizer at time
of planting or before, mixing it thor-
oughly with the earth in the holes where
the trees are to be set. This puts the
fertilizer right where the tree can take
advantage of it immediater it puts out
new feeders, thus enabling the tree to
put on and maintain a good ﬁrst growth,
and by reason of this good ﬁrst growth,
the succeeding growths will be much bet-
ter. In other words, this will get your
tree established in a way impossible if
you depend upon using the fertilizer after
the tree has started growth.
The particular brand of fertilizer does
not so much matter. There are a num-
ber of excellent brands sold by manufac-
turers and dealers in the state. It should,
however, contain about the following pro-
portion of chemicals: Ammonia 4 to 6
per cent; Phosphoric Acid 7 to 9 per
cent. ; Sulphate of Potash 3 to 5 per cent.
SETTING THE TREE.
In setting the tree, generally consid-
ered a simple task, care should be used
to see that roots are placed as near as
possible in the same positions they orig-
inally occupied, and to have the earth
packed very ﬁrmly around them. It is
‘a good idea to place your tree in its
proper position, then pack earth around
the lower roots with your hands, then
pour in a bucket of water and allow that
to settle into the earth. This will ﬁrm
the earth around the roots far better than
you can do it otherwise. Then ﬁll in
the hole, and pack the earth down hard
by stamping it with your feet. After the
hole has been ﬁlled, make a basin of earth
around the tree, say, a couple of feet
across and pour in another bucket or two
of water, and after that has soaked in,
throw some loose earth over that to pre—
vent scalding.
Ordinarily trees should be set the same
depth in the ground they originally were
in nursery. Nature marks the proper
earth line, and it is generally a good idea

152
FLORIDA STATqu-IORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
to accept this, not trying to put the tree
either deeper in the ground or higher out
of it.
PROPER SIZED TREES TO SET.
As to the most desirable sized trees LO
plant. This is a question about which
there are many different opinions, but
my experience and observation has been
that sizes usually listed in nursery cata-
logues as Standard, are about as good as
can be used. In deciduous trees, like
peaches, plums, pears, mulberries, apples.
persimmons, etc., this means 4 to 6 feet;
while in citrus trees one year buds 4 t0
5 feet. Either medium size, 3 to 4 feet,
or extra size, 6 feet and up, is all right,
and some planters prefer smaller sizes,
while still others want only two-year old
buds in citrus trees. Two-year buds of
deciduous trees are seldom as desirable
as one-year buds and nothing is to be
gained by using them, for the one-year
buds, if thrifty, should give you fruit
just about as soon and as much as the
two-year olds.
But, if good thrifty trees are planted,
and sizes within reason, the size does not
count so much. It is the proper care at
time of planting and afterward that
makes for success in fruit-growing, pro-
vided always that proper varieties have
been selected.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Hart—Do you make it a point
to plant trees in relation to the points
of the compass; that is, do you plant
them in exactly the same position as
they were originally, with the north
to the north?
Mr. Frink—No, I don't think' that
makes any difference. Of course, I
have not had a very long experience.
but I never could see that it makes
any difference whatever.

SELECT BULBOUS AND TUBEROUS-ROOTED PLANTS FOR
FLORIDA GARDENS.

By H. Nehrling
1141'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Florida is the land of “unlimited pos-
sibilities” as far as ornamental horticul-
ture is concerned. We are able to grow
in the open hundreds—no, thousands—
of species of tropical and subtropical
plants which farther north can only be
grown with considerable trouble and
many expenses in glasshouses. I have
wandered through many parts of our
country in quest of birds and plants. I
have sojourned in Texas, and made my
home for a number of years in the Ozark
region of south-western Missouri. I have
lived on the prairies of Illinois, and spent
my boyhood days in the idyllic forest
regions of \Nisconsin, my native state.
I have seen all the elaborate gardens
around Boston, New York, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, Chicago, M i l w a u k e e,
’Washington, and New Orleans; but no-
where have I found such a wealth of
beautiful native and exotic plants as in
Florida, very aptly called the land of sun-
shine and ﬂowers. Even if we were de-
prived of exotic plants, we could make
glorious gardens from the material found
in our woodlands and along our water-
courses. Native plants should form the
foundations of all our gardens. Plant
ﬁrst of all the cabbage palmetto, the
noble Magnolia grandiﬂora, the sweet bay
(Magnolia glauca), the loblolly bay
(Gordonia Lasianthus), the holly (Ilex
opaca), the dahoon (Ilex Cassine), the
red cedar (Juniperus Barbadensis), the
laurel cherry (Prunus Caroliniana), the
wild olive (Osmanthus Americanus), the
live-oak (Quercus virens), and do not
forget that jewel among climbers. the
Carolina or Yellow Jessamine (Gelse-
mium sempervirens). This greets you
on New Year’s day with a wealth of de-
liciously sweet—scented, yellow ﬂower-
trumpets,
Our worthy president has suggested
to me to read a paper on bulbous and
tuberous-rooted plants adapted to our soil
and climate. This suggestion is very
timely, because only a very limited num-
ber of our people really know what has
been done along these lines in recent
years. It is true, gifted writers of high
intellect, like P. W. Reasoner and E. N.
Reasoner, Theo. L. Mead, Walter N.
Pike, W. C. Steele, Mrs, Jennie S. Per~
kins, and others, have pointed out, time
and again, the great possibilities of grow-
ing bulbous and tuberous-rooted plants in
Florida. Many and important have been
the articles that have appeared from time
to time in The Florida A gric'ulturist, and
in the older volumes of The Farmer and
Fruit Gro'rt'er; but as far as I am aware

the subject has never been treated in a
systematic manner.
I begin with the Lily Family (Lilia-
ceae).
This is a very large group of plants,
comprising the true Lilies (Lilium), the
Gloriosas, Sandersonias, Littonias, the
Tulips, Hyacinths, the Lily of the Valley,
the Mariposa Lilies (Calochortus), the
Blue African Lily (Agapanthus), etc.
The genera Trillium (Wake Robins),
Erythronium (Dog’s-tooth Violet), Bes-
sera, Blandfordia, Funkia, Milla, Allium,
Kniphoﬁa»(the Tritoma), Albuca, Hem-
erocallis, etc., all belong to this family.
Though I have experimented quite ex-
tensively with almost all the genera of
this family, I have not been successful
with most of them. The Tulips and
Hyacinths, which form such an important
part of all the gardens of the North, are
a failure in Florida. It is useless to
meddle with them. We have numerous
tropical bulbous plants, outrivaling them
in beauty and in easy culture, and only
these should be largely planted in our
gardens.
The true Lilies (Lilium) are the gems
of this noble family. They all belong to
the Northern Hemisphere, being num-
erously represented in the cool mountain
glens of the Californian Sierra Nevada
and Coast Range, and reaching their
greatest beauty and highest development
in Japan. China is likewise rich in ﬁne
Lilies, and some of the most beautiful
are found in the Himalayas. They abound
in Europe and Northern Asia, and some
of the species attracting the attention of
all ﬂower-lovers grow in our northern
meadows (L. Canadense, L. superbum
and L. Philadelphicum). One species,
Catesby’s Lily (L. Catesbaei), grows
abundantly in the ﬂatwoods of our OWn
State. Its large, orange-yellow, upright
ﬂower chalices, spotted with deep-brown,
'form glorious masses of rich color in
September. The bulb is small, but is
easily transplanted to our gardens in rich,
moist soil. It seeds freely, and batches
of young plants are usually found around
the old bulb. Though I have experi-
mented quite extensively with most of the
species ,of the true Lilies; I have not
found their behavior encouraging. This
was, however, at a time when I did not
understand the soil and climate of Flor-
ida thoroughly. Even at the North, most
Lilies are very capricious. They thrive
splendidly for a time; then they suddenly
disappear. Since I began the cultivation
of bulbous plants in a systematic way
under sheds and in well-prepared soil, 1
have had better results.
None of the European Lilies, not even
the chaste Madonna Lily (Lilium candi-
dum) of Southern Europe, will grow
here. The species of our northern states
are also a failure. The gigantic Hum-
boldt’s Lily (L. Humboldtii), and the
fragrant Washington Lily (L. Washing-
tonianum), being sojourners of the high
and cool mountain regions of California
refused to grow with me. The only
American Lilies which may ﬁnallyy after
many generations, adapt themselves to
our soil and climate, are the Californian
L, Parryi, a very fragrant lemon-yellow
species, and the vigorous L. pardalinum.
Both have ﬂowered with me, but they
died shortly after the blossoms had faded.
The Golden-banded Lily of Japan (L.
auratum) and its varieties, the most im-
posing and beautiful of all the Lilies and
the most fragrant, has not proved a suc-
cess with me; though some bulbs made
a vigorous growth at ﬁrst. The Japan
Lily (L. speciosum) and its varieties, L.

155
speciosum album, L. speciosum rubrum,
and Melpomene, grow much better and
bloom abundantly. They seem to do best
in pots on verandas ; but I have had them
frequently in ﬂower in the well-drained,
rich and moist soil of my shed. All are
very beautiful and exhale a delicious per-
fume.
Henry’s Lily (L. Henryi), discovered
several years ago in the mountains of
Junnan, in southern China, by Dr. Au-
gustine Henry, grows vigorously in
Florida. It has been termed the “Or—
ange-yellow Speciosum Lily." Its con-
stitution is robust; the plant growing
four to six feet high and bearing from
ten to twenty rich, orange-yellow blos-
soms, well set off by its ample deep-green
foliage. I have crosses now growing
vigorously between this species and L.
speciosum rubrum,
The Tiger Lily (L. tigrinum), a Chi-
nese species which has been repeatedly
reported to be successfully grown in our
State, never made itself at home in my
garden.
The most satisfactory of all the true
Lilies, growing admirably in Florida,
provided they are well cared fbr, are
those belonging to Endlicher’s Eulirion
group—the Funnel-ﬂowered Lilies. We
all are acquainted with the Easter Lily
(L. Harrisii), a variety of the Japanese
L. longiﬂorum, carrying a magniﬁcent
crown of long-tubed, snowy-white, frag-
rant blossoms, usually at Easter time, on
a stem two to three feet high. L. longi-
ﬂorum has branched out in quite a num-
ber of distinct and superior varieties. The
type usually only bears one or two ﬂow-
ers; the Easter, or Bermuda Lily (L.
longiflorum Harrisii), usually from four
to six. L. longiﬂorum giganteum is an
improvement on the last-named variety.
It is of very free growth, carrying from
six to ten ﬂowers on each stern. They
are large and well-formed, of great sub-
stance and purity, lasting a long time
when cut. The ﬁnest variety of all is
undoubtedly L. longiﬂorum Takesima
grandiﬂorum, very strong—growing, with
glossy foliage and dark-brown stems,
bearing from six to ten long tubular
ﬂowers, white inside and tinged with
brown externally. All these Lilies have
proved a perfect success with me, ﬂower-
ing abundantly in the latter part of April
and early in May.
Have you ever seen the beautiful L.
Brownii in bloom? The form of the
ﬂower reminds one of the last-named
species, but the outside is a deep choco-
late brown. Of still greater beauty is its
variety, L. Brownii leucanthum. It is
more or less ruddy-brown externally,
milk-white inside, with a rich yellow
throat. The type is rather difﬁcult to
grow, while its variety grows as easily
as the L. longiﬂorum varieties.
In 1872 the celebrated botanical col-
lector, Gustav \Vallis, discovered a beauti-
ful funnel-shaped Lily in the Philippine
Islands. the L. Philippense, which was
scientiﬁcally described by Baker in 1873.
At that time it did not attract much at-
tention. Only recently, since the United
States has taken possession of the islands,
this lily has become better known and
American ﬁrms have distributed it
largely. Though occurring in a tropical
country it has proved hardy even in Ohio.
The stems are rather slender, and the
grass-like leaves grow all along the stems,
as in all true lilies. Usually only one pure
white ﬂower is carried on the extremity
of each stem. The ﬂowers exhale a de-
licious perfume. It grows well in my

garden, and I have raised quite a number
of seedlings from it.
The Neilgherry Lily (L. Neilgher-
rense) is another species adapted to our
soil and climate. Coming from the
mountains of the Indian peninsula, where
it grows in great abundance, in the rich
vegetable mold of half—shady positions, it
is not quite hardy here in Florida. It
insists on pushing up its stems late in
autumn and during winter, and therefore
,is easily damaged by one of our cold
spells; though it can stand a few degrees
of frost with impunity. The ﬂowers are
pure white and very fragrant.
VVallich’s Lily, also known as the Sul-
phur Lily or the Himalayan Lily (Lilium
sulphureum, syn. L. \Vallichianum) is a
native of the Himalayas. at an altitude
of from 3.000 to 4,000 feet, growing in
the same places with the tree-like Rhodo-
dendrons (R. barbatum, R. arboreum, R_
grande, R. Falconeri, etc.) which are
awaiting introduction into our gardens;
when in bloom it transforms the moun-
tain sides into an earthly paradise. It is
a vigorous grower, with large funnel-
shaped ﬂowers, rich yellow inside, tinted
rosy and brown outside, of a rich fra—
grance; it produces small bulbs at the
base of the leaves like L. tigrinum. I
have had this lily in good condition for
years; but a species of burrowing mouse,
so common in Florida, destroyed these
and many other Lily bulbs last winter.
A few days ago I received another con-
signment of bulbs of this and the next
species from Burma. This species, with
some protection, has proved perfectly
hardy near Boston.
The Nepal Lily (L. Nepalense) is my
special favorite. It grows wild in the
western and central portions of the Hima-
layas, and has recently been collected in
quantity in Burma. The slightly fra-
grant ﬂowers have a purplish crimson
tube, and the segments are broadly tipped
with creamy white—a most beautiful
color combination. Though growing at
a higher altitude than the last-named
species, it is much more delicate.
For all the true Lilies I have found the
following mode of culture the one most
likely to give good results. Prepare a
bed under half shade. Dig out the soil
to the depth of three feet, and place on
the bottom a layer of oak trunks. Cover
this with a mixture of rich muck, leaf-
soil, old cow-manure, along with some
lime and a liberal quantity of crushed
charcoal. Fill up to the rim. Mix thor_
oughly, and dig the bed repeatedly be-
fore planting. All the bulbs should be
planted in November or early in Decem-
ber. Surround each bulb (which should
be covered with three inches of soil)
with crushed charcoal, and press the soil
ﬁrmly around it. When in full growth,
I apply a small quantity of Painter’s Si-
mon Pure garden fertilizer. This also
helps to keep out the burrowing mice,
which are so destructive to all the Lily
bulbs. Never order Lily bulbs in spring
—they are always a failure. I also sur-
round'all my choice Lily plants with
broken bricks and stones. This helps to
keep the soil cool, an essential point in
Lily culture. The Lily will never flour-
ish where the surface of the soil becomes
hot. Almost all the Lilies are in full
growth in our dry season. If the growth is
in any way checked during this time, they
invariably perish; with the exception of
the L. longiflorum section. For this rea-
son they must be kept well watered.
THE GENUS GLORIOSA, OR CLIMBING LILIES
In the foregoing I have pointed out
that the true Lilies need careful attention,
if success is to follow. It is quite differ-

ent with the Gloriosas. They are per-
fectly at h0me,in Florida, No plants are
grown more easily and with less care.
Deep rich soil, and a support to climb
upon are all they require. They are all
tropical plants, one species being found
in India and the others in Central Africa.
This genus, evidently so closely allied to
the true Lilies when we consider the foli-
age and ﬂowers, is a puzzle to the biol-
ogist as far as the rootstock is concerned.
In the Lilies we have typical bulbs made
up of numerous loose scales; while Glori-
osas have peculiarly shaped solid tubers,
giving no clue to their relationship.
The most magniﬁcent of all the species
is the new Uganda Climbing Lily
(Gloriosa Rothschildiana). It starts
into growth with me by the middle of
April, and is in full ﬂower by the middle
of May. (Some varieties, however, start‘
much later.) It is a very vigorous grower,
climbing to a height of from six to ten
feet. The ﬂowers, as in all the species,
are axillary, near the ends of the stems.
The points of the leaves are provided with
tendril-like apices, with which the plant
fastens itself to bushes and tall herbage.
The ﬂowers are large and very gorgeous.
lily-like_ with reﬂexed segments, and of
a dazzling orange-scarlet color with yel-
low edges. Each stem bears from eight
to ten ﬂowers, which open successively:
the lower ones ﬁrst and the terminal ones
last. This species was discovered several
years ago in Uganda, Africa. and was
introduced into cultivation by Lord \Val-
ter Rothschild of Tring, England; from
whom I received about a dozen tubers in
the spring of 1905.
The Malabar Glory Lily (G. superba)
starts into growth much later, usually not
before the beginning of June. It is also
a very strong grower and exceedingly
ﬂoriferous, each stem producing from ten
to thirty of its showy blossoms. The
stems, attaining a height of from six to
ten feet, often throw out side-shoots at
their tops. The ﬂowers are rather dis-
appointing at ﬁrst, from the predominance
of green in them; but after a few days,
bright orange-yellow hues supersede the
green almost entirely. Nothing can be
more striking than this lily in full bloom,
clambering over a ﬂowering specimen of
Pleroma macranthum. The bright, glow-
ing, orange-yellow ﬂowers of the Glori-
osa, and the large, glossy, bluish-purple
blossoms of the Pleroma, show a charm-
ing and strikingly beautiful contrast. I
have fertilized this species with the pollen
of G. Rothschildiana and vice versa; and
I have now quite a number of promising
hybrids from both species. In 1906 I
raised several hundred seedlings of the
Malabar Glory Lily. and most of them
ﬂowered last year. I have never noticed
such a variation as was displayed here,
though the plant was crossed with its own
pollen. Some plants were strong grow-
ers; others showed a weak constitution.
Many had broad, large leaves; others
small and narrow foliage. But the great-
est diﬂ‘erence was displayed in the blos-
soms; the color ranging from a dull yel-
lowish green to the deepest orange-yel-
low. Some of the ﬂowers even were pure
yellow.
The Mozambique Glory Lily (G. vire-
sccns), as its name implies, was intro-
duced from Mozambique. Its prevailing
color is yellow, with some green.
Leopold’s Glory Lily (G. Leopoldii)
seems to be intermediate between two
already mentioned. The ﬂowers are Pure
yellow when opening, changing ﬁnally to

a much brighter and deeper hue. The
segments show rosy-red streaks and spots
in the center.
A friend of mine in France sent me
this spring an evidently new species,
which was collected on the Congo. .The
tuber is very thick and shaped like a
wedge, not branched in tomahawk-like
fashion as in other species.
Plant in deep, rich soil; either near a
shrub over which the plant may clamber,
or give a bamboo stem with branches left
intact as a support. Do not disturb the
tuber for a number of years; and give,
each spring, an application of good com-
mercial fertilizer.
Sandersonia aurantiaca and Littonia
modesta are allied plants from Natal.
Both have bell-shaped, yellow-orange
blossoms; both are climbers and both
grow well in Florida,
Tritomas (Kniphoﬁa) grow well in
Florida, and flower {in profusion; blllt
they need attention and good soil rich in
humus, not too dry and not too wet. An
application each spring of cow manure
as a top-dressing is essential to their wel-
fare. Several years ago I had a collec-
tion of about twenty-ﬁve different sorts.
They were planted out on rather high
and dry pine-land, where they grew fairly
well. A few years later I intended to
improve their condition, and prepared a
bed in the rich soil near the lake. When
the rainy season came, the bed was soon
entirely submerged; and my entire col-
lection, consisting of several hundred
plants, was lost. All the Tritomas are
natives of Africa.
The Day Lily (Hemerocallis) grows
as well in Florida as anywhere else, soon
forming large and conspicuous clumps of
great beauty. Though the individual
ﬂower only lasts one day, the blossoms
are produced in such abundance, and are
so showy, that Day Lilies should ﬁnd a
place in every garden. The most vigor-
ous grower is the common Tawny Day
Lily (H. fulva), with large lily-like,
tawny-orange flowers. The double form
of this (H. fulva ﬂ. pl.) and another
double form from Japan (H. Kwanso ﬂ,
pl.)—-the latter with strikingly varie-
gated foliage—deserves extensive dissem-
mination.
The Lemon Day Lily (H. ﬁava) is an
exceedingly beautiful plant, with large
lemon colored flowers, strongly fragrant.
I also greW' H. Middendorﬁii with
golden yellow ﬂowers, and H. Thunbergii
with sweet-scented bright yellow blos-
soms, and some hybrids which I raised
from the various species,
Day Lilies require a very rich soil.
They are splendid objects among, or in
front, of shrubbery.
THE IRIS FAMILY (IRIDACEAE).
This very large family is rich in ﬁrst-
class garden plants, comprising such well—
known genera as Gladiolus, Watsonia,
Antholyza, Crocus, Babiana. Ix i a,
Sparaxis, Moraea, Tigridia, Montbretia,
etc.; but the most important is the genus
Iris itself. About 175 species of Iris are
known to science. With the exception
of a few North African species, all are
natives of the North Temperate Zone,
inhabiting North Amerioa, Asia and Eu-
rope. The most important of all, and
the most easily grown, is the German Iris
(Iris Germanica), the glory of northern
gardens in June. It is a failure in Flor-
ida. When I made the State my per-
manent home, in 1902, I brought with
me about a thousand rhizomes, in about
forty distinct and beautiful garden forms.
They died out one after the other, and
in three years none were left. This Iris
is so beautiful that it is worth all the

trouble to grow it. I have had the dwarf
Iris pumila in ﬂower in the autumn
months. Some plants which were set out
on my place in 1886, were still in exist-
ence in 1896; but they never made much
growth. '
In moist rich soil the Japanese Iris
(1, 1aevigata) ﬂourishes with all the vigor
of a native plant. It will not grow on
high dry pine—land or in poor soil. The
soil must be rich in humus. A rich black
vegetable mold near the edge of the water
is just the right place for this exquisitely
beautiful plant. Before planting add a
very liberal amount of old cow-manure
to the soil; also apply good commercial
fertilizer early in spring, just before
ﬂowering. There is such a wealth of rich
and delicate colors in the different vari-
eties, and they ﬂower so abundantly, that
it seems strange that they are not grown
more in Florida. There are hundreds of
ﬁne varieties, single and double, which
almost all originated in Japanese gardens.
Our Florida Iris (I, hexagona) should
not be omitted from this list; as it is a
very beautiful and easily grown plant,
growing well where the Japanese species
ﬂourishes. There is also a pure white
form of it. This species offers a good
ﬁeld for the hybridizer.
The Roof Iris (I. tectorum) of Japan
thrives ﬁnely in my garden in half shade
and in rich moist soil. As its name im-
plies, it grows largely on the straw roofs
of Japanese houses.
There are undoubtedly numerous spe-
cies of the rhizomatous Irises which will
thrive splendidly in our gardens. I only
experimented with them in a limited way;
but hope to take up the genus as a spe—
cialty in the near future,
I have never planted the bulbous Irises,
such as the English and Spanish, and I
Nazarina, I. Sarii and I. Bismarckiana
have found Iris Susiana, I. Iberica, I.
a failure. In their native home they rest
in a dry hot soil during the summer and
autumn months; while here they grow
and ﬂower in the dry season, April and
May, and rest in the rainy season, which
invariably makes the thick rhizomes rot.
To Mr. E, N. Reasoner belongs the
credit of having introduced to our gar-
dens an Iris-like plant, which is at once
a most vigorous grower and an abundant
bloomer. It is at home on our high, dry
pine-land, and also in moister soil, but it
will not ﬂourish in places where our wild
Iris and the Japanese Iris thrive best.
This is the Natal Iris (Moraea iridioi-
des), a veritable jewel for our gardens.
If well cared for, it will soon form large
clumps and will ﬂower four or ﬁve times
during the spring and summer months.
In order to see it at its best, it should
be planted in groups or large beds. The
HOWers are three to four inches across,
pure white, and marked with deep yellow
on the claws of the outer segments; the
style is marked with blue—a very strik-
ing combination of colors.
The Blackberry Lily (Pardanthus Chi-
nensis) comes up from self-sown seed
everywhere in my garden. Antholyza
Aethiopica and other species, Watsonias.
and Montbretias grow all well, but I
never have been successful with the Tigri-
dias, which grew to perfection in my gar-
den in Texas,
The Gladiolus (the Gandavensis as
well as the Childsii and Groff varieties)
grows as well in Florida as in other
southern states. I prefer the Gladiolus
Childsii varieties on account of their
vigorous growth, large and ﬁnely formed
ﬂowers, and gorgeous colors. This strain
was produced by the celebrated hybrid-

izer, Max Leichtlin, of Baden-Baden,
Germany.
Last year I received from my friend,
Dr. \V alter Van Fleet, another celebrated
hybridizer, a number of tropical African
kinds. Among them G. Quartinianus,
with dazzling red ﬂowers having an or-
ange-yellow throat. These ﬂower in Oc-
tober and November, at a time when all
other Gladioli have gone to rest. They
are all vigorous growers, and the stems
attain to a height of from three to ﬁve
feet.
The Gladiolus also does best in half-
shade, and the soil should be made rich
with old cow-manure. The ﬂowers are
not of long duration here in Florida, and
therefore the stem should be cut when
the ﬁrst flower opens. Placed in the house
in a vase, all the flowers will open, and
they last much longer in this condition
and give much better satisfaction.
THE AMARYLLIS FAMILY.
DACEAE.)
(AM ARYLLI-
The word Amaryllis sounds to me like
poetry. No other word is so charming
to my ear_ The mere thought of it carries
me away into the world of my ideals.
Noble form, gorgeous colors, indescriba-
ble beauty, reﬁnement, delicacy, delicious
fragrance—all these attributes are com-
bined in the Amaryllis. I have given
up the cultivation of Orchids in order to
devote all my time, my undivided interest,
to these plants. I came to Florida with
the sole object in my mind of growing
and hybridizing Amaryllis. I bought my
place in 1883 with the view to make the
cultivation of Amaryllis my specialty.
When I say Amaryllis, I mean the word
in the broader sense of the Amaryllis
family. This noble family comprises such
superb genera as Amaryllis, Hippeastrum,
Crinum, Hymenocallis, Pancratium, Is-
mene, Griﬁinia, Eucharis, H'aemanthus,
Ammocharis, Buphane, Brunsvigia, Spre-
kelia, Lycoris, Nerine, Vallota, Habran—
thus, Zephyranthes, Cooperia, Clivia, Al-
stroemeria, etc.—all names sounding
familiar to those who take a deeper in-
terest in ﬁoriculture, all very important
and beautiful garden plants. Though
closely allied to the true Lilies—which
they not only rival but eclipse, alike in
beauty and fragrance—they are of
much easier culture, and flower more
abundantly,
I am sorry to say that I have not been
successful in ﬁowering' the true Amaryllis
or Belladonna Lily (Amaryllis Bella-
donna) a native of South Africa. I am
of the opinion that this is the most ex-
quisite of all bulbous plants. It invaria-
bly ﬂowers in August, before the leaves
appear; and the large ﬁnely formed blos-
soms, varying from a delicate pink to a
deep purplish rose, exhale a very strong
and delicious perfume—the very ideal of
perfumes.
About ten years ago, I planted several
hundred bulbs, partly on high dry soil,
partly on lower land, and partly in a half
shady position. All grew well and multi-
plied rapidly and those on low ground
flourished best: but not one bulb ever
flowered. In Texas, and. even much
farther north, and also in California, the
Belladonna Lily ﬂowers profusely. Evi_
dently it needs a heavier soil, or it may
dislike our wet summers.
The most valuable, the most gorgeous,
and the most showy of all bulbous plants
are undoubtedly the Hippeastrum species
and hybrids, everywhere known as the
Amaryllis. The scientiﬁc name which
was given to this genus by Dean Herbert,
the great Amaryllis specialist, means

Knight's Star. They are all natives of
the American Tropics, occurring in a
wild state in the rich vegetable mold of
the primeval forest; in cool mountain
glens; among the grass of the llanos; or
even as epiphytes on trees, among Or-
chids, Bromeliads, Aroids, Ferns, etc. One
species, the Blue Amaryllis (Hippeastrum
procerum), grows in the full tropical sun
on rocks near Petropolis, Brazil. When
in ﬂower all the species are strikingly
beautiful—so beautiful that even the dull
Indian or the indolent peon cannot help
pausing a moment to admire them. With
the exception of the fancy-leafed Cala-
diums, no plants in our Florida gardens
are admired as much or create such en-
thusiasm as the various Amaryllis and
their still more gorgeous hybrids. When
I saw the ﬁrst clumps of Johnson’s Ama-
ryllis in a garden in Houston, Texas, in
May, 1879, I stood speechless. Their en-
chanting beauty, their brilliant color and
reﬁned form overpowered me. From that
time on to the present day, I made the
cultivation of this class of plants my spe-
cialty. I entered a ﬁeld with unlimited
possibilities. I began to collect the vari-
ous species from their native countries,
and added the best hybrids from Eu-
ropean collections. I began myself to
hybridize with excellent results from the
start. This was about thirty years ago;
and at present my own hybrids rival in
beauty of color, perfect form and sub-
stance, the best European collections. I
grow at present all the species that could
be obtained, with all the best old and re-
cent hybrids of European plant breeders;
and my collection of named hybrids con-
sists of about a thousand different vari-
eties.
All the species are most valuable gar-
den plants here in Florida. There are
about ﬁfteen species in cultivation, and
about as many varieties or local forms of
the different species.
In April, most of the Florida gardens
are aglow with gorgeous masses of the
Orange Amaryllis or Orange Lily (Hip-
peastrum equestre). It revels in the ap
parently poor sandy soil, soon forming
imposing clumps which produce numer-
ous stems, each carrying two large, some-
what nodding, bright orange-red ﬂowers,
with a yellowish-white star. Planted in
large groups or beds, these Amaryllis in
full ﬂower produce a magniﬁcent sight,
being far more beautiful than Tulips and
other bedding plants of the northern gar-
den. Planted around palms and in front
of shrubbery, they are particularly ef-
fective. They form a charming picture
in long lines on borders, and along ver-
andas, backed by such beautiful shrubs
the sky-blue Eranthemum (Daedalacan-
thus nervosus), and the deep-blue Thun_
bergia erecta, which ﬂowers at the same
time. This species is a native of the
West Indies, Central America and North-
ern South America. A beautiful form
(H. equestre VVolteri) was lately intro-
duced into cultivation from Costa Rica.
Its ﬂowers are glowing deep orange-scar-
let.
The double Orange Amaryllis (H.
equestre Alberti) is common in the gar-
dens of Havana, and is frequently found
under cultivation in Florida. Its ﬂowers
last considerably longer than those of the
single form.
Johnson’s Amaryllis, the so-called
Scarlet Lily (Hippeastrum Johnsoni), is
one of our most valuable garden plants.
It does not thrive as well in our state as
in Texas, at Mobile or at Charleston, but
I have seen magniﬁcent clumps, beds, and
long borders of it in Orlando. With a

little care it will thrive everywhere in
the State. The ﬂowers are produced on
stems about two feet high, and each stem
carries a magniﬁcent umbel of from four
to six large trumpet-shaped blossoms.
The ground color is a very brilliant
cherry-red, and each segment has a dis-
tinct white band. It exhales a delicate
aromatic fragrance, which becomes quite
powerful when thousands of ﬂowers are
open at the same time. This is the ﬁrst
hybrid that was ever raised. In the be-
ginning of the last century, an English
watchmaker by the {name of Johnson,
crossed Hippeastrum vittatum with H.
Reginae, and the result was this ﬁne
Amaryllis, which ﬂowered for the ﬁrst
time in 1810. Thousands of hybrids
soon followed, but this is the only one
which has held its own—“the survival of
the ﬁttest.” It is so beautiful that it
should ﬁnd a place in every garden in
Florida.
Hippeastrum Reginae is said to be a
native of Mexico and the West Indies to
Brazil and Peru. I have not succeeded
in obtaining it from its native wilds. A
bulb received from Europe about ten
years ago has only formed two offsets
so far. It grows well and ﬂowers reg-
ularly each year. The color is a glowing
scarletJ with a greenish-white star. My
plants are evergreen.
H. vittatum exhibits funnel-shaped,
slightly fragrant ﬂowers. The ground
color is pure white, with broad white
bands, which are bordered on each side
by a very distinct purplish-crimson stripe.
Its native home is in the rather dry re-
gions of the Andes of Peru. This species
grows much better in California than in
the humid climate of Florida, and most
of the Amaryllis hybrids, have origin-
ated in the former state, are produc-
tions of this species. No other species
has been used so much for hybridizing
purposes in bygone days. Very beautiful
forms were frequently obtained. They
were, however, weak growers. They had
small, long-tubed ﬂowers with narrow
segments, and the form was invariably
imperfect. For this reason, neither the
species nor its hybrids are used any
longer by the best plant-breeders. I have
abandoned its use long ago,
The Funnel-shaped Amaryllis (H.
solandri ﬂorum), I have received repeat-
edly from Caracas, Venezuela. It is de-
ciduous, like the last-named, and grows
abundantly on the grassy plains or
llanos. The color is greenish—white and
the tube is about ten inches long. It
exhales a very strong fragrance.
H. solandri ﬂorum conspicuum. This
is one of the most beautiful Amaryllis in
existence and deliciously fragrant. The
ﬂowers are long trumpet-shaped, some-
what reminding one of the Easter Lily;
and its stems, which carry a magniﬁcent
umbel of from six to eight ﬂowers, grow
three to four feet high. The ground
color varies from pure white to deep pink,
striped and lined with deep purplish-red,
and suffused a little with scarlet. It is
much superior to the type. Some years ago
a friend of mine in San Jose, Costa Rica,
whom I had asked to keep an eye on
the different wild and cultivated forms
of Amaryllis in Costa Rica, informed me
that only H. vittatum was growing abun-
dantly in the gardens. He sent me at the
same time a few bulbs. When opening
the box, I saw at once that it could not
be H. vittatum, as the bulbs were of
different form, and they were covered,
moreover, with deep brownish-black
tunics. while in H. vittatum they are light
grayish-brown. When the bulbs began

to bloom a few weeks later, I recognized
them at once as the above-named variety,
A little later I received another lot of a
hundred bulbs, which are now growing
beautifully here in my garden. I have
used them largely in my hybridizing
work, with the following points in view:
ﬁrst, to introduce vigor and strong
growth into my strain; second, to make
my Amaryllis hybrids fragrant; and
third, to obtain a more numerous ﬂowered
umbel. After having accomplished this,
I never used the variety again. The ﬁrst
and second generation of seedlings had
comparatively long tubes, but in the third,
the wide open form and the short tube
predominated. I still grow this Amaril-
lis, however, for its own sake, and I
always greatly admire it when in bloom.
The long blunt leaves have a decidedly
glaucous green color.
The Parrot Amaryllis (H. psittaci-
num), from southern Brazil, is not a gor-
geously colored species; but it has been
very fruitful in the production of ﬁrst-
class hybrids. The celebrated hybrid,
“Empress of India,” raised by De Graal’f
Bros., 0f Leyden, Holland, one of the
parents of the new race of show Ama-
ryllis, was raised from this species. The
tube is very short. The ground color is
greenish-white and all the segments have
a crimson edge and a green keel, with
crimson stripes radiating from the keel.
At one time, common in cultivation, it
is at present diﬂicult to obtain true to
name. It grows vigorously in Florida,
and is very interesting.
H. rutilum is perhaps the most com-
mon Amaryllis in the forests of southern
Brazil near Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo,
etc., branching out in a number of very
beautiful and distinct varieties. All are
stoloniferous, producing numerous blind
offsets around the base of the bulb, which
may lie dormant for years. In the type
the ﬂowers are bright crimson with a
green keel extending half-way up the seg-
ments. In Milwaukee, where the Amaryl-
lis belongs to the most popular house
plants, I frequently noticed a beautiful
bright yellow Amaryllis suffused with or-
ange. It was even more common than
Amaryllis Johnsoni. I frequently saw spe-
cimens with IO to 20 ﬂowers all open at
the same time. These specimens usually
ﬂower twice a year and the bulbs multi—
ply rapidly by offsets. This Amaryllis
proved to be H. rutilum fulgidum, from
southern Brazil. I procured a few bulbs
and planted them out in my Florida gar-
den, where they soon formed imposing
specimens. A former Floridian, a grad-
ua-te of Rollins College, now in the em-
ploy of the Brazilian Government as a
horticultural expert, Prof. Adolf Hempel,
sent me another beautiful variety, H. ru-
tilum equestriforme, a very strong grow-
ing kind. The ﬂowers remind one some-
what of an Orange Amaryllis. There is
also a yellow form, H. rutilum citrinum,
and a saffron colored subspecies, H. ru-
tilurri crocatum. These two forms, which
would be very important for hybridizing
purposes, I have not yet been able to add
to my collection,
H. aulicum, the Lily of the Palace,
and its ﬁne variety, H. aulicum platy-
petalum, are natives of the Organ moun-
tains, Brazil, where they grow abundantly
among old rotten wood in shady places.
Another still more ﬂoriferous variety. H.
aulicum robustum, comes from Blume-
nau, southern Brazil. They all have
beautiful glossy evergreen leaves, and all
ﬂower about Christmas or New Year’s
time. The form of the large, widely
open ﬂowers is rather unsymmetrical

from a ﬂorist’s point of view, and the
color is a deep, dazzling crimson, very
glowing and rich. My ﬁrst attempt to
grow these plants in the open proved a
failure. They need a rich vegetable soil,
and a liberal supply of old, well rotted
cow-manure. As they all are evergreens
and ﬂower in winter, they also need some
protection. I now grow them in beds
surrounded by boards, so as to be easily
covered, when cold weather sets in. The
soil consists of half-rotten wood. old cow-
manure and black soil from the mucky
edge of the lake. In this compost the
plants grow vigorously and ﬂower abun-
dantly. When in full growth they also
receive a liberal application of commer-
cial fertilizer. preferably bone-meal. This
species and its varieties belong to the
most important ancestors of our new race
of show Amaryllis.
H. Organense, also from the Organ
Mountains. is similar to the above,
though quite distinct when closely
studied. It is a vigorous grower and
ﬂowers in winter with H. aulicum. It
thrives luxuriantly with the same 'treat-
ment.
H, pardinum. This exquisite species
was discovered in 1866 by the late Mr.
Pearce, in the Andes of Peru. It ﬂow-
ered ﬁrst in 1867, and created a sensa-
tion among ﬂower lovers, on account of
its ﬁne form and unique coloration. The
short-tubed, star-like ﬂowers have a
greenish-white ground color, and are pro-
fusely and minutely spotted with crim-
son. Some of the varieties have a de-
cided yellowish ground color and some
are, in addition to the spots, ﬂushed with
red. This species has opened a new ﬁeld
for the hybridizer. The progeny, how-
ever, though of very beautiful form, is
of weak constitution. I have used it at
ﬁrst but have ﬁnally abandoned it. The
inﬂuence of this species is still noticeable
in many of my hybrids, which are min—
utely spotted with deep red on a white
or pink ground.
H. Leopoldi, Leopold’s Amaryllis. This
species was also discovered by the late
Mr. Pearce, in the Andes of Peru, and
it ﬂowered ﬁrst in cultivation in 1870.
It is so beautiful and distinct, so perfect
in form and so reﬁned, and its color is
so unique and so strikingly gorgeous,
that Amaryllis lovers at once placed it
at the head of the entire group. The
ideal of perfect form and exquisite color
combination had at last appeared, and it
was used at once in cross-breeding. The
very large ﬂowers are short-tubed. The
ground color is a beautiful bright red in

lower half of the red, and a large green-
ish-white throat: the tips of all the seg-
ments are white. The beautiful perfect

color, though I have lost the species long
ago.
The foregoing is a list of Amaryllis
which I have grown, and which I mostly
still grow. All of the species and vari-
eties mentioned have been used in cross-

breeding. Though the blood of H. vit—
tatum has been avoided, it is still tracea-
ble through H. Johnsoni, a hybrid of this
species and H, Reginae. I have not been
able to use H. aulicum, but its blood,
nevertheless, ﬂows in the veins of my
strain, as I used H. Ackermanni pucher-
rimum largely in my hybridization work,
and this is a cross between H. aulicum
and H. _Iohnsoni.
Though I have cultivated and raised
Amaryllis since 1879, I did not start
cross-breeding on a large scale before the
year 1890. In the year named, I added to
my collection a few dozen of De Graaff’s
best hybrids and many of Veitch’s new
productions, such as Southey, Enchantress
Madonna. Giant, Giantess, etc. Em-
press of India, a magniﬁcent kind with
broad rounded segments, and of a glow-
ing orange-scarlet color with broad white
bands, was my starting-point. My aim
was to produce a vigorous strain with
short tubes and broad rounded segments,
of symmetrical form and good substance,
The ﬁrst attempts were very encouraging
and the resulting hybrids were far su-
perior to their parents. But the seedlings
were very much alike. In order to obtain
new breaks of color, I used these hybrids
as well as those obtained from Europe,
in crossing them with the various species
in my possession and vice versa. Finally
many thousands of seedlings were grow-
ing in my greenhouse in Milwaukee. The
ﬁrst began to ﬂower at an age of three
years. I watched their development with
a restless anticipation. Most of these
hybrids were inferior to one or both of
their parents, but new colors were abun—
dant. I only kept a few of the best, and
all the rest were discarded. The most
beautiful of all were the crosses between
the best show Amaryllis and H, Leo-
poldii. Hybrids between Empress of
India and H. equestre exhibited ﬁne or-
ange and salmon-red tints. This cross-
breeding and weeding out of all inferior
kinds was continued for many years, un-
til the colors were ﬁxed. Since I900,
I have not made much use of the species
any longer, only using now. in cross—
breeding the best of my own hybrids. I
also employ frequently, as pollen plants,
such English hybrids as have received a
ﬁrst-class certiﬁcate or an award of merit
from the Royal Horticultural Society of
London.
All my hybrids at present combine a
vigorous growth and brilliancy of color
with a ﬁne open symmetrical form and
great substance. The usual size of the
ﬂowers of the true species is from ﬁve
to six inches, in the new race of show
hybrids it ranges from seven to eleven
inches. They range in color from an
almost pure white to a deep glowing crim-
son, without a trace of any other color.
There is rarely a poor ﬂower in a batch
of a thousand seedlings. _ The green star
in the center of the tube, 'so prevailing in
the species and the older hybrids, and
so objectionable to the ﬂorist and ex-
hibitor, no longer mars the beauty of the
flowers. It has given place to a pure
white or a yellowish tint. The variety of
colors is really marvelous in these new
hybrids. There are numerous kinds with
a deep glowing crimson. a dazzling scar-
let or vermilion, a bright orange red
and a delicate salmon ground color. Then
we have deep pink and deep rosy purple
varieties. Most of the brilliant red colors
sparkle in the sun as if overlaid with
gold-dust. Many are crimson selfs.
Others have broad pure white bands;
others a white or lemon yellow star.
Some of the red hybrids have segments

with a pure white edge; others are tipped
with white. There are ﬂowers mottled
red and white, and a crushed strawberry
color is by no means rare. I have ob-
tained a few hybrids with a sulphur-yel—
low ground color, lined and penciled with
red. Some almost pure white ones with
a narrow red band around the edge of
the segments are particularly valuable and
so are other white ones which are densely
and minutely freckled with red. I have
succeeded in raising quite a number of
an almost pure white color, showing only
a few traces of delicate red on the seg—
ments. These are very effective. Many
of my hybrids show the inﬂuence of H.
Leopoldi in their form and color; having
either a deep crimson, a scarlet or even
a salmon ground color, with a white star
and white-tipped segments. All are ever-
green and of vigorous constitution. The
leaves are from two to three feet long,
and are of a deep green or glaucous green
color. When grown in rich soil, they
often exhibit deep reddish-brown or
chocolate-colored tints. In many varieties,
the entire lower part of the leaves shows
a deep purplish-brown hue.
This strain of Amaryllis is of very easy
cultivation, but in order to do their best,
they must have some attention. They
grow as well in sunshine as in half-shade;
on high pine land as well as on lower soil
On a bed a hundred feet long and three
feet wide. three hundred bulbs can be
easily planted. Two loads of cow-man-
ure should be spread over this bed, and
then it must be deeply spaded. Some clay
mixed with the soil will prove beneﬁcial.
The bulbs should be planted in such a
way that the point of the neck is covered
with at least one or two inches of soil.
After having ﬁnished their ﬂowering,
and again in September or October when
in full growth, they require either a top
dressing or two inches of cow-manure or
some good commercial fertilizer, either
bone meal or, still better, Painter’s Simon
P‘ure garden mixture. If in any way
neglected after ﬂowering, the bulbs be-
come so weak that they do not ﬂower the
following season. These Amaryllis are
gross feeders, but manures too rich in
ammonia should be avoided. They rather
require foods rich in phosphoric acid and
potash.
Hippeastrum Johnsoni is hardy as far
north as Washington, if given some pro-
tection. In the gardens of Raleigh, N.
C. it is a rather common plant. The Or-
ange Amaryllis is much more tender, My
show hybrids I think will prove hardy in
all the southern states bordering the Gulf
of Mexico. They will not suffer by cold
if the soil does not actually freeze. They
may lose their foliage, but the bulbs will
remain unhurt. A large bed of these
Amaryllis in full bloom will outrival in
beauty and brilliancy all the true Lilies,
and most other plants.
All the Amaryllis, and even the Cri-
nums and particularly the Hymenocallis
(Spider Lily). suffer a good deal from
the ravages of the Amaryllis caterpillar
and the lubber grasshoppers. The former
often appears in countless numbers on the
underside of the foliage. Here they can
be easily killed. If left undisturbed they
will soon defoliate the entire plant. W hen
larger, they even damage the bulbs by
eating into their centers. Usually on
March I 5, when the Amaryllis are 'in
full bloom, the earliest hordes of lubber
grasshoppers crawl out of the ground;
at ﬁrst small and brownish. then black
with red stripes on their backs, which
change into brighter yellow stripes a little
later. They are ravenous feeders from

the beginning, preferring the members of
the Amaryllis family, particularly Hip-
peastrums, as food plants. They mar the
foliage, eat holes into the ﬂower-stem
and greedily devour the ﬂower-buds. A
constant vigilance is necessary. They
take their meals twice a day—the ﬁrst
right after sunrise, and the second a little
after noontime. After having fed, they
crawl upon a bush or a small tree where
they can easily be seen and killed. The
young ones are gregarious. In dense
masses they alight on slender stems where
all can be killed with one stroke. After
two and a half months have elapsed, they
again change color. This mature color
is a yellowish gray. Their wings are
short and red. Being very clumsy in
their movements, they are easily caught
and killed. It is surprising how much
damage a full-grown lubber grasshopper
can do. Ismenes and Eucharis Amazon-
ica, as well as the beautiful and deli-
ciously fragrant Hymenocallis macroste-
phana, H. fragrans and H. speciosa are
perfectly at home in our garden; but on
account of the lubber grasshoppers it is
scarcely possible to enjoy their flowers
or the beauty of their luxuriant foliage.
Hand picking is, as far as I know, the
only way of getting rid of these two
pests.
The late afternoon hours of spring,
summer and autumn in Florida have an
indescribable charm, a charm peculiarly
their own, and the early morning hours
are scarcely less enchanting. This is the
time to enjoy nature, to enjoy our gardens
and ﬂowers. In the evening glow or very
early in the morning, I am fond of
wandering through my Amaryllis and
Caladium garden to meditate on the in-
effable glory of nature, to think of my
ideals and of all that makes life beautiful.
H‘ow charming is this Florida evening
glow as it falls on the brilliant blossoms
of the Amaryllis or on the gorgeous
leaves of the Caladiums! In the cedars
near by, the cardinal sings. in jubilant
notes its evening hymn, the mockingbird
pours forth its unrivaled melodies from
the top of an orange—tree, and the loud
whistling calls of the chuck-Will’s widow
resound from the thickets of near
woodlands. It is tWilight. The air is
Wonderfully soft and salubrious, and the
bright stars appear and shine as they only
can shine in Florida—the landof ﬂowers,
the land of my ideals in horticulture.

PLANTING FOR HOME ADORNMENT.
By W. C. Steele.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
When I was notiﬁed that I had again
been appointed as a member of the stand-
ing Committee on Ornamentals, I felt
that there was nothing which I could say
that would be worth the time which it
would occupy.
So many able committees have already
made reports covering the entire subject
that it did not seem that there was any-
thing left for me to say.
After some study, I thought that I
would recommend the planting of native
trees for home adornment; but that would
leave out some things which I wanted to
mention, therefore, after changing my
plan several times, I ﬁnally settled upon
the title given at the head of this report,
which will admit of the introduction of
anything which can be made useful for
the purpose.
Those of you who heard President
Taber’s address to this Society at the
meeting in May, 1905, or who read it
as printed in the annual report for that
year, will remember the eloquent tribute
which he gave to the beauties of the na-
tural growth in a thicket near his home.
It is a fact, greatly to be regretted, that
the American people do not appreciate
the beauties of the natural growth around
them. If they can get something which
has been imported at great expense, they
will buy it at a high price, when the
woods are full of much more beautiful
things which may be had for the trouble
of going after them and digging and
bringing them home.
I am a believer in the use of native
plants so far as possible, not to the ex~
clusion of the many beautiful and desira-
ble foreigners which have come to stay,
but rather to supplement them, or to take
their place around many homes where the
expense of these foreign beauties cannot
be afforded.
Of course, the evergreens stand at the
head, the list including Magnolia grandi-
ﬂora and Magnolia glauca, the latter be-
ing known as Sweet Bay. Both are indis~
pensable where the space can be spared to
allow them the room needed for proper
expansion. To them I would add the
Hollies. the common species Ilex opaca,
is so well known that it needs no farther
mention, but it may not be so well known
that there are other species, Ilex Dahoon
and I. cassine which are quite as valuable
and are even Inore showy, when in fruit,
as the red berries are borne in greater
profusion.
It is often desirable to have a tree
during summer where shade is not wanted
in winter, a deciduous species is much
more desirable for such a situation.
One of the best, if not the very best.
of our native species is Acer rubrum, the
soft or swamp maple. It usually blooms
in February or early in March, but this
year it blossomed in January. A single
ﬂower of this tree is small and incon-
spicuous, but a large specimen covered
with clusters of blossoms, which are
found at the end of every twig, is very
showy and attracts a great deal of atten-
tion. The ﬂowers are bright scarlet and
the seeds as soon as formed, and until
ready to "drop, retain the same bright

color. The only objection to it, is the
fact that it produces large crops of seed
which drift a long ways when the wind
blows hard and as they germinate readily
they become a nuisance, unless there is a
drouth at the time when they fall. Al—
though this maple is a native of swamps
and low land, its common name being
swamp or soft maple, still it will grow
well on dry soil if it is not too poor,
Probably the next most desirable native
deciduous tree for ornamental planting,
is the Sweet Gum, Liquidambar styraci-
ﬂua. Like the maple described above, it
is found naturally, in swamps or moist
land, but it still more easily adapts itself
to dry land culture and is not so depend-
ent on rich soil. It is one of the most
symmetrical trees that we have, when al-
lowed space in which to develop itself
properly. In autumn it shows the most
brilliant coloring of any of our native
trees. Although it is a deciduous species,
it retains its foliage later than most spe-
cies; often the old leaves hang on until
pushed off by the swelling of the buds
as the new leaves open. Occasionally the
same thing happens with the soft Maple.
I had a small maple this season which re-
tained much of last year’s foliage on the
upper twigs, when the lower part of the
tree was in bloom, and a few still hung
on when the seeds were grown and the
new leaves were more than half grown.
I have more than a dozen of these trees
on the place, and this spring was sur-
prised to notice that there was a great
difference in the time when they opened
their leaves; on some the leaves would be
almost grown, while on others not forty
feet away, on exactly the same soil, the
buds were but little more than fairly open.
While on this subject of curious varia-
tions in the habits of growth of trees,
I will call attention to a fact which may
or may not have been noticed by you.
All evergreen trees shed their leaves, but
usually it is done so gradually, while the
new ones are coming, that it is not not-
iced. This year some Magnolia glauca
trees near my house shed their leaves so
nearly all at once, that they were quite
bare and looked for a time like deciduous
trees; it happened just as the ﬁrst ﬂow—
ers were opening, and their almost leaf-
less branches showing here and there
scattered blossoms were a striking con-
trast to their usual appearance.
Another plant, also a native, which is
usually classed as a shrub, but which can
easily be grown as a small tree, is the
common Elder, Sambucus Canadensis.
At the north it is called a weed, but here
it is an evergreen shrub or small tree and
is almost everblooming. A specimen on
my own place trained to a single stem,
stands between eighteen and twenty feet
high with a trunk over six inches in dia-
meter. It is seldom out of bloom, ex-
cept for a short time in the coldest
weather of winter. During the summer
it usually has ﬂowers and fruit of all
sizes from that just formed to fully ripe
berries, though the latter are soon taken
off by the birds.
Vines, especially woody perennials, are
always favorites with all ﬂower lovers.
Three native hardy climbers are worthy
of special mention. Bignona capreolate
sometimes called Cross—vine, is perhaps
the most showy in the early spring. The
individual ﬂowers are rather dull red in
color. but when you come to a large oak
literally covered with a sheet of Bignonia
capreolata blossoms, it is a sight worth
going miles to look at. I have good-

sized oaks when there was hardly a
leaf visible so thoroughly was the top
covered with the bloom of this vine.
Tecoma radicans, usually catalogued as
Bignonia radicans, is another vigorous
growing native vine; the ﬂowers are scar-
let, a much brighter color than those of
capreolata, but it is not so profuse a
bloomer at one time; that is, while it may
produce as many blossoms in a season,
yet as they are scattered over a period of
several weeks, instead of all opening at
once, they do not make so great a display.
Bignonia capreolata is found in high ham-
mocks on dry soil, while Tecoma radicans
is generally found in cypress ponds; but,
like many other natives of low land, it
easily adapts itself to circumstances and
will grow well on high land, if not too
poor.
Last, but by no means least, I will men-
tion the Yellow Jessamine, Gelsemium
sempervirens. The wild species is so well
known that I should not mention it at
all, were it not that I wish to call atten-
tion to the fact that the double-ﬂowered
form is much more desirable than the
single. It is- not quite so profuse a
bloomer as the wild form, or at least it
does not show as many at one time, but
as the blooming period is much longer,
it may produce as many in a year. Last
fall my double-ﬂowered vines began to
bloom in November, and kept it up until
the latter part of February or the ﬁrst of
March.
So far I have conﬁned myself to native
species which anyone can have for the
trouble of going into the woods and dig-
ging them; the last mentioned is an ex-
ception, it is not offered, so far as I know,
except by the P, J. Berckmans Nursery
Company of Augusta, Ga., and they will
not send any plants by mail. I hope that
some uf our Florida nurserymen will pro~
pagate and offer for sale this very de-
sirable variety.
Three years ago, Mrs. Gates, in her
report on Ornamentals, recommended a
wild vine, a species of Smilax, very
highly. I do not think that she said a
word too much in its praise. Unfor-
tunately she did not know its botanical
name, nor have I been able to learn it; it
is a wild Smilax and that is all that I am
able to tell as to its name; but I can tell
you how to ﬁnd it. If you will watch
the hammock woods very closely, in early
spring, until you ﬁnd a vine that is a
strong, vigorous grower and bears a pro-
fusion of small greenish ﬂowers which
have the fragrance of Mignonette only
intensiﬁed, that is the one for which you
are looking.
While on the subject of vines, I want
to recommend some which are not natives
and therefore must be purchased or pro-
cured by exchange with some neighbor.
Foremost stands Rhynchosperum Jasmi-
noides, sometimes called Star Jessamine,
although it is not at all related to the
Jessamine family. The vine is a strong,
v i g o r o u s grower, perfectly hardy
throughout this state, and for several
weeks in early spring it covers itself with
a sheet of pure white, very fragrant blos-
soms; the ﬂowers are so thickly set on the
branches that the foliage is hidden from
sight. The only objection which I have
ever felt towards this vine was that in
the evening the perfume is so strong that
it is almost overpowering. If you are at
all sensitive to strong odors, do not set
this vine very close to the house.
Bignonia speciosa, Bignonia Thun-
bergiana, Pithecoctineum clematideum,
usually catalogued as Bignonia alba, and
Pithecoctineum Kayense ( ?) ; the last

name was given me provisionally by the
Missouri Botanic Garden from specimens
which did not reach them in very good
condition. These four species are all
hardy, are vigorous growers and bear a
profusion of beautiful ﬂowers in the
spring. When I say that they are hardy,
I mean throughout the orange belt; they
will not stand an indeﬁnite amount of
cold, but have not been killed on my place
for several years.
A m p e l o p s i s tricuspidata, the A.
Veitchi of the catalogues, and commonly
called Boston Ivy or Japanese Ivy, is per-
fectly hardy, but not evergreen. This
vine has every desirable feature for a
screen, except that it sheds its leaves in
winter. In some situations this is not a
drawback and for such places no better
plant can be found. The north-east end
of my house is covered from the ground
up to the roof by this vine, except parts
of two windows which it is difﬁcult to
keep clear enough to allow the light to
enter. The light green leaves are so
close, lapping like shingles, that no rain
can reach the siding during the summer.
When the wind blows strong, from either
side, the foliage moves up and down like
waves of water.
Another climbing plant which I have
tested quite thoroughly, deserves to be
more generally cultivated. I refer to
Gloriosa superba, the climbing Lily, this
plant is a member of the true Lily family,
and is so gloriously beautiful that it well
deserves the name Gloriosa. The ﬂowers
are perfect Lilies in form and when fully
developed are a rich scarlet in color. The
opening buds are a greenish yellow,
which changes to pure yellow and then
to scarlet. No lady who has ever seen
it on my place has failed to express great
delight at its wonderful beauty. The
plant is an herbaceous perennial, the bulbs
live over in the open ground without any
protection, coming up year after year.
One caution is necessary; when growth
'starts be careful that the tip of a shoot
is not broken off, for if it is, then all
growth stops. Most plants will sprout
from the axil of a leaf, if the end is
broken off, but the Gloriosa never does.
My subject is a fascinating one, and
when I begin I hardly know where to
stop. There are so many plants worthy
of cultivation which are but little known,
that it is difﬁcult to know what to men-
tion and what to leave out. Probably the
best plan will be to stop right here and
tell you to study the uncultivated lands
around you; you will be surprised to ﬁnd
how many beautiful things are growing
there which are unknown to you.

THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THE FLOW ER GARDEN.
By Mahlon Gore.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Horticulture, as a commercial asset,
should not be underestimated. With
us, who are interested in this Associa-
tion, horticulture, in its reﬁning and
elevating inﬂuence upon the human
family, is no less valuable. We seldom
see a real lover of ﬂowers who is coarse
and vulgar in his nature. How many of
us can trace our ﬁrst noble impulses to
Mother’s ﬂower garden? How many of
us plucked ﬂowers from that garden with
which to win the smiles of our chum’s
coy little sister? Babies love ﬂowers and
are attracted \by their beauty and fra—
grance. We ornament our houses and
our tables with them; we bedeck our bride
with ﬂowers, and we place ﬂowers on the
graves of our departed loved ones.
The ﬂowers of Florida have already
attracted thousands of visitors who, later
on, have cast their lots with us and are
now counted among our most desirable
citizens. “There is a use in beauty,”
and nowhere is the adage exempliﬁed
with more force than among horticultur-
ists. And still we do not make the most
of these gifts of the Creator in adding
to the attractiveness of our homes and
our state. As a purely business proposi-
tion I believe that we might add twenty-
ﬁve per cent. to the commercial value of
our possessions if we would give suf-
ﬁcient time and attention to the cultiva-
tion of ﬂowers and ornamental plants and
shrubs. What is of more value still,
would be the added charm of home to
our children; their greater interest in
and love for home, and the reﬁning ef-
fect upon their developing intellects. The
boy who loves ﬂowers to such a degree
that he will delight to cultivate them, will
ﬁnd little time to spend in the saloon, and
will have little inclination to go there for
amusement.
We old men know that the girl who
cultivates ﬂowers for love of them is far
more lovable than her sister wh05e chief
delight is matinees and social excitements,
although these last are not to be tabooed
by any means, for they give the girls the
opportunity to add to their own charms
through dainty ﬂoral adornment.
We all love beauty, and we are richer
in mind for this love. \Ve might be
richer in purse if we would devote more
time and attention to aesthetic horticul-
ture. I believe that one hour a day on
the part of each member of this Associa-
tion, devoted to the cultivation of ﬂowers
and ornamental plants, for the period of
ﬁve years, would add one hundred thou-
sand intelligent, reﬁned people to the
population of Florida. Every city and
town in the state should vie with all the
others in adding ltO its attractions for
new settlers. The competition should be
sharp, determined and continuous. Each
home should have its ﬂoral gem of a
ﬂower garden. Each resident should try
to outdo his neighbor. Each town should
try to outshine all of the rest. Every
country home should have its little orna-
mental park.
With such a state of things, Florida
would be the most charming state in the

Union, the most talked-about, the most
thoroughly and favorably advertised spot
in all the world. This is no ﬂight of fancy.
It is easily within our reach if are but wake
up. I would make the work State-wide;
organize ﬂoriculture associations in every
community, with ﬂoral exhibits at each
monthly meeting; study landscape gar-
dening and ﬂoral and plant effect; and,
ﬁnally, forever end those oft-heard and
oft-repeated ("pressions of disappoint-
ment indulged in by tourists and visitors
over the fact that “there are so few ﬂow-
ers in Florida.”

Irrigation.
By Francis L. Wills.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In reply to your letter asking me
for a paper on irrigation, would say
that we installed our irrigating plant
on this grove in April, 1905. The plant
consists of a twenty-horse-power,
White-Blakeslee gasoline engine and a
No. 4 Rumsey Improved Rotary
Pump, located in a house thirty feet
from the pond and about two hundred
feet from the grove. The pump has a
ﬁve-inch suction and a four-inch dis-
charge giving two hundred ﬁfty gal-
lons of water per minute; we have a
four-inch main pipe, running the en-
tire length of the grove, every 150
feet; laterals branch off from the main,
running the entire width of the grove;
the laterals start out with two—inch
pipe, running down to one-inch pipe, at
the extreme end.
Our stanchions consist of a three-
quarter—inch pipe, with a hose valve
on top, and are 150 feet apart through-
out the entire grove. When irrigating
we use loo-foot sections of three-quar-
ter-inch hose, connecting one end to
the stanchions and the other end to a
six-foot piece of three-quarter-inch
iron piping, drawn together and sharp-
ened at one end to stick into the
ground with a tee and nipple for hose
connection eighteen inches from the
bottom, the top ﬁtted with a three-
quarter-inch brass Magowan Spray,
the stanchions when running throw a
spray that will cover thirty feet and
we move the stanchions from one mid-
dle to another, until every middle has
been thoroughly wet down.
We usually run twenty stanchions at
a time and leave them standing in each
middle forty minutes, thus giving each
middle or tree 480 gallons of water,
which I think is equal to a little over
three-quarters of an inch of rain.
We have made it a practice to irri- '
gate the grove whenever the moisture

summer or winter, during the months
of March, April and May we run an
Acme Harrow over the grove as soon
as it is irrigated. During a drouth we
ﬁnd it necessary to irrigate once every
two or three weeks, harrowing the
grove once every week; this keeps a
good moisture under the sand mulch
at all times.
We have under irrigation thirty
acres of grove.
The plant, as I have described it,
cost us a little over $6,000 and as yet,
the plant being new, we have not had
to lay out anything for repairs. I run
the engine myself and have one man
at $1.50 a day to move the stanchions
from place to place.
The engine consumes practically
twenty-ﬁve gallons of gasoline, run-
ning from nine to ten hours a day, and

ten acres; so I calculate that to irri-

This does not include wear and tear on

When irrigating in hot weather we
start our engine up as soon as it is
light enough to see, and run it ﬁve
hours; then we start up again in the
afternoon at three and run until seven.
The ﬁrst year we irrigated we ran the
engine steadily from daylight until
dark; but I became convinced that it
was not a good plan to throw water
into the grove in the heat of the day.
Of course, it would be much better to
irrigate at night rather than the day,
but this is not practical, as I have yet
.to ﬁnd men who will drag hose around
through the grove in the dark.
Some say it is a question whether
or not irrigation pays. All I can say
is that our trees look well and we seem
to get a pretty fair crop of fruit each
year.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
To the tourist or winter visitor,
Florida presents a most beautiful pic-
ture or panoramic view of ﬂowers and
sunshine; of magniﬁcent and extensive
evergreen forests, dotted here and
there by beautiful lakes whose waters
are as clear as crystal, and as pure and
sparkling as the morning dew. He
is delighted with our glorious climate,
our orange groves laden with their
golden fruit, and our truck farms em-
bracing broad acres of growing veg-
etables. He is impressed by the scenes
of nervous activity and evidences of
enterprise and prosperity on every
hand, and especially in and around our
packing houses during the shipping
season. He hears and reads of vast
sums of money being made by the fruit
and vegetable growers in various parts
of the state. He is delighted with all
he sees or hears, and, in fact, it seems
to him that Nature has almost ex-
hausted her resources in making of
Florida a veritable horticulturists’
paradise, leaving nothing to be desired
which could in any way contribute to
his happiness or success. And from
his standpoint the tourist is right in
his conclusions. Florida is a grand
state, possessing many natural advan-
tages and horticultural possibilities for
which we hereby express our thanks
and gratitude to the One from whom
all such blessings must come. We all
love our Florida and appreciate her
many natural advantages and also
those which have been brought about
by the efforts of her enterprising citiz-
ens; and our hearts are bound to her
by invisible and mysterious ties which
we cannot possibly understand nor ex-
plain and which grow stronger as the
years go by.
But, at the same time, those of us

who have spent many years here, and
have on several occasions seen the
smiling features of our fair state dis-
ﬁgured almost beyond recognition by
natural causes, are forced to admit
that Florida also has several natural
disadvantages, among which may be
mentioned the poverty of the soil, un-
expected visits from jack-frost in win-
ter, the insufficiency of rainfall during
the growing season, and a pretty good
supply of insect pests of all of the lead-
ing and up-to-date varieties; and one
or two other disadvantages from which
nature is not responsible, viz.: the high
freight rates and poor services im-
posed upon us by the railroads.
Some of these adverse conditions
have been overcome by artiﬁcial
means, and most of the others can
and must be, or the horticultural in-
dustry will be overcome by them; and
as I understand it, one of the principal
objects of this Society as a body, and
of each member as an individual, is to
give each other the beneﬁt of what-
ever knowledge or experience we may
have gained in our attempts to meet
and overcome any one or all of these
difﬁculties.
The problem of poor soil has been
solved to the satisfaction of all con-
cerned by the fertilizer manufacturers
of the state, who have placed within
our reach, in convenient and available
form, all of the necessary elements of
plant food so essential to plant life,
and in which our Florida sand is so
deﬁcient; thereby enabling us to not
only make two blades of grass grow
where only one grew before, but even
making it possible for us to grow good
crops of fruits and vegetables where
nothing could grow before; thus, in
my opinion, placing the fertilizer man-
ufacturer in the front rank of public
benefactors. The Florida Experiment
Station and also the United States De-
partment of Agriculture have given
and are still giving us valuable infor-
mation along the line of insect exter-
mination, by sending to our assistance
specialists of the highest order, men
specially trained and ﬁtted for this
kind of work, who are industriously
devoting their time and talents to sci-
entiﬁc investigations and experiments
along these lines. It has been my
privilege to become acquainted with
several of these gentlemen during the
past two years and make myself some-
what familiar with the work they are
doing, and it gives me pleasure to say
to this Society that they are meeting
with success and are getting results
which could never have been obtained
in any other way and which will be of
inestimable value to the horticulturists
of Florida.
We look to the Railroad Commis-
sion, to the Inter-State Commerce
Commission, and the Florida Fruit and
Vegetable Growers’ Protective Asso-
ciation, for reduced freight rates and
better transportation facilities.
50 with all of the other problems
disposed of, we now come to the ques-
tion of irrigation. This scarcity of
rainfall during the growing season,
just when rain is most needed, is, in
my opinion, the most serious difﬁculty
with which the fruit and vegetable
grower has to deal. It causes him
more disappointments, more heart
aches than all of the others combined;
it sours his disposition, causes him to

grow old before his time and, in fact,
at times it causes him to almost doubt
the existence and guidance of an im-
partial and all-wise Providence.
These conditions have been grad-
ually growing worse for the past two
or three seasons, until at the present
time irrigation, which is, of course, the
only remedy, is regarded as an almost
absolute necessity. A good many
growers who happened to be favorably
situated as to water supply, who were
sufﬁciently informed as to what kind
of irrigation they needed and had the
means to pay for it, have put in irri-
gating plants which are working suc—
cessfully and which have made their
owners independent of rainfall. But
most of these plants have been in-
stalled at an expense which places
them out of reach of the orange
grower, one of my neighbors having
just completed a plant which cost him
over $10,000.00. It consists of one
mile of six-inch wrought iron pipe,
enough smaller pipe to form a com-
plete network under his grove of about
I20 acres, and a rotary pump driven
by a ﬁfty-horse-power engine. The
water is delivered through patent
sprinklers which are placed in the
centre between each four trees; he can
run forty of these sprinklers at once,
thus watering forty trees at one time.
This kind of irrigation is all right
for those who can afford it, but is be-
yond the reach of about ninety-nine
per cent. of us, and for this reason it
is not necessary for me to enter into
a detailed description of it at this time.
What is needed is a system of irriga-
tion which can be installed at a cost
within the reach of the average grower
of limited means and yet of sufficient
capacity to meet all of his require-
ments.
For the past eight years I have had
charge of the property of Chase & Co.
at \Naco. This property consists of
the famous Isleworth groves and nurs-
eries and, incidentally, an extensive ir-
rigating plant of about the same ca-
pacity in gallons of water as the one
above mentioned and costing about
one-eighth as much. I have visited
and made myself familiar with the
workings of irrigation plants of nearly
every kind or system now being used
in our part of the State, but for hand-
ling vast quantities of water 'at the
least possible expense, which is, of-
course, what the grower of limited
means wants to do, I have never seen
anything to equal our plant.
A description of our pump and
method of distributing the water over
the grave will be found in the report
of last year’s meeting, but for the
beneﬁt of those who may not have
been present at that meeting I will
give a brief description here. The pump
consists simply of a square box two
feet in diameter inside and \about eigh-
teen feet high, or about six feet above
the highest point in our grove. This
box stands one end in the edge of the
lake, where water should be two to
three feet deep. Through the center
of this box, from top to bottom, there
is a steel shaft, with a water wheel on
the bottom end; another one of the
same kind in the middle and a pulley
at the top for connecting with the en-
gine. This bottom wheel, by being
revolved at a high rate of speed. lifts
a column of water two feet square, up
to the upper wheel, which catches it
in the same way and carries it out at
an opening near the top of the box,

and just below the belt and pulley. In
case of a higher lift being required all
that is necessary would be to increase
the length of the box and shaft, put in
another water wheel about seven or
eight feet higher up, put on more
power and go ahead. From the top
of the pump the water is conducted
across the middle of the grove through
a ten-inch terra cotta pipe; thence
from this ten—inch main to either side
of the grove through a ﬁve-inch gal-
vanized-iron pipe of about the thick-
ness and weight of small stove pipe
and connected up in the same way, but
in sections ten feet long.
Our pump will supply about four of
these lines of ﬁve-inch pipe at one
time; sometimes in case we are short
on piping we run one or more of these
ﬁve-inch openings in furrows. This
running water in furrows in Florida
sand has always been theoretically im-
possible, but we have proved beyond
question, by actual experience, that it
works very successfully indeed; and, in
fact, I consider it one of the best, if
not the very best, method now being
used; and I would especially recom-
mend it to vegetable growers. We
can ﬁll four or ﬁve furrows from each
opening in our ten-inch main, and by
using the furrow system exclusively
we can have about twenty furrows 600
to 700 feet long running at one time.
This will give you some idea of the
capacity of our pump, and also give
you an idea how effective this system
would be in irrigating vegetables. The
imagination of the trucker could not
possibly conceive a more pleasing pic-
ture than to go out some evening
about sundown and ﬁnd twenty little
rivers of cool, fresh water ﬂowing
gently down between twenty rows of his
withering vegetables.
I had, as the title of this paper sug-
gests, intended giving quite an exten-
sive collection of facts and ﬁgures as
to cost of irrigation supplies of differ-
ent kinds, but as I believe this part of
the subject will be more thoroughly
and ably covered by Mr. Skinner, I
will only give a few points along this
line in connection with this particular
system of irrigation.
The pump we are using is known as
the Menge pump and is manufactured
in New Orleans at a cost of about $150
at the factory. The terra cotta- piping
of various sizes can be had at about
the following prices, delivered to dif-
ferent parts of the state:
10-inch 25 cents per foot
8-inch 17 cents per foot
5-inch IO cents per foot
4-inch 8 cents per foot
The ﬁve-inch galvanized pipe comes at
about ten cents per foot, delivered.
For locations where lake water is
available, and the lift not more than
ﬁfteen feet, there is nothing better nor
cheaper than the Menge rotary pump.
For higher lift I would recommend a
centrifugal pump, which will not only
lift the water but also force it to any
height up to about thirty-ﬁve feet.
The capacity and cost of these four-
teen pumps range about as follows:
A pump with a capacity of 100 gallons
per minute will cost about $110; 450
gallons per minute, $210; 1,000 gal-
lons per min., $360; and others, large
or smaller in proportion. A pump fur-
nishing 600 gallons per minute will
cover one and three-tenths acres one
inch deep in one hour, or 13 and one-
ﬁfth acres one inch deep in ten hours.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I received a letter from Prof. Rolfs
asking me to give a little talk on irri-
gation. I am always ready to talk on
irrigation, but I was not posted as to
what special branch of irrigation I was
expected to talk on, until I came into
Gainesville. ‘
My experience has been entirely
with what is called the sprinkling sys-
tem. \Vhen I ﬁrst had an idea of tak-
ing up irrigation, I felt that I had to
take it up if I were going to grow or-
anges as a business and make a suc-
cess. Of course, the ﬁrst question
that came into my mind was, where to
get the water. There were only two
ways: from a pond and from a well.
I spent a little time going to see the
irrigating plants through the state,
and among them was one of Mr.
Adams of Thonotosassa. His struck
me as being the best I saw. It con-
sisted of large pipes with small mains
connected with them. running to dif-
ferent parts of the grove. From these
laterals were standpipes to which the
hose was attached. By using the hose
he was able to get along without using
so much iron pipe. To the hose were
attached the McGowan sprinklers,
which he considered the best in all re-
spects. They throw a large amount
of water and throw a very ﬁne spray
with plenty of force all over between

words, one inch of rainfall, will wet
thoroughly six to eight inches of per-
fectly dry Florida sand.
Skinner.
the trees. It struck me as being the
best and most successful system I had
seen, and_he had a ﬁne crop of fruit
from his grove.
At that time, iron pipe was beyond
my reach, and I investigated the ad-
visability of using cement pipe. The
best iron main will cost thirty-ﬁve
and forty cents a foot for four-
inch pipe. I think a six-acre grove
irrigating plant with steam pump and
boiler, iron pipe, etc., will cost in the
neighborhood of $1,000.00. I had
plenty of muscle, time and some labor.
I investigated the cement pipe and
made up my mind that it would do.
I bought a machine and a car of ce-
ment and went to work. \Ve turned out
lots of pipe; I now have about 35.000
feet of that cement pipe. It has cost
from three to six cents a foot; gen-
erally about four cents; but there is
no time to stand around when you
make it at even four cents. I think
you can possibly make it at an average
of ﬁve cents. .
You dig your ditch and put your
machine right in it, and make the ce-
ment pipe as you go along. cleaning
out your machine when stopping at
noon or night and starting again. I tried
to make a solid joint by pressing the
cement together with my hands about
the core of the machine, but found that
it would not do. \IVhen I put on my
12

power, every joint burst and there was
‘ trouble right away. A gentleman who
has made and uses this pipe told me
that though the weak places in his ce-
ment pipe had broken, he had patched
them until the pipe was all right. I
began to ﬁnd that there were weak
places and ﬁxed them up by this
method. \Vhen I stopped making the-
pipe at any one joint, I set the ma-
chine down in the ditch farther along
and went on, leaving that gap. After-
wards I put the machine on the ground
and made some pipe for ﬁlling these
gaps and sawed it into the proper
lengths (you can pick up ﬁve or six
or seven feet) and set it in the section.
Then I set the right length into the
gap and wrapped some wire loosely
around the joint; then took some ce-
ment well mixed and spread it around
and in the wire completely. That
joint will never break. Just wind some
wire loosely around it and ﬁll it in with
cement, spreading it quite liberally,
and it will answer every purpose. Any
small wire will do; I generally use
small, galvanized wire.
\Ve generally put in the hydrants
the following morning after the ce-
ment pipe is made. Scrape the top
of the cement away so as to give a
new- surface. When you are running
your irrigating plant and the hydrants
break out, by using this wire plan,
winding wire around again and again
loosely and ﬁlling it up with cement,
it will be tight and ready for use on
the following day.
I ﬁnd this cement pipe very satis-
factory. I have tried the McGowan
nozzle. It has a little small top that
screws down to regulate the amount
of water. Sometimes it is screwed
down too tight and sometimes too
loose and you are apt to have trouble
if you don’t look after it pretty care-
fully. Cement pipe will stand a good
deal of pressure, but not as much as
iron pipe. You have all heard the
story of the man down at the Tampa
Bay Hotel, who had a big head on
him the morning after a festive even-
ing. The manager took one of our
ﬁnest Florida grapefruit and ﬁxed it
up with a little ice and sugar and a
little French brandy and gave it to
him. Pretty soon the man came down
and asked for his bill and said, “I am
going to New York to tell the boys,
‘Eureka, I have found it.’ ” The Cac-
tus sprinkler affected me very much
the same way. \Vhen I saw it I felt
like exclaiming, “Eureka, I have found
it and must tell the boys." From
a four-inch pipe I have seen it throw
the water in a circle thirty-ﬁve feet in
diameter, wetting it well in just a few
minutes. It puts water on in the ﬁnest
kind of spray. They are very simple
and last a long time. There is only
one that is any good for our irrigation,
and that is No. 10, one-inch size. It
will put on lots of water and in ﬁne
shape and at low pressure.
In the above system of iron pipe, the
laterals are of two-inch pipe from a
four-inch main. It waters about forty
acres and costs about $3,000.00. To
ﬁx it up with cement pipe it would cost
about one-third as much. The Chase
& Co. system at Lake Butler, where
there is an ample supply of water, is
the cheapest plan there is, but you
must have unlimited water. If your
water supply is unlimited. you can
take terra cotta pipe and the Mean’s
pump and throw a world of water on

the ground, but where you have a
limited amount of water and the
ground is not situated where you can
make the water ﬂow, I think the ce-
ment system with Cactus sprayers is
the best and cheapest system I have
even seen.

DISCUSSION. .
Dr. Inman—How far under the sur-
face do you lay the cement pipe?
Mr. Skinner—Twelve inches.
Dr. Richardson—VVhat is the name
of the sprinkler of which you speak?
Mr. Skinner—Cactus Lawn Sprin-
kler, No. IO. They are made by the
Phrenger and Hanger Company and
are for sale by the Baird Hardware
Company, Gainesville, who are the
state agents.
The most perfect system of irriga-
tion for vegetables that I have ever
seen is at Sanford. It is a revelation.
Their system of irrigation with ar-
tesian wells is really marvelous.
Mr. Rose—I am not well acquainted
with the Sanford system. As Mr.
Winters has described it. there are
varieties of the same system. There
are admirable systems where the tile
is perfectly laid: where the irrigation
where needed is perfect and drainage
where wanted is perfect. The greatest
trouble is that the ﬁelds frequently get
more water than they want and their
plants take diseases and die.
Mr. Skinner—The place I visited
specially, had the tile so arranged that
the gardener could draw the water off.
I was told by Mr. Chase and some of
the ,men who lived there, that in
former years water would stand all
over the country, but now the drains
are all open, and when the artesian
wells are shut off by the gate valve,
the water ﬂows off in a few hours.
The men who had the best ﬁelds had
level ﬁelds.
That system has gradually grown up
by their needs and their wants, and it
certainly has served their purpose. It
certainly has proven a great success.
I do not believe I have seen so many
new homes going up in Florida. Men
who used to get two dollars and three
dollars a day are now getting thou-
sands a year. easy.
“'e all agree that with plenty of fer-
tilizer, plenty of water when we want
it, and a way provided to carry off
water when we do not want it, there is
no place on earth that will blossom
like Florida.

Shipping and Growing of Vegetables.
v\
-_
By N. 0.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am called on at this meeting for a
paper treating on the growing and ship-
ping of vegetables,—a large and an im-
portant subject, one that not only re-
quires, but deserves a great deal of
thought; and unfortunately for me one
that I am not as familiar with now as
one should be when preparing a paper.
It is now several years since I have
had any active experience with the veg-
etable business, and accordingly I shall
only give you some of the conclusions
arrived at at that time together with my
observations since. '
I have no apologies to offer for know-
ing so little about this subject. I am sim-
ply here with this paper because I am
called upon, and I feel that it is the duty
of every citizen to respond when called
upon to the best of his ability, and that
is what I am now doing.
The demand of our markets is for
strictly fancy produce as well as fruits
and it is only by catering to this de-
mand that the grower is able to make
money. Poor and inferior stuff seems
to be a drug on the market at any price,
a thousand crates of fancy goods will sell
before one of inferior grade.
Among the most successful practices
seems to be that of irrigation and drain-
age. There does not seem to be any
standard for water supply, some are us-
ing windmills, others artesian wells.
while still others are using gasoline en-
Penny.
gines and pumps. The locality and
source of supply seem to be the deter-
mining features. As far as we can learn
results are good from all, but probably
the least efficient is the windmill, which
I think is being gradually superseded by
the gas engine, especially so where large
quantities of water are required.
Drainage also appears to be one of the
fundamental requirements. It appearing
to intelligent growers that if we cannot
depend on Dame Nature for water when
we need it, neither can we depend upon
her not to send us more than we need,
and growers ﬁnd that a ﬂood is as bad
as a drouth.
Drainage is usually accomplished by
means of open ditches and underdrains,
I believe that the most approved prac-
tice is in having the system so arranged
that they can be used for both irriga-
tion and drainage at the will of the op-
erator. The grower can then protect
himself in either a wet or a dry time.
More attention is being paid to inten-
sive culture, intelligent growers ﬁnd that
one acre properly cared for will produce
more than two indifferently cultivated,
and at the same time there will be a
larger per cent, of that most important
essential fancy quality.
A great deal of attention is also being
paid to the use of fertilizers, and it is
not uncommon for growers to use two
and three thousand pounds per acre
where but a few years ago it was only


## p. 183 (#725) ############################################

customary to use that many hundreds of
pounds. This is not becoming necessary
_ on account of any impoverished condition
of the soil, but growers ﬁnd that it is a
paying investment, one that pays very
large dividends.
There also seems to be a tendency to
specialization at certain points. I will
cite Sanford for celery, Hastings for p0-
tatoes, etc. There are many advantages
derived from this, and where it is possi-
ble for him to do so the grower will do
well to take advantage of them. I will
not undertake to enumerate all the ad-
vantages that may be derived from so
doing, but will mention a few that occur
to me at this particular moment. First
we are sure of our land and the crops
it will produce; we get the beneﬁt of car
lot rates, direct line transportation, cash
buyers, and lastly but not least we se-
cure the beneﬁt of all prestige and reputa-
tion this particular point has in the
markets of our country. That this is
a very valuable asset, is best illustrated
in this way. It not only amounts to
quick sales, but very often in an advance
or higher price of at least 25c. on the
crate over the same quality of unknown
goods. All these things are a handicap
to the grower who does not avail himself
of these advantages, and quite frequently
it amounts to all his proﬁts.
I do not mean to say that a grower
or growers cannot build up a reputation
for any particular point, or any particular
product, but I do say, my friends, that it
is uphill work, and a long pull; and if
we can arrange to take advantage of a
reputation already established it will more
than pay to do so.
METHODS OF PACKING.
Growing a crop is scarcely half the
battle. The successful grower provides
a packing house of ample size, wherein
to handle his crops with rapidity, he has
also provided all the facilities that are
essential for the handling of his crops.
He will provide the best of crates. He
has also furnished himself with stencils
for each and every mark that goes on
a crate, and under no circumstances al-
lows a pencil to be used for any mark.
He has also provided each year printed
wraps if his crops are such as can be
wrapped, each wrap being printed with
a fac-simile of the brand that is used on
each crate. He will gather his crops at
the proper time, see that they are very
carefully handled to avoid all damage
from bruising, etc. See that his crates
are all neatly and securely nailed, and
made in the best possible manner, the bet-
ter to withstand transportation, and that
they may present a better appearance on
the market. He will see that his produce
is all properly cleaned, and washed if
needed, that it is properly graded to a
high standard, that it is carefully sized,
and well packed. All crates being uni-
form, only one grade and size in each
crate, and that grade and size plainly
and neatly stenciled on one end of each
crate.
He also sees that each crate bears his
own particular brand either stenciled or
printed on one end, and that all stencil-
ing is done in a neat and systematic man-
ner, and presents a good appearance.
And when delivery is made to the trans-
portation company each crate is in a con-
dition that barring accidents or delays it
will arrive on the market in prime con-
dition,
There is a tendency among the best
growers, especially individual shippers to
select one good ﬁrm in one or two cities

tage, and ship to them each year, year
after year. It places their goods on
sound business basis, and does not bring
it into competition with itself. and in a
short time they will often build up a
trade that is enviable. No sensible
grower will change his house without
serious cause. He cannot afford to do
it for in so doing he throws away all
the pfestige and reputation he has been
years in building up. He would in chang-
ing have to begin all over again with a
new ﬁrm, and the new ﬁrm’s customers.
It is like going into a strange city. It
requires a long time to become ac-
quainted with its people, and it is the
same way in the produce markets,
GROWING AND SHIPPING CELERY AND PEPPERS.
By W. E.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The ﬁrst thing necessary is good land,
well drained and irrigated; subirrigation
is the best. The next important thing
is good seed which can be obtained from
any good seedsman. The best varieties
to grow are “Golden Self Blanching Cel-
ery,” and “Ruby King Peppers.” An-
other consideration is good fertilizer.
This can be obtained from any reliable
fertilizer company. Be careful not to
use fertilizer that runs high in ammonia,
as it will cause heart-rot in celery and
black-rot in peppers. Fertilizer should
run at least IO per cent. in potash and
not over 3 per cent. in ammonia. Lands
should be thoroughly cleared off, well
plowed and harrowed thirty days before
planting. Fertilizer should be applied
broadcast and harrowed in both ways
ten days before planting and land thor-
oughly irrigated. For celery one ton per
acre should be applied before planting,
and one-half ton ﬁve weeks after plant-
ing by spreading in the middle of rows,
harrowing or plowing in, always plowing
Robinson.
shallow after planting. For peppers. one-
half ton should be applied before plant-
ing, and one-fourth ton in four weeks
after planting by drilling in middle of
rows. One-fourth ton should be applied
in eight weeks after planting for last
application. Pepper will grow and con-
tinue to bear till frost comes or season
closes for shipping. Seed beds are the most
important of all in these crops. Celery
should be sown about August 20th broad-
cast and not too thick on seed bed well
prepared and raised eight inches above
the level of the ground. Seed beds
should be partially shaded—the best way
is to cover with slats four feet above the
seed bed slanting towards the south with
cracks two inches wide. All shade
should be removed after September the
20th. Seed beds should never get dry,
and should be watered twice a day for
eight days after sowing and then kept
wet. Plants should be sorted so all will
run one size as near as possible and set
in straight rows three feet wide and eight
inches in drill, either single or double

rows, single rows are preferred; if
double rows in drill, then rows should be
four feet wide.
Peppers should be sown the same as
cabbage or tomato seed, seed beds are
prepared about the same as for other
things. Any farmer can raise pepper
plants. Peppers should be {planted in
rows three and one—half feet wide and
twenty inches in drill.
Celery and peppers should be sprayed
with Bordeaux Mixture, celery every
ten days, and pepper as often as black
rot appears. Celery should be sprayed
in seed beds from the time it comes up
to the time of setting out. Celery should
be well blanched with boards by standing
the boards to the side of the row close
to the celery as possible, and all cracks
should be stopped to exclude the light.
It will take from ten to twenty days to
blanch celery, and the boards should re-
main till celery is white. Twelve-inch
boards are the best. Gather the celery
by cutting around the root with a knife
and leave a part of the roots on the cel-
ery, but be certain to keep the celery
clear from dirt, especially do not get dirt
in bud or plume. All dead leaves should be
removed and it should be packed in large
crates with roots all one way and as many
stalks in crate as possible. Crates are
always packed from the side. Be certain
to use plenty of nails and ship by express
or by refrigerator cars.
Peppers should not be packed till
thoroughly matured when it looks slick
and feels ﬁrm, it should be allowed to
grow as long as it will before turning red
and it should be packed in tomato carriers
or in lettuce baskets, as you prefer. Al-
ways use the largest package for the
same freight. Select your commission
merchant before you get ready to ship
and get in touch with him. All markets
are about the same on celery and pepper,
supply and demand governing the price.

“Shall Rudimentary Agriculture and Kindred
Sciences be Taught in the Common Schools?”
"9.
7' By Capt. R. E. Rose.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I ﬁnd myself on this occasion in rather
a peculiar situation. On coming in last
night and listening to what Dr. Sledd
had to say in regard to the relation of the
University to the Horticultural Society I
found that he had, to a very large extent,
anticipated the remarks I expected to
make this afternoon. It reminds me very
much of an anecdote which has gone the
rounds of the Florida political campaign
for many years. Some years ago, a prom-
inent candidate for Governor and Con-
gressman Davis were canvassing the State
for different political oﬂices. The rule
was that the gentleman running for gov-
ernor should make the ﬁrst speech,
followed by Davis. At one point, the
candidate for Governor was invited by a
friend to stay all night with him; conse-
quently they were belated in going to the
meeting the next morning. The local
committee, not desiring to delay ‘ the
speaking, asked Mr. Davis to address the
audience. Davis had heard his friend
speak so often that he got up and gave the
candidate for Governor’s speech almost
verbatim. \Vhen the other man came in
and found that his speech had been taken
thus unceremoniously from him, there
was nothing else to do but be taken sud-
denly ill and not make any speech at all.
I could perhaps have overlooked one
speech of this kind, but at the close of
the meeting our worthy president had a
paper largely along the line of common
education in the public schools. That re-
minded me of the little boy when the min-
ister was taking dinner with his father
and mother. The little fellow was very
fond of chicken and chicken was scarce
with them. His mother said, “Now,
Tommy, you must only take one piece
of chicken.” Tommy said, “Well, but,
mamma, I want more than that.” She
said, “I know, but there must be one
piece left for manners.” It so happened
that the minister took the last piece for
his second or third helping and Tommy
cried out, “Oh, mamma, there it goes;
manners and all 1”
That is the way I feel today. I am
very glad to see that this session has deaIt
very largely with the interests of educa-
tion, I am very glad to see that our col-
lege men, literary as well as scientiﬁc men
are beginning to realize the fact that a
slight understanding, at least, of the
principles of a man’s calling, are abso-
lutely necessary to his success.
The question, Shall we teach rudimen-
tary science in the common schools?—
Physics, Chemistry, Biology and kindred
sciences. relating to agriculture, and d0-
mestic science, better known as nature
studies, is now occupying the attention of


## p. 187 (#729) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 187
many thinkers. The question is dis-
cussed from many points of view, by per-
sons of divers professions,-—the scientist,
the editor, the professors of our colleges,
both literary colleges, and scientiﬁc
schools; the political economist. and the
layman.
The fact that the discussion is univer-
sal among thinkers, shows its importance.
No one at this day will deny the value
of education; no one would dare suggest
the abolishment of the common schools.
The question is therefore, What is the
purpose of public education? The reply
would certainly be, to improve the man;
to make of him an active, useful member
of society; to teach him the principles of
the calling he is to pursue; to broaden his
conception of the laws underlying his
chosen profession; to give him the beneﬁt
of knowledge accumulated from the ex-
perience of others, without the care, toil,
research and time necessary to be .given
in the personal experimenting, and study
of the subject, in gaining the information
as to the facts, laws, and reasons underly-
ing the work he is to perform; inciden-
tally to improve his reasoning powers,
broaden _his mind, and develop his intel-
lect.
The common school has greatly broad-
ened its scope, in the last three decades,—
much useless matter has been eliminated,
and better methods adopted.
The science of teaching has been recog-
nized, teachers are trained. Pedagogy is
now recognized as a science, and taught
as such. To become a teacher one must
study the science and art of teaching.
Most of us can remember when the
teacher in the common schools, was gen-
erally an untrained workman, knowing
little of the teacher’s profession, having
more or less knowledge of the “Three
R’s” and little if any capacity, or inclina-
tion, to impart what little he did know.
The demand for training, or education,
has grown wonderfully in the past thirty
years—particularly for training along
special lines. In all walks of life the spe-
cialist is now recognized,-—in law, medi-
cine, the sciences, teaching, agriculture,
chemistry, physics; in none is the special-
ist more evident than in the teacher’s
profession.
Agriculture, “the oldest art, the young-
est science,” occupies by far the greater
number of our people, while the trades,
and other productive occupations; man-
ufacture and transportation, the next
larger part of the population of this and
other countries. The proper ﬁtting, or
training, of this vast majority of our cit-
izens, for their future occupations, be-
comes a question of the utmost import-
ance to the State.
In a recent address delivered in this
city, by an eminent authority, Dr. An-
drew Sledd, President of the Florida
University, he said:
“For some years the public schools of
the United States have not been fully
meeting their obligation to the general
public. According to the census of 1900,
of the 29,000,000 persons over 10 years
of age engaged in gainful occupations,
10,400,000 were following agricultural
pursuits, or 35.7 per cent; 24.4 per cent.
were employed in manufacturing and kin-
dred labor, domestic and personal occu-
pations claimed 19.2 per cent., trade 16.4
per cent. and the professions only 4.3
per cent. In Florida the percentage of
farmers is even greater, or 44 per cent.,
and of men engaged in the professions,
smaller, or 3.5 per cent.
“A public school system, established for
the greater good of the greatest number,
would, if free from prejudice and from
traditional inﬂuences, base its educational

policy along the line of bulks of popula-
tion. The curriculum would be made
to prepare the major part of the youth
for their life work, instead of those pre-
paring to follow some profession. Until
_recent times the major part has been ig-
nored.
“The present situation gives promise of
what is to be, although the struggle with
tradition is still going on. Modern ed-
ucation is for the masses. Practical edu-
cation is coming to the front. The cul-
tural and humanizing subjects are not to
be ignored, yet the practical should as-
sert its rights.
“Washington, in his ﬁrst message to
congress, advocated the fostering of ag-
riculture. The ﬁrst organization of
farmers in the United States was founded
in 1785 at Philadelphia: Of this society
\Vashington and Benjamin Franklin
were members. Among the committees
appointed was one to promote agricul-
tural education. This committee advo-
cated the founding of professorships of
agriculture in the colleges already estab—
lished, and the giving of courses of agri-
culture in the high schools. The ﬁrst
professorship of agriculture was estab-
lished at Columbia in 1792. The ﬁrst
State Agricultural College was founded
in Michigan in 1855; although private
schools, some of college rank, were in
existence before this date, and a few of
these had State aid.
“The Federal government early mani-
fested its interest, the ﬁrst action being
taken even in the time of Washington.
In comparatively recent times this interest
in the practical education,-—in the educa-
tion for agriculture and the mechanical
arts—has grown greatlv. Various acts
have passed and several are now pending
in congress for the fostering of educa-
tion in agriculture and the mechanical
arts.
“In these acts the Federal government
seeks solely to promote instruction in ag-
ricultural and mechanical arts. It be-
lieves that the masses need instruction
where their work lies. There are several
acts still pending.
“In its aid the Federal government seeks
to throw emphasis where it is most needed
to help the masses, to enable the man who
toils in the sweat of his brow to do his
work more efﬁciently. It seeks to uplift
the mass of working people. Schools
founded for this purpose should keep it
in mind; they should strive to serve most
of the people in the best way.”
“I have taken the liberty to quote Dr.
Sledd liberally, his position as an educa-
tor; his knowledge of the subject, gives
his opinion an'.’l statement, weight ani
authority.
“I desire to call your attention, however,
to the fact that the effort to teach agri-
culure, and its kindred sciences, has been
to establish colleges, and schools of higher
learning,—-a very necessary course per-
haps in the early days; when trained agri‘
culturists and scientists were few. when
the science of agricultre was drabtically
unknown; when text-books on th . subject
were few, and not adapted to the school~
room; in fact only of value to the trained
scientist, and so cumbered with scientiﬁc
terms, that the ordinary teacher. to say
nothing of the school children, failed to
grasp their meaning or understand their
truths, which were, frequently. simply as-
sumptions, and not yet demonstrated
facts,-—There were doubtless reasons for
beginning the structure at the roof and
building down to the foundation. As
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson has apt‘ y
said, “Place a faculty of agricultural pro-
fessors in the top story of a building with-
out a stairway. and say to the boys and
girls of the country, jump up here and
we will teach you scientiﬁc agriculture."

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 189
When we remember that of the manv
millions of school children, only one per
cent. or less, graduate from the high
school, (of which 80 per cent are fe-
males), that by far the greatest number
never enter the high school, but have to
begin their life work, with_but a few
years (or months) training in the com-
mon schools, we realize how few of our
boys and girls destined to be the farmers,
and farmers’ wives, of the country, ever
receive in school any practical or scientiﬁc
knowledge of the subject which will be
the principal, if not the only, pursuit of
their lives.
I will not indulge in the usual plati-
tudes, “The farm the basis of wealth, the
mudsill or foundation of the nation's
prosperity.” The object of my talk is to
stimulate a demand for teaching those
things that will be of the most value, to
the greatest number of the future men
and women of the country, that will ele—
vate their conception of the dignity of
their profession, and stimulate them to
excel in its pursuit.
Ninety per cent. of our boys and girls,
particularly in the rural districts, “quit
school” before reaching what is known
as the seventh grade of the common
schools; very few enter the high schools,
and still fewer graduate therefrom.
By far the larger part of our people
begin their life’s work without ﬁnishing
the course in the common schools, with
a smattering of “Reading, Riting, and
Rithmetic,” with no effort made to teach
them any of the facts, or laws, underly-
ing the profession they are to pursue.
It would be folly for me to decry the
value of the necessary preliminary stud-
ies, arithmetic, spelling, reading and
writing, and such fundamental branches.
I do contend, however, that the rudi-
mentary principles of Physics, Biology,
and other natural sciences, “nature
studies,” should be substituted for the
ordinary “reader,”—with its fables and
glittering generalities, elocutionary gym-
nastics, and singsong poetry. Our read-
ing exercises could be made useful and
entertaining, and impart knowledge at
the same time, language equally as pure
taught, and correct ideas as to natural
science imparted at the same time.
Equally as interesting stories, inculcat-
ing facts, can be substituted for the fables.
and stories, of the present reading les-
son.
Many of the text-books on agriculture.
—now abundant,—are interesting to a
degree to the youthful mind,—always
hungry for information. That child
once taught the ﬁrst law of physics, ex-
pressed in simple language,——that “force
and reaction are the same and in opposite
directions,” will not in future life spend
years in the futile effort to create perpet-
ual motion,
That child taught a few lessons in
Physiology, or animal ,structure, will
never be guilty of removing an animal’s
inner eyelids to cure the “hooks,” nor
bore a cow’s horn for “hollow horn.”
When taught a few of the fundamental
laws of Agricultural chemistry, he will
not buy a ton of “guano” because it is
cheaper than another ton; nor will he be
persuaded to buy fertilizer, or feeds, on
account of a name, or brand. and pay
more for an inferior material with a
catchy name.
No lesson is more quickly absorbed.
nor more easily taken in, by the average
child than Physical geography, simply
because it deals in facts, as to produc-
tions, and conditions of various countries.

toms.

deﬁnition of a continent, peninsula, is-
land, or isthmus is, he knows however,
that oranges and alligators are found in
Florida, that “Uncle Sam” is cutting a
big ditch at Panama; that monkeys, cof_
fee, jaguars and India rubber come from
South America.
We do not appreciate the capacity of
our children for facts,—-they care little
for the reasons, but want facts,—these
should be given as fully as, possible.
Rules mean but little to children, facts
much.
How many of you remember the old
“Murray’s Grammar?” with its pages of
rules,—which we “learned by heart” and
did not understand, (and don’t yet). The
old “Davies” or “Todd’s” arithmetic,
with its rules and terms,—all Greek to
us then, and to most of us now.
\Ve did know (when the teacher, or
our parents told us) that certain con-
struction of sentences, or certain words
were not correct. We learned good lan-
guage from hearing it spoken.
We now teach grammar and arithme-
tic almost unconsciously, by absorption
we might say.
The same may be said of science, or
“applied common sense,”—the facts
which experience, and experiment have
proved to be facts, governed by natural
laws.
How many of us members of the Hor-
ticultural Society, would have avoided
serious mistakes, expensive in time and
money, had we as children been taught
a few facts, as to the composition and
use of fertilizers,-—why they were neces-
sary, and for what purpose applied; the
functions of nitrogen, phosphates, and
potash, in the plant economy?
How many of us have had to learn by
experience, more or less expensive, the
facts well known to the scientist of the
day? though forty years ago he knew
little more than the average pupil of the
common school does now.
There is little chance to teach agricul-
tural science, (and art), to the adult
farmer; barring the Farmers' Institute,
there is no efﬁcient method of reaching
him. However, teach these facts to the
children, furnish them with authentic
and trustworthy text-books, and very
soon the parent will himself absorb a
very considerable part of the sciences.
It has been said, “The education of the
child should begin in the cradle,” no
greater truth was ever spoken.
“The child is father to the man,” and
on his early training depends the future
citizenship of the country,—while teach-
ing the child,—-the common school pupil,
—the rudimentary truths, facts and laws,
of science,——“nature study,”—by simple
statements of facts, with little discussion,
rules, or reasons,—put before him in an
interesting manner in the shape of nar-
ratives or stories, illustrating the subject;
together with simple experiments and il-
lustrations, we unconsciously, but none
the less certainly, teach the parent many
truths, and broaden his conception of his
calling. For rest assured, that whatever
deeply interests the child at school, is
discussed at home,—c0mmented on and
digested to a degree, not generally under-
stood nor allowed for.
Why have our children’s imaginations
excited, their faith in the wisdom or
truthfulness of their teacher,—and text-
books lessened, by such tales as the “Ad-
ventures of Sinbad the Sailor,” “Gul-
liver’s Travels,” “Don Quixote,”-—inter-
esting and exciting to the imaginative.
and credulous mind of the child—and
other equally useless, in fact, injurious
matter; used in the schoolroom? When
equally choice and interesting reading

matter, describing wonderful occurrenceg
beautiful processes, and surprising re-
sults,—all inculcating truths, that will
be of value in succeeding years, can be
given them; equally as interesting and ex-
citing to their imaginations, making last-
ing impressions on their plastic minds.
Truths told in simple language, free from
scientiﬁc jargon, comprehensible to the
youthful mind, or to the ordinary adult,
who has had no scientiﬁc training, of
which the mass of our people are com-
posed.
Among scientiﬁc literature, written in
plain, simple language, that should be
found in every schoolroom, and read by
every teacher, or pupil of our common
schools, is the little monthlv publication
of our State Board of Health, called
Health Notes. It deals with common
things, common diseases, their cause and
effects in such simple, though forceful
language, as can be readily understood by
any one, child or adult, who can read.
As a pattern for a child’s or adult’s pri-
mary, scientiﬁc, text-book, it is com-
mendable, and should be found in every
household in the State.
I am pleased to say that this subject
is now attracting the attention of school
ofﬁcers and educators everywhere.
I note our next summer schools for
teachers, will have the beneﬁt of twelve
lectures on agricultural subjects, by such
men as, Dr. Sledd, Prof. Rolfs, Prof.
Floyd and Prof. Fawcett, of the Univer-
sity of Florida, and the Florida Experi-
fnent Station. Lectures that will doubt-
less go far towards instructing the teach-
ers of the State, as to the importance of
acquiring a knowledge of the rudimentary
principles of agriculture, that they may
be better ﬁtted to successfully prepare
the children of the State for a broader
view and more comprehensive knowledge
of their future callings ; that they may be
able to dignify the farmer’s profession,
by teaching that it is truly a science, as
well as an art, requiring more knowledge
of all the sciences, than does that of any
of the learned professions, to master its
details, and successfully practice it.
I believe the place to begin the teaching
of agriculture is in the common school,
just where we begin the teaching of liter-
ature, and the science of numbers and
language. That the farm, the school,
the experiment station, and agricultural
college, should be linked together, and
properly co-ordinated: that we should be-
gin at the foundation,—the child,—and
build upward toward the complete ediﬁce,
the college, and not from the college
downward.

Roselle.
l
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Of the smaller fruits that have been
introduced into the State for a compar-
tively long time, none, with its seeming
commercial possibilities, have been more
neglected than roselle (Hibiscus sab-
dariffa), also known under the name of
Jamaica sorrel. Even as a household
plant, it is not, considering the ease with
which it is cultivated, grown as widely
as it deserves. At the Subtropical Lab-
oratory we have paid particular attention
to the cultivation of this plant for nearly
four years, and on receiving an invita-
tion from the President of the Society to
deliver an address at this meeting, I se-
lected this as a timely subject, so much
the more as during the existence of the
Society only once, in 1899, if I am rightly
informed, has the attention of the mem-
bers been called to the roselle. This pa-
per is Farmers’ Bulletin No. 307 con-
densed, where the subject is more fully
treated, with such additional data as have
been obtained since that bulletin was
written,
As those of you who are acquainted
with roselle know, the plant is an an-
nual and resembles somewhat the cotton
plant in habit, attaining a height of from
ﬁve to seven feet, with about a like
spread, under favorable conditions. Its
large, red-eyed yellow ﬂowers indicate
its relationship to the okra, the various
species of ornamental hibiscus and the

cotton plant. It is indigenous to the Old
_World tropics, but is now probably dis-
seminated to all the tropical and subtrop-
ical countries. Some twenty or more
years ago-the roselle was introduced into
Florida, the name Jamaica sorrel being
probably an indication that the plant was
introduced from Jamaica.
Keeping in mind that lands subjected
to ﬂooding and insufﬁciently drained
lands should be avoided, as well as lands
infested with the rootknot nematode
(Heterodera radic‘icola) to which the
plant is very much subject, the roselle
seems to thrive on any of our Florida
soils that are moderately rich or sup-
plied with the necessary plant food in
the form of commercial fertilizer. If sta-
ble manure is used it should be supple-
mented with phosphates and fertilizers
that contain potash, as an excess of am-
monia in the soil tends to the develop-
ment of large plants at the expense of
their productiveness.
The plants may be started in a seed-
bed in the spring and planted out in the
ﬁeld similarly to tomatoes, or the seeds
may be planted in the hills where they
are to remain and thinned out to one
plant to a hill. The rows should be
from six to ten feet apart and the plants
set out four to eight feet apart in the
row according to the fertility of the
land and the supply of moisture. In our
experience a mixture similar to tomato

fertilizer has been found to be very sat-
isfactory, applied at the rate of 1,000 to
2,000 pounds per acre. \Nhere a few
plants are set out for home use most
fertilizers that are available would
probably serve the purpose.
The greatest drain on the vitality of
the plant is the ripening of the seed and
if the calyces are picked as soon as they
are full grown instead of allowing them
to become more mature, the plant, in the
effort to reproduce itself, sends out new
ﬂower-buds that set fruit continuously
until cut down by frost if it is not injured
by diseases or insect enemies.
In a report from the Porto Rico Ex-
periment Station, 1906, the yield per
plant is given as four pounds of fruit
while some plants were estimated to
yield double that amount. At the Sub—
tropical Laboratory during the past few
years we have been engaged in the breed-
ing of a variety having larger calyces
than the common kind and during the
last fall and winter weighed the fruit
from eight plants of this variety to as-
certain the average yield. The data ob-
tained, which are given in the following
table, are quite interesting.
Nos, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent one
plant each and No. 6 represents calyces
from three plants weighed together. The
yield from No. I was so markedly larger
than from the rest of the plants
that it was thought desirable to save the
seed for breeding purposes, which ex—
plains the omissions in yield from Jan-
uary 6 to February 8, 1908, at which
latter date part of the ripe calyces were
saved and the remainder February 18.
January 25 the calyces of all the plants
except No. I (which was tented) were
picked for fear that the plants might
freeze down in an approaching cold wave.
Subsequently all the plants in this exper-
iment died from the attack of rootknot
nematodes, except No. I, which was
pruned back, has continued to bloom and
is still in active growth and setting fruit.
Two plants which were not included in

Porto Rico as compared with that ob-
tained by the Subtropical Laboratory,
due partly to continued breeding and se—
lection, and probably in part to more fa-
vorable conditions and perhaps to better
cultivation.
In Florida the plant has thus far been
grown for home use only and the caly-
ces used in making a sauce similar to
that made of the cranberry, or in jelly
making. Besides the two products already
mentioned, the roselle yields a most ex-
cellent fruit syrup that can be used in the
home in various ways. It can also be
used as a ﬂavoring extract at soda foun-
tains.
When the calyces are used as a sauce
the seedpods must of course necessarily
be removed but last fall we found that
this is not necessary in the making of
jelly. In the manufacture of jelly on a
commercial scale this is an important con-
sideration, as the removal of the seed-
pod is at present a slow and tedious pro-
cess.
Several years ago Mr. W. W. Tracy
of the Bureau of Plant Industry, made
jelly of the tender twigs and branches,
but did not follow up his discovery to
ascertain its commercial possibilities.
Acting on this suggestion, during the
past year the writer experimented with
extracting the acid from the whole plant
by boiling both the young stems and the
leaves. The jelly obtained in this way
was perhaps a little more difficult to
make than that made from the calyces,
but it is possible that some mistake in
making it was the cause of this, for I
understand that Mrs. P, H. Rolfs has
made jelly from the stems and leaves that
she considered fully equal to that made
from the calyces of the plant. An excel-
lent fruit syrup is also obtained from the
same source that may be used in the
household or used as a ﬂavoring extract
in soda water fountains. Utilized in this
way the plant can be grown in a large
territory of the United States and the
ease with which the plant is cultivated
probably renders it a cheaper source for
ﬂavoring extract than any other plant.
The only disease that has so far been
observed on roselle is a mildew that at-
tacks all parts of the plant above ground
and if the disease appears early it is apt
to do considerable damage if it is allowed
to spread unchecked. An experiment to
ascertain the comparative value of dry
sulphur, sulphuric acid diluted one part
to 500, 1,000 and 2,000 parts of water,
respectively, and liver of sulphur as a
remedy for the disease was made last
fall at the Subtropical Laboratory.
Their comparative values as fungicides
were found to be as in the order named.
The sulphur should be applied early in
the morning while the plants are still wet
with dew, -
In addition to the soft scale (Coccus
hes/Jeridum) another scale was noted on
roselle last fall. Specimens were sent
to Dr. L. O. Howard, Chief of the Bu-
reau of Entomology, United States De-
partment of Agriculture, who identiﬁed
them as Hemichionaspis aspidistrae. It
appears, however, to do very little dam-
age as, while multiplying itself rapidly,
the scale is followed by a parasite (Aspi-
diotiphagus cit-rinus) that seems to keep
it well in check.
In Queensland the cultivation of the
roselle has_assumed a commercial aspect
during the past few years and consider-
able quantities of roselle jam are yearly
exported to Europe. In the Unitel
States, aside from the home use as a
sauce, the .most popular products would

probably be jelly, a fruit syrup for the
table use, or diluted with water as a cool-
ing drink and as a ﬂavoring extract for
cool drink stands. The writer ventures
to express the opinion that when the man-
ufactured products of roselle become
known to the public the roselle will fur-
nish the basis for a considerable indus-
try along these lines in the United States
at no distant date, in which Florida, due
to her geographical position, should have
a large share.

Efforts to Secure Better Shipping Facilities and
Rates.
By F. D. Warner.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
For as far back as most of us can
remember we have been complaining
of high freight rates on our fruit and
vegetables, but it is only within the
past year that any concentrated effort
on our part has been taken to remedy
the evil. Many cases of individual ef-
forts have been made, but to no avail.
But today we have a strong organiza-
tion to ﬁght for our rights, and if we
can have the co-operation of all ship-
pers we can accomplish much, we be-
lieve.
As most of you will recall, the
Gainesville Melon Growers’ Associa-
tion called a meeting in Jacksonville
in February, 1907, for the purpose of
securing a car-lot rate on our fruits
and vegetables to the eastern markets
and to form an association for that
purpose. At that meeting there were
some sixty members who joined and
now we number over ﬁve hundred,
with only one resignation during the
year.
Shortly after this meeting we had a
conference with the representatives of
the various railways leading out of the
state, at the oﬂice of our secretary, J.
C. Chase, Jacksonville, at which time
they promised to take the matter up
and give us some relief, but failed to
do so; but instead asked us to meet
them in \Vashington on November
6th, which we did, our attorney also
being present at this conference. \Ve
made them a compromise proposition,
as follows: 5 cents reduction on stan-
dard crates and 10 cents on bbls. 0r-
anges and pineapples, with a refrigera-
tion of 15 cents a package instead of
20 cents, with a minimum of 20,000
pounds to all eastern points. This
they refused, but came back to us with
a proposition granting about one-half
of our compromise; which we in turn
refused and took the matter before the
Inter-State Commission in its original
form, which amounts to much more
than we were willing to compromise
for. The ﬁrst hearing before the Com-
mission was held at Washington on
February 4th, at which time we had
eight witnesses from Florida and sev-
eral from the commission merchants
at the north. This meeting. as you
know, was adjourned to Jacksonville
on March 18th for the want of time,
and as you all know we had a large
representation. The ﬁnal hearing
takes place tomorrow at \Vashington,
and we can look for some decision
some time in June.
There was a called meeting at Lake-
land on April 21st, which meeting

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 197
took the place of the annual meeting
which should have been held in Feb—
ruary. At this meeting the old ofﬁcers
were re-elected and several added to
the board of directors. The matter of
adopting a standard size box for both
the celery and orange was gone into
to considerable extent, but no action
was taken to make the Florida orange
box to conform to the California size,
i. e., 11%x11y2x26.
The matter was laid over until the
next meeting, which will be held in
Jacksonville some time in July, when
we will have heard from the Commis-
sion. F "I
It was decided at Lakeland to con-
tinue the Association and to take up
the many matters which we are dis-
criminated against both by express
and freight. Some of our best markets
are south of the Ohio and Potomac
rivers and yet the rate is often higher
than points beyond.
There is no salaried office in this As-
sociation and the ofﬁcers have been
faithful and loyal to the cause and have
sacriﬁced much time and money, and
we want the help of every person who
ships a package of fruits or vegetables.
We would also like to have the en-
dorsement of this Society in good,
strong terms.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Warner—This report is simply
to show what has been done to secure
better rates, especially car-lot rates for
eastern points, than we now have.
They have given us a promise that
they will make a decision before they
adjourn about the ﬁrst of July. We
would also like to have the endorse-
ment of the Society. The railroads
have tried to belittle our efforts, but
we contend that we represent about
seventy-ﬁve per cent. of all fruits and
vegetables shipped. If all you people
will come with us and stick to us and
all of us hold together, we can get
pretty nearly what we ask for, which,
of course, is only our rights. I believe
I have given you an outline of what
has been done. We have here a copy
of our attorney's brief, but the testi-
'mony in our case amounts to volumes
and volumes. I will be glad to answer
any questions that any of you care to
ask.
Mr. Have your efforts been con-
ﬁned to oranges and pineapples?
Mr. \Varner—No, sir; we have been
working for better rates on everything
that is raised in the state.
Mr. Frink—I would like to ask Mr.
\Varner if the object of this Fruit
Growers’ Association is to make aper-
manent organization of it and continue
the ﬁght for better rates and better
facilities of all classes of fruit and veg-
etables. not only now but in the future.
Mr. VVarner—Yes. sir; that is the
object of this Association, and in the
meeting at Lakeland it was moved that
the Association be continued. The
ﬁnal hearing that comes up tomorrow
is for a carload rate to the East, which
we do not now enjoy. we want to
enjoy the same blanket rate that Cali—
fornia has now on oranges, both East
and \Nest.
Mr. Frink—I am in favor of Mr.
Warner's work, and think the mem-
bers will all be in favor of it if they
understand it. It is a great work and
needs to be looked into more carefully
in the future than it has been in the
past.

I” FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. Hart—It has a membership of
about ﬁve hundred, hasn’t it?
Mr. \Narner—Yes, sir.
Mr. Hart—\Vhy didn’t they call on
us?
Mr. \Varner—They did. \Ve have
written letter after letter, and asked
everybody to help us that we possibly
could. But we have not had funds
enough to foot the bills, and have had
to go down in our pockets, because we
thought we were doing the right thing.
Mr. Skinner—The penalty of being
a Director is about $500.00.,
Mr. \Varner—We have hired the
best attorneys we could hire. We have
hired attorneys to get up briefs and
have had all kinds of expenses to con-
tend with and nothing to meet them
with, unless we paid them ourselves.
The next meeting will be held in Jack-
sonville some time in July.
Mr. I would like to ask if any re-
duction was asked for anything less
than carload lots.
Mr. \Narner—No, sir. \Ve thought
we had a ﬁght big enough for us to
handle when we asked for a reduction
on carload lots. There is a great deal
of shipping done in less than car lots.
They made a proposition to us say-
ing that they would give us a carload
rate provided we would accept their
terms on less than carload lots. We
refused to do this. However, the ﬁght
was taken up originally to get a car-
load rate on fruits and vegetables.
Mr. Skinner—The Clyde Steamship
Line pays the Atlantic Coast Line
Company ten cents for every package
they deliver to them at Jacksonville,
as a sort of compromise for not carry‘
ing it to Savannah and delivering it to
the Ocean Steamship Line. The rate

to Jacksonville is from 17 cents to 20
cents on‘ oranges. The rate to New
York is 35 cents, 10 cents of that goes
to the A. C. L. we contend, and I
think we are supported in our belief,
that they are transgressing the law,
and that they should carry it to New
York for 25 cents. The grower should
have the benﬁt of the 10 cents that is
paid to the A. C. L.
Mr. Warner—In other words, the
Clyde Line pays the Coast Line 10
cents for not hauling it to Savannah.
Now, gentlemen, if we will join to-
gether and stick together, there is no
doubt but that we can get our just de-
serts and I think it is the duty of every
one of us to uphold this Association in
its ﬁght.
Mr. Skinner—It means about $200,-
000 to the state if we win out. This
is worth ﬁghting for.
Prof. Rolfs—I think we ought to
hold up the hands of the Association,
like holding up Aaron’s hands of old.
I understood, Mr. Skinner. that a com-
mittee was appointed this morning to
prepare resolutions of some kind com-
mendatory of the work this organiza-
tion has been doing. If you have them
ready. we would be glad to act upon
them at this time.
Mr. Skinner—“\Vhereas, The fruit
and vegetable shippers of Florida have
for years been discriminated against
by the railroads and have been obliged
to pay a much higher rate of freight
than our competitors for a less haul:
therefore be it

Orange and Grape Fruit Statistics.
By P. Phillips, M.D.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Enclosed please ﬁnd letters from the
different railroad companies, in the
state of Florida, with the exception
of the East Coast Railroad, which I
explain here below.
The crop for the year of 1906-07,
three million seven hundred seventy-
six thousand naught eighteen (3,766,-
018). I estimated the crop for the
year of 1907-08 to be sixty per cent.
of the above amount. This will make
it 2,265,610. I will gladly get up the
statistics again from the different rail-
road companies of Florida, the num-
ber of boxes shipped the past season
and compare it with my estimate, pro-
vided the Society desires me to do so.
The East Coast Railway Company,
I estimated, had ﬁve hundred thousand
boxes, and after correspondence with
them, I found that my estimate was
not far wrong. I, therefore, think I
have it as near as possible to the cor-
rect amount that was shipped out of
the state during the year of 1906-07.
Hoping the State Horticultural So-
ciety will continue to prosper, and
with you—its president—I know they
will succeed, I beg to remain,
Yours truly,
P. PHILLIPS.
Dr. P. Phillips, Orlando, Fla.
Dear Sir—In reply to your letter of
September 28th, I beg to advise that
the Atlantic Coast Line handled dur-

Nursery Inspection From the Inspector’s Side.
By E. W. Berger.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The essential parts of this paper
were written nearly a year ago, and
were then intended to be a contribu-
tion toward supplementing Nursery
Inspection (1) and (2), published by
Prof. H. A. Gossard as Press Bulletins
Nos. 6 and 7 of the Florida Agricul-
tural Experiment Station, and repub-
lished in the Florida Agriculturist for
June 19 and 26, 1907, pp. 5 and 7, re-
spectively. The purpose of the paper
was to set forth more fully the prac-
tices of inspectors as understood by
the writer, based upon his own experi-
ence, and the experience of other in-
spectors obtained verbally and from
their writings. The writer realizes
that, considered from the standpoint of
the ideal, the inspection of nurseries,
as practiced in the United States, is
frequently open to criticism; but the
subject has been treated here as modi-
ﬁed by the conditions which exist,
rather than from an ideal point of
view. In other words, we have to deal
with a practical question and not a
theory.
THE RIGHTS OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES.
These naturally come under three
heads: those of the buyer, the nursery-
man, and the inspector.
THE BUYER—The buyer, or grower,
is perhaps the most vitally interested
of all, and generally has the least to
say in regard to the inspection of the
goods he desires to buy. That the
buyer might have much to say will be
brought out later. The buyer has the
right to be protected; but at its very
best, a certiﬁcate from an inspector
cannot be a perfect guarantee of free-
dom from insects and diseases; a fact
noted in Nursery Inspection (2), and
generally recognized by experienced
inspectors. The point is, that it is
physically impossible to examine every
tree in a nursery, to say nothing of
examining all parts of a tree. Never-
theless, a certiﬁcate signiﬁes much.
After the inspector has examined, say,
the four sides of a large block of stock
and has passed through it in several
directions, carefully scrutinizing ab-
normal appearances as well as making
a close inspection of an occasional tree,
he feels reasonably certain whether
the block is clean or not. Besid'es
signifying that a diligent search has
been made, a certiﬁcate implies that
moral obligations have been assumed
by the nurseryman. It thus becomes
especially obligatory upon him to send
out nothing but clean stock. Then
there is a further deterring inﬂuence,
namely the fear of exposure and for-
feiture of the certiﬁcate if he sends out
infested or diseased stock.
In view of the fact that a certiﬁcate
cannot be an absolute guarantee, it has
been suggested that a written guaran-


## p. 202 (#744) ############################################

202 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
tee from the nurseryman should be
substituted for a certiﬁcate. But why
should a written guarantee from the
nurseryman not be required to accom-
pany the inspector’s certiﬁcate? Every
buyer has the power to demand such
a guarantee. Again, it has been sug-
gested, that fumigation should be sub-
stituted for a certiﬁcate, or that a cer-
tiﬁcate of fumigation from the nurs-
eryman should be required to accom-
pany each shipment of certiﬁed stock.
The requirement of a certiﬁcate of
fumigation from the nurseryman, to-
gether with an inspector’s certiﬁcate,
is the law in Georgia and some other
states. Again, defoliation together
with the cutting back of the tender
growth should be required in all ship-
ments, and several nurserymen now
make this practice. In fact, one should
practice not only defoliation and cut-
ting back, but fumigation as well.
There remains only the addition of the
written guarantee, and I hope soon to
see some nurserymen take this for-
ward step. A nurseryman could give
a guarantee which the inspector can-
not give, because every tree sold ought
to come under his or some competent
person’s scrutiny at the time of digging
and packing.
It has been objected that fumiga-
tion, defoliation, and cutting back are
injurious to trees. In regard to de-
foliation, the preponderance of evi-
dence, so far as the writer can judge,
indicates' that, at least under certain
climatic conditions, it is not injurious;
and some even state instances where
defoliated trees started off better than
others not defoliated. Should fumiga-
tion cause the death of some trees and
retard the growth of others—a doubt-
ful contingency—yet the loss of a few
trees should not be deprecated when
it may involve the saving of a whole
grove from becoming overrun by in-
sects. It is the writer’s opinion that
defoliation, together with cutting back
and fumigation, should be practiced by
all nurserymen, in fact insisted upon
by the buyer, whether any n0xious in-
sects are suspected to be upon the
stock or not; for there are other pests,
such as rust mite, red spider, orange
weevil, and perhaps still others, living
on the leaves and roots [the grubs of
the orange weevil live on the roots],
which would probably be completely
eradicated by this means.
No stock should be shipped partially
exposed [leafy tops left uncovered],
but it should be so covered and wrap-
ped as to make it secure against be-
coming infested in transit. We need
only to bear in mind the possibility
that a package of citrus trees may
come in contact, either in the express
car or at the railway station, with a
crate 0f scale-infested citrus fruit, or
a package of peach, plum, or other
similar trees, or with some San Jose
scale-infested fruit; when the in-
festation may spread to the previously
clean stock, if it was not completely
and properly covered. All these re-
quirements, I believe, are quite within
the reach of the buyer, and need simply
to be insisted upon when he contracts
for his trees.
Further. in regard to a written
guarantee from the nurseryman, it will
be evident that the nurseryman could
not give a guarantee of freedom from
insects and diseases extending ahead
over any long period of time. The best
form of written guarantee would pro-


## p. 203 (#745) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 203
bably be one to the effect that the
stock was guaranteed to be free from
all living insects (mites included),
insect larvae, insect eggs, or other dis-
eases, at the time of its delivery. If
newly-set stock is found to be free
from infestation when it has matured
a new crop of foliage, this would be
fairly clear evidence that it was clean
when received. If infestation with in-
sects, or infection with disease, was
discovered by the time a new crop of
foliage had matured, expert evidence
[inspection of the neighboring prem-
ises, and of the nursery from which
the stock was obtained] would have to
decide the case. Such a guarantee
would also be in the nature of a chal-
lenge to the buyer or grower to ﬁnd
insects and disease if he could; and
no nurseryman would make such a
challenge if the stock he shipped was
not clean.
In conclusion. the writer believes
that the grower can best protect him-
self by making the following require-
ments the conditions of buying a nurs-
eryman’s stock:
I. A written guarantee that the
stock is free from noxious insects and
diseases at the time of its delivery.
2. A written guarantee that the
contents of each package have been
properly fumigated prior to shipment
[ornamentals and other stock which
would be killed by fumigation alone
not to be fumigated, or fumigated with
a smaller dose].
3. The complete defoliation and
cutting back of- all stock (especially
citrus‘) prior to shipment [ornamentals
and other stock which would be killed
by such treatment alone excepted].
4. Complete protection of the stock
from outside contamination through
insects and diseases during transporta-
tion, by a properly constructed box or
other covering.
The writer also desires to direct the
growers’ attention to the following
law:
Ch. 4814, Acts 1899, Sects. I and 2.
3701. The Sale or giving away of
Diseased Nursery Stock or Seeds'.—It
shall be unlawful for any person to
.knowingly sell or give away any dis-
eased nursery stock or seeds in the
State of Florida. Any person violat-
ing this section shall 'be ﬁned not more
than ﬁve hundred dollars or impris-
oned not more than six months—Gen.
Statutes of the State of Florida, 1906.
From the foregoing it will be seen
that the grower has these matters
wholly under his control, and all that
is necessary is for him to take advan-
tage of his rights.
THE NURSERYMAN.—That the nurs-
eryman also has some rights must be
conceded. When nursery inspection
has become deﬁnitely established un-
der well-deﬁned laws and regulations
within a State; and when a larger num-
ber of nurserymen have learned to
realize that a knowledge of insect
pests and plant diseases is quite as im-
portant to their business as the ability
to grow plants; and when by the
bringing of gradually increasing press-
ure by inspectors from year to year,
greater vigilance will be exercised and
thoroughly up-to-date methods be em-
ployed in all nurseries: we may assume
it proper to refuse a nurseryman a
certiﬁcate in whose stock but one spe-
cimen even of a species of noxious in-
sect is found. But where, as in Flor-

ida, nursery inspection has not become
systematized; and where, furthermore,
citrus nursery stock has not before
been certiﬁed [the writer did this for
the ﬁrst time last fall, when several
states and foreign countries required
citrus stock to be admitted under cer-
tiﬁcate only] ; it appears no more than
fair that conditions of fumigation, de-
foliation, etc., should sometimes be re-
quired in giving a certiﬁcate in lieu
of absolute freedom from insects. I
admit that to the buyer one insect is
as bad as a thousand, and the case
merits careful thought and considera-
tion. But the nurseryman having spent
thousands of dollars to grow his trees,
feels that to be refused a certiﬁcate
means bankruptcy. The grower hardly
desires to see the nurseryman bank-
rupted, neither does he wish to see his
own property jeopardized. In such an
instance the inspector almost invaria-
bly steps into the breach, so to speak.
His knowledge of a certain pest, for
instance, convinces him that the stock ‘
should be absolutely safe when cut
back, defoliated and fumigated. He
requires this as a condition of giving
the certiﬁcate. The nurseryman as-
sumes the moral obligation of good
faith and the other conditions previ-
ously referred to, and the case is gen-
erally settled; unless the nurseryman,
to his discredit and to the detriment
of the inspector, breaks faith. Besides
the above stipulations the inspector
may require the destruction of all in—
fested trees, and the exclusion of cer-
tain blocks of stock from the market;
or the entire nursery may be placed
under quarantine pending a period of
cleaning up. All of these practices are
in the nature of a compromise; but
they are practiced by all inspectors in
some form or other, as will be evident-
from a perusal of the literature availa-
ble on the subject.
In connection with this same point
we may imagine the case of two nurs-
erymen, one of whom succeeds in con-
cealing any disease in his stock; while
the other one does not attempt this,
and even points out the doubtful trees
to the inspector. Under a cast-iron
rule of “one insect—no certiﬁcate,"
the honest man would fail to get a cer-
tiﬁcate, while his less honest neighbor
would get one. Again, of two neigh-
boring small nurseries, the one is per-
haps found infested or diseased; the
other one is not, and gets a certiﬁcate.
The whole of a large nursery is as
large as two small ones; one portion is
perhaps infested, the other part not. In
view of the fact that the inspector can
hardly, under ordinary conditions, re-
fuse a certificate to the small clean
nursery; then ought not the large
nursery to be certiﬁed, with proper re—
strictions, to the extent of its clean
portions, leaving the infested portion
without any certiﬁcate? Besides, if
the man with the clean, small nursery
is dishonest, he may buy infested stock
from his neighbor and sell it under his
certiﬁcate.
T HE INSPECTOR—The rights of the
inspector—what are they? He is en-
titled to a hearing if anything is sup-
posed to be going wrong. He should
be the ﬁrst one to be notiﬁed. Thus,
last fall, the entomologist of a certain
southern state wrote to me stating
that there were rumors of unclean
stock having been shipped into that
state'from Florida. I asked him to send
me particulars at once. He answered

205
that he would as soon as he had seen
th stock in question; but as he was
never heard from again in regard to
this matter, it is to be presumed that
the rumor was without foundation.
The inspector must insist upon the
right to use his judgment. It is not
unfair to assume that his knowledge
of insects qualiﬁes him for this beyond
all others, few excepted. In the facts
already discussed, the writer has im-
plied that, under certain restrictions
and preliminary operations, certiﬁcates
are sometimes issued where adherence
to a ﬁxed rule would prohibit this. In-
spection in Florida is not for Florida
itself, but for other states and coun-
tries which admit stock only under
certiﬁcate. The inspection require-
ments of these states and countries will
therefore naturally be made the chief
guide in the inspection of Florida
nurseries. Furthermore, when the
writer was in doubt he wrote to the
entomologist of a certain southern
state into which he knew that large
quantities of citrus would be shipped
from Florida, and received the follow-
ing answer: “Our plan in Louisiana
is to give a certiﬁcate of inspection to
nurseries, even when whiteﬂy is pres-
ent; provided, of course, that we have
no reason to believe the nurseries in
question will not thoroughly defoliate
the stock.” With this statement in
mind, I acted so as to meet the exig-
encies of the case, and I believe that
the interests of the grower have been
safeguarded; for no one has yet
claimed to have found whiteﬁy on
citrus stock sold under the writer’s
certiﬁcate. I did more than the previ-
ous statement exacted, for I required
the stock to be fumigated besides;
which to the best of my knowledge,
together with cutting back and com-
plete defoliation, makes citrus trees
safe from whiteﬁy. The following cir-
cular was sent to nurserymen on No-
vember 12, 1907, and a revised form
will be ,issued during this summer or
fall.
G
PRELIMINARY CIRCULAR TO NURSERYMEN.
Following are several simple re-
quirements, compliance with which is
expected from every nurseryman re-
ceiving a certiﬁcate:
I. To fumigate all nursery stock
prior to shipment: excepting ship-
ments to states and countries that
fumigate all stock at the port of en-
try; excepting to parties desiring to
do their own fumigation; and except-
ing a few ornamentals, such as roses,
that do not stand fumigation, and coni-
fers.
2. To defoliate all stock, if not al-
ready defoliated, at the time of ship-
ment. A few ornamentals that do not
stand defoliation are alone excepted:
and shipments of citrus stock may be
excepted during November and De-
cember if the buyer so requests, pro-
vided the same are fumigated and
.completely enclosed in a box or in bur—
lap.
3. Since it is impossible for the in-
spector to examine every tree in the
nursery, it is imperative for the nurs-
eryman to see to it that no diseased
stock is sent out. This should be a
simple matter, since each tree must be
handled several times in preparing it
for shipment.
4. The inspector reserves the right
to re-inspect, at the expense of the
nurseryman, any nursery previously

certiﬁed, for the purpose of verifying
that all conditions have been, or are
being, fulﬁlled; and to annul the cer-
tiﬁcate if the conditions in the nursery
prove unsatisfactory, or if any require-
ments upon which the certiﬁcate is
conditioned are violated.
N. B.—The purpose of Rule I is not
to encourage nurserymen to be less
careful in keeping out whiteﬂy, scales,
etc.: for a badly infested nursery will
not be certiﬁed under any conditions.
E. W. BERGER.
Entomologist to Florida Agricultural
Experiment Station, Gainesville.
In conclusion, the present inspector
can in no sense be considered a state
ofﬁcial, and inspections have been
carried on by the Experiment Station
solely to meet the exigencies of nurs-
erymen doing business with other
states and with foreign countries.
THE GROWER’S SIDE.

C. B. Thornton.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
As a member of the Committee on
Nursery Inspection would say: In my
opinion, the only measure to insure jus-
tice to all, is a State law, so framed that
all nurserymen in Florida large or small,
selling trees in the State, especially citrus
trees, are compelled to have a certiﬁcate
duly attested, from a State oﬂﬁcer, com-
petent to judge, stating the absolute con-
dition of the trees offered for sale and'
this done often enough to give security to
the buyer. This is a drastic remedy but
in no other way can positive security be
given the buyer nor an impartiality hin-
dered between the different nurserymen.
As a prominent nurseryman writes me:
“How much good will it do you if I sell
a lot of nursery trees to you, duly in-
spected, passed, and' ﬁnally to make sure,
fumigated and your neighbor “J”-—,
going to a little out of the way nursery,
buys a lot of trees infested with scale,
mealy bug, white ﬂy and all other ills?
How long will your trees stand in their
neighborhood without becoming in-
fested? At present nursery inspection is
simply of no value to Florida and with
the exception of out of the State and
West Indian business, it does not amount
to a row of pins.” This is from an
experienced, successful nurservman. Un-
less a severe State measure is passed, all
that should be required of a Florida nur-
seryman is, that he has his stock free
from white ﬂy and mealy bug. These two
are the most dreaded and justly so. Un-
less radical measures are taken at once.
the white ﬂy will be prevalent in all
citrus growing parts of the State as the
common purple or long scale is at present
and this in spite of all sprays, fumiga-
tions, fungus or other preventatives.

Cultivating and Fertilizing Citrus Trees.

J. D. Bell.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is not to be expected, since horticul-
tural science has become a lifetime study
in what may be called: the producers col-
leges, established by our government all
over our country, that much that is new
can be brought you by a lay member
of our brotherhood. I shall endeavtor
to remind you anew of well known facts.
upon the principle that line upon line
and' precept ujpn precept is needed in our
business as in all others. Cultivation is a
word having a vast range, applying not
only to the every day business of the hor-
ticulturist but to 'every department of
human activity. In the limited sense in
which we are to consider it today let us
call to mind why we cultivate. First, to
conserve moisture; second, to put the soil
in good tilth; third, to kill grass and
weeds which are taking tree food from
the soil; fourth to decrease evaporation.
During the months of 'March, April
and May in Florida the orange grove
should be cultivated every ten days. In
the fall the grove should be plowed Shal-
low, this being the best method of put-
ting it in a clean condition for winter
and thus reducing danger fromv cold. As
to the tools and minor particulars of cul-
tivation every grower should judge by
his own experience what is best for him-
self or follow the example of his most
successful neighbor. In the dry weather
of spring and early summer cultivate
shallow, cultivate often. During the
rainy season cease cultivation.
Prof. H-ume says “the horse and cul-
tivator are often a most excellent sub-
stitute for an irrigation plant.” Some
one has said “cultivation is fertilization.”
Theory and practice strongly enforce the
necessity of frequent and thorough cul-
tivation during our dry season. An
equally important duty of the orange
grower is a liberal use of fertilizers.
Citrus trees amply repay good care and
attention. Not less than one ton of the
best quality of fertilizer should‘ be ap-
plied to each acre of bearing grove. A
good way of guaging the quantity of fer-
tilizer for a bearing tree is to increase
your applications until your tree has a
good crop of oranges and is at the same
time making a good growth. Look over
your grove and endeavor to make every
tree in it as good as the best one. Scat-
ter fertilizer broadcast through the grove,
except for young trees, then scatter upon
the feeding roots. Some successful grow-
ers fertilize in January, May and Octo-
ber. Others in February, June and No-
vember. Three applications are better
than a less number, having the same
amount of fertilizer. Work in fertilizer
soon after it is applied. Always be lib-
eral with your trees, a stingy man can—
not make a great success in orange
growing.

Reports from Local and Horticultural Societies.
By Lawrence C. Moore.
'M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
At the time I received President
Rolf’s circular letter (which was
doubtless mailed to every member),
naming certain subjects which should
have the attention of our Society, and
then mentally examined my- stock of
knowledge upon said subjects I threw
the letter in with my answered mail,
satisfying my conscience with the
thought that he would ﬁnd more fully
equipped men to discuss and entertain-
ingly present all the leading facts; so,
donning my hat. I wandered forth to
my orange trees, drying up for want
of water and cultivation, with work
enough in sight to keep three men
busy for a year! But—two topics kept
persistent hold of my mind and I found
myself repeating the old adage, “\Vhat
is everybody’s business is nobody’s
business,” and, in my egotism, I ap-
plied it to the letter of our President,
and persuaded myself that it was my
duty to do the little I might, to hold
up his hands—send him some response
and leave it to him to present the best
thought offered on any given subject,
or to dissect each paper, and combine
the best ideas, to the end that individ-
ual knowledge might be increased and
some progress be the result. I there-
fore throw upon him the whole respon-
sibility should this paper reach other
eyes—or ears—than his own!
Having determined my duty, next
came the selection of the subject. This
was not difﬁcult; it was suggested on
every hand by the wilting trees, the
encrusted ground, the hot, dry winds
and eight or ten neighbors sitting
around whittling, smoking and dis-
cussing everything but the improve-
ment of surrounding conditions. Per-
haps it was the strong contrast to all
this.which caused my mind to revert
to my boyhood’s days, when I had the
good fortune to spend several happy
vacations in that wonderfully thrifty
Quaker settlement. ’Sandy Spring,
Montgomery county, Maryland, where
both my grandmother and my honored
father ﬁrst saw the light. Here the
local Horticultural Society has ce-
mented the neighborhood into one
homogeneous 'whole, and no such con-
ditions as those surrounding me could
exist under the unity plan. Neglected
trees, idle men have no part or place
in that community, but persistent
labor and the helping hand of neigh-
borly neighbors have converted it into
one of the garden spots of this country.
And so I wrote to our President and
accepted an assignment on “Local
Horticultural Societies.” Then came
the rub; I was committed; had to
work out a given thing in a given time,
and that is always a nerve-strain.
Suddenly a brilliant inspiration came:
why not write for a full account of the
organization and life of the Society at
Sandy Spring and substitute it, warm
from its birthplace, for any colder facts
which I should have to cook over?

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
And so I will give you the reply which
came to my letter, with only such al-
terations as are necessary to elucidate
facts otherwise obscure because of lack
of familiarity with the surroundings.
“SANDY SPRING, MD.,
2nd month, nth, 1908.
My dear Cousin—I was glad to have
thy letter, for I believe it has been
twelve years since we have met. I send
thee, as requested, such information as
I possess regarding our Horticultural
Society. The Horticultural Society of
Sandy Spring has been in exist-
ence about forty years, and it seems
to us to be a fair model of a local
organization. It was started with the
double object of promoting a desira-
ble social life among country people,
and to cause them, by this contact of
minds, to learn better ways of living
and better methods of producing. thus
enabling the community to discover
and put into practical use new methods
of doing old things, as well as the most
modern and economical manner of
producing, harvesting and marketing
the products best adapted to its local-
ity.
Our Society meets once a month,
from March ﬁrst to November ﬁrst.
but in thy locality this would doubtless
be changed, and possibly twelve de-
lightful meetings might be held. About
ﬁfteen different households belong to
the Society, with an average of three
to a house in attendance; guests often
bring the numbers up to seventy-ﬁve.
Meetings are held in rotation at the
homes of the members, and each one
is expected to bring small samples of
his wheat, best fruits and ﬂowers, or
specimens of plants to be discussed,
looking to improvements in its propa-
gation, or to the extermination of
some enemy. We meet at 3:30 p. m.,
and have the usual ofﬁcers—President,
Vice-President, Secretary and Treas-
urer—who are elected annually. The
latter is a mere complimentary posi-
tion, as funds are not much in evi-
dence, nor are they needed; hence
there is no membership fee. The read-
ing of the minutes of last meeting is
disposed of in the usual way, and also
the minutes of the last meeting held
at the farm of the present hosts, since
this takes up the work most interest-
ing and valuable to them. For exam—
ple: Thee may be devoting thy time
to orange growing; another to pine-
apples; another to grapefruit; and so
on; each wants the ideas on his spe-
cialty, and it is the aim of the presiding
ofﬁcer to keep this subject uppermost.
Then comes the report of the “Fore-
thought Committee,” which is always
bright. Then each member is asked
a question, or may read a brief, suita-
ble selection. Generally two readers
are appointed, with the understanding
that they will not be called on if busi-
ness prevents. An early collation is
served in any informal manner selected
by the hostess. The collations are
purposely kept very simple and consist
of'tea, coffee, hot rolls or biscuit, ham,
chicken, or better still, a salad; or else
coffee and sandwiches, with a simple
dessert of cake or melons, in season.
This is served either by handing round
with paper napkins or is placed on a
table on the lawn, each guest helping
himself.
I have gone into particulars to show
how easy it is to serve seventy-ﬁve or
a hundred guests when it is done sim-
ply. It seems unnecessary to say that
neither politics, religion, nor any sub-

ject calculated to provoke heated dis-
cussion, is permissible.
Our Society always has a waiting
list. There are two similar ones in the
same country neighborhood. of forty
members each; this speaks volumes
for its usefulness. Your cOusin,
M. B. Thomas.
Mr. President, this article is sufﬁ-
ciently lengthy to stop here, but I ask
your indulgence for a single moment,
to say that no place in our country of-
fers a better ﬁeld for local organiza-
tions than Florida. We boast of the
most cosmopolitan citizenship of any
State in the Union. Local jealousies
and petty personal differences are sap-
ping the life of many communities;
men antagonize progressive local
measures because others advocate
them, and I have yet to see the neigh-
borhood unanimous even for good
roads. One neighbor withholds the
price obtained for a shipment, and
makes a secret of the name of the
house to which he consigns it. An-
other will write your customer, whose
name he has obtained at depot from
your shipment, underselling you.
These and similar local unpleasant-
nesses are rendered void by local as-
sociations, and the old but true state-
ment is exempliﬁed, that “There is a
giving that does not empoverish and
a withholding that doth not enrich.”
If this be true, then go home and or-
ganize, and let the ﬁrst Society render
us a synopsis of its year’s work,
through its secretary, at our next an-
nual meeting.
ORGANIZATION OF LOCAL SOCIETIES.
By H. B.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I said I did not have any paper; I
might have said also that I did not
have any speech. If you want to or-
ganize a Society, go ahead and do it.
If you succeed, you succeed; and if you
fail, you fail. We organized a Society
in DeLand to ﬁght against insects, and
the people, through that organization,
have become more interested in horti-
culture. If you organize a local soci-
ety, you will ﬁnd it is an easy way to
get members into this Horticultural
Society. The Fruit Growers’ Protec-
tive Association will be a great help to
us, and our society saw at once the
advantage of taking hold of it and the
great need of carrying on its work.
Stevens.
When they made an appeal for money,
$300.00 was raised with us in about
ﬁfteen minutes. If you have an or-
ganization like this, it is an easy and
quick way to bring matters of vital in-
terest to you all, before them, and it
is an advantage to have as many or-
ganizations as you have neighbor-
hoods
I think it well to get together locally
and form other organizations and all
join together against the things that
are working against our interests; the
railroad transportation, etc., and to
work with the Horticultural Society.
There is everything for us in co-opera-
tion, and failure for a good many if
we insist on standing as individuals.

Agrichltural Organization.
By C. K. McQuarrie.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me the greatest of pleasure to
present to you for consideration and dis—
cussion a subject that every member of
_ this Society is interested in, viz., Agri-
Cultural Organization,
In dealing with this subject I want to
say at the start that the word Agricultural
in this case means Horticulture as well as
Agriculture.
There is no doubt whatever of the
beneﬁt to be derived individually and col-
lectively where there is a wide-awake.
up-to-date organization of farmers and
fruitgrowers in existence. and it would
be to the advantage of the country at
large if their numbers were largely in—
creased. 'One can easily understand how
uniformity of prices can be maintained
and the proper distribution of products
controlled by an organization. where the
individual would be hopelessly lost. We
have had ample proof of this in West
Florida during the last twenty years and
if it would not seem to be out of order. I
would like to give a little history of a
couple of these organizations of which I
happen to be a member.
Eighteen years ago there was a rush
of new settlers around DeFuniak and
every last one of them going in for peach1
pear and plum growing. \Ve found that
collectively we could buy nursery stock
to greater advantage in car-load lots; so
we organized “The West Florida High-
land Fruit Growers Association.” we
had a membership of more than one hun-
dred. For three or four years everything
went along smoothly; bought nursery
stock and fertilizer in car-load lots and
saved considerable money in so doing.
G. W. Mellish was our energetic and
capable secretary, and A. G. Hollowell
was president, and under this manage-
ment things did very well. \Ve held
meetings once a month and in the sum-
mer time, or when weather permitted
these meetings were ‘held at members'
residences in rotation. At those meetings
was laid the foundation of the greater
interest that West Florida takes in farm_
ers’ meetings than any other portion of
the state. And here let me digress a
little from my subject to say that the at-
tendance at Farmers’ Institutes in West
Florida is far beyond any other section
of the State both in attendance and in-
terest in the subject on hand.
When our orchards began bearing. we
tried to ship in the same way that we
bought, but it somehow would not work.
The varied individuality of the member-
ship caused considerable friction. Poor
packing, packing unripe fruit. and pack-
ing fruit that was too ripe were some of
the causes and we found that, generally
speaking. the man that did the worst
packing and was not particular as to uni-
formity in size and coloring was the one
who did the most kicking and loudest
grumbling.
The L. & N. (the only road in this

section) would not give us the rates to
which we “were entitled. They had us
by the neck, and they knew it. So when
our Association came to the marketing
side of its usefulness it did not prove
as successful as the purchasing side of
it, and, to add to our calamities, our
enemy, the San Jose Scale, came in
among us to stay for good, and in a very
few years we were as busy grubbing up
dead trees as we had been planting, and
the grubbing was the more laborious job
of the two.
For a few years after that our Asso-
ciation drifted along with a very small
membership waiting to see how affairs
would turn out. Brown-rot and crown-
gall, and other enemies made themselves
at home gmong the few remains of our
orchards. \Ve knew we had one of the
best fruit sections in the country and our
faith was strong that we could devise
ways and means to overcome most of our
difﬁculties. .
On July 4th, 1899, was formed the
“\Vest Florida Agricultural Society,”
whose formation was the outcome of a
general farmers’ picnic at Grand Ridge.
This picnic was gotten up by Judge Por-
ter so as to get West Florida farmers
together in a social way and discuss mat-
ters relating to their calling.
The Society was launched at that meet-
ing, but at a later one, at DeFuniak. the
ofﬁcers were appointed and a constitution
and by-laws adopted. The Society has
been very successful along purely agri-
cultural lines. The president at that
time, Judge Porter. called on the pres-
ident of the L. & N. R. R. (Mr. Smith)
and was successful in getting a one-cent
rate for members to attend meetings.
The territory covered by the Society ex-
tends from River Junction to Pensacola,
160 miles. In its earlier history meet-
ings were held once a month in the sum-
mer and every two weeks in the winter.
At these meetings all subjects relative
to farming interests were discussed. In
fact, they were equal to Farmers' Insti-
tutes; but as we had no funds at our dis-
posal to pay expenses of state lecturers,
were conﬁned to members for speakers.
At each meeting the place for holding
the next one was decided. The favorite
places were Grand Ridge, Chipley and
DeFuniak.
Members attending from a distance
had to deposit a certiﬁcate of membership
with the ticket agent to get the one-cent
rate for distance traveled. The condition
to be observed in getting this reduced
rate was to notify the division ticket
agent a week ahead of any meeting to
allow him time to notify the local agent.
The membership of this Society at one
time numbered nearly three hundred of
. the most progressive farmers of West
Florida.
In 1901 it was decided to try to ship
canteloupes and other early farm pro-
ducts in car lots, the railroad agreeing
to give us certain facilities by placing
pick-up cars at our disposal. This worked
fairly well, but we found a great many
obstacles in the way; the different soils
and different modes of planting causing
uncertainty in time of ripening: also the
different fertilizers used and the different
modes of culture. Every small thing
had in the aggregate quite a decided in- ‘
ﬂuence on the general success of any one
crop, and the studying of results along
these lines was a very valuable education
to those interested, and as the writer hap-
pened to be the secretary, the informa-
tion he got and the means of observation
at his command, were very valuable to

him for further work in this connection.
The death of C. P. Atmore, the gen-
eral ticket agent of the L. & N ., gave the
Society a severe setback; for Mr. At-
more’s successor cancelled the arrange-
ment for the one-cent fare, thus giving
us a blow from which we have not yet
recovered, for the regular passenger rate
on this division of the L. & N. is four
cents a mile, and few farmers are going
to leave home, lose time, and pay this
rate to attend meetings, let the subjects
be ever so important.
We are still holding together nom-
inally, waiting for better times to come
to us in the shape of the return of the
old rate. We may not get it, and we
may, but the good the Society has al-
ready done in awakening interest among
the farmers of our section and in educat-
ing them in the meeting-habit is of great
value to all concerned, for it is a very
difﬁcult matter to get agriculturists to at-
tend meetings. They think they have no
time to devote to meetings and yet these
are schools of education to them. The
very fact of meeting each other and get-
ting interested in each other’s doings
awakens a livelier interest in all matters -
pertaining to their good.
We all know that the real prosperity
of the country depends on its agriculture.
It is the real creator of wealth, and if
those engaged in it would only wake up
and get more mutual conﬁdence in each
other the good they could do is incal-
culable. To get this ideal state of mat-
ters, we have to begin early. VVle have
to start in the district school house. Edu-
cation is at the bottom of it. An ignorant
man or woman is always a suspicious
one; thinks someone is going to get
ahead of him; for this lack of education
keeps his mind cramped and his outlook
narrow. In all agricultural meetings, the
man who knows least thinks that he know
most, and this holds true everywhere;
and the past history of agricultural so-
cieties all over the country will bear out
what I have said.
The outlook for this usefulness of agri-
cultural organization is very bright.
Their past history is full of achievements,
but their future history will be yet fuller.
The solving of the present problem of the
age, good roads, is in the agriculturists'
hands, and they are leading the way in a
wonderful manner. About ﬁfteen years
ago the farmers of New jersey pro-
claimed the fact that the state at large
was as much interested in good roads as
the farmer; that every individual resident
of the state, through the market, was
affected for weal or woe by road condi-
tions, and demanded that the state treas-
ury pay at least half the cost of good-
road building. This really was the birth
of the state aid for good roads in Amer-
ica, and the New Jersey agriculturist was
at the bottom of it. This work was not
done by leading individuals among agri-
culturists, but by the combined efforts of
the agricultural organizations of the
States. Their good work was so evident
that others caught on to the New Jersey
idea and the good work spread rapidly,
until today state aid for good roads ob-
tains in fourteen states. All save two

gan has a sensible law whereby the state

amendment providing for a bond issue
of ﬁfty million dollars available at the
rate of ﬁve million a year, all for good
roads.
The New York farmer, strange to re-
late, did not share his New Jersey
brother's enthusiasm for good road-s at
ﬁrst, but now he has fallen into line and
goes one better in that the state does more
for this purpose than any of the others.
Let us look at our own state and see
the paltry efforts the farmers are making
for good roads and compare it to those
mentioned, and yet we could make good
roads at less cost than any of those. The
Middle West is setting the pace in this
direction. The Indiana agricultural or-
ganizations have been the means of get-
ting that state to lead all others, as thirty-
ﬁve per cent. of the entire roads of the
state are 'hard roads. Ohio comes next
with thirty-three per cent.., Wisconsin
seventeen, Kentucky sixteen, Michigan
ten, Illinois eight, Missouri two, Iowa
one and seven-tenths, and Mississippi
0.38. Where is Florida? Too low to be
ﬁgured out. I hope the day is not far
distant when we can also make a show-
ing in this direction.
The Highway Commission of Illinois
has been collecting some very valuable
data on the beneﬁts of good roads versus
mud roads. Travel is uniform all the
year round on good roads, while mud
roads show a falling off of at least three-
fourths during February, March and
April, showing fully that the economic
beneﬁts of good roads are not fully un-
derstood by the ordinary individual.
The need of the hour is the road-
builder and our agricultural organization
more than any other must be in the lead
to get him here as soon as possible.
“The schoolmaster and roads are
the most important agencies to advance
civilization,” declared a great statesman
in the U. S. Senate years ago. The
schoolmaster is in evidence and doing
good work; but where are our good
roads? Now, let us, as an organization
of horticulturists representing the best in
the state in our particular line, lend our
aid to hasten this good movement for the
common highways of our country are the
veins of commerce and civilization, and
the greatest need of our day is good
roads. This question outweighs the
Panama Canal or the irrigation of the
arid West. The world’s food supply
passes on wagons over our country roads
and that tells the story in a sentence.
‘Any interruption of traﬂ-ic upon our
roads affects market conditions. The fact
of the matter is that prices of farm pro-
ducts have depended more on road con-
ditions than anything else. In the great
grain-producing section, crops must all
be hurried to market in about two
months’ time for later than that the roads
will be impassable, thus crowding into a
few weeks what should have six and
eight months to do it in. The conse-
quences are stringency in the money mar-
ket, depression of prices, and a good time
for those parasites on the so-called
Boards of Trade who feed on what they
don’t produce and gamble with other
people’s property.
I could give this subject all the time
at the disposal of the Society during the
whole meeting and then I would be touch-
ing only the fringe of it,
And now let me ﬁnish by saying that
the good that can be done by a live agri-
cultural organization is beyond calcula-
tion, if conducted along proper lines. The
subject of immigration is one that could
be proﬁtably handled by such, for the en-

couragement of the right class of settlers
is one that calls loudly at our doors for
solution.
The agitation for uniform rates from
our railroad company is another live is-
sue that could be taken up and properly
settled, and a score more of abuses that
exist to keep the agricultural industry in
a backward condition. And not the least
of these is the subject of compulsory edu-
cation, for until we compel careless
parents to keep their children at school
we cannot expect a ﬁrst-class citizenship
from the rising generation.
In recommending the consideration of
these very important questions that con-
front us as citizens and agriculturists, we
must by all means steer clear of giving
any of them a political aspect, for the
history of the past goes to show that
politics has been the rock on which the
most of agricultural organizations have
been wrecked in the past. So by all means
let us keep away from giving any ques-
tion under consideration a political color-
mg.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I
leave the subject with you for your criti-
cism and discussion. My remarks have
been made with a view of bringing out
the best point in the subject under con-
sideration by the after-discussion which
I hope it will bring on in a lively manner.

Pasadena Farmers’ Club.
By H. Roberts.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Pasadena Farmers’ Club con-
tinues in a prosperous condition, with
meetings well attended and interest in
the discussions increasing.
This is primarily a social club, de-
signed to promote friendly intercourse
among all the people in our rural com-
munities, both natives or old residents
and those who have come in later from
other states. We realize the fact that,
especially in sparsely settled districts,
farmers and fruit growers are apt to
live too much to themselves. They
fail to take advantage of the opportun-
ities afforded them to enjoy and de-
velop the social side of life, thus un-
willingly imposing upon themselves
and families privations that could well
be avoided, and failing to obtain the
full beneﬁts to be derived from the
freedom and healthfulness of a life
among the trees.
In this effort to amend social con-
ditions we have succeeded even beyond
our expectations. Our people are
united and in hearty sympathy with
each other. New-comers are intro-
duced at once into the best society and
old neighbors who had not visited each
other for years are brought pleasantly
together and old friendships renewed.
Our discussions are on some matter
of general interest, on some line of our
work as home-builders. For that is,
after all, our principal aim, to make of
our little corner of Florida a land of
happy homes, such as can only be
found among a prosperous and united
people.
We should be more than pleased if
this club idea would spread to other
districts and that a system of inter-
correspondence could be established
between the clubs so that the people
of one county or section might feel a
closer interest in the people of other
sections; that all might work together
for the better settlement and upbuild-
ing of our beautiful state.
A very interesting feature of our
work during the past year was a
Farmers’ Institute held under the aus-
pices of the Club, at which lectures
were delivered by Prof.- Rolfs and
Prof. Blair, of the Florida Experiment
Station, the exercises being inter-
spersed with talks and discussions by
local workers, and not neglecting the
generous picnic lunch supplied by the
ladies who are. after all, the mainstay
and support of the Club.
With many thanks to your Society
for the invitation to “report progress,”
we remain. yours for a still better and
more prosperous Florida,
The Pasadena Farmers’ Club.
Per H. Roberts, President.

REPORTS OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Executive Committee met at
the Secretary’s ofﬁce in jacksonville
on July Ist, and instructed the Secre-
tary to print the report of the meeting
held at St. Petersburg last May. This
volume was dedicated to the memory
of our deceased president, C. L. Mc-
Carty. Sundry bills were approved
and ordered paid.
On March 19th, your Committee
met in Jacksonville and named the
date of May 12, 13, 14 and 15 as the
r
time for holding the twenty-ﬁrst an-
nual session at Gainesville, and in-
structed the Secretary to secure rail-
road rates and arrange with the local
committee at Gainesville for place of
meeting and hotel rates.
The Executive Committee- met at
the Brown House Thursday morning
May 14th; bills as presented by the
Secretary were examined and ordered
paid. The accounts of the Secretary
and treasurer were examined and
found correct. The treasurer’s report
showed a deﬁcit previous to this meet-

ing of $136.85, which amount the
treasurer has advanced.
The amount paid in by the Secretary
at this meeting amounts to $311.11,
which will give only $174.26 towards
printing this year’s proceedings and
other necessary expenses. It is evi-
dent that the Society will be over
$200.00 short of meeting expenses.
This time seems opportune for an
endeavor to secure state aid for the
Society.

Final Resolutions.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
\VHEREAS, The members of the Flor-
ida State Horticultural Society in its
twenty-ﬁrst annual session have been
so well entertained and so well cared
for by the citizens of Gainesville, and
in view of the courtesies extended to
us by the State University and the
ofﬁcers of the Experiment Station,
therefore be it
RESOLVED, That we wish to thank
the citizens of Gainesville for our royal
entertainment (they have made good),
the ofﬁcers of the University for a very
proﬁtable and entertaining afternoon
and evening and the best of suppers.
and for showing us that we have an
interest in so great an institution. We
feel gratiﬁed to know its size and
scope. and pledge it support and good
will.
RESOLVED FURTHER, That we wish
especially to acknowledge the very
efﬁcient work and interest in our en-
tertainment of Dr. C. L. Crow and
Messrs. Wilson and Ellis. Their. work
has been thoroughly and carefully
done. and we appreciate and thank
them. \Ve wish further to thank Mr.
Ino. Billing, Press Secretary, for the
very complete reports of our proceed-
ings. and congratulate the people of
Gainesville on possession of so bright
a Sun. This paper has given us the
use of several columns daily.
RESOLVED FURTHER, That we feel
under especially heavy obligations to
President Rolfs for the wonderfully
interesting and instructive program he
has been able to prepare for us, and
extend to him our hearty thanks.
RESOLVED FURTHER, That we thank
the gentlemen in Uncle Sam’s most
efﬁcient ranks of workers, who are en-
gaged in solving for us the difﬁcult
problems that confront us, and wish
them speedy success. We also wish
to thank the Transportation Com-
panies for the courtesy of giving us
good service and in reducing the rail-
road fare, thus enabling more of us to
come to the meetings, and hope that
they may some day see the wisdom of
inaugurating a lower rate in the move-
ment of our produce to the markets of
the country. We hope that they may
see that our interests and theirs are
identical and that they prosper as we
prosper.
It is also desired to extend thanks
to the two ladies who added so much
to our pleasure and entertainment——
Mrs. Prange and Miss Hubbard.

Necrology.

EULOGY OF REV. LYMAN PHELPS.
E. S. Hubbard.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
On April 26th our friend and fellow
worker, Rev. Lyman Phelps, embarked
on his last journey to “the undiscovered
country, that bourn fr0m which no
traveler returns,” and I would render a
tribute to his memory. The lofty brow,
the piercing eyes, the Dantean nose, the
grim yet tender mouth, the prognathous
jaw, the countenance that was index to
his character will be seen among us never
again. The distinguished presence that
graced our gatherings is a memory of
the past. The subtle intellect that coun—
seled and guided in our deliberations is
a shade with the host of departed spirits,
and the place that knew him once will
. know him no more.
Thirty-ﬁve years ago, broken in health
from overwork in his chosen profess'on,
having buried the wife of his youth, with
even life despaired of, he came to Florida.
In our balmy climate he gradually gath-
ered strength and courage and began mis-
sionary \vork among the scattered settle-
ments. The long drives through the wild
forest _country gave him an intimate ac-
quaintance with Orange county and stim—
ulated anew his interest in botany, giving
him a knowledge of the species and habits
of the Flora of Florida equalled by few.
From this he became interested in the
horticultural and business advancement
of his surroundings. For a time he was
postmaster at Sanford, connected with
the bank and an encourager of all legi-
timate enterprises; but what appealed to
him most was the growing and improve-
ment of citrus fruits.
For a time superintendent of General
Sanford’s Bellair orange grove he made
an intimate study of the great number
of new varieties imported by General
Sanford and was the chief factor, in se-
lecting the most desirable and introduc-
ing them to the public. At that time
nearly all the oranges in Florida were
grown on sweet seedling trees from seeds
of the old Spanish strain of stocks and the
groves planted by Zephaniah Kingsley.
Mr. Parsons, the nurseryman of Flush-
ing, Long Island, had made quite a list
of importations from Rivers of England.
including the Excelsior, also known as
Hart’s and Valencia Late and imported
by General Sanford as Brown, but the
varieties of Maltas, Jaffas.|etc., were
mainly brought to public notice by Mr.
Phelps.
He was the father of chemical fertiliz-
ing for citrus fruits in Florida. \Vhen

he began his experiments the old groves
were mainly fertilized by cowpenning
with cattle; the muck mania was in full
blast and the small amounts of commer-
cial fertilizers used were usually either
organic nitrogen material or one-sided,
ill-balanced chlorine base mixtures that
produced when used continuously unfa-
vorable results. The discovery of a well-
balanced chemical fertilizer produced
from sulphates that can be used safely
year after year was a triumph of which
any horticulturist might be proud.
The inﬂuence of this discovery has been
far-reaching not only with citrus, but with
deciduous fruits and the principle in-
volved is now generally recognized as the
correct method for high-grade results. He
also discovered that an excess of sulphate
of ammonia or a spray of bi-sulphate
soda prematurely sweetens oranges.
Mr. Phelps was also a prime mover in
the citrus exhibits and competitions
started at Orlando and continued at San-
ford and Ocala. He used his full in-
ﬂuence for the judging of citrus fruits by
scales of points and furthered the im-
provement of those scales to this present
form. Nothing educated public opinion
and knowledge as to the standards of ex-
cellence of oranges and the merits of
different varieties as did these competi-
tions, and there was no greater object
lesson on scientiﬁc culture and fertilizing
than the thin-skinned, high-ﬂavored fruit
shown at these exhibitions. I think Mr.
Phelps was most proud, however, ofhis
discovery of the cause of bud-sports, va-
riations or so-called mutations of citrus
fruits. The origin of new varieties,
types or species in plants is a complex
subject. The production of new varieties
or types by cross-pollination or hybrid-
ization and the culling and selection from
thousands of seedlings is exempliﬁed by
the work of Burbank and others.
To illustrate the small and inconclusive
extent of experimental research into the
origin of so-called accidental sports I will
quote from Prof, H. ]. \Vebber, Bulletin
251, February 1908, Cornell University
Agricultural Experiment Station of the
College of Agriculture, Plant Breeding:
“A second type of variation is that known
to gardeners and horticulturists as sports
and to scientists as mutations. These are
large pattern, striking variations which
do not occur very commonly, but which
when found are likely to prove useful in
the production of new types of value. The
recent scientiﬁc studies of De Vries, a
famous botanist of Holland, have empha-
sized the great importance of such varia-
tions in the production of cultivated vari-
eties and the evolutions of species. As is
well known to gardeners, these sports or
mutations appear suddenly without warn-
ing or reason so far as we know. We
cannot produce them and must simply
wait until they appear and then be pre-
pared to recognize and propagate them.
Mutations usually reproduce their char-
acters without much reversion to the
parental type except such as is caused by
cross-pollination. Mutations of self-fer-
tilized plants thus usually come true to
type, while in cross—fertilized plants the
mutations must usually be cultivated in
an isolated place and carefully selected
to weed out the effect of such crossing
as has occurred. Many seedsmen exam-
ine their trial grounds regularly for the
sports or mutations and many of our best
varieties have resulted from the selection
of such sports. Livingston, of Ohio,
who during his life was famous for the
number of new varieties of tomatoes
which he produced. made a practice to


## p. 226 (#768) ############################################

224 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
regularly search the ﬁelds of tomatoes
which he grew for seed purposes, for
such sports, and almost all of his num-
erous varieties were produced by the dis-
covery of such striking variations.”
“Another kind of variation, probably
of little value to the breeder of annual
plants and about which we as yet know
very little, is the so-called bud varia-
tions, sports or bud mutations. Chrysan-
themum. and rose growers know that it
is not a very uncommon thing for a plant
to produce a branch which will be entirely
different from the remaining portions of
the plant. Valuable new varieties of
roses, chrysanthemums. carnations and
some other ﬂowers and fruits have been
secured by the selection and propagation
of such bud variations. They seem in
a large measure to be comparable to
mutations except that they originate in
a bud change instead of a change occur-
ring in the sexual reproduction. It is
probable that they will ultimately be
found to be due to similar causes, being
produced in the same way..”
Prof. VVebber also speaks of the work
of an experimenter stimulating plants to
produce mutations by injecting chemical
salts at certain periods. Mr. Phelps,
however, believed that no effect in nature
is produced without some active, adequate
cause and that the bud changes were ef-
fected by the organs of reproduction of
the ﬂowers.
The citrus are the most highly organ—
ized plants I know of. The discovery
that cross-pollination changes citrus
fruits on the parent tree to hybrid fruits
but not with hybrid seeds, goes back one
hundred years to Gallesio.
Mr. Phel'ps discovered that not only
was the fruit affected in these rare in-
stances by cross-pollination, but that the
wood immediately below the fruit partook
of the cross also and by taking buds be-
low the fruit when small be secured trees
that bore the hybrid fruit and remained
true to type. He also claimed that by
forcing the trees with special combina-
tions of chemical fertilizers they were
more susceptible and that he proved these
results by artiﬁcial cross-pollination.
These were lost in 1895.
It is unfortunate no public experi-
menter has had the courage and patience
to work on this line like Burbank on by-
brids. as the results when obtained are
more immediate and certain. The estab-
lishing of a working plan, however,
would require considerable experiment
compared with growing hybrid seedling
plants, as a majority of hybrids show
crossing from the start, while with cross-
pollinated sports the negative results
might possibly be as great as the rejec-
tions from seedlings. The occurrence of
these 'bud sports from bud wood used just
after the spring bloom has been often ob-
served by citrus nurserymen and fruit
growers.
So far as I know they have never been
noted from bud wood taken before bloom-
ing. I have secured two and probably
three varieties of navels in this manner,
The inﬂuence of the bud on the stock.
is also greater than imagined, as
was shown in numerous cases after the
1895 freeze where lemon and sweet or-
ange sprouts sprang from the roots of
sour stocks on which lemons and oranges
had been previously budded but killed
out_
Mr. Phelps was an original member
of the Nurserymen’s Association that was
reorganized into the old Florida Horticul-
tural Society. He was a charter member
of the present State Horticultural Society

and chairman of its executive committee
till failing health rendered him unable to
fulﬁll its duties, and he did as much as
any one man to steer the Society through
the perils of its infancy and establish those
conservative policies which have made it
respected and a power in this state and
country.
Mr. Phelps was a man of imagination
and possessed the subtle outreaching in—
stincts that mark the prophet and the
seer. His enthusiasms may sometimes
have carried him to temporary erroneous
Rev. Lyman Phelps, who was a native
of New York State, was born December
12, 1833.
He early 'served an apprenticeship to a
cabinetmaker. where he learned the
art of working. polishing and ﬁnish-
ing woods which 'was to be in later life a
source of pleasure to himself and friends.
He attended the Moravian Institute as
a student in winter, teaching in various
places during the summer months.
Later he attended the Theological Sem-
inary at Nashotah, Wisconsin.
He was ordained to the deaconhood
of the Protestant Episcopal church at
Nashotah Seminary, St. Sylvanns Parish,
VV'isconsin, June 15, I862. and to the
priesthood at Zion church, Oconomonoc,
Wisconsin, June 28, 1863.
Under Bishop Jackson Kemper he did
missionary work part of the time among

parish at Mineral Point, \Visconsin and
principal of the church school at that'

it is the so-called cranks and visionaries
that reach out into the unknown and dis-
cover and harness the unseen forces. Let
his example be to us an inspiration, a

During the summer of his last year at
Mineral Point, 'he went for his vacation
to a resort near Magdaline Island where
he was to hold services. He was accom -
panied by his wife.
Owing to bad sanitary conditions
while 'here both Rev. and Mrs. Phelps
contracted typhoid fever, which resulted
in the death of Mrs. Phelps and complete
loss of health to Mr. Phelps.
He was obliged to give up his charge
at Mineral Point. He went cast for
medical advice and treatment, stopping
for some time at the sanitarium of Dr.
Foster at Clifton Springs, N. Y.
In the winter of 1875, accompanied by
a devoted sister, he came to Florida.
Here much of his time was spent with
gun over his shoulder, in taking long
tramps through the woods studying the
ﬂowers, trees and birds of the southland.
His health improved and 'he became
deeply interested in the culture of the
orange and other tropical and semi-trop-
ical fruits.

On August 15, 1877, he was married
to Mrs. Mary Lyman iWells, the widow
of the late Philip Wells of Armenia, N.
Y., and (laughter of Moses Lyman, of
Goshen, Conn., who had a winter home
on Onoro lake near Ft. Reed, Fla.
Rev. and Mrs. Phelps chose for the
site of their future home a lovely spot
lying between Silver and Onoro lakes.
At this time Mr. Phelps applied the
knowledge acquired in early life to dec-
orating his house 'with beautiful speci-
mens of Florida mahogany and curly
pine; beautifully ﬁnished and polished
doors, panels, mantels, tables and suites
of furniture remain as monuments of his
knowledge, skill and handiwork. Mr.
Phelps’ health continuing to improve, he
did considerable missionary work through
the county. He was rector of the church
of the Holy Cross at Sanford for some
time. ‘
He continued the study of the orange
and all citrus fruits, was manager of the
famous Belair Grove, owned by General
Sanford, when in its prime.
It was while manager of this grove,
that under his direction were raised some
of the ﬁrst and ﬁnest pineapples ever
grown in the State.
He was appointed postmaster at San-
ford February 26, 1883, serving the pub-
lic faithfully during the term of his ap-
pointment.
He was one of the originators of the
Lyman Bank, and director of- the First
National Bank until failing health caused
him to resign.
His grove at Denmere, his home, be-
came one of the ﬁnest in the State.
The freeze of 1895 was a severe blow
to Mr. Phelps.
The death of his beloved wife in Jan-
uary, 1897,. was shortly followed by a
severe attack of typhoid fever. Much of
his time for the next two years was spent
in rebuglding his grove.
During the winter seasons he went to
Lake Maitland each Sunday to assist his
honored and ‘beloved friend, Bishop Ben-
jamin Whipple, in the siervices at the
church of the Good Shepherd‘. This he
continued to do until the death of Bishop
Whipple, which was another severe blow
to Mr. Phelps.
On January I 7. 1900, he was married
to Miss Mary Louise Blanie, of Sanford,
Fla., whom he had known for many
years.
At this time Mr. Phelps became very
much interested in the growth of lettuce
and celery, which was attracting a great
deal of attention in the State. During
the two years in which he was engaged
in this work he raised successively very
ﬁne crops of each vegetable on his lots in
Sanford.
During the winter of 1905 and I906,
M.r. Phelps’ failing health was a source
of great anxiety to his wife and friends.
He could take only short walks about his
home.
After January, 1906, he was never
able to leave the house. His days were
spent in his roller chair. Much of the
time on the east porch overlooking the
beautiful lake Onoro, or on the south
porch looking toward Silver lake. His
favorite spot in the evening being at the
west hall door to watch the sun sink to
rest 'behind the orange trees.
There was little noticeable change in
his health until the winter of 1907-8
when he grew gradually weaker. but suf-
fered very little pain.

him in his chair for the last time. By his
own wish he remained up all day, and
watched the sun set at evening.
Easter Monday he was too weak to
get up. Each day he grew weaker, the
last three passed in a semi-conscious
state, recognizing no one but his sorrow-
in-g wife.
His spirit quietly passed away on Sun-
day morning, April 26, at about
o’clock.
The funeral services were held at Den-
mere, Archdeacon Brown ofﬁciating.
The remains were laid in ‘the family
burying ground near Silver lake, where
in their season, the orange trees he loved,
may scatter their blossoms over his quiet
grave.

WILLIAM H. EARLE.
William H. Earle for many years was
a prominent and leading citizen of Tan-
gerine. He was born at Hubbardston,
Mass, on the 22nd day of May, 1831.
His father -was a farmer, and of, good
New England stock.
The life history, and a detailed account
of the work done 'by the subject of this
sketch, would, as those best acquainted
with him well know, ﬁll a volume. Being
possessed of a mind, more than ordinarily
bright and active, and having a natural
inclination to literature, he at an early
age became, and through all of his active
business career remained a valued and
constant correspondent of many of the
leading papers not only of his native
State, but also of the State of his adop-
tion. Nor was it by pen alone that he
acquired the respect and' esteem of the
citizens of his native State; for we ﬁnd
him taking an active and leading part in
the gran'ger movement; and as one of the
strongest and most aggressive advocates
of the cause of temperance, and it was
upon the platform 'and the rostrum that
he won his brightest laurels; eventually
becoming the gubernatorial candidate on
the ticket of the temperance party of his
native State. Again we ﬁnd him actively
engaged in mercantile pursuits, he
having founded and for many years per-
sonally conducted the agricultural imple-
ments, feed and seed business, still car-
ried: on by: Ross Bros. \in the city of
Worcester, Mass, and which owing in
no Small measure to his care and forc-
thought has continued to flourish until at
the present time it is one of the largest
concerns of the kind to be found any-
where within his native State. Mr. Earle
continued in the active management of
this enterprise until about I885, when on
account of failing health, he was com-
pelled to ldispose of |the 'business, and
turned his thoughts toward‘ a more con-
genial climate than that aﬁ'orded by the
old Bay State. His former schoolmate
and life long friend, Mfr. Dudley Adams,
having acquired extensive holdings of
real estate near Lake Beauclair, in Or-
ange county, Florida, it was perfectly
natural that his thoughts should turn
that way, and we soon ﬁnd him in com—
pany with two near and dear friend‘s, Mr.
George H. Rice, of Worcester, Mass,
and Mr. S. C. Davis of New York, lo-
cated near the small village of Tanger-

ine; this was about 1883, and the three
friends at once commenced the construc-
tion of a cottage, for their winter home
in the Sunny South. The genial and
equable climate of Florida soon brought
about a decided improvement in the
health of Mr, Earle; and he.thereu-pon
determined to make Tangerine his future
home. His friend, Mr. Rice, and him-
self i-mmediately embarked in ihe orange
culture, then in its infancy in their local-
ity.
They established a large nursery, and
set out many of the orange groves in
and about the village of Tangerine’ the
subject of this SkCthll at once entering
" heart and soul in the enterprise.
Their groves grew, flourished and com-
menced to bear ﬁne crops of golden fruit;
then came that 'never to be forgotten
freeze of 1895. Almost every tree was
destroyed; and absolute ruin stared every
owner of a grove in the face. The result
was that most of the capitalists from the
north withdrew from the ﬁeld, and aban-
doning everything returned to their
northern homes in disgust.
Not so with Mr. Earle, and it is just
here that his indomitable will, energy and
perseverance most shows itself. He did
not give up, but patiently, persistently
and industriously went to work to repair
so far as lay in his power the damage
done to his groves, and 'by his acts and
advice inspired a few of his neighbors to
follow his example. The result is that
we have the Tangerine of today, sur-
rounded by its tens of thousands of beau-
tiful orange and grapefruit trees; while
many another settlement has for the lack
of a man of Mr. Earle’s sterling worth
and character. been absolutely deserted,
and literally wiped from the map of
Florida.
During all of these years Mr. Earle
was also an active member of the Horti-
cultural Society of Florida, and through
his association with that society and its
ofﬁcers, he was enabled to secure many
choice varieties of fruits, plants and flow-
ering shrubs from other countries, many
of which remain as a monument to his
good taste and practical forethought.
There is still another enterprise in which
Mr. Earle was interested. He became
the owner of the only hotel in Tangerine.
about 1885, naming it The \Vachuset
House and personally conducted the
house for many years.
Here he hospitany entertained many
of his friends from the north, during
their winter sojourn in this land of sun—
shine, of fruit and of ﬂowers. Mr. Earle
was twice married, his ﬁrst wife was
Sarah R. Greenwood. Two children
were born to them; one a son, William.

MR. F. LIPP.
Mr. F. Lipp, who died at his home in
Cocoa May 8, was born in Bavaria, Ger-
many, 1844; 'he came to the United
States, 1882, New York, and in 1886
moved to City Point, Fla., remaining for
one year. After that 'he came to Cocoa
and has lived here since. He was mar-
ried the second time 33 years ago to the
present wife, who survives him. He was
buried in the Cocoa cemetery Saturday
evening, with only the formal burial cere-
mony, read by his old time friend Mr. R.
N. Andrews, and his remains now rest
by the side of his little son who died 21
years ago. A large number of friends
were present. Mr. Lipp has been unwell
for almost a year, and bore his affliction
with great patience. He was kind—a good
neighbor, and his closest neighbors for
21 years bear testimony to his genuine
worth as a citizen. The old song “kind
hearted and' true” sums up the life of
Mr. Lipp, and many admirers will miss
him.

Question Box.
No. I—To what extent do orange and
grapefruit growers practice cutting out
the dead wood accumulating on the in-
side of trees? We would like to hear
from some of our best growers on their
practice along this line.
Mr. Hart—I think it is desirable to
cut it out- and I do so when I can pos-
sibly ﬁnd time for the work. The dead
wood there does no harm to the tree so
far as I know, unless it is very large,
but it is very inconvenient to the pickers
and it injures and destroys considerable
fruit. I think it advisable to prune out
all dead wood while the fruit is small.

N0. 2—Do 'we cultivate the soil, dur-
ing a dry time, to bring the moisture up,
or to keep it down?
Mr. Hoard—I do not see how cultiva-
tion could have any effect towards bring-
ing the moisture up, but think it would
have the tendency to check it and keep
it down.
Mr. Von Engelken.—I presume the
practice of cultivating during a dry spell
is for the same purpose as that accom-
plished in the Western States, where
they raise crops with practically no rain-
fall whatever. They keep the soil
stirred; in other words, keep the mois-
ture down where it will do the most
good. _
Mr. Hart—The earth cools off at
night and sucks in the ain that is laden
with moisture, and in the morning as it
warms up, that air expands and much of
it goes out, leaving the moisture behind.
Cultivation just helps to retain that mois-
ture that is brought in the night before.
It also prevents the escape of moisture
that is brought up by capillary action.

N0. 3.—W.ill you kindly tell me of
Bermuda Onions? Can they be success-
fully and proﬁtably grown in the latitude
of Gainesville, Fla?
Mr. ( )—At McIntosh the farm-
ers have been growing onions for ship-
ment on a small scale and have been
very successful. They are pretty fair
onions, too.

Mr. Taylor—You cannot grow them
on very dry land. They must be planted
on moist land, but not too moist. It is
one of the surest crops we can grow.
They stand both cold and reasonably dry
weather pretty well, and the man who
puts them on the right kind of land is
sure to make something of a crop.
Mr. Painter—A crop of Bermuda on-
ions grown so as to reach the early mar-
ket is sure to be proﬁtable. Late onions
will seldom sell for over $1.00 per bushel.
They require a rich and moist soil, or
the soil made rich with fertilizer. I
grew seven successive crops and all were
proﬁtable except one, when the seed
turned out to be White Californias in-
stead of 'White Bermudas. The former
made a large crop, but would not carry
to market. By raising onions on irri-
gated land they can be pushed during
growing season and when they are large

enough, withhold the water and let them
ripen and dry up. Two weeks can be
gained in this way and two weeks often
means a difference of $1.00 to $1.50 per
crate. The market does not want a
large onion. The best size is three inches
in diameter.

No. 4—Is it desirable to prune out
watersprouts from orange trees?
Mir. Hart—If the sprout is where I
can let it grow, I always save it. Their
tops can be swung usually to where
there is room for them. I do not waste
any growth that I can put to use, and
you can put almost any watersprout to
use. It is very rare indeed that I take
one out. I consider that more groves
were killed after the freeze of 1894 and'
1895 by cutting off the sprouts, than in
> any other way. It takes away the leaf
surface the tree should have, and I think
every inch of leaf surface adds to the
strength and bearing capacity.
Mr, ( )—Do they not take a great
deal of strength from the tree?
Mr. Hart—No. sir; they bear the
second year, and properly trained, soon
become as proﬁtable as any part of the
tree. The fruit bends them down and
the next growth starts from the bend.
The limb thickens up, the rest of the tree
grows out around it and it becomes a
valuable part of a symmetrical tree.
Mr. ( )—Do I understand that
you would let nature do its own pruning
unless you found that the limbs were
bending and rubbing against each other?


Mr. Hart—Yes, sir: that is pretty
nearly right.
Mr. ( )——After the freeze of

1894, there were a lot of sour sprouts
came up, sometimes as many as eight or
ten. In most instances I have left all
and they have made large limbs. Instead
of having a large single trunk, I have a
number of large limbs. The trees are
about 25 feet from each other and in
some cases they almost overlap, but
there is a dense growth in the center. I
have been in doubt as to whether it
would not have been better to thin it out
and get more fruit in the interior of the
tree, but I have ‘been afraid to do it. I
understood that you, Mr. Hart, did not
do it, but I am a little in doubt as to
whether I am losing fruit by not thin-_
ning them out, or not.
Mr. Hart—VVlhen the sour sprouts
came up, I budded two or three of them
and as the buds took, instead of cutting
them away, I cut them partly off above
the buds and laid them down. I would
cut them partly off and then press my
foot against them above the cut so that
there would be a long break or split. In
that way I retained the leaf surface of
the sour wood in connection Wilth the
root until the sweet buds became larger
and could take care of the strength of
the roots. After a year or two the sweet
buds have gotten good tops, those limbs
that I had laid down had served their
purpose and I took them away. Do not
cut them entirely away and destroy the
leaf surface until the sweet stock is large
enough to take care of the root system.
Mr. Seymour—After the freeze, I had
to saw off my trees level with the ground'
and when the sprouts came up budded
from four to eight, according to the size
of the trunk. I have in my grove from
one to seven or eight sprouts on the trees.
As to the fruit of a single stock bearing
as much as one with four stocks, I have

proved that not to be so. I have one
tree with one stock and some with four,
and I get a great many more off the four
than off the one. As Brother Hart says,
I do not pull all the extra sprouts off.
I think the tree needs the leaf surface,
and I leave them on in big bunches
and after awhile I pull them off I think
my grove is as ﬁne a bearing grove as
any in my neighborhood.
Mr. ( )—\Vhere you have a clus—
ter of limbs growing up from the ground,
do you prune or not?
Mr. Seymour—I let nature do its own
pruning. Unless a limb gets across
another one and“ rubs it, I never cut it
out. I have a neighbor who is all the
time cutting his trees and he never gets
more than half a crop any time. I think
in pruning too much, you stop the bear-
ing qualities of your tree.


No. 5.-—Is Frenching of the citrus
family a disease in itself or simplya
symptom of a derangement? How can
it be treated?
Mr. Painter Frenching comes from
malnutrition. This may be from differ—
ent causes, therefore the treatment that
will cure in one case will not necessarily
cure in others. The most prevailing
cause is 'humic acid in the soil. Apply a
liberal application of airslacked or hy-
drated lime to the tree or on the side of
the tree affected and harrow or hce it in.
Fertilize with a few pounds of nitrate
of soda in addition to the regular appli—
cation of fertilizer. In some cases three
or four pounds of copperas applied to
the diseased tree has apparently cured or
helped the tree.

.No. 6—1 especially would like to know
why it is set down so positively that we
cannot grow apple trees in Florida. With
me several varieties are growing quite
as well as they do in my New York
orchard. I rely on heavy mulching f0r
all trees, but especially for apples, plums,
peaches, etc. I slope my mulch inwar-l
so as to catch and retain the rains. This
mulch [is made of any coarse material
and covered with a layer of sand. If
carefully made it equalizes the temper—
ature around' the roots. The hottest days
do not affect the ﬁne roots seriously. I
am having excellent success so far with
King David (one of Stark’s new apples),
Stayman’s \Vinesap, and a few more of
the fruits set down as hardly belonging
in Florida. Of course my test has not
yet reached the fruiting stage. I am suc-
ceeding so far admirably well with Lam-
bert and Bing cherries. I am planting
f-reely of Mir. Munson’s hybrid grapes,
and they promise exceedingly well.
Among my peaches I have several from
Stark Bros, in Missouri, that are doing
quite as well as our Florida sorts. One
of the best of these is W'right. The
Early \Vheeler, (ﬁrst received from Mr.
Munson), is doing well. I think, how-
ever, that this variety has some of the
Chinese blood in it.
\V'hat I miss in Florida is humus. and
this I put forth every effort to create.
Fortunately n'ature offers us aboundiug
material for this purpose. I do not allow
a“ pound of humus material to be burned.
In such material I grew an 18 pound
sweet potato this last year. Florida is
full of problems, and is to me, immensely
attractive.
er. Painter—It has been set down
that apples cannot be grown in Florida.

after repeated experiments by some of
our best horticultunists. Many of the
varieties growing in the north haw been
trier? with varying success. The ﬁrst
year the trees are planted they apparently
do well; the second year they may do
fairly well and bear a fruit or two, but
the third year generally winds them up.
The apple evidently was not intende-..l for
this latitude, consequently will not thrive.
It may be that some day by hybridizing
carried out on the same line that Prof.
Weber is following with the citrus, we
may get an ZIJPPIC that will do fairly well
in Florida. I believe that the Secretary
01' the Horticultural Society will be able
to eat all of your next season's crop of
apples grown in Florida, and would not
object to trying.
