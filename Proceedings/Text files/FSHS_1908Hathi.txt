PROCEEDINGS OF THE Twenty-First Annual Meeting OF THE Florida State Horticultural Society The Florida State Horticultural Society celebrated its twenty-ﬁrst an-
nual meeting in the beautiful and his-
toric city of Gainesville. It can be said of this meeting that it opened with the largest attendance of any meeting in the history of the Society. There have been other meetings when the total number in attendance was larger,
but at no time was the hall so ﬁlled with horticulturists from all over the state, and with townspeople, as greeted the fall of the President’s gavel at the opening session of this meeting. The attendance through the entire session was large and the whole time allotted for the program was taken up. None of the sessions were cut out or cur-
tailed, but the full time put in.
The members enjoyed the afternoon session at the State University and Experimental Grounds. They spent the time very proﬁtably in going over the ﬁeld and seeing what was being done and at the same time seeing what was needed to carry on the State work.
Many a member went home deter-
mined to appeal to his member of the Legislature to give the Experiment Station more consideration and a larger appropriation for its work, at the next meeting of the Legislature.
One address we are not able to give in our report was the lecture by Prof.
H, Harold Hume on “Adorning the Home Place," which was given com-
plimentary to the people of Gainesville.
This was a stereopticon lecture illus-
trating the good and bad effects of different planting of shrubs and trees.
The printing of the address without the illustrations would take away half of its value. As we are unable to print these this year, the members who did not attend will have to lose the pleas-
ure and proﬁt of Prof. Hume’s lecture.
\Vhen the time for the next place of meeting was brought up, Daytona, De-
Land, Orlando and Jacksonville were in the race. On the ﬁrst ballot it was left to DeLand and Daytona. and the latter won out by a few votes, con-
sequently the next annual meeting will be held at one of the prettiest towns

Address of Welcome.
By Col. Horatio Davis.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gmtlcmcn:
As mayor of this city, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Gainesville,
and in the words of Shakespeare’s charac-
ter, “I say to thee and to thy company,
I bid a hearty welcome.” Horticulture,
as the dictionaries say, is that department of agriculture which relates to the culti-
vation of ﬂowers, fruits and vegetables,
and where can such cultivation be more important than in a state with twelve hundred miles of sea coast, over seven hundred miles long, and every acre of land within that state tempered by sea breezes?
The Bible tells us that one of the ﬁrst commands given by God after He had created the earth, was for it to bring forth fruit, every tree after its own kind.
As soon as He had created man, He said to him, “I give you the fruit from these trees for your food.”
posed that when the trees came forth from the hand of God, it and its fruit were perfect, but as time passed, neglect worked its inevitable result, and the tree with its fruit deteriorated. As I under-
stand it, one of the endeavors of this so-
ciety is to learn how to bring back to that tree and its fruit, its pristine per-
fection.
It has been said that Florida has eight It is to be sup-.
months summer and four months warm weather. we who live in Florida know that this is not so. We know that we have four months summer and eight months pleasant weather, and there are but few days in which the horticulturist or agriculturist cannot work. “'here else in the world have you such a ﬁeld for your labor? Where else are such flow-
ers, fruits and vegetables awaiting scien-
tiﬁc research facing him as in Florida?
It is a public benefactor who causes two blades of grass to grow where one grew before. Is he not a public benefactor who tells us how to make our fruit and vegetables perfect, and how to adorn our homes with beautiful ﬂowers, and that.
I understand. is one of the objects of your association, and here, during thiﬁ
meeting, we will be told by a number of gentlemen how that object is to be ac-
complished.
\Vith such objects in view by your society. is it surprising that there is 110
city that is not proud to entertain you and feel honored by your presence?
It is customary on occasions of this kind for the speaker to present to the guests. the key of the city, but as Gaines-
ville is hospitable, she keeps no keys. Our doors are wide open. and I say to you a5
mayor of the city, “\Valk in and take p05-
session.”

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 21
THE RELATION OF THE UNIVERSITY TO THE HORTICUL-
TURAL SOCIETY.
Dr. Andrew Sledd.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlmncn:
I wish respectfully to endorse and sec—
ond the words of welcome which the Mayor has extended to your body, in behalf of your State University. We are very glad indeed to have you in our city, and esteem it a privilege and honor,
and trust you will feel that whatever we have out there; whatever of buildings,
or faculty, or service, is entirely at your disposal. \Ve hope to have the privi-
lege of having you out an afternoon and evening. On that occasion we wish you to take possession of the buildings and grounds, and we would like for you to go to and fro and see what is there so that you may know what we are trying to do in the cause of education.
I shall probably not be able to enjoy the Association on that occasion, by rea~
son of the fact that I have had an en-
gagement out of the city for some months,
but Prof. Rolfs will show you every cour-
tesy and more than take my place, I am sure.
Now, like the Irishman who wanted to make a few remarks before he said any-
thing, I address myself directly to the matter of The Relation of the University to the Horticultural Society. I will not presume in the preSence of these experts who are versed in technical knowledge,
to enter into any arguments or discus-
sions of a technical nature. I know very little about technical horticulture; but I address myself to you as citizens of the State, feeling that you are citizens before you are horticulturists. I feel that you are horticulturists as an incident, but that your citizenship is your chief work and one of the highest interests in your life.
Therefore, I think I can speak to you as citizens ﬁrst and then horticulturists.
Agricultural interests, including in them horticultural interests, are the great-
est single interests in the nation. Re-
cently I have been looking over some of our agricultural statistics, and ﬁnd that the amount of money that we get out of the ground through crops and fruits will amount to the amazing sum of over $6,-
5oo.ooo,ooo.oo; that our corn crop for one year would more than pay the na-
tional debt, and would sustain the na-
tional government for two years or more,
paying all of its expenses. The vast ma-
jority of our people are directly or indi-
rectly dependent upon agricultural inter-
ests. Not counting the non-productive elements of the population, such as chil-
dren under ten years of age and matrons in the home, there are 30,000,000 of peo-
ple in the United States engaged in gain-
ful occupations. Of that number, nearly forty per cent. are engaged in horticul-
tural and agricultural pursuits. This does not include their dependents. In our own state, forty-four per cent. of our working population is engaged in agricul-
tural pursuits; by far the largest propor-
tion engaged in any one line or calling in the state.
Gigantic as are the interests involved,


## p. 22 (#564) #############################################

22 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
enormous as are the numbers engaged in those interests, but little attention has been paid to reducing these interests to a scientiﬁc basis, or equipping those en-
gaged in this occupation for perfection in their work.
You will ﬁnd that the ﬁrst agricultural society was started in Philadelphia in
178 5, and had the names of George Wash-
ington, Benjamin Franklin and others as prominent on its lists. The ﬁrst profes-
sorship of agriculture was established at Columbia University at about the same time, in 1795. George \Vashington,
Benjamin Franklin and the others of whom I might speak took an active inter-
est in scientiﬁc learning in this line. The present interest, however, can be dated from about the time of the Civil War.
The passage of the Land Grant Act in ’62,
may be said to institute the ﬁrst concrete movement which still bears fruit for those people engaged in this tremendous and important work. It seems surprising that school men should have so long neg-
lected the practical application of the principles of education in this ﬁeld and that this mass of our population should not have had the beneﬁt of scientiﬁc study and research. The schools did, however,
under the attractions of the Rennaissance,
devote the main part of their time to the study of the classics, especially Latin, and to the development of a type of educa-
tion which is known even today as “cul-
tural”—a part of which is a certain dis-
regard, amounting almost to contempt,
for the practical. For a long time there has been, and is today in many commun-
ities a feeling that it is unworthy to spend one’s time in the study of practi-
cal things, and a corresponding respect for the man who is educated and trained along the lines of so-called “culture, don't you know.” This movement has not yet expended itself, and there are more pu-
pils in the schools of the United States today studying Latin than any other one subject, with the possible exception of al-
gebra. Fifty per cent. of the pupils of the United States still study Latin, and Latin isrequired in nearly all college en-
trance examinations and in most curricula of the colleges throughout the Union. 1
cannot quite appreciate the necessity for a superﬁcial knowledge of Latin, when a man’s life work is to be the growing of tobacco or corn or cotton; and it seems to me it would be far more beneﬁcial to the individual and to society at large it such a student would spend the time which he devotes to “culture” in the scientiﬁc study of the growing and curing of to-
bacco, or corn, or cotton; the prevention of diseases and the cure for same, and the wonders of germination and growth and maturity.
My education has been a classical one,
if you will pardon a personal allusion,
so that it represents a mighty revolution for me to say that in my judgment our educational ideas are fundamentally wrong, and whereas the majority devote themselves to the study of the classics and the small minority to the agricultural studies. the majority should devote themselves to a practical education, leav-
ing to the minority the dilettante pur-
suits of the so-called “culture.”
Since I862. there has grown up a num-
ber of institutions based upon that act of Mr. Morrill whose duty it is to instruct the mass of people in the practical affairs of life. These institutions now number
50. one of which is your own State Uni-
versity. There are ﬁfty institutions aet-
ing under the Morrill Act, the Land Grant Act. and other Acts supplementary thereto. Of the students attending these colleges, a large per cent. is women, and

there are altogether 44,000 men, a little over 10,000 being engaged in non-tech-
nical, non-agricultural work. There is a very large proportion, about 25
per cent. who are not engaged in the strict lines of work for which these institutions were established.
5,500 are engaged in some other course,
now and then taking a course in animal husbandry or some such branch. 6,000
are in the preparatory department, 21,000
only are engaged in the practical agri-
cultural and mechanical pursuits for which the institutions are intended. Now,
let us go a little further into the matter and take this 21,000 engaged in the prac-
tical agricultural and mechanical pursuits.
Out of this number we ﬁnd less than 3,000
engaged in the special work of agri-
culture and horticulture at this time, after forty years of effort in that direction. I mention this to show the persistent tenac-
ity of the old academic ideas, the per-
sistence of the notion that the only edu-
cation worth having involved the study of literature, especially the study of the classics. It is a very hard matter to con-
vince the school men in the ﬁrst place and the population at large, after the school men have been convinced, of the advis-
ability of a change in any educational sys-
tem,
Now, as I said, the bulk of the popula-
tion is engaged in agricultural and hor-
ticultural pursuits. It seems to me that the educational system should be laid out upon those lines in which the bulk of the population is interested. Less than four per cent. are engaged in professional pur-
suits, and yet our school system in the State of Florida, with the exception of the State University, is designed with reference to the four per cent, with al-
most total disregard of the remaining Population. In other words, in none of the schools of the State, except the State University, will you ﬁnd any instruction in horticultural and agricultural pursuits.
I wish to bring it to your attention that igis high time some action is taken with reference to changing this situation. The State University, your University, is the only institution offering instruction along these lines, but there should be many oth-
ers. The main part of our current ex-
penses is provided by the Federal Gov-
ernment, and provided with reference to the practical instruction of the young men of the State, the vast forty-four per cent. of the young men of the State, who will be interested in agri-
cultural pursuits.
Our ideal out here is to serve the peo-
ple according to the people’s needs; and these needs are not, as we understand it,
to be found mainly in the realm of cul-
ture, but the people’s needs begin with the need to eat. We begin with this funda-
mental need, and go up, up with the needs of the people, up and up to the needs of the intellect and into the needs of the spirit manifested in right living. But ﬁrst and foremost is the all-dominant need, the need to eat. I hold that it is a proper function of the schools to raise the stand-
ard of living; and to do this, it is neces-
sary to improve the workman. Your in-
stitution is organized on that basis. The farmer must be equipped with knowledge of the whys and wherefores, he must know the principles of causes and effects and have a certain amount of scientiﬁc knowledge with which to combat the evils which are the enemies to successful agri-
culture or horticulture. Of the 15 of this faculty, II are engaged under this general head: to equip the worker with the proper knowledge. I include the Professor of Physics, the Professor of Botany. and except only the Professors

of Modern Languages, History, Philos-
ophy, and Ancient Languages. We offer four year courses in Horticulture, Agri-
culture, Mechanical, Civil and Electrical Engineering in addition to four year courses in General Science and four year course in Literature, Philosophy, and Pedagogy, which do not belong under this head. \Ve also offer a two year course in Agriculture, and a two year course in the Mechanical Arts.
Under the Buckman Bill we are re quired to maintain certain entrance re-
quirements which may be modiﬁed by the Board of Control. They have been so modiﬁed, and we now admit students who have completed the eleventh grade of the public schools. We accept actual farmer boys in the department of Agri-
culture without their coming up to those requirements. The young farmer boys throughout the State who really want to learn the scientiﬁc elements of agricul-
ture and horticulture and the elements of mechanical arts have an open door and a hearty welcome into the institution.
We hold, with the possible exception of a few of our men who are still joined to their idols of “culture,” that our ﬁrst duty is to the largest body of our citizens,
'and the last duty to the smallest body,
and we have done all that we can to ac—
complish that result. .
Now I want to tell you some of the results. I said it was a hard matter to convince the people after you convince school men. W e are convinced that the methods of education which we represent are the proper methods; we are howling dervishes in our conviction. You can hear us howl. If you listen you can hear Prof, Rolfs and myself howl clear down on the Gulf Coast and on the East Coast and down in the Everglades. We are convinced. The next proposition is to convince the people that this proposi-
tion is true and that we are prepared to serve them. Let me give you a few
*facts and ﬁgures. Before I give you these, let me illustrate from the situation in the State of Missouri. There are 555
high schools in that State which are re-
quired to give instruction in agriculture.
In these schools, how many do you think were taking Latin and how many do you think were taking the course in agricul-
ture? Out of the students in 555 high schools which were required by the law to have a course in agriculture, 28,000
students, who had the opportunity brought to them in the schools to take agriculture and at the same time the op-
portunity to take Latin, 14,000 were tak-
ing Latin and 1,180 taking agriculture!
Now, in our own State Institution, we have an enrollment under the Agricul-
tural and Mechanical College Acts, of college students amounting to ﬁfty-two.
That does not count two or three grad-
uate students or some 25 or 26 students who are taking the literary course. The total enrollment for the year just close-l has been IO3—very small, but still the largest college enrollment in the State.
\Ne include in this 31 preparatory and some graduate students, but of those tak-
ing the regular Agricultural and Mechan-
ical College courses, there were 52.
Now, gentlemen, the doors are open for a scientiﬁc education along the lines in which you are most interested. Prof.
Rolfs and myself are going up and down the State trying to convince the people that what they want and need is educa-
tion along the practical lines of agricul-
ture and horticulture. There is no tui-
tion fee, no laboratory fee; board, fuel and lights at $15.00 per month; and yet we have under the agriculture college professors, 52 students in agriculture and

the kindred subjects. This state of af-
fairs ought not to be.
It seems to me there are three reasons for this condition. In the ﬁrst place, the farmers of the State do not realize the necessity for a technical education. They do not realize that agriculture is a science and that horticulture is a science. They think if their grandfather plowed with '1
rope line over a lop-eared mule they should not show disrespect to his mem-
ory by endeavoring to improve on his methods. His antiquated methods were agriculture, and agriculture is just simply agriculture. Another difﬁculty is that the rural population does not realize the possibility of technical education in those lines. It is a new idea. Agriculture used to be regarded as a business which did not need much, if any, apprenticeship.
It was simply a matter of “being brung up to it.” The average farmer or fruit-
grower thought the “book—farmer” a fool,
——and perhaps they were sometimes right.
There is a general prejudice against the
“book treatment” of the subject. You have undoubtedly observed this in your own community. The average farmer will say, “Oh, he is just a book farmer and can’t teach me nothing.” Of course,
“the book farmer” in the early stages of his career made mistakes, and is still mak-
ing them, perhaps; but, as a whole, the fair-minded man is willing to concede that he has more than made good. The third difﬁculty that is observed is that there is no movement in the State except this one struggling enterprise looking to this end. There is no high school in the State representing this idea. There is no school in the State teaching these things.
As a consequence, there is no stimulus towards the University, and it is really remarkable that we get more than ﬁve or six to come up here to study.
This Society, in my judgment, might be extremely effective in facilitating a general movement in the State for carry-
ing horticultural and agricultural educa-
tion down into the graded schools. I do not know anything more pitiful than to see a little country boy going up to read
“Gallia est divisa in partes tres,” or some-
thing like that, and learning nothing and caring nothing about the wonderful branch of industry which he is to make the work of his future life, knowing noth-
ing and caring nothing about the planting and germinating and growth of a grain of corn or wheat,—devoting a quarter of his precious time to a study which will not do him the remotest good which had far better be spent in studying the science of plant and vegetable life. Now, he could at least learn that it is a science and that it is to his interest and is his bus-
iness to study that science; and if he be-
gins the study he will follow it up through the University,
Now, as I have before said, the run-
ning expenses of the University are met mainly through the Federal Government.
In nearly sixty per cent. of the states in the Union, the State is appropriating more for its agricultural and mechanical colleges than the Federal Government.
In some states they have practically as-
sumed the entire support of these institu-
tions. In our own State, the State gives about one-third of the current income.
The institution could not be run three months on the State appropriation for current expenses. We are anxious to serve the farmer boy. We are convinced,
and we want to convince the people and we trust that this meeting of the Horti-
cultural Society may contribute to that end. We believe that sooner or later we will succeed; we know we must succeed,
because practical training is the only

training for a practical man living a prac-
tical life in a practical age. I do not mean to depreciate true culture, but what we need ﬁrst in this and every other State,
is an education which gets right down to the practical phases of everyday life; and the gentlemen of this distinguished So-
ciety can be of the utmost service in car-
rying forward that idea. We need more practical education introduced into our common schools, into our high schools;
and this University, your University,
gentlemen, needs and should receive the co-operation and liberal support of the State, in its campaign for the practical education of the masses of the people,
and in its earnest efforts to serve all the people of our common State according to their needs.
RESPONSE.

Dr. W. C. Richardson, Tampa. '
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I certainly esteem it a privilege and an honor to address an audience in this great educational centre of the state. I am afraid, however, that what may be a source of pride to me may be an inﬂic-
tion to you before we get through with it. If it is in the nature of an inﬂiction,
no one will be to blame but your Presi-
dent. When I got his notiﬁcation that I was expected to respond to these ad-
dresses, I was on the eve of going to my groves. I returned home last Friday morning, but with my usual habit of pro-
crastination, had put of? writing my ad-
dress. When I got home Friday morn-
ing, the good Lord had seen ﬁt to send a little grandchild to my daughter's home and that upset me, naturally. So, in the whirl of events, I did not have any time to prepare my address. Then I thought the best thing to do was to look over the records of the proceedings of the last few years and see what had been said and patch up something extemporaneous from that. \Vell, when I tell you what I found, you will know what I was up against there. We had, at the last meet-
ing, an address from our respected friend,
Dr. Kerr. The meeting before that we had an address from our beloved friend,
Mr. Taber, and the meeting before that we had an address from our revered and lamented Mr. McCarty. No one can compete in eloquence, style, ﬂuency and interest with the addresses of these men.
But I am here; it is up to me, and I am somewhat in the position of the hero in one of Bret Hart’s little poems. He was a preacher and a miner, and the bur-
den of the refrain was “He always did his level best," and that is what I am here to do.
I want to say that I am particularly proud to come here to that which is es-
sentially ours; to our University and our faculty. I am particularly delighted to have heard the head of that University speak as he has done. I have thought for years, in my conceit, that I was one of a few men who thought and talked that the only kind of an education that

was worth having, is an education along practical lines, but to hear it from the President of a University is a surprise and a pleasure.
I realize, as he realizes, that a techni-
cal education along technical lines is far better, far more useful and far more ben-
eﬁcial in every way than a so-called clas-
sical education. I think it was Oliver W'endell Holmes who wrote:
“There is many a one, though highly skilled in hic, hac, hoe,
In arts and knowledge still a block."
When my children had grown up and were in school, they laughed at this quo-
tation, saying that my Latin pronuncia-
tion was old style and wrong and that it should be heck, hyke. hoke. I said,
“Let it go at that even, and it will still be applicable as
‘There is many a one though highly skilled in heek, hyke, hoke,
In arts and knowledge still a BLoxEl’ "
I am delighted to know that we have this kind of an institution. I am delighted to know that we have this kind of men at its head. As has been said. “It is ours,” and I am glad that we have come to our own at last.
Now, Mr. Mayor, I want to thank you for your courteous invitation to your hos-
pitalities, for your courteous welcome to what you have here. and they are no small things. \Ve appreciate this city with its paved streets, with its great Uni-
versity, with its great men, and we es-
teem it a privilege to be here. We are glad, and we realize that you understand that Horticulture is more and higher than a human institution. \Ve may come up here with hard hands and hard heads,
perhaps, as sons of toil, but nevertheless we are horticulturists, and horticulturists are men who have something to be proud of. The calling of horticulture is, as you have intimated, of Divine origin. The
ﬁrst horticulturist was the Creator Him-
self. He prepared the garden, put fruits and ﬂowers into it, and ﬁnally put man into it. Man, in his usual manner, dis-
tinguished himself by getting into trouble the ﬁrst thing, and then blamed it onto the woman. Unfortunately for us, the Crea-
tor did the same thing that we are doing.
He put a tree of evil in there, and that caused the trouble.
There was another reference made by your Honor, about anyone being a bene-
factor who caused two blades of grass to grow where one grew before. I want to say that we are, on that proposition, mul-
tiple benefactors. There isn’t one of us who has not beat that all to pieces. If you don't believe it, try to dig up a blade of Bermuda grass and see what follows.
These gentlemen who have preceded me have not taken up all the time allotted to them, and unlike the omnipresent poli-
tician, I have been “elected,'’ for the evening at least, consequently I don’t have to quit.
Isn’t it a wonderful thing that the Bi-
ble speaks so often of fruits and ﬂowers?
It refers to the rose, the lily, the pome-
granate, the olive and the ﬁg, but never a word about the grosser productions such as potatoes, carrots, cabbage, etc.
‘The most wonderful thing that has ever happened, the greatest event that was ever enacted in the world’s history, took place in an olive grove; I mean that won.
derful scene that was enacted in the gar-
den of Gethsamene. ~ I was in that gar.
den about two years ago, therefore it may not be amiss for me to say a word in regard to it. _I can understand why the peopleof Palestine take to horticul-
ture instead of agriculture. They \vOuId not enjoy plowing with a lop-cared mule,

L'S FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
01' plowing at all for that matter. And,
by the way, they have no lop-cared mules in Palestine, and no plows, but you see them scratching along with a forked stick drawn by a cow, or occasionally an un—
dersized donkey; that is the nearest ap‘
proach to a lopeared mule in Palestine.
It is the ﬁnest country for good or-
anges in the world. The JaFfa orange is the best orange I have ever seen. It has been my privilege to eat those oranges right from the trees, but delicious as they are, give me Florida every time. I would not give a quarter section of Florida sand for a township in Palestine. \Vhen I stood in the hill country of Judea looking out 'over the valley of the Jordan and saw the mountains of Moab and Nebo’s lonely peak in all its glory, the idea oc-
curred to me that the Lord was certainly good to Moses to let him die before he got into the land of Palestine. Perhaps it is not today what it was in the day of Moses. Today, it is a land of dirt,
ﬁlth, ignorance and Turkish misrule, and nothing to commend it. Give me Florida every time.
There is one other thing I want 'to bring before you. I think we too fre-
quently neglect to live up to our oppor-
tunities and to make the most of our immediate surroundings. \Ne come up here to these meetings, resolving to do and be done. \Ve come together, hop-
ing to do ourselves and our occupation good, and we talk beautifully and make plans, and resolute—and then we go home and in a few weeks fall back into our lethargic, indiﬁ'erent, indolent meth—
ods, and our good resolutions are all for-
gotten. Now, if we could carry some of our enthusiasm home with us, if we would carry some of our resolutions home and act upon them, it would be better for us, it would be better for the business in which we are engaged, it would be bet-
ter for the institution of which you, Mr.
President, have spoken. Let us try to do it; let us realize that here in Florida we have opportunities such as are found in few countries of the world, certainly in very few states of the Union. Let us work with the determination to make the most of our opportunities. Let us do the best we can to further the interests of our Society and our great educational institution.
I remember reading some time ago of a ship in the days of sailing vessels. The ship had met with contrary weather, and had been partly dismantled, driven from its course, and ﬁnally the water had given out. At last, when the crew was about to perish from thirst, a vessel was seen approaching. The captain of the dam—
aged ship called through the trumpet,
“Give us water,” and the answer came back, “Drop your buckets where you are!" They thought it a strange answer and repeated again, “Water! We per-
ish! Give us water.” Again the answer came back, “Drop your buckets where you are!" The third time they begged for water, and the third time the answer came back, “Drop your buckets where you are!” They ﬁnally thought there must be some reason for such an answer and dropped their buckets which came up ﬁlled and brimming with fresh, sweet water. They had been driven into the hundred-mile—wide mouth of the Amazon and did not know that they were sur-
rounded with fresh water.
Now, when we are perishing with a

diversity of trials, when we are disman-
tled by freezes, droughts, white ﬂies, po-
litical campaigns, etc., we should drop our buckets where we are, and bring them up ﬁlled with the reviving water of re-
newed courage, prosperity and success.
In conclusion, let me say that
“This world is full of beauty like other worlds,
above;
And if we do but our duty, it will be full of love."

President’s Annual Address.
By Prof. P. H. Rolfs.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
\Ve are here to hold our twenty-ﬁrst annual meeting. The hand of fate has guided us during these twenty years into the most distant portions of the state;
from Pensacola on the west, to St. Au-
gustine on the east and Miami on the south. It is quite probable that when Key West shall be made the most south-
ern railway station in Florida we will stretch out a hand of welcome to our lusty young neighbor, the Cuban Horti-
cultural Society.
During our devious wanderings and in the course of these two decades, our membership has gradually increased.
Even the terrible freezes could not chill the ardor for information. The meet-
ing of 1895, following the most disas-
trous catastrophe the state has known,
was characterized by the most earnest attention to the program. While the at-
tendance was smaller than at some of the previous ones, the membership was suf-
ﬁcient to enable us to print the annual proceedings.
Of the members who took part in the organization at Ocala, only four of the original eighteen remain to us. Our worthy and distinguished ex-president was then a lusty youngster. You would not know that he is a year older today,
if it were not for a slight intimation of gray, and his dignity when in the execu-
tive chair.
CHAN GES IN VARIETIES:
Twenty years ago the list of varieties of oranges was probably as long as the list of today. Many that were at that time thought to be the best have since been discarded, and six varieties not then recognized are ranked as among the best today. The list of those that have orig-
inated in Florida is increasing, and it is quite probable that in the course of time the leading varieties will be those that have originated in our state.
In our ﬁrst catalog of Florida fruits only one variety of grapefruit was recog-
nized. There are now at least a score,
nine of which are catalogued by this So-
ciety. The old many-seeded, ﬁrst-known grapefruit is rapidly being displaced by newer and less seedy varieties.
The progressive changes in the citrus fruits are however no greater than in the deciduous fruits.
In the case of vegetables we have a much more radical change. The old va-
rieties have been almost entirely replaced.
In fact, vegetables were grown only to a limited extent twenty years ago. Even celery was spoken of as an experiment as late as the report of our ﬁfth meet-
ing.
CHANGES IN RAILROADING.
At the time of the founding of this Society (1888) a large part of the state was horticulturally unknown. Such rail-
roads as occurred in the state were poorly

equipped, and many were disjointed frag-
ments beginning in a hammock and end—
ing somewhere in the piney woods. How horticulturists ever succeeded in making a living under those conditions of trans-
portation is impossible for us of a later day to understand. The following inci-
dent, which occurred in the spring of
1892, illustrates the indifferent way in which business was done on some of the plug lines then in operation. Some co-
operative experiments were being car-
ried on at Grand Island, and it was de-
sirable for me to make my way from Eus-
tis to a point on the Sanford 81 St. P. R.
R. By driving to Tavares one would be able to take the T. & G. then popularly known as the “Tag.” which left at about sunrise. On the morning in question,
the train, probably the only one on the road, was composed of a few box carsv and a coach for accommodating passen-
gers. The train started about a half hour late, but still early enough to prevent the passengers from obtaining breakfast.
After running for an hour or an hour and a half the train stopped suddenly in the woods. The whole crew, from ﬁre-
man to conductor, abandoned the train and started directly for a nearby water-
melon ﬁeld. We passengers discussed among ourselves whether to follow or to remain. To our surprise, the train men went leisurely about to ﬁnd the choicest melons, carried them to a fence, sat down and ate until satisﬁed, and then each car-
ried back to the train one or two melons.
\Vell, to cut the story short, we got to Clermont just in time to see the train we wished to take pull out from the other station. One train a day. Passengers and perishable fruit left at a junction point without any reasonable cause.
VV'hile we do not live under ideal condi-
tions at present, the passenger and freight trafﬁc is fairly good compared with a decade and a half ago.
THE PRACTICAL HORTICULTURIST AN AR-
TIST.
The progress made in the production of ﬁne fruit is fully as great, or possibly greater, than that in transportation. We all recognize the fact, however, that we still have much to learn. If it were not for the strong desire to improve on our present condition we would not be as-
sembled here.
The best horticulturists of today in Florida are artists in their special lines.
It takes as much careful thought, and as much application of this thought, to produce an ideal tomato, or an ideal or—
ange or grapefruit, as it does to produce a ﬁne picture on canvas, or to build an engine. As there are only a few master hands that can command a talent sufﬁ-
cient to produce a really ﬁrst-class paint-
ing, so there are only a few who produce a really superior horticultural product;
and still fewer who have the commer-
cial instinct sufﬁciently developed to get the highest price for their product.
The pioneer fruit and vegetable grower lives under conditions that enable him to extract a mere existence in exchange for his toil and thought. It is quite natural that he should become more or less dis-
satisﬁed with his lot in life. His sur—
roundings cause him to lose interest in his work and home; he either sinks into a careless and indifferent existence, or drifts to a populous center where he be-
comes a mere atom in human existence,
and tosses about from one engagement to another.
MIGRATION 'ro BUSINESS CENTERS.
Under our old routine rule-of-thumb method of horticulture, the farmer and his children were mere machines, which

did a certain amount of work at the ex-
pense of a certain amount of energy. The thinking-mechanism was scarcely called into action. Under such conditions it is no wonder that our young men and young women sought relief by migrat—
ing to the business centers. The evidence from history is that our foremost states-
men, our foremost men and women in literary pursuits, as well as our foremost business men, were in the majority of cases raised in the country. This migra-
tion to the business centers still continues.
It is not surprising to those who have studied the matter, and who perceive somewhat clearly the cause. You cannot blame a young woman for hesitating to accept the position of a wife in the coun-
try, when laborious drudgery, from early morning until late at night, is the only prospect in view. You cannot blame the young man for shrinking from a life of six days constant toil, and a Sunday of only half rest. Under such conditions we ﬁnd even the fathers and mothers,
who have spent possibly a half century of constant vigil on the farm, moving to the town or city to retire and spend the rest of their lives in comfort. This move to the city would never have been contemplated if they had been perfectly contented on the farm; or if the farm were the ideal place it ought to be. They move to town because their money will there buy them the comforts that were not obtainable in the country.
MIGRATION TO THE FARM AT PRESENT l M POSSIBLE.
I have called attention to the fact of history that a larger percentage of our leading men and women were raised on farms than was due to the rural popula—
tion. There must therefore be some vir-
tue in the country as such for producing superior intellects, sturdy manhood and womanhood. Let us for a moment look at the extreme negative of this question.
In the tenement district of New York City, which is the most populous center in America, there hangs a diagram show-
ing the number of people to the acre of ground. It is calculated that at the same rate of crowding the world’s population could be placed in the State of Delaware.
An accompanying diagram shows that the average boy and girl in this crowded section is far below the normal size.
These facts are so well known to my hearers that it is useless for me to en-
large upon them. My speech has recalle-l to you the well known fact that we have a constant stream of migration from the country to the town, and n0 counter-cur-
rent to the farm. It speaks volumes for the thrift and strength of those who re-
main that this condition could have gone on for decades. The stream has been all one way—toward the town. It should not be understood that I would raise an argument against migration to the city.
It very often happens that a very poor farmer would have made a ﬁrst-class mer-
chant, lawyer, preacher, or doctor. No two of us are endowed with the same talents and tastes combined in the same manner. \Ve cannot readjust the ele-
ments that make up our talents and intel-
lects, but it is our divinely—appointed duty to seek and ﬁnd the vocation for which we have been best endowed.
BACK TO THE FARM.
Thousands of people, possibly hun-
dreds of thousands, in the United States
ﬁnd out when too late to change, that they have taken up the wrong vocation.
The following is a composite of scores

of pathetic letters that have come to my oﬁice for a reply:
Dear Sir :—I have twelve hundred dol-
lars that I have saved in the last ten years and wish to start in farming or fruit growing, as my health has .been pretty badly broken by hard ofﬁce work.
There are three children in our family who ought to be brought up on a farm.
I want to get away from town so that I can enjoy the companionship of my family.
\Vhere in your state can I invest and make a living from the start?
Yours truly,
Can there be anything more pathetic?
After ten years of hard, unrelenting toil,
with health broken, and disappointed in his highest ambition of providin'r for his family. Ten years of the best of his life spent in following the wrong vocation.
Ready, like the drowning man, to grasp at a straw. he risks his future on the ad-
vice of a man to him unknown and in a distant state. I must confess to you,
ladies and gentlemen, that when that prop-
osition is placed before me to answer, my courage fails. It is too serious a mat-
ter. -
These letters, of which the above is a composite, would not have made so deep an impression on my mind; nor would I have realized the magnitude of the un-
rest in the city population, but for one incident that came to my attention rather accidentally.
Mr. A, D. Shamel, a young friend of mine, was asked to award the prizes in the corn exhibit of the North-west. In an interview with a Chicago newspaper reporter he made mention of the fact that many young men wanted to go back to the farm. In less than ten hours letters began to pour in, and for two days three stenographers were unable to complete the work of replying to the inquiries.
This happened just before the money panic. The burden of all these inquiries was, How to get back to the farm?
I do not contend that all of these men would make a success of farm work. It had been clearly demonstrated to them,
however, that they were misﬁts in the city. They were eagerly seeking for an opportunity to get away from the city,
but the way was securely blocked.
I have drawn out these illustrations at length to show fully the present condi-
tion. (No one can say that he is not in-
terested, for it is our own children who are swelling and will swell the throngs in the over-crowded cities.)
Dr. Sledd, in his address tonight, has shown most clearly that our public schools teach our boys and girls away from the farm and from the grove. Nowhere in our common school system do we ﬁnd anything that will make the boy more efﬁcient on the farm or grove, or the girl more efﬁcient in the house.
AGRICULTURE IN OUR COMMON SCHOOLS.
In discussing the matter of agricul-
tural education in various parts of the state this year, a number of people have told me that they could teach their boy more agriculture and better agriculture on the farm than he could learn in any school. My natural retort is: “But do you do it ?” The candid answer must be,
No. Every mother here is able to teach her girls and boys arithmetic, spelling,
and geography; but she does not do it,
simply because it is much cheaper to hire it done, and at the same time the teach-
ing will be much more efﬁcient. Let me ask again: How many of ussend our.

children to hear the reminiscences and war stories told from grocery boxes, and call that history? The agriculture that is taught in the ﬁeld while driving a mule or “cussing” a laborer bears about the same relation to agriculture that the gro-
cery-box reminiscences do to history. It is not because the subject is too intricate or difﬁcult, but no parent can afford to take the time from his busy day of labor to assume the role of a teacher. and give his son a systematic and rounded course
' in agriculture, any more than he can af-
ford to give his son a course in arithme-
tic or bookkeeping. It takes no longer to teach a dozen students in the same class than one; consequently, it is much cheaper to hire some one to teach a whole class than it is to spend all the time on one student. '
Probably the most potent reason why agriculture is at present so imperfectly developed in that adequate systematic effort for its advancement has not been made. Organized and concerted ef-
forts for its advancement have been practically unknown until very re-
cently: and at present even higher edu-
cation in agriculture cannot be said to be well organized. excepting in those states that are most advanced.
\Ve are entering a period where or-
ganized and systematic effort will be re-
quired to accomplish anything even of moderate proportion. Agriculture, the newest of the sciences, is being rounded.
out and brought into tangible shape.
Our sister states, Georgia and Alabama,
have made provision for district high schools in which are taught agriculture and domestic science.
This is well enough so far as it goes,
. but it stops too high up. The very pu-
pils who need the education most are the ones that are denied the privilege of at-
tending the high schools. It is only a small percentage of our Florida boys and girls that receive any training above the eighth grade. These young people need to get some insight into the plants and an-
imals they see and handle every day.
Books have been, and are being, pub-
lishetl bringing our knowledge into a concrete and teachable form. What if they don’t learn quite so much about the number of planets, or recite fewer deﬁni-
tions from a so-called grammar!
It is not necessary to over-burden the course of study with agriculture in order that -we may have pupils to study it.
There are many thousands of children that do not receive any instruction at all.
who would gladly avail themselves of a chance to learn something that appeals to them as being worth the while.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen. I wish to say that we have left our homes and labors at no small sacriﬁce. \Ve are here not for the mere pleasure we get out of the trip—that is a mere incident to the annual pilgrims: nor are we here that we may accumulate a few more dollars by some sordid method; but we expect to go back better men and better women;
better equipped mentally and morally for the unceasing struggle of life. We ex-
pect to return home with newer and bet—
ter ideas of how to equip and beautify the home; and above all, we expect to be better women and men for having met our distant friends and neighbors on common ground for argument and dis-
cussion.
As your presiding ofﬁcer, I hope that the arguments will be strong and force-
ful, and the discussions vigorous and t0
the point, sparing neither colleague nor adversary: for it is the heated furnace that separates the gold from the dross.

Climatology of the Citrus.
By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson.
1V1 r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject of climate has in all ages and all countries furnished a vast and highly important ﬁeld for the considera-
tion of the horticulturist.
This is especially true of those engaged in citrus fruit culture, for it is a thor-
oughly demonstrated fact that the orange is limited in its proﬁtable commercial production to certain well deﬁned climatic zones.
The study of airs, waters, places and soils may fairly be said to embrace chieﬂy that which is included in the climatology of a locality or territory. On the north-
ern hemisphere the isothermal line of seventy may perhaps be said to be the centre of the orange growing districts,
and the isotherms of sixty and eighty practically, though not exclusively, the limits. The isotherm of seventy is not conﬁned to latitude but extends, in belt—
ing the earth, north and south more than ten degrees and may be said to range be-
tween the twenty-ﬁfth and thirty—ﬁfth parallels. Within this belt are found the orange-growing districts of California,
Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, Spain, Mo-
rocco, Algiers, (Italy, Egypt and Asia Minor.
These are not the only countries in which the orange thrives. as there are many other places in the transitional zones, both north and south, in which it may be found doing fairly well, but they include nearly all the districts that are chief factors in the commercial produc-
tion of this fruit.
The orange does not attain its great-
est perfection or productiveness in tropic heat and can stand little or no freezing cold, hence any place where the tempera-
ture ranges for any length of time below twenty or above one hundred is not a suitable climate for its culture. In South-
ern Europe, Northern Africa, \K'estern Asia and in California the cold is greater than in Florida, but is more evenly dis—
tributed and continuous. In Spain,
Southern France and Northern Italy or-
ange groves are often covered with snow_
In these countries, and in California as well, temperatures ranging as low as seventeen or eighteen degrees Fahrenheit are not infrequent and result in no seri-
ous harm to orange trees. In Florida owing to more warm davs. such extremes would be disastrous. Continuous cold weather hardens the trees. but alternate warm and cold periods (10 great damage.
Under the head of water in relation to orange culture it may be said that it is a necessity in liberal quantities.
As to location, it is a fact worthy of note that the most thriving districts are clustered around large bodies of water.
as the Paciﬁc, Mexican Gulf and Medi-
terranean Coasts.
The most extensive orange districts of Mexico are perhaps an exception to this and are found on the table lands, at ele-
vations of from three to ﬁve thousand

feet; but even here they are rarely more than seventy-ﬁve or one hundred miles from the Gulf or Paciﬁc Coasts.
I saw no large or thrifty looking trees in Mexico, and in fact I have never see'n trees anywhere as large and vigorous looking as we have in Florida.
Oranges grown to maturity in the tropics are frequently wormy and us-
ually sweet, almost to insipidity; hence they are generally harvested when intended for shipping before ripe. The delicious, snappy subacid ﬂavor that makes the orange so attractive requires some cool weather.
Long, continuous heat without cold snaps which we, perhaps wrongly, dread so much, has a tendency to encourage all kinds of predatory insects, described and indescribable and some others be-
sides.
If there is a deﬁciency in precipitation,
mean or relative humidity, to get the best results it must be made up by irri-
gation. In those places, as Florida and Mexico, where there is a summer rainy season, the ripening of the fruit is some-
what accelerated and it reaches maturity shortly after the close of the wet season.
On the other hand, a dry summer and rainy season in the winter, as in Cali-
fornia, has a tendency to retard the time of ripening.
As to soil, it may be said that a littoral alluvium rich in sand is the best. The writer’s observations lead him to say that he has seldom seen a proﬁtable orange-
growing district in which there was not a rich supply of sand in the soil,
There have been so many scares re-
cently that it may be worth while to say a few words as to change of climate,
about which of late years we have been talking so much. but perhaps no more than people have feared and discussed for the past ﬁve or six thousand years.
There is a probability susceptible of proof that within the period of recorded history there has been absolutely no change of climate, with the exception of slight local changes due to destruction or planting of forests, cultivation of crops, irrigation, etc.
In the marvelously storied land of Egypt the same cereals, fruits and veg-
etables are planted and harvested at the same time of the year they were thou-
sands of years before the time of the Pharaohs. In Palestine, if not since the antedeluvian period, certainly and posi-
tively since the time of Moses there has been no change. The seed time and the harvest time of the same staples, includ-
ing seasonal festivals of the Syrians are still on the same dates. The same is true of Europe, and the brief history of Amer-
ica offers no other kind of evidence.
Meteorologists have from time to time advanced many plausible theories as to the causes that operate to produce sudden changes and extremes of weather. Solar heat is thought to be the main, if not the only source of warmth. Planetary in-
ﬂuences as disturbing causes have had many advocates and a Frenchman has recently suggested that the earth revolv-
ing in its orbit has a motion like a spin-
ning top, and from time to time wobbles nearer to or farther from the sun, with-
out any possible regularity; hence the absence of periodicity as time in the oc-
currence of severe changes. All theories so far advanced, it seems. are almost purely speculative, and probably extremes of temperature are caused largely. if not solely, by local disturbances and move-
ments of the atmosphere. It is scarcely two hundred years since accurate instru-

ments, careful observations and detailed records have been in use, but these show no change. Speaking from a geological standpoint, the climate is indeed grow-
ing warmer. There is evidence of glacial drift with Arctic weather as far south as Ohio, and the same is true of Central Europe. These geological changes, how-
ever require thousands of years for their manifestation and we need not suffer any fear that our citrus isotherm will move far enough north to make it too tropical for any orange groves that may be planted near it within the limits of our present civilization.

DISCUSSION.
Prof. Rolfs—We have cords of sta-
tistics on records of weather and cli-
mate, but we have not a single man who can interpret them or make any use of them. \Ve are now getting our climatological records in a little more accessible shape than they were twelve or thirteen years ago.

Methods of Shipping and Packing.
By w. s. Hart.
Mr. President, Ladies and chtlcnu’n:
It has been wittily said, “To train a child, commence with his grandfather.”
So to market fruit easily and proﬁtably,
one should commence by so cultivating,
fertilizing and handling the grove as to produce good fruit, i. e., fruit of desira-
ble sizes, good color, ﬁne appearance,
heavy weight, leathery rind and with juice qualities of the highest type; but,
as all this has been and will continue to be discussed in these meetings by other committees, I will pass on to the time the fruit is taken from the tree.
By a careful study of Prof. G. Harold Powell's very valuable report. “The De-
cay of Oranges While in Transit From California” (Bureau of Plant Industry,
Bulletin No. 123), and the report of Prof. Tenny before this society last year,
all orange growers should become con—
vinced of the important part that careful and profier handling of the fruit bears on the matter of successful marketing.
\Vith the best product of its kind, put on the market in the best possible shaﬂc there remains little in the way of “marketing problem” that need tax the ability of any able business man.
Every handler of fruit wants the out-
put of him who furnishes the best. To the dealer it means high prices, the most proﬁt, the best trade and the ﬁnest kind of advertising at no Cost whatever; for every grower wants to get in where high prices are being steadily realized, no mat-
ter what the quality of his own fruit may be, and the consumer able to pay for the best goes to the high-priced merchant,
feeling assured that there is where he will ﬁnd it.
I propose in this paper to give special attention to that branch of the subject covering the preparation of oranges so that they may command the attention of the best trade on arrival in market. leav-
ing the broader but not more important phases of marketing to other members of this committee, whose experiences especially ﬁt them for the work.
Hire all help by the hour, except, pos-
sibly, the foreman and box-maker. \\'hen sending the pickers to the grove they should be well equipped with plenty of the best tools for their work that the market, or the employer, can provide.
A strong draft animal, with nose cov-
ered so that he cannot browse even a leaf from the trees, a good, three-reach plat-
form wagon so made that the hind wheels will follow the tracks of the front ones,
plenty of good ﬁeld boxes made to rest one on top of the other in a way that will not allow of slipping. and with sides lower by three inches than the tops of the end heads, with openings at the sides near the bottom to allow of the free cir-
culation of air and easy cleaning, with sides not too thick or heavy, and the box to hold no more or less than from one»

half to a full packed box of oranges according to the system of handling, and provided with good hand holds at the ends. Never use bags for picking. Either baskets, tin or galvanized iron receptacles are the only ones on the market that are safe. The latest make of basket leaves little to be desired in that line.
Send a light but strongly made step-
ladder for every picker and a good ex-
tension ladder to about every three men,
if the trees are of good size. Most im-
portant of all, send clippers that are strong and durable so that each picker can afford to own and care for the one he uses, and so made as to render it as near to an impossibility to clipper-cut or puncture an orange as possible and yet allow of cutting the stem snug to the calyx, or even slice a part of it from the fruit.
Until within a very short time, there has been no really good orange clipper on the market. Now the need is fully met. It is best always to send an extra
' pair of clippers along, and also a jug of water, that time may not be wasted in trips back to the packing house in case either is needed. No man should be al-
lowed to use a pair of clippers that is not in perfect order so as to do good work rapidly.
With the foregoing equipment and a piece of chalk for putting their number on each box they pick, the pickers should start their work at the bottom branches and wOrk up as high as they can easily reach: then take the step ladders and.
without leaning them against the tree,
clean it of its fruit to fourteen or ﬁfteen feet from the ground. Above this, long ladders will have to be used: but the utmost care should be exercised not to jam the limbs and fruit out of place more than can be avoided; as where that is done much fruit is injured by thorn-
ing, crushing, scratching, or being shaken from the tree. Do not allow pickers to pull on an orange to get it within reach of the clippers. Every orange should be so clipped that if the stem end should be
ﬁrmly pressed against another orange, it could not injure it.
The picker should be trained to clip three or four oranges, where hanging handily, before putting them in the bas»
ket; which must be done carefully and without a drop of over a half-dozen inches at most. Don't leave scattering fruit,
but pick clean as far as you go, unless selecting for size or ripeness. Turn the fruit into the ﬁeld boxes with care, keep all dead twigs and trash out of all receptacles and keep the fruit shaded from the hot sun while waiting to be hauled. In loading, see that no box is so full as to permit of injuring the fruit by placing another on top of it. or that any may roll off. .
If oranges drop so that injury is pos’
sible, lay them out as culls. There are many methods of handling fruit at the-
packing-house. They should be studied and the one best suited to the individual needs adopted: but there are some gen—
eral directions that may apply to all cases.
The packing—house should be arranged for the careful and economical handling of fruit, as little carrying from place to place as possible; as little lifting of heavy weights as need be and above and over all, plenty of light. The house, bins and runways should be kept reasonably clean and no rotting fruit be allowed to remain in them or in out-of-the-way corners to
ﬁll the air with blue mold germs. Every-
thing that fruit comes in contact with—-
receptacles. runways, spouts or ﬁnger

nails—should be often inspected to see that no rotten fruit, slivers, nail heads,
rough trash or sharp edges can, by any possibility, come in contact with it. If oranges could squeal like a pig when hurt,
there would be noisy times in some pack-
ing-houses and about some pickers.
The markets have had washed fruit and like it, if washed without injury.
No washer will do good and safe work in the hands of careless workers; but there are some now on the market that,
properly handled, will rather add to than injure the keeping qualities of our fruit while doing nice work. I wash all my fruit, though it is as clean and bright as that of any grove probably, and I could hardly be hired to give up the practice.
After washing the fruit should be dried,
being but one layer deep before being put into bins or crowded together in any way. A wet skin does not hurt sound citrus fruits if all parts are wet. Drying on one side and soaking on another is not recommended. My own packing-
house is so arranged that if fruit has to be taken in wet from the outside drying rack, it will dry evenly in the trays where it is graded.
All citrus fruits should be carefully graded into at least two grades. My own practice is to make three grades:
Fancy, No, I Bright and No. 2 Bright.
I have few russets. While grading, I have the scale insects, where there are any, removed by scraping with a light spatula of hard pine. Any orange that is even doubtful as to soundness is put in the cull box.
I prefer to pack after the fruit has been off the trees at least twenty to thirty hours and has lost its rigiditv.
If the system of handling is in deep masses of fruit, then the quicker they are packed and shipped the better their con-
dition on arrival in market. If the nights are cool and the days warm, it is ad-
visable to close the packing—house tightly before the air warms up much, as otherwise it will deposit its moisture on the cold fruit so that they become drip-
ping wet and unﬁt to be handled for the time being. With this exception a good current of pure air through the packing-
house is always desirable.
From the grading trays, the fruit goes to the large hopper holding many boxes,
and from there to the sizer and through the spouts to the packing-bins, The slope of the hopper should be a little greater,
but for drying rack and spouting, three-
fourths inch to the foot is about right.
There are many sizers on the market and several do good work. I should choose one that by no possibility could injure the fruit, that would size by the largest diameter, would be lasting, simple in con-
struction and easy to run.
The bins from which the fruit is packed should be of good size; those likely to receive the greatest quantity should be the largest; those taking the largest and smallest sizes can be of less capacity.
They should be so constructed as to avoid the necessity of pulling the fruit about with the hands and should have either canvas bottoms or be well cushioned where the oranges are to drop more than four inches.
Use strong but not heavy tissue paper for wraps. The so—called Japanese is good, but a little too transparent. Paper that will give a reddish tinge to the fruit is best, if not too tender. Have your private- brand printed on each wrap.
and not so large but that the whole of it will show plainly on a zoo-size orange.
Wrap with brand opposite the stem and

pack as closely as possible without injury to the fruit. If the pack runs too high or too low, don’t pass the box until it is made just right by changing some of the fruit. The sizer must be set according to the shape of the fruit and will occa-
sionally require re-adjusting where the average shape changes, as it will do when running on different varieties or fruit from different soils,
Close packs will not stand to pack as high as the looser ones. From half to three-quarters of an inch above the heads of the box, necessitating considerable pressure in putting on the cover, is about right if packed properly in the layers. If the boxes are trimmed with lace paper,
it is best to paste it at the bottom of the box and pack the ﬁrst two or three layers with the brand next to it, then stencil so that in opening, that side will be the cover. If an attractive display card for the retailer to hang in his store is put in, it helps the marketing. Everything that tends to give the impression of care and neatness about a packed box and its contents adds to the price the fruit will bring and increases the demand. I have my material gotten out to orders sent in May for fall delivery. Bead the edges of every side, use a handsome strap thick enough to allow air to circulate between the boxes, and a neat and tasty stencil or printer. Don’t hesitate to put time and labor into preparing your fruit for market, for there is where a good portion of the proﬁt lies. Every large city con-
tains one, two or three, seldom more,
fruit dealers who handle only fancy stock and they have customers who care little for the price they pay but are only satis-
ﬁed with the very best fruits obtainable.
These are the houses that purchase from the man who puts intelligent work into his products; they are the ones that pay a dollar, two dollars or even more above the top quotations and never ﬁnd more than they want of the kind that pleases them. There are only about three houses of this kind in New York, our largest city. The others pay the prices quoted,
but they will pay more for the second grade or for the poorer sizes of the man who supplies the best trade than they will for the best fruit of the careless shipper.
The shipper who caters to the best trade is not apt to be the one who ships one, two or more cars a day, but he may employ as many hands as one who does and give them work four months each season, help his town as much and net as much proﬁt as his neighbor who has several times his acreage and crop. The man who makes and markets his crop at a cost of $1.25 and gets $1.50 for it makes a clear proﬁt of 25 cents. He who sells for $3.00 makes five times as much net gain, if we allow 2 5 cents for added com~
mission and cost of preparation, and there will be a short time almost every season when he will gross six or seven dollars per box for his best grades and sizes.
At these prices, the small grower of only a few thousand boxes, and groves not so large but that he can handle them prop-
erly and protect them in case of danger,
may have quite a satisfactory income,
while he escapes much of the anxiety and loss of the large grove owner who can—
not give the close personal supervision necessary to the very best work. I am a believer in small groves, but there are individuals who are built for big things and can carry them on successfully.
though they seldom reach the top of the market.
The matter of agencies through which to market is one that I will leave mostly

to other members of this committee to present; but I wish to say this much:
if you put your fruit in the hands of com-
mission houses, look them up carefully before-doing so, both as to reliability and courage in naming prices. To put hun—
dreds, or thousands, of dollars' worth of your products into the hands of strangers at a distance, with no security or guaran-
tee of a square deal, is one of the stran-
gest customs of our business system. You would not loan money to them without careful consideration and ample security,
Why should we throw such fearful temptation in the way of our fellow man and give him so many chances for fraud-
ulent gain with little chance of punish-
ment until, whether honest or not, he gets blamed when results fall short of our ex-
pectations? If we must do this, let us at least take every means possible of elim-
inating temptation and assure ourselves of the integrity of those who sell our pro ducts. Some salesmen have little trouble in asking 25 cents above the market for something extra nice; but for the shipper of the choicest oranges there must be salesmen who know a good thing when they see it and who can‘ ask ﬁfty cents,
a dollar or two dollars above the market with absolute assurance that it is not an over-charge.
Much condemnation has been heaped on the heads of those who make early shipments of green fruit. It is often claimed that such shippers get meagre re-
turns and ruin the orange market for others for the season; that it should be frowned upon by every citrus grower or handler and stopped by law, if possible.
The ﬁrs-t claim is seldom true, for the worst of these sinners. It is those who compromise with their conscience and fol-
low the bolder ones, who take the low prices. For instance, a neighbor with groves alongside of mine shipped his tan-
gerines in early November and got, gross,
$6.00 and $7.00 for them. I commenced November 20th, and they sold for $5.00
and even lower later in the season. I am no lawyer, but I don’t believe that the law can touch the matter, except it be through Boards of Health at the north-
ern end; not would I advocate it if I could, for I believe there is and always will be legitimate demand for a small quantity of early green fruit at good prices, and just so long as this is the case,
just so long as growers are hungry for money in the fall, just so long as the fear of loss through drought, cold or other disaster is upon him who has a crop for sale—just so long will there be a rush of green oranges to market early in the season, a few condemned by health au-
thority, a few high prices realized and then a slump and disappointment for the laggards. As these things will continue,
why rant over them? Let the early ship-
pers have their experiences. They cannot all be happy ones, and the more there are the sooner will every consumer get to know the true conditions, and the lover of sweet oranges will be taught to wait for them until Nature has had time to ripen their sugars and temper their raw acids.
Though oranges grow in size through-
out the shipping season and very high prices are often realized in March and early April, the danger from cold to the fruit of unprotected groves, the great dropping that commences when growth starts in the tree, the tendency to crease,
to get puffy, to dry out and lose ﬂavor late in the season, make it questionable whether it is best to hold even a part of the mid-season varieties later than the

ﬁrst week in March. After this, the later varieties may be shipped at good prices and fair proﬁt from groves well south in the state or farther north if the groves are protected from injury from cold.
Load your own fruit into cars wher-
ever possible, even though there be but a few boxes in the shipment, and see that the ventilators are all open.
As between express and freight, for sound fruit I prefer the latter, believing that the rougher handling and stealage by express more than compensate for the difference in time of delivery, to say no-
thing of the greater difﬁculty in collecting just claims. '
The lesson, then, that I would teach is carefulness that should run, like the red strand in the cordage 0f the English navy, through all our operations and re-
lations with our fruit. This, coupled with honesty and loyalty to ourselves and the handlers of our products, will allow of our shipping our fruit to the north in ventilated cars and there hold more than our own against the pre-cooled and iced fruit of our worthy rival, California;
but the lack of it during the past season has cost us dearly in both money and the reputation of our fruit.
I also have some rules posted in my packing-house, and if you would care to hear them I will read them to you. They are for the guidance of help, and N0. I8
is for casual visitors as well.
I.
Care must be taken when picking or-
anges not to clipper-cut, bruise or thorn them. -
2.
Every picker must put his number on the boxes he picks.
3.
Do not let oranges remain in the hot sun when waiting to be hauled, or for long when on the drying rack.
4.
Every orange must be washed, and sponges used regularly when washing,
5.
Keep plenty of water in the washer to hold weight of fruit so as to wash clean,
6.
All oranges must be examined for long stems and all found must be closely clip-
ped before the fruit goes into the washer.
7.
WVhen curing, oranges should not be over two layers deep.
8.
Keep a constant and careful lookout for anything that will injure the fruit,
such as nails, slivers, sharp edges or long
ﬁnger nails. All persons handling fruit for shipment should keep their ﬁnger nails closely cut.
9.
Be careful to have cushions in place when pouring oranges into bins or hop-
per, and see that no injury is done to any that may be already there.
IO.
Look out for blue mold about bins or boxes and for rotten oranges in the pack-
ing-house. These should be removed at once.

II.
Care in picking, washing, grading,
packing and all work connected with pre-
paring fruit for market is of greater im-
portance than speed,
12.
Every doubtful orange is a cull.
I 3.
Citrus fruits should remain in this packing-house to cure at least thirty-six hours.
14.
Pack true to grade, size and quality,
and so that when the cover is put on the fruit will be tight in the box.
15.
Each packer must put his initials or number on every box he packs; also grade and number of fruit in the box. Cus-
tomers will be requested to send us the packer's mark on every box badly packed,
so that the packer can be held responsi-
ble.
16.
The W. S. Hart brand must be known as an honest brand.
17.
No excuse is a good one for careless-
ness or waste of time.
18.
All persons, both casual visitors and help, must bear in mind that this is a place of business and not for loaﬁng, long stories or gossip; nor must visitors divert the attention of the help from their work for long at any time.
No one but the undersigned has au-
thority to change these rules.

He who knows it all and resents in-
struction, is hopelessly ignorant, a dis-
appointment to himself and vexing to others, the last to be employed when help is scarce, and the ﬁrst to go when it be—
comes plenty.
By F. G. Sampson.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
\Vhen I learned of my appointment on your Citrus Packing and Shipping Com-
mittee, I wondered what I could say at all worth while, but from shape of mar-
ket the past season, it does seem as if the time were right now when we should take counsel together for the bettering of conditions. \Ve can start with the fact that if we are calculating to hold any position worth while in the markets, we shall be obliged to adopt the most im-
proved methods all the way through from growing to marketing our fruit. The citrus plantings in California, Porto Rico,
Cuba, Arizona, and Mexico are enormous and add to that the yearly planting in Florida makes an increasing supply that leaves no possible room for proﬁt, for anything but the best work of which we are capable. The production of all other kinds of fruit is year by year being brought to greater perfection in quality and attractiveness, and any orange to get preference over other kinds of fruits must be both good to look at and to eat. Flor-
ida does produce such fruits; but those

very qualities (thin skin and full to burst-
ing with delicious juice) calls for extra care all the way through, and in that, I am afraid, most of us are not doing our best at all. The past season was opened with shipments of fruit as green as‘the leaves on the trees; it is no trouble at all to color an orange, but it is impossible to make an unripe fruit ﬁt to eat, and pretty nearly so to get a buyer for second lot after sampling ﬁrst. Some early or-
anges are ripe enough inside before the rind is fully colored and should be ship-
ped and so prolong the season; but until you yourself enjoy eating them they should be left on the trees.
Then, unless you have been in the mar-
kets and actually seen condition on arrival of many of the shipments, you have no idea of the amount of decay. The per-
centage of shipments arriving in bad or-
der is responsible for continual lowering of the markets; for you can bet your last dollar that if the buyer sees any decay at all (and he will see it if it is there), he will buy at a price allowing for double what he suspects is there.
Now, it is not enough for oranges to arrive sound; they must stay so until the retailer can sell them and the consumer eat them. Our fruit not standing up is responsible for the tremendous margin the retailer exacts.
Then, again, no orange that has been in contact with a decaying orange has the fresh, inviting ﬂavor that we must furnish our customers in order to secure consumption at good prices for the size of crops in sight.
The wide range of prices the past sea-
son shows that the buyers are ready to pay well for what they want. For in—
stance, auction market sales New York February 26th Florida 1.20 to 3.25, Feb-
ruary 27th 1.25 to 5.20, and 29th Florida
1.25 to 5.65, California 1.65 to 3.10,
Porto Rico 1.10 to 1.55 for oranges and grapefruit, these date from 1.12% to
8.62%. The growers getting 3.10 to 5.65
for oranges and 8.6212 for grapefruit were getting rich; the others, I guess not.
Part of our marketing troubles the past season were from causes beyond our con-
trol, national ﬁnancial troubles and drought causing summer-bloom fruit of different ages; but this trouble was in-
creased by many shipping all ages to-
gether, which, with decay, soon brought our markets too low for any proﬁt.
The Agricultural Department, in bul-
letin 123, clearly shows the cause and the Practical—not theoretical, mind you, but entirely practical remedy for most of the decay and we had best be getting busy studying and following.
Putting me on this committee means,
I suppose, that I am to give my own packing methods and so help start the discussion. \V e use the cloth-lined, rattan picking baskets, strap that goes over shoulder, of wide webbing, hung low enough so the elbow just clears the bas-
ket, which is then where the forearm reaches the bottom of the basket; the fruit is placed in basket, not dropped. \Ve round off ends of bent-blade scissors blunt, and pick all bottom fruit before using ladders. The picking “boss” sees that a picker slips his basket off his shoul-
der, laying a dozen or so oranges in bot-
tom of box and then tipping basket with one hand eases fruit into box with the other, and he puts his ticket in box as
ﬁlled. Hand holes in ﬁeld boxes are not cut clear through and so avoid ﬁnger-nail cuts, and boxes set down, not dropped at all. At the packing-house the fruit goes to grading bench, cloth-lined, and with

heavy duck apron at the ends, with one side nailed down. The box is placed on a shelf four inches lower than the table,
and the grading boss gathers end of apron in each hand and holds tight over box of fruit while he upsets the box and then lifts box off. As the fruit spreads out, if it shows long stems, they are cut and word is sent to the grove to straighten up that picker.
Have short side benches that hold boxes for two grades bright and one russets,
and cull box under bench and try, and do not forget to use cull box. Trucks hold-
twenty—eight boxes carry graded fruit to different piles to cure a couple of days.
Sizer-hopper has shelf and apron. We use sizer made by Alfred Ayer, Ocala,
that sizes, and is set so that in packing,
each tier has to have pressure to get last row in, and so the box will stand tipping at quite an angle before the fruit would roll out.
we use \Varner wrapping machines that twist paper tight and get box packed tight all the way up, and so avoid so much pressure on top as box is nailed up. As boxes are nailed up they are stood on end, two high, and have trucks with 11-
inch axle and wheels inside, so the two boxes are put right in place in car without further handling.
\Ve hire by the day, for I fully believe that piece-work is responsible for very much of the decay; at any rate it is cer-
tainly easier to get the extra care from a hand when you are paying him for the extra time that may be required; but really when once the habit is formed, it requires very little more time to handle right, but it is certainly a day’s work to make our hands understand we will have careful handling.
My paper is too long already, but I want to say that I think our marketing methods must be improved, or our in-
creasing crops will bring us no proﬁt. The buyer and packer who did not lose money the past season was exceptionally f0r~
tunate, and, naturally, all will contract very carefully this fall. I believe we must have a central distributing headquarters at Jacksonville, so the crop can be handled so as not to have each packer competing for every sale in each and every market.
To handle the present crop in sight, the packers ought to get together for thor-
oughly systematic distribution. We ought to have very much lower freight rates to nearby states. We could then sell fruit very good to eat but not quite up to stan-
dard—cheap, and still get more than with distant freightage and so relieve the large markets of so much off-grade fruit. It is the accumulation of off-grade fruit that breaks our markets. Our Southland i5
prospering and will take lots of our fruit if we could deliver at reasonable freight rates. Unless our shippers organize and use quite a little judgment, we are likely to see our markets go to smash in a hurry this fall. The early markets paid so much better than the later, the past season, that the last one of us will probably think it smart to work-all night and Sunday, too,
to swindle someone with our unripe fruit.
I believe the situation a very serious one, needing the most intelligent handl-
ing. If we continue our present policy of “each one for himself and the Devil take the hindmost,” my judgment goes on record right here, that he will get a good big bunch of us this fall,

By 0. W. Sadler, Jamestown, Pa.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I want to call the attention of the society to the extreme importance of a most thorough study and discussioﬁ of means and methods for the sale of our products of Florida. The extremely low prices obtained for everything this Year,
- should have touched every grower in his tenderest point—his pocketbook—severely enough to make him think and act.
Since the collapse of the panic before Christmas, except a few cases of especially fancy stock, oranges have not netted, on the trees. over
25 to 50 cents when consigned; at least that has been my experience with several cars 'to various markets reported as the best; $1.25 to $2.00 being the av-
erage limit for good oranges. The causes preached to us were the “panic,”
and the “large crop.” By investigation on my trip north, and since I have been here. has given another cause,—green fruit early in the season. The green-fruit proposition is brought about by two main facts or conditions. The ﬁrst is, on ac-
count of the comparatively few Florida oranges since the big freeze, the great mass of orange eaters have not learned what a good ripe Florida orange is, and do not know a Florida from appearance, or where it comes from, so have not sufﬁcient knowledge to judge by. \V hen there are few, if any, other oranges, the green stuff is offered for sale. They make a ﬁrst pur-
chase of “ﬁne sweet Florida oranges,”
and Oh! the awakening; and straightway their opinion of Florida oranges is de-
cidedly expressed in—“VVell, if that is a S'ZW’C! Florida orange, I never want any more.” By the time they get over that disappointment, they venture to try some other kind, and they ﬁnd a colored green California and try it. [t is not real sweet, but as a Florida green colored orange is always very much more sour and rank than a California of the same stage of development, without fur-
ther trial, remembering how awfully sour the Florida was, he remains a California chooser.
This experience was told me by sev-
eral people from several states and mar-
kets, and positively asserted that the sale of green fruit had injured Florida's repu_
tation for good oranges to an enormous extent,
As speculators were the chief cause of the shipment of green fruit the past year,
and as the majority got left to the tune of 50 cents to $1.00 per box, after the dis-
tribution of the ﬁrst car in a commun-
ity, they cannot work the “early sweet Florida” game in the same places again,
at least to the consumer, it is to be hoped the state may redeem its name in part the next crop. Until this season I have al—
ways been able to sell my Florida oranges in competition with Californias at an av-
erage advance of 50 cts. over Californias.
This year the reverse is the case, except with people who know the difference. Our greatly increased foreign population who have not yet had the opportunity to learn the difference, make up a majority who buy through ignorance and looks—bright Californias.
The dealers have proclaimed loud and long that “the poor, the laboring class eat the oranges, and they are out of work and can not buy.”
Is it true they can not, and do not buy?
We are all aware the crop has been sold,
and consumed—somebody ate the or-

anges. Did the consumer get any advan-
tage of the low prices paid the grower?
A few ﬁgures from my own sales on consignment of about 1,500 boxes, mostly car lots, will give one example of the very small returns to the grower. The average sales returned was $1.78. The average freight, cartage and commission, was 89
_cents, leaving 89 cents f. 0. b. at packing-
house. Taking from this the usual pick-
ing, packing and shipping 50 cents, leaves
39 cents on the trees. This was during January, February and March. Those sold f. 0. b. at home did better, bringing
$1.30 to $1.40, showing considerable ad-
vantage of f. 0. b. at home, over consign-
ment. But this year there were very few f. o. b. buyers, and not all could be relied on to carry out their contract.
Now, let us see if these low prices were necessary to the retailing of the fruit with a reasonable proﬁt.
I have inquired carefully as to many places, from Georgia, North, East and West, and in my own town, and ﬁnd that retail sales were 15 cents to 20 cents for the smaller sizes, progressively upward to
25, 35, 40, 50 and 60 cents as to size,
and one gentleman living in New York said he paid 75 cents per dozen for 150-
size. Averaging all prices would give 37
cents per dozen. If oranges run all sizes in equal quantity, the average dozens in a box would be 15%, giving an average retail sales price of $5.73 per box. If we only include 250s, 216s, 1755, 1505 and
126s, we get an average of 18% dozens,
and averaging per-dozen prices at 15
cents, 2o, 30 cents, 35 cents, 40 cents and
50 cents, we get an average of 31 23
cents per dozen, 31 2-3x18%—$5.85 per box, average all sizes and prices.
If we grant a loss of 16% per cent.
for decay, there is still left $4.90 as the retail price per box. The above average commission house return price of $1.78
leaves a net proﬁt of $3.12, while the grower has received the generous sum of
39 cents, including his investment, and proﬁt P—where is the proﬁt?
Suppose we add one dollar more to the cost to the small and interior town retail-
ers, he still has $2.12, or over ﬁve times more for selling than the grower for pro—
ducing.
Fruit-growers of Florida, are you will-
ing to continue this unequal division of the products of your labor and expense,
without an effort to change?
Let us take another example in the veg-
etable line—cukes. The ﬁrst week in May cukes selling in the chief markets at $1.00
to $1.25. The average express charges in less than car lots not less than 75 cents,
commission I 1 cents, hamper, picking and packing 30 cts.—$1.16, average consign-
ment sale $1.25; loss, 3% cts. for grower.
Consequently none but those who can ship in car lots have any chance of coming out even.
Investigation as to retail prices, by per-
sonal inquiry at large and small stores and fruit stands, I am told cukes average
—small, medium and large—6 dozen per basket; averaging the prices 30, 40 and
60 cents per dozen—43 1-3 cents or $2.60
per basket, or $1.38 net Proﬁt for selling,
against nothing or a loss for growing.
What is the use discussing how best to grow our products if we can get nothing for them? The few commission men I have talked with about the matter, who should be the grower’s agent to see that he got his share of what the consumer pays, say they do not see how they can change conditions. Although they have a society, they make no concerted effort to get our equalshare, but, on the other

hand, compete with each other in selling OUR products, thus favoring the retailer,
practically giving us over into his power,
as the foregoing ﬁgures demonstrate.
Is there no way to remedy this con—
dition? This is the great problem for our society to solve. Can we do it? Can the growers come directly to the consumer and cut out the middlemen who now are only agents for_our undoing?
The consumer pays enough for our pro-
ducts, but we get very little of it.
The result of my study of the question is, ORGANIZATION OF oaowans SELLING DIRECT TO CONSUMER.
That there will be many difﬁculties in its accomplishment, goes without saying.
But that there are business men in our society to devise a plan and work out the details, I am certain; and when done,
taking present conditions as a basis, I am sure there will be much more proﬁt in the selling than in the raising.
As I cannot be present at the meeting to discuss the matter with you, I will give you a few of my thoughts as to a plan.
Let every district or section organize and establish a common packing-house at the most convenient shipping point, so as to ship in car lots. A packing-house im-
plies a competent picking and packing crew.
Elect a competent man as grader and inspector of the fruit, either on the trees or as delivered at the packing-house, and each grower be given a credit certiﬁcate for the number of boxes of different grades, or a more exact way, the number of pounds, and then let his fruit lose its identity as his special lot.
A manager for each packing house or board of managers representing several or all, are then ready to sell f. o, b. at packing house. Or, having organized and opened a sales house or houses in places capable of taking—consuming a car load a week and upward, keep these sales houses supplied through telegraphic com-
munication with a general head as they need. The details of retail distributing houses can certainly be worked out by successful business men. Each grower,
each manager of packing-house, and of sales store, should be a stock owner, or interested ﬁnancially, and partake of the proﬁts. The organization could by vote
ﬁx starting price for fruit on the trees,
or the proportionate percentage of the net proceeds at stated times.
As it is now, the grower must pay the cost of shipment before they leave, and gets no money until the consignee gets ready to remit—from ten days to three months, and by drawing no money from the organization for the same average time the capital need not be large.
I have not the time nor the capacity to go into all the details, but hope I have suggested enough to introduce the sub-
ject, and certain that together, a success-
ful way of beneﬁting ourselves and the consumer can be devised.

By W. E. Bryan.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Starting at the beginning of the sea-
son the ﬁrst problem is the packing of fruit that is not thoroughly mature; this fruit requires to be kept in the packing-
house several days until the water in the rind has sweated out. If this is not done before the fruit is packed it will sweat in the box and undoubtedly cause decay,
which will not develop until after it has left the packing house, and the grower will often be astounded when he gets a letter from his commission merchant in-
forming him Ithait his fruit, 'which he knows left his packing-house in good or-
der and condition, has arrived in bad or-
der, and has had to be sold at a sacriﬁce.
The grower often thinks the commis-
sion merchant is deceiving him and try-
ing to cheat him when the true reason is found in the fact that the fruit having sweated in the box, has caused the wrap-
ping paper to become thoroughly wet and the whole contents of the box are in a very moist state, which is a condition highly conducive to very rapid decay.
Let us beware, then, of shipping or-
anges with moisture in the rind,
SIZING AND GRADING ORANGES,
When packing fruit it is well to re-
member that most of our fruit is packed to be sold to some stranger, who in turn will probably sell to somebody else; there-
fore it is necessary that he should have some idea of how many oranges he is getting in each box and of what quality they are. The number and grade, then,
should be put on each box plainly and the contents should be strictly accord-
ing to stenciling both in number and in grade. Any irregularity in this respect will make the buyer suspicious of the fruit not being equal to the markings and in future ‘buying he will feel unwill-
ing to pay full market prices, and hold a general distrust of orange packers. It is necessary, if each person concerned in marketing oranges is to get their full quota of proﬁt, that each and every one does his share of the \work and that all should be in sympathy. When all can be trusted there is an economy in the marketing that should be an extra proﬁt to all concerned. I have known of well-
known brands of fruit fetching higher prices because it was known to be exactly as represented by the markings on the box. Such fruit often passes through the hands of the middlemen without the de-
lay and cost of inspection.
Let us, then. be careful to mark and grade our fruit correctly.
PROPER PACKING.
One of the worst features of poor or-
ange packing is the putting of too much fruit in the box; in some instances so much is put in as to cause the top and sides to bulge out. This is done to such an extent that the top of the box cannot be nailed in the middle; the fruit in such a packed box is nearly sure to be very much bruised by pressure from other packages in transit and from handling.
If dealers ﬁnd much damaged fruit in their purchases, they have to sell the good fruit at (very advanced prices to make their purchase proﬁtable, and thus materially restrict the consumption of or-
anges, which restriction results in glut-
ted markets and poor returns to the grower, whilst the consumer is complain-
ing of the high price of retail oranges.


## p. 51 (#593) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 51
These results are brought about by loss of damaged fruit caused by putting too many oranges, or too large oranges, in too small a space and than subjecting the box to outside pressure from other freight, both in the railway car and on the transfer trucks.
SIZE OF ORANGE BOX.
What size should an orange box be?
The size should be regulated by economy for the grower and availability to the consumer. The packing will be most eco-
nomically done by having a box large enough and not too large for one man to handle and lift without other aid than his own physical strength, and large enough to keep a man of ordinary strength in good exercise, thus handling a good many oranges at one time and at the same time keeping up a high degree of manhood amongst the orange fraternity.
' The size of the box from the seller’s point of view should be that which is most available to dispose of in the market.
The present size of the box, viz.: 12x12x
24 inches, would seem to be large enough and not too large for one man to handle;
and if the commission merchants do not
' complain of the size as being awkward to dispose of, I do not think we should change. We should pay no attention whatever to any size of box that some other orange section may produce, know-
ing fully well that the orange buyers will pay just so much, that the fruit will bring them a proﬁt and that their price will be regulated by their ability to make their proﬁt out of the contents of the box.
The unit of economy in the size of the box is that it should be large enough to tax the strength of an ordinary man, and not larger, and if the present size of the box fulﬁls this condition, any other size would make the cost of handling greater,
which extra cost would have to to be paid by the grower when the fruit was in abundance and low in price, and by the consumer when the fruit is scarce and high and always means money paid to the middleman either by the producer or con-
sumer.
Some sections may ﬁnd it advisable to have a very small box, as possibly not much of their fruit is wanted; but if Florida fruit is classed as being equal to the best, let us send it out in abundance,
and 'not try to restrict our output by contracting the size of our box.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Hart—Now, there is a great deal of difference in white papers.
Some white papers will give you the proper color. The mandarine orange is of much better quality than the tan-
gerine, but the latter brings nearly double the price of the other. The Japanese paper does not give that pretty tint and it is so transparent that it shows up the blemishes badly. but it is tough and does not break or tear easily. I also think the print is of much importance. Your private b r a n (I should not be too large. I have seen some so large that on a 200 orange you could only see some confused printing.
in the middle. A good print can be made small. yet plenty large and plain enough to show the whole of it on a
200 orange.
Before the fruit goes into the washer the thumb, ﬁnger or the eye comes in contact with every calyx, and if any stem is left on them they are carefully clipped off. It would be almost im-

possible for a long stem to get by my men as far as the washer.
Mr. Skinner—I have heard it said that Mr. Sampson puts up the best pack in the state, not excepting any.
I think it will do us a great deal of good to listen to these men and learn what they have learned by experience.
The great trouble with me is labor.
We have to import from 100 to 200
hands every year and we have to get green hands and when you have to deal with these fellows and get them to pare their ﬁnger nails, etc., we are up against it. I have one thing in my packing house that is of great help to me, and that is truck boards. When the boxes are nailed up they are set on this truck board and we have a special truck that is slipped under it,
and the boxes are moved right into the car and are not touched at all. The truck board protects the fruit entirely.
I was struck by a little article I saw in the paper not long ago. The writer said he set his fruit over some steam pipes so that it could not get cold and attract outside moisture. He also said he washed his fruit with a little sali-
cylic acid, and he said the wounds that it had received dried over. I have been thinking of that. I use a washer with a great deal of satisfaction except when the burlap breaks loose, then I have a good deal of trouble in getting it ﬁxed. I think my washer is the best washer there is, but it is necessary to have good burlap.
Mr. Hart—I would like to ask Mr.
Skinner what becomes of the boards he speaks of?
Mr. Skinner—The fellows that are trucking run the truck to the end of the car where the man is loading, and he lifts the boxes off and sets them in place. The truck boards are thrown to the side of the car and a man sets his truck under them when a pile ac-
cumulates and carries them back into the packing house.
Mr. Hart—I saw them in California used for plums and I thought they would be ﬁne for oranges. The point I mean to bring out is that you would have to handle your oranges once more than you would without them.
Mr. Skinner—\Ve use them when the fruit is brought into the packing house, in fact, we use them every-
where. You see, our station and pack-
ing house are together.
Mr. Hart—Most of the trucks that are used are so made that the arms are so high that it comes right in the mid-
dle of the section where it can do the most harm. I think them very bad.
indeed, to handle fruit. I once put an iron bar across them to prevent .that,
but if these boards can be used. I think it wise to do so. Do you use one board to three boxes?
Mr. Skinner—Yes. You see. you have to have two cleats underneath the boards. These cleats ﬁt right over the prongs on the truck. and you can lift them up and carry them without the least difﬁculty or danger.
I might speak of another thing.
Perhaps you are familiar with the Cali-
fornia load. In refrigerator cars espe-
cially it is a ﬁne thing. You put six boxes across the car, standing them up on end, and there is a space of about four inches between each box in an ordinary car and six inches in a vent.
Then two strips are nailed across.
leaving a vent clear through. each box by itself. There is a straight line of

boxes from one end of the car to the other. The cost of the stripping never exceeds $I.25. To show you how well it holds, I had a car handled by the Atlantic Coast Line in its usual careful way. They were going about forty miles an hour when a wreck occurred.~ That car turned over on its side and rolled down a hill. How-
ever, each layer of boxes settled down against the next one, and only about six boxes in the car were broken.
I think Dr. Inman might be able to tell us a good deal along this line, if he will.
Mr. Inman—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Had I known that I would be called upon, I might have formulated some ideas which would be of interest to my fellow fruit growers.
I am not a good talker, and if I had any ideas, I fear that I cannot present them in a very interesting way. But I can probably tell the story as it ap-
pears to me.
First, let us cast about and take an inventory of what we are doing in the way of growing and harvesting citrus fruits in Florida. Are we producing as much or of as good quality of fruit as we should do? And after it is grown, are our methods of harvesting in keeping with the spirit and pro-
gress of the times? I am free to say that we are growing but little over one-half of the fruit that the groves of the state are capable of producing un-
der a more through system of care and cultivation. But. upon this subject I do not propose to dwell. as it, within itself, would require a volume. How-
ever, I will say right here that I have visited a good part of the world where citrus fruits are grown, and have come to the conclusion that, so far as I have seen or acquired knowledge of, there is no country or region which affords the advantages for the growing of or-
anges, tangerines and grapefruit that we possess right here in Florida; no place where fruit grows to such perfec-
tion or the groves produce so abun-
dantly, and no place where an enter-
prising man can engage in the busi-'
ness with the same certainty of being well compensated for his labors.
Harvesting—This is one of the all-
absorbing subjects of the day, and the one demanding the most thorough in-
vestigation and thought, followed by energetic action upon the part of every one engaged in the fruit-growing in-
dustry. Our careless and rough hand-
ling is costing the state thousands, yes,
hundreds of thousands, of dollars every year. I make the assertion that fully ninety per cent. of the Florida fruit which arrives in market in bad order is attributable to careless clipping and careless handling. All of us ﬂatter ourselves that we are taking extra pains and doing better than'our neigh-
bors, and that if our fruit does not reach its destination sound, the fault lies with the transportation companies and not with us; when, if the truth were known, fully one-fourth of the oranges were either punctured by the clippers,
scratched by the ﬁnger nails or bruised by dropping, jamming against the lad-
ders. pouring into the ﬁeld boxes,
rought treatment by teamsters, empty-
ing and piling up in the hoppers, or falling from the sizers into packing bins. All of these matters seem to be of small moment until they are care-
fully looked into. When that is done,
the result is simply astounding. We

must awaken to the importance of these little details, and bear in mind that fruit should be handled with the same care that we would give eggs,
and will actually stand no more rough-
ness without great damage. Stop and consider. Is there one of the abuses mentioned that we cannot correct and entirely eradicate?
I am not making these statements at random, nor without abundant evi-
dence to substantiate every word or assertion. They have all been con-
ﬁrmed by actual tests, made by gov‘
ernment experts, both in this state and California, during the past season. Re-
member that the slightest scratch upon the rind of the fruit is just as surely fatal as a deep puncture or severe bruise, provided the fruit is exposed to the rot spores, which are never want—
ing in every one of our packing houses.
Every small inch of atmosphere con-
tains thousands of them.
Marketing—Here comes the business part of all of our undertaking. the,one that must be revolutionized very soon. or the business of the growing of citrus fruits in our fair state will soon fall into a more chaotic and helpless state than it is at the present time. Who is to
,blame? No one but our dear selves.
and no one but the growers can ever correct the existing evils. We can and must do it.
Let us take the state of Florida as a whole, and make it a business proposi—
tion. applying to each one of us singly;
for what concerns any one of us, ap-
plies to every one in Florida engaged in the growing of fruit.
Let us see if we are acting as busi-
ness men should—are adopting good business methods. What are we doing, and what are our methods, and what must we do? If you will bear with me, I will enumerate some of our follies. To begin with, we are sup-
porting about one thousand solicitors and drummers, representing commis-
sion houses from almost every city in the North, South, East and \Vest. Add to these one thousand men about
ﬁve hundred livery rigs and drivers.
These are all high-priced men, and ex—
pensive livers. This army of itself costs us hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars annually. But this is but the be-
ginning of our extravagant manage-
ment, for we are supporting, in a good part, an equal number of commission houses in nearly every city in the Union. I do not wish to be under-
stood as casting any reﬂection upon these men, nor upon the fruit houses;
for I acknowledge that the great ma-
jority of these men. also the houses which they represent, are doing a legi-
timate business. and at the same time doing the very best they can for our interests. But, is our way or system of marketing correct and in keeping with good business principles? I would answer, most emphatically, No! No!
You will ask, “Is there any remedy within our reach. any system of econ-
omical marketing upon which we can all unite. one ‘WllllCl‘l shall be just to all.
one by which the widow and the small grower with a badly assorted grove.
producing a little of all varieties and kinds of citrus fruits. will fare as well and receive the same price (quality the same). as the most shrewd and com-
petent business man ?” To this I an-
swer. with the same emphasis and con~
ﬁdence, Yes!
You inquire by what authority and

ways I have arrived at these positive conclusions, and how I am able to talk as though these were established facts.
To answer and prove that I am not dreaming or theorizing, I will tell the whole story as I know it.
I have been in Florida twenty-two years, and during all of that time have been engaged in the growing of fruit,
and that, too, with very good success and results, which I do not complain of. But, for the past two or three sea-
sons, I have been convinced that our methods were not the best, and that the orange growers of California were outdoing us, both as to harvesting and marketing of their crops.
On April fourth I decide to go to the Paciﬁc coast and investigate, not alone for myself, but with the hope of beneﬁting my neighbors as well. By appointment with Prof. Tenny, a gov-
ernment employe, I was met at River-
side by Professor Powell, who has been engaged, through the Horticul-
tural Department at Washington, for the past ﬁve years in making a thor-
ough study of conditions existing there, and teaching, by a vast number of experiments, the growers how to correct the evils and errors, which he discovered existing there, which were many, yes, even more and worse than are besetting us at the present time.
The growing and marketing of their oranges was affording almost no proﬁt and, in many cases, an actual loss to the producer. Their methods of harvesting were very crude, and when it came to selling their fruit and get-
ting it to market, the results were such that a great many of the orange groves were abandoned, or cut down and the land planted to other crops. It seemed impossible for them to get their or-
anges to the Eastern markets without their arriving rotten. How to remedy matters was the task undertaken by Professor Powell, and that, too, almost single-handed, for he was supported with an appropriation of only $3,500
annually, out of which he had to meet all of his personal expenses, as well as to pay his assistants (when he had any). This season the appropriation is $6,700.00 and he has seven men to\
aid him. It seemed a Herculean task,
and one almost without hope. But,
what has been the result, what has this one man achieved? How plainly has he demonstrated that men. not money,
are the powers which are moving the world at the present time.
In the ﬁrst place, he demonstrated that the harvesters, and not the trans-
portation companies, were at fault for the rotting of the fruit. He showed the growers, by actual experiments,
that in some cases over ﬁfty per cent.
of their fruit was hopelessly damaged before it was delivered to the railroad company. This was his ﬁrst key to the solution of the problem, and. with all of his experiments before the grow-
ers, the remedies were easily found,
and all enterprising growers set about jointly to correct and remedy every bad feature in the harvesting, until to-
day oranges in California are handled with the same care as eggs. And claims upon the transportation have been reduced about seventy-ﬁve per cent.
Next, as to the methods of market-
ing, and the organization known as the California Fruit Exchange, which is today, I believe, the most thorough business organization in the United

States, not excepting the Standard Oil Company or the United States Steel Company; and, more, it is one without graft or fraud, and to which I can see no probability of fraud creeping in.
The California Fruit Exchange has only about or less than $20,000; If I remember correctly, it is $I5,000 capi-
tal, upon which it never pays a divi-
dend. I will try to tell you something of the Fruit Exchange. This organ-
ization consists of numerous packing houses, or associations. These asso-
ciations are usually made up of neigh-
bors, for whom it is convenient to do their packing at one packing house,
and of these associations there are a great many, and each one of these as-
sociations is entitled to one share of stock (no more) in the Fruit Ex-
change. This share of stock entitles the association to one representative to or in the Fruit Exchange. The Exchange is made up and controlled entirely by these representatives from associations (who do not draw pay).
These representatives elect the board of directors; the board of directors elect the ofﬁcers, and the oﬁicers elect the President and employ the execu-
tive force. The Fruit Exchange is al—
most a complete duplicate of our Fed-
eral Government.
All business is transacted at head-
quarters at Los Angeles. and it is sur-
prising how much can be done by a few men when well systematized. For instance, and to illustrate some of their methods and their success, only ﬁve years ago the Fruit Exchange was or-
ganized, with only a few associations.
It then only controlled a small per-
centage of the fruit. But, by thorough business methods and advantages which co-operation afforded. It has grown very rapidly, until this season The Exchange will handle fully sev-
enty-ﬁve per cent. of all the citrus fruit grown in California, amounting to over thirty thousand (30,000) car-
loads. And all of the sales are man-
aged 'by two (head sales-men, with only six traveling salesmen to help them.
How does this compare with our force employed for the selling of our small crop? It is not ﬁve per cent. of our expense. In fact, the whole expense of managing associations, Fruit Ex-
change. collections, buying and all,
does not amount to ﬁve per cent.
Losses, defalcations and non-payment of accounts, as shown by the books of the Exchange, which are open to all, amount to less than three hundred
($300) dollars, and this, too, upon sales amounting to over thirty millions of dollars ($30,000,ooo.oo). Payments for fruit to the growers are made in cash every thirty days, no losses, no
‘Zt'OffiL’S. You might inquire if there are any other beneﬁts or advantages to be derived from such an organiza-
tion as the California Fruit Exchange.
Yes, very many. For instance, before this organization was effected, the growers were paying nineteen (19)
cents each for orange boxes. Today they cost them 12 to 12% cents.
Paper, machinery, the price of help,
and the supply are managed by the Exchange. Freight rates are all man-
aged by the oPﬁces of the Exchange,
and the rates which they pay on fruit,
considering the broad distribution which they enjoy, is very much less than we pay from Florida, notwith-
standing that we are two thousand miles nearer to the markets.

A very small proportion of the Cali-
fornia fruit is re-shipped from point to point, as the Florida fruit is. The Cali-
fornia rates are all made to Denver,
Colorado, and beyond. It costs no more for them to place a car in Boston than in Denver, freight the same to all points east of that city.
Shall I tell you how the labor is done by the Californians? This might be of interest and may be a help to you in getting down to a proper way of doing the work, with the object in view of correcting the present errors and abuses.
To begin with, all labor is employed by the day. except the wrapping of the fruit. This work is nearly all done by women, and the price per box is two and one-half (2%) to three cents.
In all packing houses which I visited they were paying two and one-half centsper box. The picking is done by man. not exﬂert pickers such as we employ, but Mexicans, Chinese, Japs,
Indians or white men, under the eyes of a Superintendent, whom they must obey to the letter and in the proper spirit. This ﬁeld superintendent is sup-
plied by the association for which the work is being done, and all gathering must be done under the supervision of their ofﬁcers, and not according to the taste or ways of the growers, for here is the beginning of the careful work, and of very vital importance,
for an error here is past remedying.
\Ve cannot patch up a damaged or-
ange.
Hauling—This is all done upon spring wagons, and the ﬁeld boxes are carefully set upon the wagon and when taken off are carefully set down, not shoved or thrown. They never use a
ﬁeld box larger than a common orange box, and they ﬁll these boxes about two-thirds full and carry about sev—
enty-ﬁve to ninety boxes upon each wagon.
I am asked how it would be possible for us to form such an organization in Florida, where our matters are in such a state of confusion. You say that it would not be possible to get a sufﬁcient number of growers to unite to control a majority of the fruit; too many ﬁrms and individuals with pri-
vate interests would oppose and work against us. Yes, they would do their best; but we would not need any cer-
tain percentage of the fruit. The prin-
cipal object should be to do the work in such a manner and at such a saving,
and show such results, that the ques-
tion would be not as to who wished to join the associations, but as to who the associations would take in; for all who become members of the Exchange have to submit to the positive rules of the same. Remember, and do not confound the terms Exchange with that of associations. The latter is made up of an association of neigh-
bors for the better gathering and packing of their crops. The Exchange is composed of representatives, one from each Association. Every grower is in reality a member of the Ex-
change. How could we proceed to or-
ganize an Exchange? What steps should we take? To this I will say that nearly all present are orange growers, and among us we have a large number of enterprising, _loyal men who could be appointed by this Society for the purpose of forming an organization. They would proceed as follows: Say three be chosen to go

to California and fully familiarize themselves with the workings of their Exchanges and Associations. The Californians send you through me an invitation to come there, and they will warmly welcome and aid you. Get a copy of their Articles of Incorporation.
The California Fruit Exchange is an open book, and they are with us and are very anxious that we organize,
which would mean much to them, and do away with our glutting and ruin-
ing every market within our reach.
You never hear of a glut of California oranges. They were willing to give me a copy of their Articles of Incor-
poration, which I have, also by-laws governing several of their associations.
This Committee would return and re-
port to their fellow members. The next step would be to secure a lec-
turer and organizer—a teacher; the same one who did the work (or nearly all of it) for the Californians. (I was told by their President he thought he could be had.) Set him at work and as soon as half a dozen neighborhood organizations were effected, proceed to incorporate the Florida Fruit Ex-
change. And, by the way, we have now in this state quite a number of these local organizations, which are ready and waiting to organize an Ex-
change. This work would go on very rapidly and with a positiveness of suc-
cess, as we would have all of the ex—
perience of our California neighbors,
the full beneﬁts of their system, from beginning to end, which has cost them thousands of dollars and ﬁve years of hard work.
After a great deal of study, I am in favor of an organization in Florida,
with the California organization as our pattern. \Ve must do this if we wish to remain in the fruit-growing business for proﬁt; if we wish to avoid the greater calamity which confronts us. Conditions are becoming worse every season, and the coming season will experience worse gluts and rot-
outs in the markets than ever before.
Not that there is too much fruit; no.
\Ve cannot grow too much fruit. That is not the trouble, and is not a fault to be remedied. The faults are these:
Too great an expense is allowed to ac-
cumulate upon our fruit between the tree and the consumer. This is an old song, but we are going to remedy it. I speak again with positiveness,
for where our pocketbooks are touched, the same thrust pierces our hearts also.
\Ve are going to organize and that.
too, soon. The time is at hand, and within ﬁve years seventy-ﬁve per cent.
of our crop will be handled in a busi-
ness way, and the same per cent. of our expenses will be cut off.
It may seem like a big undertaking to get us in line, but it would not be. But it must be done by men with an honest and pure motive, with no graft to be anticipated, for none can exist. If I were a young and strong man, I would be only too glad to do this work for the good of our state.
and could do it with but very little money to start with.
Dr. Richardson—I have been very much interested in these papers and the discussions. \Vhile they have all been instructive and beneﬁcial, it does not seem to me that any suggestion has reached the bottom of the situa—
tion. What the Harts and Sampsons and Inmans and the rest of the men

can do as individuals, does not beneﬁt the average grower. These gentle-
men haVe found out how to raise or-
anges and how to contend with the natural and unnatural enemies of the industry and meet them successfully.
They represent themselves and per-
haps ﬁve per cent. of the orange grow~
ers outside of themselves in the state of Florida. Let me tell you how the situation is in my own neighborhood,
and I think it is a typical neighbor-
hood. Seventy—ﬁve per cent. of the fruit grown in that neighborhood is neither picked nor packed nor mar-
keted by the grower. The buyer comes in and he hires men to pick it and pack it and ship it. The men that we have to hire to do this work for us are a set of irresponsible men, and if they got their just deserts they would all be hung. I can’t stay to see my oranges packed. I have got reasona-
bly fair prices for my oranges and the men who have bought them have suf-
fered perhaps more than I have. \Vhy do we sell our fruit this way, though?
\Vhy are we compelled to sell it to people who have no interest in his reputation as an honest grower, whose only idea is to sell the fruit at the best possible price? It is simply because of the lack of co-operation; simply from lack of willingness to exercise conﬁdence in our neighbor and fellow man. \Vhen I talk to my neighbor about co-operation for our mutual good, he simply draws into his shell and says, “My business is my own, and your business is your own, and if you will leave mine alone, I won’t bother yours.” Now, we know what is the proper thing to do, but how are we going to get seventy-ﬁve per cent.
of the growers to know what we know and what should be done for their own good? It is bound to come after a while, as Dr. Inman says. It may not come in his time or in my time.
as he has so unkindly intimated that he and his contemporaries are past the
ﬁrst ﬂush of youth; but it is to the gentlemen who are on the platform—
Prof. Rolfs, Dr. Sledd, and the others
—to whom we must look. It has to be done through education. It must be taught to the coming generation:
not only horticultural-and agricultural methods that will be successful. but they must be taught that intelligent co-operation is the only way to make a success of the orange or any other business. We expect you to teach the coming generation how to do this. but we know you can’t do it alone. \Ve cannot get all the orange growers to come into this association, and how can we teach them to pack and ship oranges to get the best results?
Through education. That is the key-
note, and until we educate them up to seeing their own interest and realizing the fact that “united we stand, and divided we fall," we never can expect anything in the way of results. \Vhat does the man coming here from Cleveland or Baltimore or New York care about our success or our reputa-
tion? He wants to get the most he can out of the crop. \Ve have to pay his expenses and. in fact, everything comes back on the grower. The only way to restore Florida’s reputation as the best orange-growing country in the world, is to co-operate with that end in view. Send out men to organ-
ize local organizations, and let the members of these local organizations

obligate themselves to practice meth-
ods that will protect us all. Let us bind ourselves together in organiza-
tions that will hold, and then we will succeed.
Dr. Inman—I also want to tell you that under the California organization the man who produces ten boxes and
'the man who produces a hundred boxes stand on a parity with the largest growers in the association.
This organization is not incorporated for the purpose of making money for itself. It nevertpays dividends. The men who operate the California Fruit Exchange are salaried men. They are employed by the association. I would not advise our people to organize an association here in Florida except on this strictly and purely democratic basis.
As Dr. Richardson has said, we are supporting too many men at too great an extravagance.
Mr. Reaves—I just wanted to ask Mr. Inman to explain a little further.
We had experience down at Sarasota,
some years ago. We had an Orange Growers’ Union in this state then and local unions were organized, one at Sarasota and one at Oneco. I was president of the one at Sarasota and felt so much interest I also attended the meetings at Oneco. The union saw the necessity of properly distrib—
uting the fruit and for that reason they had adopted the fruit exchange as a medium through which to ship.
In order to get the fruit properly dis-
tributed we tried hard to get all the growers to ship through the exchange;
we knew that fruit shipped to com-
mission men was not properly distrib-
uted. One prominent shipper at Oneco said that he had a good-com-
mission man and he was going to ship to him. Another shipper by the name of Marshall hesitated, but ﬁnally joined and shipped through the ex-
change. \Vhen the returns came, the man who had shipped to his commis-
sion man said, “Well, Marshall, how are your returns? Ha, ha; mine are way ahead of yours.” Marshall looked at them and said, “Doggone the Fruit Exchange, the Orange Growers’
Union and the whole business; I am going to ship to commission men af-
ter this.” Commission men are sharp enough, and if they see that things are going against them, they are willing to make a little concession. His com-
mission man saw the point and he used his opportunity to do us up there. Of course, a lot of the men who were ship-
ping through the Exchange could not see through the little scheme and said to themselves, “Well, if the commis-
sion men give so much better returns.
we will ship to them_after this and let the Exchange go.” That one man broke up the whole thing: everybody went back to patronizing the commis-
sion business.
The time has been when commis-
sion men were necessary, but I believe that time is past. We have rapid com-
munication to all points to which we ship, which makes it possible for us to sell if the commission business were out of the way, and I believe if this Horticultural Society would co—op-
crate with the Association in Califor-
nia, we could get a United States law against the commission business. As it is, hundreds of growers may ship to some one point, the market may become glutted and prices correspond-

ingly low. In many cases, we all know it would be cheaper to let the crop stay in the ﬁeld to make fertil-
izer than to ship it.
Dr. Inman—If you people would only be in earnest about forming this organization, we would not have as much to contend with as the Cali-
fornians did. Prof. Powell, in two months, would organize the state of Florida into as solid an organization as that of California, if you would only co-operate with him. There is no question about the commission men buck-
ing hard and trying all their methods and schemes, but they will be very easily overcome if you listen to the advice of men of ability and experience like those in California. They have driven the commission men out of busi-
ness out there. There would be no trouble to get these men of ability;
the trouble is to determine deﬁnitely and positively what we want. I don’t want you or ask you to take my in-
vestigation of the matter. Send some men out there to see for themselves and make you a report. The fruit ex—
change is composed of such men as Dr. Richardson, Mr. Boardman, Mr.
Skinner, Mr. Hart and all you other gentlemen whose names I do not know.
Mr. Sampson—Don’t you think we needit particularly this year? What price do you expect the buyers are go-
ing to offer for fruit if there is not some better methods of packing? I think one great need is to standardize the packing.
Dr. Inman—So do I. I don’t think it would take very long to organize if we can strike while the iron is hot.

year that we are going to have a good fruit market and that we are going to get our money for the crop with the least possible expense.

AFTERNOON SESSION.
Professor Rolfs—“le had this morn-
ing a little talk about packing and shipping oranges, and Dr. Inman and some others cited the methods that were employed in California in pre-
paring the fruit for market and ship—
ping the oranges. It was suggested that you, Mr. Tenny, be requested to give us a little talk about the organ-
ization out there.
Mr. Tenny—I will not talk long now, since the society asked me to give a paper this evening on a some-
what similar subject and as this will require nearly an hour I do not wish to weary you this afternoon. The Doctor has possibly given you an im-
pression that the organization that has been known up to a couple of years ago as the So. California Fruit Grow-
ers’ Exchange, now known as the California Fruit Growers’ Exchange is a pretty large affair. This year they are shipping approximately sixty per cent. of all the oranges and lemons from Southern California. This great organization did not come into being It has been a growth. Its beginnings were back about 1895. The organization grew out ‘of the fact that it was realized that the citrus growers were not in-
dependent of each other, but depend-
ent. especially as to marketing of their fruit, with regard both to a systematic distribution of the fruit over the ship-

ping season and to the geographical distribution. The Exchange has grown steadily from 1895 when it handled about one—third of the crop until the present time when its shipments amount to something like sixty per cent. No better account of the work-
ings of the exchange can be given than is found in Bulletin 123, recently pub-
lished by the Bureau of Plant Indus-
try, Department of Agriculture. which says, “Among the co-operative organ-
izations, the California Fruit Grow-
ers’ Exchange packs and sells through its own district agents in the markets somewhat more than ﬁfty per cent. of the entire citrus crop. This organiza-
tion is formed to regulate the distrib-
ution of citrus fruits throughout the country and to give to its members the beneﬁts that arise from its co—
operative efforts of various kinds.
This Exchange represents about 4,000
growers, who are organized into more than eighty local incorporated associa-
tions, the primary function of which is to prepare the fruit for market. The associations in the different producing regions combine into one or more local incorporated district exchanges or selling agencies. which sell the fruit through the district agents or at pub-
lic auction and receive the money therefor through the medium of the California Fruit Growers’ Exchange.
There are thirteen of these district ex-
changes. Each local district exchange selects a representative to act for it on the board of directors of the California Fruit Growers’ Exchange, which is an incorporated body acting as an agency or clearing house for the district ex-
changes in the marketing of their fruit and which operates for the grow-
ers without proﬁt to itself. It takes the fruit of the district exchanges after it is packed, and with their co—opera-
tion and advice places it in the differ-
ent markets of the country, sells it.
collects the proceeds, and turns them over to the district exchanges, which in turn pay the growers through the local associations. The California Fruit Growers’ Exchange is the agency through which the grower is able to control the larger business problems and the general policy of the handling and marketing of the citrus-
fruit crop.”
This description gives you a good idea of the management of the gen-
eral exchange; but you may be inter-
ested in a more detailed account of the relations of an individual grower to the Exchange and the way his fruit is handled. A group of men, possibly one hundred or it may be a much larger number. living in a certain 10-
cality form an association. They build a packing house and elect a general manager, who has the running of the house. The shipping season is divided into periods varying in length from two to six weeks, and these periods are known as pools. As the fruit of the individual grower comes into the house it is usually weighed; at the time of packing, this fruit is put into the several grades and each grade is weighed automatically. A record is kept of the individual loads, and this gives the weight of fruit of each grade.
At the end of the pool the total amount of each grade of fruit shipped from the house is determined and also the selling price of this fruit. In this way, the manager is able to determine what each pound of fruit of each grade

for that pool is worth. He is then able to ﬁgure the amount due to each grower pool. By this method of shipping fruit under brands selected for each grade,
the individual grower loses his iden—
tity as far as the market is concerned,
when the fruit is graded.
Mr. What has been the result?
Mr. Tenny—It has been satisfac-
tory. The fact that the Exchange has grown from handling a small portion of the crop to sixty per cent. shows that it has been successful.
Mr. \Nhat per cent. of Californa is Southern California in the shipping of fruit?
Mr. Tenny—This year the state of California is shipping somewhere in the neighborhood of 30,000 cars of or-
anges and lemons. About 2,000 of these come from north of the Teha-
chapi Range of the Sierra Madre Mountains. The largest plantings are in Tulare County, and these plantings are sufficient so that under favorable conditions 10,000 cars may be ex-
pected. Some co-operative houses are in operation in this section.
Mr. Skinner—Is the exchange still



growing?
Mr. Tenny—Yes.
Mr. \Vhat is done with the other fruit not included in the sixty per cent?
Mr. Tenny—There are several large co-operative houses that are not con-
nected with the California Fruit Grow-
ers’ Exchange. Then there are cer-
tain individuals who ship direct to eastern markets. There is also con-
siderable buying by eastern men who have their fruit packed in private houses.
contributing fruit for that-
Mr. About how much does the cost of maintaining this organization tax the grower? How much per box?
Mr. Tenny—I can’t give you that
ﬁgure, but the tax per box is not large.
Dr. Inman—It is about ﬁve cents a box, if I remember correctly.
Dr. Inman—Are you able to give the ﬁgures showing how much the or-
ganization has been able to save its members by the purchase and trans-
portation of supplies?

Mr. Tenny—No, I cannot give these
ﬁgures either, but I do know that the saving has been very large. They have been able to secure a rate on box ma-
terial that is very satisfactory from the growers’ standpoint.
Mr. Reaves—Do you think it would be possible to have the same organiza-
tion run on the same principles in Florida?
Mr. Tenny—No, I doubt if an asso-
ciation exactly similar to the Califor-
nia exchange could be worked in Flor-
ida. The scattered condition of the orange sections in Florida make it harder to co-operate. The industry in Florida appears to be more in the hands of the packer and the shipper rather than in the hands of the grower. I see no reason, however,
why a co-operative body of ship-
pers or shippers and growers could not be made successful in Flor-
ida. The essential feature would be to have people that are will-
ing to work together. The suc-
cess of such an organization depends very largely on the character of the men who are selected to be at the head. These need to be high-class business men, who. of course, will

have to be secured at a good big salary.
Mr. Does the association dis-
courage the selling of oranges at the packing house, or do they do all the selling through agents in the east?
Mr. Tenny—No oranges except the culls are really sold at the packing house. If a person wishes to buy fruit from any individual packing house,
f. o. b., he can make this purchase through the agent of the exchange.
Of course, in all these matters, the managers of the individual houses are consulted and, to a very large extent,
they determine where their fruit shall be sold.
Dr. Inman—VVhen a person wants to come into the exchange, is it done for the life of a crop or for a series of years? For violating the rules it costs them a penalty of about ﬁfty cents a box. It ceases to be boys’ play.
A man might become dissatisﬁed, but it would make no difference about the marketing of his fruit. The associa-
tion of packers come in, and take his fruit just the same. That is the better way; not to be bothered at all by the individual growers.
Mr. Tenny—As I understand it, any grower may withdraw from the ex-
change house at the end of any fruit season. I would not be sure about this matter, however.
Mr. Grifﬁng—Does the local as-
sociation look after the picking or just the packing of the fruit?
Mr. Tenny—The usual method has been for each individual grower to do his own picking. Recently, however,
we have been doing a good deal of work on the methods of picking and we ﬁnd it much easier to eliminate in-

juries made in the picking when the association does the picking than when it is done by the individual growers.
When the house picks the fruit, it is possible to obtain an efﬁcient foreman,
who properly superintends the pick-
ing.
Mr. \Vhat is the output per day from one of these packing houses?
Mr. Tenny—From one to ten cars.
The average house ships four or ﬁve cars a day.
Dr. Inman—The packing houses are run under perfect discipline. Each man has a certain work to do, and pays strict attention to business. It is just like clock work. There is no racket at all. ‘
Mr. Gritﬁng—Do they have much trouble with labor?
Mr. Tenny—They have all sorts of labor. There are many Japanese,
Chinese, Mexican Greasers and a good many hoboes. Women do a large por-
tion of the packing. The Chinese are also used in the packing houses. but not much in the ﬁelds. The ﬁeld work is done largely by the Japanese, Mexi-
cans and whites.
Dr. Inman—The wrappers were get-
ting 2% cents per box. Some were paying as high as 2%, and it was a rare instance where the limit of three cents was paid for the wrapping.
Mr. Skinner—How many boxes per day will the average packer pack?
Mr. Tenny—'—I have seen packers who would wrap and pack over 100
boxes. A great many wrap and pack from seventy to seventy-ﬁve.
Mr. Hart—My experience has been that the packers will only average about ﬁfty boxes per day. I consider that good work for an average packer.



## p. 65 (#607) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 65
That is about the limit of my pack.
It costs me about four cents a box;
that is an allowance of $2.00 per day for packing. If the packing went up to the average of the California packer it would cost me about $4.00 a day for packing.
Mr. Von Engelken—Is the grower expected to clean his fruit when it is infected with scale or other diseases?
Mr. Tenny—All washing and brush-
ing of the fruit is done in the packing house. Practically all the fruit is run over brushes which clean it of dust.
In case the fruit has to be washed in the packing house, this is charged up extra against that lot of fruit.
Mr. Did the Department have anything to do with the -organization of the exchange?
Mr. Tenny—VVe have had nothing whatever to do with the organization of the exchange and have done no co-
operation with the exchange other than what we have done with in-
dividuals. The fact that the Exchange handles its own fruit and handles such a large quantity of fruit has made it advisable for us to do a large part of our experimental work in their houses. \Ve have shipped much fruit,
however, in cars that have been packed by individual shippers, or in co-operative houses that are not con—
nected with the Exchange.
Dr. Inman—Through what agency was the fruit exchange organized and put into operation?
Mr. Tenny—I cannot give you the details of the organization of the ex-
change.
Mr. Reaves—Does the Exchange use the commission men in any way?
Mr. Tenny—All sales are made

Mr. C. L. Reaves—I located in Ma-
natee county in the vegetable and fruit business in the spring of 1874. I have orange trees that are nearly forty years old from which I shipped the
ﬁrst fruit, and have been shipping fruit from them ever since. \Vhen I settled in Manatee county near the Sarasota Bay in the spring of ’74. I had only $15.00 in money and no prop-
erty at all. Now, I have an orange grove, a little stock farm coming on
(about eighty acres); I have a store and the postofﬁce and my credit is good everywhere except with my wife.
I must tell you about that. At the time I was married, I married a lady down here, there was nobody in the country except cattle men, and they were having very little work done and it was hard to get money in any way.
I gave $11.00 for oranges to get the seed and managed somehow to get rid of the other four dollars, so that I did not have any money. I had a little muzzle loading riﬂe that was almost
‘the only property I possessed. I pawned that to get money for the preacher. My wife had forty dollars and I borrowed money enough from her to pay for the license, and she de-
clares to this day that I have never paid it back. I don’t believe now she would lend me money to buy license to marry any women.
Now. about the vegetable growing and shipping. I have had experience along this line as well as the fruit busi-
ness. I don’t expect to say very much about the growing of it; that would be enough to take up all the time. I would advise anybody who goes into

the vegetable business to ﬁrst try to learn the methods of doing it right.
Now, the shipping is the main thing.
I remember yesterday one gentleman said, in telling about the rules posted in his packing house, that one of them was that his brand must be an honest brand. If you can make your brand an honest brand, you can sell your fruit and vegetables and you don’t need commission men to sell it for you. Now, you know the commission men do not sell direct to the people very much. The commission houses I have seen sell only at wholesale.
About the only good they do you, is to have you dump in your stuff and then they show it for you.
One day I was in Bradentown in company with some of the best fruit and vegetable growers. They were talking about the shipping of to-
matoes. One fellow said, “If I ship my tomatoes, I would like to put up good stock in good shape. If I were selling here, it would not make so much difference.” Another said,
“Well, I don’t know so much about that. I think if I were selling here I would like to put in good stock, be-
cause I would like to build up a good reputation at home.” I listened to these men and was amazed. Not an honest expression. It was simply a question of doing right because it was good policy. Not a single one said he was going to do right because it was right. That is what we should do;
we should make our fruit and vegeta—
bles something that can be depended upon: make it so that when anyone buys from us, they know they are go-
ing to get their money’s worth and they are going to be done by as we would like to be done.
I asked several questions yesterday while we were talking about the Cali-
fornia Fruit Exchange, with a view of
ﬁnding out their methods. I learned that sometimes' this Fruit Exchange sells the fruit at auction where it is an auction town, but if not, they sent a man all the way from California to sell the fruit, which is expensive. Not only that, but when they send a man they have to trust that man to some extent, just as we have to trust com-
mission men. I noticed some time ago that there was a man in the United StatesTreasury Department who had grown old in the service, having been there since he was a young man, and had established a reputation for h0n~
esty. In some way, he got into a little tight place and there was a $1,000.00
bill missing out of the Treasury. One man came very near paying the amount back because the suspicion was directed to him. A lady learned the truth about it, and the guilty man
ﬁnally acknowledged having taken it.
What we need to do, is to arrange it some way so that we will not have to trust anybody only just as far as busi-
ness methods go. It is asking too much to found an Exchange and put men in charge and ﬁnd some among them who will not work to their own advantage. There is bound to be graft in any organization, and we will have to pay for it.
In Manatee county we have men who for years have been buying,
packing and shipping fruit and vegeta-
bles. The rule in their packing houses is “Honesty.” They have built

up a reputation for honesty. They use the wires, which is less expensive than sending a man. They get a man to buy, and when the man sends an order they ship the car and send a sight.draft on the man’s bank, with the bill of lading attached. If the man who gave the order will honor that draft, the fruit is his, but if he won’t honor the draft, he can’t get the fruit.
The shipper is notiﬁed by wire and he at once places the fruit with some other man. They sell it right from Manatee county, and they get their money, too.
I have had considerable experience along that line. Some years I sold everything, some years have shipped to commission men, and the years I have sold are the years I made the money. I have known some men to get rich in a year sending to commis-
sion men, but, as a rule, they have come outat the little end of the horn.
In many cases, they use rented land,
pay rent, pay for fertilizer and pay for labor; then after they have a crop they ship it hundreds of miles away to a man they know nothing about and say to him. “Take my stuff and do just what you please with it. Send me some money if you can.”
Last fall, one of the best tomato pro-
ducing men in that part of the country,
who had as good land as there is, de-
cided to raise a little crop. The weather was dry, and we didn’t raise very much, fortunately. We got about 400 boxes and they were care-
fully put up and carefully selected,
and vegetables were quoted pretty high. \Ve shipped to several commis-
sion men and they all said, “Your fruit came in bad condition;” or this, that and the other; and after shipping about four hundred crates, we had to foot the bills, but the returns we re-
ceived’were just a little more than enough to pay for the crate material.
It would have been better for me to to have let those tomatoes rot in the
ﬁeld.
The question with us is, whether the commission man is a necessity at the present time. I think the time has been when he was. One man said yester-
day, “I think it is necessary to have the commission man to buy the fruit.”
Now, if that is the commission busi-
ness, I am in favor of it; but what I understand to be the commission busi-
ness is for a man to sit up and ask the people to send him goods on the con-
signment plan, and if you send them to him he shows them to the public,
sells them if he can, takes his com-
mission out, and sends you the rest,
if there is any. If he does not sell it,
he loses nothing, but you do.
I believe the commission man hin-
ders our business. For instance. you want to buy fruit in one of the cities and you invest in a car of it. You buy from a commission house and they don’t know and you don't know what is going to be dumped in within the next few hours. You pay your money and in a few hours perhaps a dozen cars of fruit come in, and what are you going to do? You have spent your money and the fruit is on your hands and perhaps no market for it.
The commission man is going to put you out of business if he can.
\Ve buy goods frequently from the manufacturer instead of the middle man. and why cannot the people buy direct from the grower instead of

through a commission man, who is going to get a proﬁt from both sides?
Down where I am, there used to be a, large number of alligators. All we knew how to do with the alligator skins was to buy them and ship them to commission men. Of course. freight would be so much, commission so much, available portions of the skin so much, and we never could tell just what we were going to get for them.
Now we don’t have to do this. I have here a letter from a certain ﬁrm who are getting alligator skins direct from the merchants. They guarantee us‘a certain price for a given length of skins.
I think that nine-tenths of the fruit and vegetable growers patronize the commission business; perhaps even a larger percentage. The Bible says,
“Lead us not into temptation.” This commission business will lead us to do wrong. and it certainly leads the com-
mission man into temptation. I have known many a commission man who had enough consignments in one sea-
son to set him up in business. And,
as I have said all along, though the time may have been when the com-
mission man was necessary, that time is past. and it is up to us to discover some way that we can get along with-
out dealing with him.
One man sent well-gotten-up letters and quotations to‘all the growers in South Florida and offered the ship-
ping agent at Sarasota a large per-

centage of his commission to solicit consignments for him. A lot of our most intelligent shippers sent oranges to him. He sent quick returns and large checks, which caused us to think that he was all right and we shipped him more oranges, but his checks Mr. Mont-
gomery, of Palmetto, Fla., let one of his checks go to' protest and employed a lawyer in the city where the com-
mission man was located to try to col-
lect something. but he failed. Then I reported him to the Post Ofﬁce De-
partment for using the mails for fraudulent purposes. His case was presented to the United States Court at Macoana“ but they neglected to subpoena the witnesses to go before the grand jury until the statute of.
limitation was nearly out and then they did not give us time enough. I was the only witness that got there in time and they said that one witness was not enough and that the time was too near out for them to subpoena us again on that complaint, but that he had been reported later by a man near Jacksonville, which would give us an-
other chance. The next time, my sub-
poena got to my postofﬁce the day that I was to be in Macon. I sent them a telegram at once that I would be there and took the ﬁrst train, but when I got there the grand jury had ad-
journed. so the whole thing was lost and nothing accomplished.

Is Decay of Oranges in Transit Necessary?
By Lloyd S. Tenny,
(Pomologist, U. S Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The ultimate end of commercial fruit growing is to make money. With a very limited supply and a large demand for any particular fruit, no difﬁculty is found in realizing this end. This has been true in the citrus industry. But with the growth of refrigeration and the extension of the railroads, production has increased,
and the tendency is for proﬁts to dimin-
ish. There comes a time ﬁnally when the minutest details must be looked after in order that the proﬁts may be large enough to keep the industry alive.
In 1894 when Florida reached high water mark in citrus production, South—
ern California was shipping annually less than two million boxes of oranges and lemons. The Tulare district in Cali-
fornia was then unplanted. Shipments from Cuba and Porto Rico were so few as to inﬂuence but little the market con-
ditions. Then came the' freeze and F lor-
ida was practically eliminated for the time being as a large producing state.
Fourteen years have passed and once again Florida looks forward to a rec-
ord-breaking crop. During these years,
however, great changes have been made in the orange producing sections. South-
ern California is, this year, shipping nearly or quite 30 thousand cars or over II million boxes of oranges and lemons.
Tulare county has now an annual pro-
duction of about two thousand cars; new plantings have been made which, under favorable condition, may increase the production in that section to IO thousand cars, or about four million boxes. Cuba has been pushing forward in its planting,
and while no reliable information is at hand, doubtless between 8 and 10 thou-
sand acres have been planted. Porto Rico, also, has extensive plantings that run up into the thousands of acres. I do not wish to discourage you orange grow-
ers, or to make you think there will be no market for your fruit. With the in-
crease of production, there has come a large increase of demand. Hundreds of small towns over the country that now have oranges in their stores throughout the season scarcely saw a box of the fruit in 1894. The quantity eaten in the large cities has also been very largely increased during these years. It is safe to say that with a proper distribution of the fruit, fair proﬁts might be made by all growers, provided only the fruit could be placed on the market in a sound condi-
tion, and with a feeling in the minds of the buyers that they could hold the fruit ten days or two weeks with only a rea—
sonable amount of decay.
This leads us to ask the question, “Is it necessary to have decay of oranges in transit P” or “What is the length of time that oranges should be expected to keep after being packed P”
Two years ago the Department of Ag-

riculture at Washington began the study of conditions in this State to see if these questions could be answered. Previous to that time considerable work had been done in California, and some very deﬁnite results obtained. These have recently been published in Bulletin 123, Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, entitled, The Decay of Or—
anges While in Transit from California,
by G. Harold Powell and several assist-
ants. At the last annual meeting of this society held at St. Petersburg, I had the pleasure of outlining our experiments in Florida and giving the results we had secured up to that time. The investiga-
tion has been continued during the past season and valuable additional data se-
cured.
Brieﬂy stated, the losses from decay of oranges while in transit from Florida amount annually to one-half or three-
quarter million dollars. The principal loss is due to a decay or rot which is pro-
duced by the growth of a mold or fun-
gus within the tissue of the orange. The most common fungus is a species of peni-
cillimn. This trouble cannot be called a disease for sound, healthy fruit is not at-
tacked by the fungus and seldom rots. It seems to be necessary ﬁrst to puncture the rind of the fruit, or to bruise it in some way sufﬁcient to kill the tissue. If now the seed of the fungus are present at this injured place, the ﬁrst step toward decay has been taken and if the temperature and moisture conditions during the fol-
lowing few days are suitable for the de-
velopment of the fungus, the orange is sure to rot. On the other hand, large quantities of fruit have been held experi—
mentally under weather conditions most favorable for the development of decay,
yet when the fruit has been carefully handled and the skin of the orange has been uninjured, there has been practically no loss, even when the spores or seed of the fungus have been purposely placed over the surface of the fruit.
This belief is not a theory or a labora-
tory scheme. In 1905, experiment work conducted in six packing houses in Cali-
fornia, holding the fruit for two weeks under the most trying conditions, fre-
quently in a lemon-curing room, so that often from 50 to 100 per cent. of the in—
jured fruit decayed, yet the average de-
cay for all the sound uninjured lots was only 4.9 per cent. In 1906, the experi-
ments were in I 5 houses and the average decay for the carefully handled fruit was
1.5 per cent. In 1907, the number of houses where work was done was in-
creased to 31 and the average decay for sound fruit was 2.0 per cent. In addi—
tion to these experiments, where the fruit was held in the packing houses, last season 186 cars were shipped from Cal-
ifornia in which there were placed exper-
imental lots of oranges. Under ventila-
tion the sound fruit shipped immediately arrived in New York City with 1.4 per cent decay; under ice with 1.1 per cent.
decay.
While these ﬁgures are for California oranges, yet we are ﬁnding that the same principles hold true in Florida. An or—
ange without a cut or scratch on the skin and which has not been bruised in pick-
ing and packing, almost invariably keeps.
Last season the carefully handled fruit held packed here in the Florida houses for two weeks, contained 2.9 per cent.
decay. This present season the same lots showed 2.1 per cent. waste. This has been the ﬁrst season for any shipping ex-
periments from this State and the results show the very encouraging average of

only 0.4 per cent. rot on arrival at mar-
ket for carefully handled sound fruit.
The work has now been carried far enough so that it seems safe to say that the Florida orange inherently is a good keeper. \Ve can go even farther than this and say that it has been possible to pick, pack and ship the fruit in a way that has practically insured its safe ar-
rival on the market. Judging from the past season’s shipping experiments, it seems safe to say that any large percent-
age of decay in transit is not necessary.
The question then does not seem to be,
“Is it possible for the Florida Orange to carry to market ?” but rather “Is it prac—
ticable to handle the crop in such a way that the carrying quality has not been in-
jured ?” The ﬁrst question seems to be well solved in our investigations and we have now turned our attention to the practicability of careful handling.
THE HANDLING IN THE ORCHARD.
Before there can be good carrying quality, there must be careful work in harvesting the fruit. Under the present conditions, a premium is placed on the amount of work done, rather than on the quality. In handling a tender perishable product, it is false economy to reduce the cost of an operation at the expense of the keeping quality. A laborer picking 75
boxes of oranges per day at ﬁve cents a box and injuring a quarter or more of it,
and dropping the oranges several feet into his picking bag 0r box, is far more expensive than the one who picks 30
boxes for $3.00 a day, but who does his work carefully.
There are three points that need care-
ful attention by the picker. (1) the oranges should not be cut or punctured by the clippers, (2) the stems should be cut short, (3) the fruit should be put in its place by hand and not thrown or dropped.
CLIPPER CUTTING.
The smooth round Florida orange can be cut from the tree with a short stem without injuring the fruit with the clip-
pers more easily than can the California navel, which has a depression around the stem. Notwithstanding this, considerable damage is being done by clipper cutting.
The amount of injury varies widely in different picking gangs.
CHART I.
Percentage of Clipper Cutting by Individual Pickers in One Gang.

2.6 _ 10.0 26.0
3.4 11.0 36.7
Chart I shows the work of the in-
dividual pickers in one gang in Florida.
Of the nine pickers, not more than one or two were doing satisfactory work.
The average for the nine was over 12 per cent. cut fruit. Not all of these injured oranges would decay under ordinary shipping conditions. \Vith conditions fa-
vorable for rot, however, a large percent-
age would go down. As a matter of fact, several boxes of the fruit picked by the two men showing the high percent-
ages of clipper cuts, after being packed fourteen days, contained 21 per cent.
waste, and the beginning of the decay could almost invariably be traced to the injury made by the clippers. Another lot of fruit selected from the more care-
ful pickers and packed and held the same length of time and under the same con‘
ditions had 3 per cent. decay.
The clipper cutting indicated in Chart L is above the average for Florida. In

one small district counts were made at one time in four different orchards, with the following percentages of clipper cuts.
1.4 per cent., 1.6 per cent., 3.8 per cent.,
and 10.4 per cent. It is rather sugges-
tive that of these, the ﬁrst gang was paid by the day, while the last one was on box work. ‘In another orchard two men were working together. Two boxes of fruit from each were examined. The
ﬁrst picker had cut but four oranges,
while his companion had literally slaugh-
tered 65,
In another place, the average injury done on a ranch, where the owner had everything under his direct control was slightly over 6 per cent. At a nearby packing house where the owner pur—
chased all his fruit and had his picking done under the supervision of a fore-
man, the total injury found at one in-
spection was only 1.6 per cent. The dif—
ference lay in that on the ﬁrst place the pickers worked largely by themselves,
without proper instruction and inspection.
The second foreman had been trained by us to watch for injury and had person-
ally instructed each picker and inspected his work, until almost uniformly good work was done.
INJURIES OTHER THAN' THOSE MADE BY CLIPPERS.
It is not necessary that the injury be made with the clippers in order to cause the fruit to decay. Any other abrasion through which the seed of the fungus can enter the fruit does the same dam-
age. Frequently there are found or-
anges in the b0x that have been thorn punctured, scratched on the branches of the tree, cut by nails or splinters in the box, or injured by the ﬁnger nails, Many of these are made through carelessness and haste on the part of the picker and therefore vary with individual pickers.
The amount of thorn puncturing done while the fruit is still on the tree is sur-
prisingly small or at least the decay which results from such puncturing is small. After a heavy wind decaying or-
anges may frequently be seen hanging on the trees. If the fruit is picked soon after such a storm, some punctured oranges are found. But more damage is done by “thorning” as the pickers pull the fruit from among the branches. In the gang referred to a short time ago as hav-
ing a careful foreman 3 per cent. of the fruit had body bruises. In the different boxes there were all the way from 2 to
8 injured oranges. The fruit from four other pickers in another locality showed the following high percentages of body injuries, 7.6 per cent., 15 per cent., 22.4
per cent., and 23.6 per cent. Add to these injuries two or three oranges per box cut by the ﬁnger nails, and another two or three and frequently more bruised by nails or splinters in the box. A large amount of damage is possible therefore,
before the fruit has left the grove on its journey to the market.
LONG STEMS.
Considerable emphasis in the past has been placed by orchard men on having the fruit cut with the stems short. It has been realized that an orange with a long sharp stem was capable of doing much damage. The long stem in itself causes no trouble; it is only when the stem has been brought into contact with another fruit and the rind punctured that damage is done. The amoun’. of injury,
therefore, depends largely on the extent and the nature of the handling of the fruit after picking. More puncturing is done if the fruit is dropped 18 inches or

two feet into the picking bag and then for an equal distance into the box, than would be if it were possible to lay the or-
anges carefully into the bag and box.
A long haul over a rough road with a considerable number of oranges with long stems in boxes will do plenty of damage.
It is not necessary to have much shaking of the fruit in the box in order to do puncturing, for the ﬁeld crate used almost universally in Florida is so large that the weight of the fruit in the box is sufficient to force a sharp stem through the peel-
ing of an adjacent orange near the bot:
tom of the crate.
The number of long stems left by dif-
ferent pickers varies largely. Some pick-
ers work steadily without leaving scarcely a long stem. Others cut practically all the stems too long. The following ﬁg-
ures show the percentages left by differ-
ent individuals, 5.9 per cent., 14 per cent.,
18.8 per cent., 8.7 per cent., 15 per cent., 7 per cent., 14.1 per cent., 0.7 per cent., and none. The following are av-
erages for gangs: 2.9 per cent., 2.3 per cent., 16.1 per cent., I per cent., 9.7 per cent.
As in the case with the clipper cutting,
when the attention of the picker is called to the number of long stems he is leaving and when he knows his fruit is being inspected the number cut incorrectly gen-
erally decreases,
CAREFUL HANDLING.
The third point in connection with good picking has to do with careful handling. There is nothing in connec—
tion with the citrus business of Florida that impresses a person accustomed to handling different fruits than the rough-
ness with which the oranges are treated.
To see the fruit dropped several feet into the picking bag or basket as the laborer holds the branches with his left hand and clips the fruit with his right, starting it toward the mouth of the basket at a lively speed with his clipper, one would think an imperishable product was being handled instead of a very delicate living fruit. \Vhen the picking basket is full,
the fruit takes another severe fall into the ﬁeld crate, and the usual method of locating the gang in the orchard is.to lis-
ten a moment for the rattle of the or-
anges in the box. I need not call your at_
tention to all the places in harvesting and packing the crop where rough handling is practiced. If anyone doubts the state-
ment that a large percentage of the fruit falls somewhere at least 18 or 20 inches,
a trip with this in mind through his own grove and packing house will probably satisfy him about the matter. At least such a trip through his neighbor’s grove will convince him. On his journey let him stop for a moment at the side of the hopper, one of those real large ones,
holding ﬁfty boxes or more, and watch the results. Let him place his hand on one of the fruit, and allow the other or-
anges to hit against it. Just then have him forget that he is watching oranges and imagine that they are apples or per-
haps Georgia peaches. I wonder how successful a shipper of such fruits would be if the handling was as rough as that to which the oranges are subjected. Yet the experiments last year indicated that with oranges dropped once 18 inches one out of every ﬁve would rot within a short time. This year the skin of the fruit seemed rather thicker and tougher and but ten per cent. rotted. But in test affer test where the oranges were dropped 18 inches decay developed where it did not where the fruit was carefully

The sound carefully handled lots were picked under our personal supervision and the fruit was not dropped in any way. It was drawn to the packing houses usually on spring wagons, and packed without any machine handling. The dropped fruit was handled in identically the same manner, except that just before packing each orange was dropped sep-
arately 18 inches on to the ﬂoor of the packing house or into the empty ﬁeld crate. The series indicated by the words
“through machinery” were handled in the grove as the carefully handled lots,
but before packing the' oranges were poured into the empty hoppers and were
- then graded and sized in the usual man-
ner, and generally by the labor in the packing house. In all cases, the hoppers and bins were empty so the maximum amount of injury from the machinery was obtained. For this reason it was not uncommon for our experiments to show greater decay in the fruit carefully picked but run through the empty machinery than we secured in the regular commer-
cial pack which had been picked and packed without any attention on our part. The boxes that made up the “Com-
mercial Pac ” were selected after they had been packed and were taken from the fruit coming from the same orchard in which we had obtained the other experi-
ment boxes. The “Mechanically In-
jured” lots were those in which each orange showed some abrasion. Clipper cuts, box injuries, ﬁnger nail scratches and stem punctures were the most com-
mon.

MARKET STORAGE TESTS.
Aside from the experiments, where the fruit has been held in the packing house,
about ﬁfteen shipping experiments have been made. These lots have gone by ex-
press, freight, and water and have been shipped to Washington. The average length of time in transit has been about
7 days. Upon arrival the fruit was ex-
amined and the percentage of decay noted. The fruit was then repacked and held in a common storage room and re-
examined at the end of one week and again' at the end of two weeks. At that time most of the lots were discarded, yet some boxes of carefully handled fruit'
were held for some time longer.
The results of these shipments showed that all the lots except the injured fruit arrived at market in a fair condition.
Chart V gives the data in detail.

ﬁgure of over IO per cent. The injured fruit shows 38 per cent loss. At the end of the second week the carefully handled series remain still practically sound. All other lots show heavy losses. The com—
mercial pack at that time had nearly one—
ﬁfth waste while over one-half of the in-
jured fruit has decayed.
Among the results shown by this chart there is a conﬁrmation of the belief hel.l by the fruit trade in general that it is not a safe thing to handle Florida oranges for even if there is but little decay on arrival, the fruit will not hold sufficiently long for the retailer to sell his stock.
There is probably no other one thing that has more to do with low prices or small demand for Florida fruit at any time than this. The quality of the fruit is such, and the texture and general ap-
pearance so good, that there should be a healthy demand for your fruit through-
out the season. But as long as the buyer must ﬁgure on losing perhaps one-quar-
ter or even one-half of a box by 'decay,
if it is necessary for him to hold it some days, he cannot afford to handle such fruit if there is on the market a brand which he is sure will hold an equally long time with but a slight amount of waste.
The sound, carefully handled lots shipped this season answer all his requirements.
Is it possible then, to handle your fruit in any better way than is being done at present? Chart VI gives the results of some educational work done among the pickers.

weeks later the total was reduced to 4
per cent. This large reduction was made by a little quiet educational work by showing the different pickers where they were doing had work, and by telling them of the damage this kind of work was do-
ing. This particular lot of pickers was on day pay, so it was easier to work with them than it was with pickers paid by the box. Notwithstanding the better work done, the quantity picked remained about the same and was perfectly satisfactory to the owners. This was in a community where I had been told less than a year be-
fore that it was entirely out of the ques-
tion to pay by the day. Decided improve-
ment may be made, however, with men working by the box. One crowd under a good foreman after some help by us was averaging only about 2 per cent. in-
jury at several inspections.
Those who think it is impossible to handle the fruit with care should visit a large peach ranch in Georgia, where un-
der one general foreman and with col-
ored help, ten cars and more of peaches are shipped in one day, and the fruit is so delicate that a heavy pressure by the
ﬁnger in picking damages the carrying quality.
The outlook, then, is hopeful. Decay
—at least damaging decay—is not neces—
sary. Fruit, sound and carefully han-
dled has been held in the packing houses two weeks with but slight decay. Other lots have been shipped and arrived on the market with almost no loss and have stood the market holding test remarka—
bly well. On the other hand roughly handled and injured fruit should not be expected to keep, and it does not. The methods of harvesting and packing at present in operation are extremely rough and should be expected to produce a poor-
carrying product. Experiments show that this is true. It is not impracticable on the other hand to change these meth-
ods sufﬁciently so that a great improve-
ment in keeping quality may be expected.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—I note in your paper you speak of the oranges going through machinery. To what do you refer?
Mr. Tenny—All the machinery found in the average packing house:
the hopper, the elevator (if there'is one), the sizer and into the bins.
Mr. McClung—How long after the fruit was picked before the dropping of it was done?
Mr. Tenny—\Ve tried it at various times. As a usual thing, within twenty-four hours: almost certainly within thirty-six hours after picking.
Mr. McClung—And you found the same results after the fruit was wilted a little as when perfectly fresh?
Mr. Tenny—Very much the same.
The majority of the dropping that causes damage in the commercial handling is done at the time of pick-
ing, hence most of our experiments were made with fruit that was drop-
ped immediately after picking.
Mr. \Varner—I think it would be a good thing for Mr. Tenny to give us a lecture next year on the methods of packing and shipping oranges from California. using the stereopticon slides so that we can see for ourselves.
I make a motion to that effect; that is, that Mr. Tenny give us an illus-
trated lecture at our meeting next year showing just how these matters are handled by our California brethren.
Motion seconded, put and carried.

Controlling the White Fly by its Natural Enemies—Report of Progress, and Other Observations.
By E. W. Berger,
(Entomologist, Florida Agricultural Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The mills of the investigator grind slowly. \Vhoever makes a business of investigating nature (coaxing as best he.
can her secrets from her) is treading un-
known ground, or ground in regard to which he has only suggestive evidence.
or no evidence at all, as to what he may
ﬁnd. Then also, a great part of his work generally consists in developing new methods as he progresses, although he may be guided by certain general princi-
ples. And then, at the best, his results are generally obtained point by point,
and after long waiting. Thus it is with the whiteﬂy investigations. This matter has been investigated before. Riley and Howard write: 1 “Our ﬁrst acquaintance with the species was in June, 1878, when we found it occurring in profuse abun-
dance on the leaves of the citrus trees in the orangery of this department. Some observations were made upon its life-his-
tory during that summer, and all of its stages were observed. During the fol-
lowing years we observed it in Florida, ~
and it was studied by two of our agents,

tiﬁc name (Aleyrodes citri) by Mr, Ash-
mead2 in 1885. In 1893 Prof. H. A.
Morgan3 published a brief report of his observations upon this insect in Louis—
iana. He states that orange growers be-
lieve that it was brought into Louisiana on plants exhibited at the New Orleans Exposition in 1885. Later on Dr. H. J.

lishing his bulletin on the Sooty Mold of the Orange in 1897. Next came A. L.

upon the ability of 'w-hiteﬁy to survive on detached and partly dried leaves; the varieties or species of whiteﬂy represented in the State which attack citrus seriously,
the amount of honeydew excreted, and a few other points.
METHODS OF INTRODUCING THE FUNGUS PARASITES.
It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the red and yellow Aschersonias can be successfully introduced by spraying their spores (germs) suspended in water on to the under surface of white ﬂy-in-
fested leaves, or by pinning leaves hav-
ing these fungi upon them to the under surface of the leaves of white fly-infested trees. Both methods are also applicable to the cinnamOn and whitefringe fungi.
The spraying method is probably not generally applicable for introducing the brown fungus, and pinning fungus-bear-
ing leaves is therefore recommended.
This fungus has, however, been several times successfully started by spraying a mixture of water and fungus, obtained by agitating fungus-bearing leaves with water. A better way would be to scour the fungus from the leaves with a little sand and water. Use one to several leaves to a quart of water and strain the liquid if necessary.
EXPEIMENTS FOR INTRODUCING TIIE FUNGUS PARASITES OF VVIIITEFLY LARVAE.
Actual experiments and observations in the ﬁeld have again demonstrated that the period of summer rains is a most fa-
vorable time in which to introduce the several fungus parasites of whitetly lar-
vae. Introductions of the red and yel-
low fungi made during October and No-
vember were successful only to the extent of getting a small start of fungus, but were sufﬁcient to insure a good spread of the same during the following summer.
T hus, sprayings with spores of the red fungus in the R. S. Sheldon Grove at New Smyrna, on October 3, 1906, de-
veloped but a few pustules of the red by the ﬁrst of December of the same year,
and no more by the ﬁrst week of May,
1907. The fungus spread, however, dur-
ing the summer of 1907, so that by the fall of that year the trees sprayed had the foliage of many small branches lit-
erally clotted over with the red pustules,
besides which the fungus had spread to perhaps all of the trees of the grove not sprayed with spores. This fungus will,
no doubt, quite control the “ﬂy” in this grove during the coming summer, and from there will spread over all the white-
ﬂv-infested citrus trees of New Smyrna.
Why sprayings with spores of the red and yellow Aschersonias (fungi) made in the Ronnock groves at New Smyrna, at the same time (October 3, 1906), failed to produce a start of fungus can only be surmised; it may have been due to a more arid condition in these groves at that time, but more probably to poi-
soning of the spores by the use of an old spraying outﬁt previously used for spray-
ing Bordeaux mixture. There being much less “ﬂy” in these groves, of course,
also lessened the chances of getting a start,
Sprayings with fungus spores made in the F. W. Edison grove at New Smyrna,
on November 29, 1907, have given a promising start of red Ascheronia [trees examined April 23, 1908]: but other trees sprayed with spores at the same time in New Smyrna (some in the Ronnoc groves) show but a very poor start of

either the red or yellow Aschersonia after a period of ﬁve months (November 29,
1907, to April 23, 1908). Again, spore-
spraying operations in some trees-of" Mr.
B. F. Hampton’s grove near Gainesville,
made on October 6 and November 16,
1907, resulted in promising starts of both the red and yellow Aschersonias.
Spores of the red and yellow Ascher-
sonias, together with some brown fun-
gus material, scoured from the leaves with a little sand and water, were sprayed into some citrus trees at DeLand on january 17, 1908. Examination of the trees on April 20, 1908, revealed no certain growths of fungus. Introduc-
tions of the red Aschersonia made into thirteen trees on April 21 and 22, 1908,
at the same place, by the spore-spraying method have produced an excellent growth of this fungus [trees examined june 17, 1908 and paper revised to this date]. In two trees, Mr. H. B. Stevens and the writer estimated that from 30
to 40 per cent. of the white fly larvae had become infected by the fungus and were dead. In two other trees the writer estimates [estimate was based on actual counts made upon leaves] that at least
50 per cent. were dead. Fungus intro-
duced into two other trees by the leaf-
pinning method resulted in only very poor growths of fungus; the growths of fungus produced by the spore-spraying method are estimated at from several hundred to perhaps a thousand times as great as those produced by the leaf-pin-
ning method in the two trees referred to.
At the time of introducing the fungus the spring brood of adult “flies” had about disappeared and larvae of the ﬁrst,
second and third stages were in abun-
dance beneath the leaves. These spray-
ing and leaf-pinning operations at De-
Land on April 21 and 2-2 are regarded as of great signiﬁcance; because they indi~
cate so clearly that the best time in which to introduce the red Aschersonia by the spore-spraying method is when young larvae are abundant. It appears that young larvae are more easily infected than the older ones of the fourth stage and pupae. The fact that rains immedi-
ately followed or preceded the operations may also be of signiﬁcance; the moisture favoring the germination of the spores.
The comparatively very poor growths of fungus produced in the two trees into which leaves only had been pinned, are believed to indicate that the presence of an abundance of adult “ﬂies” is necessary in order to obtain good growths of fun—
gus by this method. [See: The Whiteﬂy SPreads the Fungi] \Vhat has been stated here for the red Aschersonia is also believed to hold good for the yellow Aschersonia; both are very similar in all their characters except color. The same principles, with one or two exceptions,
probably apply to all the fungus parasites of the whiteﬁy larvae.
The experiments enumerated demon-
strate quite clearly that the red and yel-
low Aschersonias can be introduced in whiteﬂy-infested trees during the fall months with fairly good success by the spore-spraying method, but leave us in doubt if we may ever be able to success-
fully introduce them during the winter and early spring months. Some other sprayings made at Gainesville with the red and yellow Aschersonias and the brown fungus during january and March indicate more clearly, however,
that this may be impossible since not a single growth of fungus has so far re-
sulted from any of these sprayings. The absence of the easily infected young lar-

vae at this time is believed to be the ex-
planation. If the absence of young lar-
vae is the explanation for the failures during January and March, this barren period is believed to also include Decem-
ber and February, since in neither one of those two months are there any but but a few [in December] young larvae.
In other words, the barren period for introducing fungus will extend from De-
cember through March or until the young larvae of the spring brood of adults become abundant either in late March or in April. If larvae of the fourth stage and pupae are practically immune to the attacks of fungus as the January and March experiments indicate,
then we may expect another barren period of a few weeks immediately preceding the appearance of the second brood of adult “flies” sometime in June or some-
times earlier. Preceding the appearance of the third brood of adults, there may also be a barren period, when the white-
ﬂy is in the fourth stage and pupae; but generally the separation of the second and third broods is not so well deﬁned;
larvae of all stages continuing to exist during the interval of the greatest abun-
dance of adults. Some few trees in Mr.
\Vm. E. Heathcote’s grove at St. Peters-
burg were sprayed on May 17, 1907,
with spores of the red Aschersonia A good growth of this fungus had devel-
oped from this spraying by the end of last summer, although in the beginning only a few fungus pustules could be found. This experiment clearly indicates that we can begin operations in May;
and earlier as the DeLand experiments of April 21 and 22 have shown us. Better stated, the time to begin to introduce fungus in spring is when the young lar-
vae of the spring brood of adult “ﬂies”
are becoming abundant (that is by the dozen) beneath the leaves.
Operations were begun last spring in
1\er Heathcote’s grove for the main pur-
pose of demonstrating what can be done in one season with the spore-spraying and leaf-pinning methods of introducing the fungi. The frost of the previous December together with the prevailing drought having defoliated so many citrus trees in sections where fungus had been abundant, that only small quantities of fungus could be obtained. However,
continued efforts on the part of Mr.
Heathcote, together with some supplies of fungus and aid from the writer, re-
sulted in giving a wholesome sprinkling of the fungi, especially the red Ascher-
sonia, together with some yellow Ascher-
sonia and brown fungus, by the end of
1907. Mr, Heathcote has recently writ-
ten, stating that the fungus does not ap-
pear to be as abundant in his grove this spring as it was last winter. This is quite what I expected, since it spreads but little if at all during the winter, and of course what has previously developed becomes weathered; besides some leaves drop, thus reducing the amount of fun-
gus present in the trees.
It would be consuming an unnecessary amount of time were I to undertake to say something about all the experiments that I have started in different parts of the State. Sufﬁce it to say that I have Started spore-spraying and leaf-pinning operations for introducing fungus in the following places: Lake City, Leesburg,
New Smyrna, Kissimmee, St. Petersburg,
DeLand and Gainesville, in all seven 10-
calities. Taking a single grove or yard in which trees were treated in these sev-
eral localities as the unit and also count-
ing as separate experiments the differ-

ent times at which operations were be-
gun in the same grove or yard, we have in all something like forty or ﬁfty exper-
iments made by the writer for introduc-
ing the fungi parasites of the white ﬂy during the past two years.
TWO OTHER FUNGUS PARASITES.
Since appearing before you a year ago,
two other fungus parasites of the white-
ﬂy larvae have been discovered in Flor-
ida. These are described by Professor H. S. Fawcett in Press Bulletins 68 and
76, Florida Agricultural Experiment Station, and are the whitefringe fungus
(Mic-rocera sp.) and the cinnamon fun-
gus (Verticillium. heterocladum) re-
spectively. The whitefringe fungus has been observed mainly at Sutherland, but specimens have been sent in from other parts of the State; so that it appears to be quite widely distributed. The cinna-
mon fungus has hitherto been mistaken for the brown fungus, and is probably as widely distributed as the latter, though not so abundantly. Both of these fungi being new discoveries, we are not pre-
pared to make speciﬁc recommendations as to their efﬁciency in reducing the whiteﬂy or as to the best methods for in-
troducing them. Professor F awcett, who has so far done about all of the work on the whitefringe and cinnamon fungi, suc-
ceeded in starting both of these upon whiteﬁy larvae by spraying the spores of the fungi suspended in water. The cin—
namon fungus has also been started by pinning leaves, and this method, no doubt is applicable to the whitefringe fungus.
SIX KNOWN' FUNGI PARASITES.
Following is a list of the six known fungus parasites of whiteﬁy larvae given in their order of discovery in Florida:
Red Aschersonia- (Aschersonia aleyro-
dis Webber) 1893.
Brown Fungus
1896.
Red-headed Scale Fungus (Sphaeros-
tilbe coccophila Tul.) 1903 [P]
Yellow Aschersonia (Aschersonia_
flavo-citrina P. Henn.) 1906. _
VVhiItefringe Fungus (Microcera sp.)
1907.
Cinnamon Fungus (V erticillium hete-
rocladmn. Pensig) 1907.
The red-headed scale fungus has been observed upon white ﬂy larvae only a few times and cannot be said to be of much signiﬁcance in its relation to this insect.
It is, however, a most efﬁcient fungus parasite of scale insects in nearly every part of the State.
The following table gives the present distribution in Florida 0f the six fungus parasites of white ﬂy larvae: R, Red Aschersonia; Y , Yellow Aschersonia; B,
Brown Fungus; W, VVhitefringe Fun—
gus; C, Cinnamon Fungus; S, Red-
headed Scale Fungus:

THE \VHITEFLY SPREADS THE FUNGI.
Observations made during the past year indicate that the whiteﬁy itself is instrumental in distributing the fungi after once they have been started in a tree or grove. The adults, as they walk over the leaves, no doubt get many of the fungus spores attached to their feet,
and as they ﬂy away to other trees de-
posit them upon whiteﬂy larvae; thus un-
knowingly carrying disease with them.
Other insects, such as ants, and ordinary
ﬂies and beetles, may also be instrumen-
tal in disseminating the fungi. This probably accounts for the fact that pin-
ning fungus—bearing leaves has not re-
sulted in much success in starting the fungi during the cool and dry periods of the year, or when few or no adult whiteﬂies were about. It is therefore advised only to use the leaf-pinning

method for introducing the fungi during the period of summer rains or at other periods when abundant whiteﬂies are in the trees. Most excellent results have been obtained with the red and yellow Aschersonias by pinning fungus-bearing leaves during June, july and August.
The spore—spraying method can be used at any time, but it will probably be difﬁ-
cult to start fungus in winter and early spring by any method. There are indi-
cations that larvae of the fourth stage and pupae (in which two stages the “ﬂy”
exists from about December until March and April) are not readily, if at all, in-
fected with fungus.
PLAN OF CAM PAIGN‘.
The writer’s plan of campaign, based upon experiments in the ﬁeld, is as fol-
lows :—If a grove is thoroughly infested with whiteﬁy, and sufﬁcient “seed-fun-
gus” is available, introduce fungus into all the trees; but if the supply of seed-
fungus is limited, distribute it here and there thrOughout the grove, so that there will be a great many centers of infection from which the fungus can spread. It may be considered advisable to treat only a few trees in each row with fungus, and it may only be possible to treat some branches of each of these trees; but any scheme of distribution that will give the fungi a good chance to spread to all parts of a grove will sufﬁce. Later on, when more seed-fungus is available, the trees or parts of trees not previously treated may be attended to. A second, and even a third or fourth treatment may be given to the trees in order to get the quickest possible dissemination of fungus. So long as only a few fungus pustules are visible on those leaves of a tree which bear the most fungus, it will be advisable to introduce more fungus, especially should an abundance of seed-fungus be readily available. The greater the amount of fungus growth which is successfully started in a grove by artiﬁcial means, the more rapid will be the destruction of the whiteﬁy. \Vhite-
flies have the habit of congregating on water-sprouts and other tender growth of citrus, consequently we should give particular attention to introducing the fungi into such parts of the trees. The work should be done methodically and not in a haphazard way.
The plan of campaign for a grove just becoming infested with whiteﬂy; or only infested in part, would be to introduce fungus into all those trees sufficiently in-
fested (that is, whiteﬂy by the dozen on the leaves), and later on into other trees as soon as they become sufﬁciently infested. Incidentally, the trees should be fertilized a little more heavily.
“Seed-fungus" becomes abundant about midsummer and lasts until midwin-
ter and later, although some can gener-
ally be obtained somewhere at all times.
The best weather conditions for intro-
ducing fungus are met with from about June to the end of August. Since the period of summer rains is also the time when “seed-fungus" is abundant it is about the best time in which to introduce fungus. It is advisable, however, to in—
troduce fungus at other times when “seed-
fungus” is available, using onlv the spore-
spraying method when young larvae are abundant and adults not plentiful but employing either one of the two methods (spore-spraying or leaf-
pinning) during the warmer months, or when adult “ﬂies” are swarming abun-
dantly about the trees. It will, of course,
be evident from a perusal of the preced-
ing pages that it would probably be use-
less to try to introduce fungus from

vae become abundant immediately follow-
ing the ﬁrst brood of adults in spring.
It is best to use fresh fungus, although the writer has succeeded (during the rainy season) with fungus that had been collected and dried for a month.

0TH ER OBSERVATIO NS.
IVhiteﬂy Matures on Dead Leaves.—
On November 20 and 21, 1907, Mr. R. Y.
\Vinters, Assistant in Botany, and the writer made a very careful inspection of some of the trees at DeLand that had been defoliated the previous February,
but in which the whiteﬂy had reappeared during the summer. Careful inspection of the vegetation in the neighborhood of the infested trees revealed no plants infested with whitefly which could have acted as carriers during the period of defoliation of the citrus. (It does not necessarily follow, however, that such carriers did not exist.) But whiteﬁy in abundance existed in the citrus and Cape jasmine that had been defoliated the previous February. Where had it come from? The writer ﬁnally decided to carefully examine the dead leaves accum-
ulated under a certain Cape jasmine, es-
pecially any that had collected in small hollows near the trunk. Something like several peeks of such leaves were exam-
ined by Mr. \Vinters and the writer with the result that well matured larvae and pupae, apparently healthy and alive,
were found on some leaves that were dead and brown, but had either retained or been supplied with enough moisture to keep them ﬂexible. Finally, the writer found an adult specimen about half emerged from the pupa case on such a leaf. The specimen appeared fresh but inactive, and with a little effort was freed from its case and found to be un-
doubtedly alive, since it could move its legs and feelers.
In the afternoon Mr. \Vinters went to carefully inspect the fallen leaves of cer—
tain citrus trees. with similar results.
Seemingly live and healthy pupae were found upon dead and dried leaves gen-
erally with enough moisture; however. to remain ﬂexible. Some of these leaves were taken to the laboratory at the Ex-
periment Station by Mr. \Vinters, and after a few days, live adults were found moving about under the bell jar. Two days later the writer found apparently live specimens of pupae on a few partly dried and curled leaves of citrus in an-
other yard at DeLand. On january I7,
some of the fallen leaves under the Cape jasmine above referred to were again ex-
amined, when semi-dried leaves with plump, live larvae were found, also a pupa on a leaf that was dried and brown.
It was further observed on the Cape jas-
mine in question, and on two citrus trees
(all of which had been defoliated in the preceding February) that the greater number of whiteﬂy larvae were low down in the trees (about the lower third) and also that the empty pupae cases of pre-
ceding brood were on the lower leaves of the trees, possibly indicating that the
“ﬂy” came up from the ground.
When at DeLand on January 17 and I8, 1908, I brought back to Gainesville

several small twigs (with leaves) of the Cape jasmine before referred to, and well infested with whiteﬂy. A portion of this material was placed in a small cloth sack and slightly buried at the foot of a large magnolia tree near the Univer—
sity. The magnolia was chosen because no citrus or jasmine was near at hand.
On March 22 live adults were emerging and some of the leaves were still green.
Another portion of this material was placed under a bell jar (with open top and covered with cheese—cloth) on sand in the greenhouse. Live adults were ob-
tained as before at the end of two months and a few of the leaves were still green.
In both experiments, however, the lar-
vae on the leaves which had turned dark or dried, soon died,
These observations leave no doubt in my mind that some whiteﬂy can be car-
ried through the winter on dead, partly dried and browned leaves, scattered un-
der trees, especially when so placed that they do not dry sufﬁciently to crumble,
although some of the leaves examined were quite dry. It was not possible to know how long these leaves had been in the condition in which we found them,
and whether the larvae there could have matured; for when leaves are allowed to dry in the laboratory all larvae have been observed to die. In regard to the pupae there can be no doubt about their matur-
ing, as one adult at least was caught in the act of emerging from its case while others developed into adults when taken to the laboratory, as previously stated.
It is estimated that the leaves in question had fallen from the trees two weeks to two months previously, but they may have been older. The experiments with the fresh green jasmine leaves indicate furthermore, that it is possible for such leaves to become buried in the sand or otherwise protected, so that they remain green for at least two months, allowing whiteﬂy larvae to mature upon them in time to infest the early new growth of the trees.
Extermination by Defoliation.—The previous observations and experiments indicate pretty clearly why the attempts at exterminating the white ﬂy at DeLand in February, 1907, by defoliating the trees have failed, notwithstanding that precautions were taken to burn all the leaves. Some of the trees had been banked with earth, and as the “ﬂy” ap-
peared in greatest abundance in these trees after the defoliation, this again in-
dicates the possible source of the re-in-
festation, since these banks of earth about the stems of the trees would be ideal places for preserving leaves, as the pre-
viously stated experiments show. That the defoliation of all the trees at De-
Land at the time referred to was never-
theless useful can hardly be doubted,
since it must have been at least equiva-
lent to a season’s spraying or fumiga-
tion in keeping the "ﬂy" in check. The de-
foliation was completed after the partial defoliation by the December freeze of
1906, so that the burden of it was much less. I believe that defoliating whiteﬂy-
infested trees after a partial defoliation by a freeze may frequently be advisable,
but doubt if the wholesale butchery of the trees at Marysville, California, of last year was advisable, and doubt, fur-
thermore, if they will be successful in exterminating the white ﬂy there unless they keep up the extreme vigilance now exercised for at least ﬁve or six years.
No doubt the growers at Marysville, Cal-
ifornia, would have done better to have checked the “ﬂy” as best they could dur-

ing last summer by spraying or fumigat-
ing, and then in winter have undertaken to exterminate it by fumigation in the citrus trees, and by destroying all of its other food plants possible. The injury in winter caused by even large overdoses of hydrocyanic acid gas would have been trivial in comparison to the injury done to the trees by cutting off their large limbs in order to get rid of the leaves.
Honeydew Excreted.—Leaves with an abundance of whiteﬂy larvae were placed between glass plates, and it was found that the honeydew ejected by the insects was deposited in small drops on the glass above or below them, in some instances the liquid being precipitated up-
ward a distance of 1-8 inch or more. Pu-
pae ready to have the adult emerge se-
crete honeydew as well as larvae of all stages. A lot of larvae of perhaps the third and fourth stages of growth ex-
creted at the rate of .0005 gram each in 48
hours. At this rate 1,000,000 larvae (in round numbers) could excrete one pound of honeydew in 48 hours, which would be at the rate of 15 pounds per month or
180 pounds per year. Since no doubt a large percentage of this sweet excretion is sugar (let us assume 50 per cent.,
since we have not had an opportunity to test it or have it tested), at this rate
100 trees of good size on an acre of ground would lose something like 50
barrels of sugar per year, allowing 1,-
000.000 whiteﬂy larvae to a tree. These
50 barrels are the equivalent of 10,000
pounds, or 5 tons; at 5 cents per pound,
this would amount to $500.00. Of course. this is not the actual loss per acre, since carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,
the components of sugar, come from the air; but it does represent an unneces-
sary amount of work that the trees are required to do, granting that they bear a full crop besides, which they probably never do. This great amount of loss of sugar and water, however, does account for the insipid and dry fruit of whiteﬂy-
infested trees, and suggests the necessity of giving the trees an extra allowance of fertilizer and, of course, sufﬁcient wa—
ter.
Two Species—Are there two species of white ﬂy seriously affecting the citrus trees in Florida? The writer has several times observed that the eggs of the white-
ﬂy in certain localities in Florida had a.
different appearance from those in other localities. Last fall and winter, while Prof. H. S. Fawcett and Mr. R. Y. \Vin-
ters were doing some work with the mi-
croscope under the writer’s direction on the whiteﬂy larvae and eggs. our atten-
tion became further directed to a peculiar delicate net-like covering to certain eggs.
After examining material from different localities, I found that only whiteﬂy eggs from certain localities had this cov-
ering, eggs from other localities being perfectly smooth and shiny. A like ex-
amination of eggs of this spring’s brood from the same localities revealed the same differences, together with decided differences in the external structure of the larvae of the ﬁrst stage. At the time of writing this no literature on the whitefly has been found which takes note of differences such as have just been stated,
It istrue that Professor H. A. Morgan-
in his bulletin (previously cited) ﬁgures the reticulated type of egg for the white-
ﬂy in Louisiana in 1893, and in his de-
scription of the egg mentions “a ﬁlm-like covering arranged in hexagons—;” but it is evident that he was not aware of the existence of two types of eggs represents

ing two species of whitefly seriously affecting citrus. Professor Morgan gives the name of the whitefly observed by him in Louisiana (bulletin cited) as Aley-
rodes citrifolii, giving for his authority Riley (unpublished manuscript). This is presumably the manuscript which was later published in Insect Life (previously cited), the name of the insect in the meantime being changed to Aleyrodes citri. The description in the article in Insert Life clearly refers to the species with smooth eggs, since it is expressly stated that the eggs are perfectly smooth,
although sometimes pruinose, while the description of the larvae of the ﬁrst stage also agrees with the character of the lar-
vae which hatch from the smooth eggs,
and not with those hatched from the reticulated eggs. At ﬁrst it was thought that either Aleyrodcs aurantii Maskell, A.
Marlatti Quaintance, or A. spinifera Quaintance, reported on citrus from the N. W. Himalaya Mountains, Japan, and Java, respectively, might be the species in question. However, a careful compar-
ison with the descriptions of these species has ruled them out, as well as many other species. The writer is therefore quite satisﬁed that the citrus whiteﬂy of Florida with the reticulated egg is a new species, distinct from the citrus whitefly of Florida with the smooth egg (Aley-
rodes citri); the differences in the eggs alone are considered sufﬁcient to make the distinction. Careful comparisons have also revealed distinct differences be-
tween the pupae and perhaps also be-
tween the adults of the two species as well as between their eggs and newly-
hatched larvae. -
What is the signiﬁcance of this dis-
covery? The species with the reticulated egg is found at Clearwater, Largo and Sutherland on the \Vest Coast, and at Mims, Titusville and Geneva on the East Coast. It also occurs at Orlando and probably in other localities. The species with smooth eggs is at present known to occur at St. Petersburg, Largo, DeLand,
New Smyrna, Gainesville, Manatee County, Apopka, Chiplcy, Leesburg, Bay Ridge, Daytona, jacksonville and other places. One conclusion immediately fol-
lows: that there have been at least two separate introductions of the whitefly into Florida; assuming, which is proba-
ble, that the \vhiteﬂy of Florida is not a native here. It indicates, also, that the whitefly in the upper part of the Sub-
peninsula is not altogether an introduc-
tion from St. Petersburg as is generally believed, but has had its origin in part elsewhere, probably over at Safety Har-
bor. Whence came the “fly” at Safety Harbor cannot at present be told, but it is believed to have infested citrus trees there for many years. On the other hand, the \vhiteﬁy at St. Petersburg, in all probability, has been brought from the Manatee Country. Further research may determine many important points of dif-
ference in the life history, effectiveness of the fungus and other parasites, spray-
ing or fumigation in the control of each species.
[This paper was followed by a dem~
onstration with stereopticon views illus-
trating the eggs and ﬁrst stage larvae of the two species of white ﬂy discussed, to-
gether with views of the fungus, para-
sites, lacewinged flies, and excretion of honeydew]

DISCUSSION.
Dr. Inman—I would like to ask how much~ damage we are likely to do this fungus by spraying with insecticides.
Dr. Berger—That would depend

upon the nature of the insecticide.
Kerosene and soap solution would do very little injury unless you keep the trees sprayed all the time. Of course,
very caustic insecticides and those con-
taining fungicides may do very much harm.
Dr. Inman—Thrip juice,_ which is a solution of arsenic—what about that?
Dr. Berger—I do not know the in-
gredients of thrip juice. I cannot an-
swer deﬁnitely whether the arsenic will do harm or not, but probably not.
I have never seen arsenic recom—
mended as a fungicide.
Mr. Mote—How about the sulphur solution?
Dr. Berger—It may be very injuri—
ous to fungi if used too frequently. Of course, one spraying or dusting of the trees with sulphur will do very little damage, especially if the spraying is not too thorough and applied only to the parts of a tree affected. The Rex lime and sulphur solution is now re-
commended and sold as fungicide.
Mr. How about the resin wash?
Dr. Berger—I imagine it would be injurious, because it is generally quite caustic. but one or two sprayings in winter will probably do little harm to the fungi.
Mr. Henderson—Do you know any-
thing about the Gold Dust solution?
Dr. Berger—If Gold Dust is nothing but powdered soap, as I believe it is,
it will do very little, if any, injury to the fungi.
Mr. Henderson—I also wish to say that I visited thirty or forty orchards in thestate and in every one, but one.
there was scale, somewhere. I intro—
duced the fungus into all the orchards and so far as I know, the scale is dead

in all of them. My experience has shown that the fungi is not only the cheapest but the best remedy for San jose scale and orange scale. I believe that the black fungus is really more effective and stands more hardship and spreads more rapidly than the red.
The application is very simple. You just tie a small piece of wood contain-
ing the fungi to about every tenth tree, and your work is done. It is much less trouble and expense to get the fungi and apply it than it is to spray one time. One man can go over about twenty acres in a day.
Prof. Rolfs—I might say, in open-
ing this discussion, that to use the fungi requires courage and intelli-
gence. I know the results of Mr.
Henderson’s experience must be espe-
cially gratifying to Mr. Hart, since he has been harping on that for ﬁfteen years. It must be gratifying to him to see that a large number of citrus growers are coming around to see that the fungi are of invaluable assistance to them.
Mr. \Varner—I would like to ask whether it is better to combat the rust mite with a spray or dust.
Mr. Skinner—The liquid spray just hits the outside of the tree, but the dust goes into the whole tree, and I think it is more effective. Besides,
liquid spray is so unpleasant to use that ordinary labor will shirk their work to get through quicker. The lime is hard on their hands and faces and gets into their eyes and they don't like to use it.
Mr. Stevens—If you use the dust spray, try sulphur and no lime. It does not increase the scale at all. The liquid spray, in my judgment, injures the

fungi working on the spray, while the dust does not.
Mr. Painter—A good many com-
plaints have come in the same as Mr.
Skinner’s, and one man told me he overcame that by giving his men olive oil with which to rub their faces and hands.
Mr. Longley—I don’t think the sul-
phur solution brings scale. I spray with a sulphur solution and have been for a number of years, and in my case it killed the scale. I never have a scale even on the grapefruit, and we all know that it is a great breeder of scale.
Prof. Rolfs—I will say in connection with this subject that the lime in the dry spray is not necessary for it to be efficacious. It is pretty apt to kill the fungi and let the scale come out.
Mr. Longley—In order to keep the scale down and the rust mite down, I have found that unless you spray thor-
oughly you had better not spray at all.
Consequently, it is necessary almost always to personally supervise it or do it yourself.
THE WHITE FLY INVESTIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
By Dr. A. W. Morrill.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen.-
I spoke to you last year on the subject of fumigation for the White Fly, describ-
ing the methods of procedure and dis-
cussing in a general way the results ob-
tained up to that time. As most of you know, the present investigations of the Department of Agriculture have for their object a thoro study of all phases of the White Fly problem. Such work naturally divides itself into: ﬁrst, studies of life history and habits; second, control by natural enemies, including parasitic in-
sects and fungi, third,‘c0ntrol by spraying or fumigation; fourth, studies of miscel-
laneous factors in their relation to White Fly damage and control.
The early history of the \Vhite Fly is rather obscure and its origin not positively known. The evidence at hand,
however, seems to Show the pest to have been an imported rather than a native species and much support has been given to this theory by its recent discovery in China. The ﬁrst investigation of Citrus pests in Florida was by H. G. Hubbard,
who was doubtless known to many of the present members of this society. As a special agent of the Division of Ento-
mology of the U. S. Department of Agriculture he published in 1885 a valua-
ble report entitled “Insects Affecting the Orange,” based on three years’ work be—
gun in August 1881. In connection with the White Fly, it is interesting to note that at the time of Mr. Hubbard's in-
vestigations this insect gave no promise of developing into a pest, although its

existence in Florida was not unknown to the author. The ﬁrst investigations of the Orange White Fly were made by Riley and Howard, of the Division of Entomology, and the results published in
1893. The scientiﬁc name Aleyrodes citri was given the insect at this time,
and its different stages—egg, larval,
pupal, and adult—were described in de—
tail The subjects of life history and re-
medies were also considered in as thoro a manner as the opportunities for the in-
vestigation permitted. The next in-
vestigations of the Citrus \Vhite Fly were by Dr. H. J. \Vebber, who, as an agent of the Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology, stu'die'd’the problem from the standpoint of the sooty mold which follows the attacks of various honey dew secreting insects. Of those insects‘ the White Fly was recognized as the principal pest and in his bulletin published in 1897
important experimental work with sprays was reported and the two mOSt useful fun-
gus diseases of the ﬂy were carefully de—
scribed and their importance discussed in some detail. Aside from the reports pub—
lished by the Department of Agriculture,
the Florida Experiment Station has pub-
lished two valuable bulletins, in addition to the records of the observations on the White Fly published in annual reports.
Bulletins on this subject have also been published by the California and Louisiana Stations.
The investigation of the \Vhite Fly by the United States Department of Agri-
culture was again taken up in July 1906
as a consequence of the urgent demands for such an investigation from Florida orange growers. Five thousand dollars was appropriated by Congress for this work for the ﬁrst year. ending June 30,
1907, and for the work of the present year $10,000.00 has been available.
These provisions by Congress have per-
mitted extensive experimental work and the detailed results will be published in bulletin form from time to time as con-
clusions are reached concerning the vari-
ous phases of the subject of White Fly control. My purpose at this time is to present a general outline of the scope of the investigations at present in progress,
with a summary of some of the more im-
portant results thus far obtained.
The paper here presented is based on the entire work done in connection with the investigation, including that by the various men associated with the writer during the past two years, more especially Messrs. E. A. Back and \V. W. Yothcrs.
LIFE HISTORY.
In working out any important problem in econOmic entomology a thoro knowl-
edge of the insect concerned is of prime importance. Successful control must take advantage of the more vulnerable periods in the insect’s life history, while on the other 'hand a knowledge of the insect en—
ables us to avoid useless efforts. Studies on the life history of the Citrus \Vhite Fly extending over a period of nearly two years, have reached a point where the most important features are well under-
stood.
During the summer months the eggs hatch in from nine to nineteen days, av-
eraging about eleven or twelve days.
This variation is quite remarkable, inas—
much as eggs deposited upon the same day are subject to this wide range in the duration of the egg stage. The larval stages are even more remarkable in their range of variation. Dr. Back has found that the larvae hatching from eggs de-
posited in July will reach the adult winged

stage in a period varying from a little over four weeks to a period of thirty-ﬁve weeks, the maximum period being more than eight times longer than the min-
imum period. The total periods from the deposition of the egg to the appearance of the adult in these two cases are 41
and 256 days respectively. In other words, eggs of the White Fly deposited by the adult on July 15 may result in a few adult ﬂies as early as Aug. 25, while some of the larvae will winter over and produce adults the following spring as late as the 20th of March. Our observa-
tions show that the adult life under nor-
mal outdoor conditions is about ten or twelve days, altho occasionally an indi—
vidual may live for more than three weeks. 'Egg—laying usually begins within a few hours after the adult females reach maturity and continues usually at the rate of ten or II eggs per day throughout life. As near as we can estimate the av-
erage number of eggs deposited by each adult female under normal conditions is in the vicinity of I00. In exceptional cases, however, individuals have been known to deposit more than twice this number. Previous to these investigations it has been generally considered that adults deposit twenty—ﬁve eggs or less and usually die in the course of three or four days. If this were correct the destruc-
tion of adults would be of slight con-
sequence even tho accomplished incidental to remedial work directed primarily against the larvae and pupae. As it ap-
pears from our studies, however, the de-
struction of an adult even tho it has been depositing eggs for ﬁve days previously.
will probably prevent “the deposition of up-
wards of ﬁfty eggs. This statement should not be considered as advocating the giving of particular attention to the destruction of adults; but only as show-
ing the value of this when it can be ac—
complished in connection with spraying.
The foregoing facts concerning the life history of the \Vhite Fly are simply a brief resume of our records on some of the more important features. A bulletin will soon be prepared, giving full details of these studies and showing their prac-
tical bearing on remedial work.
NATURAL CONTROL.
The subject of natural control is one of more than usual interest in the case of the insect under consideration. Its exposed condition, apparent vulnerability to attack by natural enemies, and the high degree of humidity in the citrus-
growing regions of the Gulf states, favor-
ing the effectiveness of fungus and bac-
terial diseases, all give basis for the hope that complete control by natural enemies will be the eventual conclusion of the
\Vhite Fly problem.
So far the fungus diseases of the ﬂy have been the most useful of the natural enemies; in certain favored sections of Florida, offering assistance to the orange growers amounting in a series of years to about one-third of a complete remedy.
The important problem in this connection is to develop methods whereby thru arti-
ﬁcial means these fungus diseases can be relied upon to give satisfactory control.
The experiments of the agents of the Bureau of Entomology, while extensive.
and useful as adding to our understand-
ing of the nature of these \Vhite Fly enemies, have not thus far contributed anything of value as a satisfactory method of this kind. The introduction into groves of these parasitic fungi is a comparatively simple operation under fa-
vorable climatic conditions, and is to be

recommended in all cases where they do not already exist. It is a long step, how_
ever, from the introduction of these fungi into a grove to the propagation of them on an entirely satisfactory basis, and our records and experiments have not as yet led us to conclusions justifying complete reliance upon the fungus diseases in any section of the state.
The subject of parasitic and predaceous insect enemies of the White Fly are be-
ing given attention in connection with the present investigations. No true parasites have thus far, been discovered, al-
tho efforts have been made to test the parasites attacking other species of white
ﬁies, as to their ability to parasitize this species. The known species of VV-hite Flies in the United States number more than seventy; and many of these are kown to be held in check and prevented from developing into pests by these min-
ute parasites. ,
The recent discovery of the Citrus
\Vhite Fly in China furnishes strong evi-
dence concerning its probable origin, and opens up the possibility of discovering natural enemies in that region. Pre-
datory insect enemies of the Citrus \Vhite Fly are not numerous and are of no con-
sequence as far as observed.
DIRECT REMEDIES.
The success of direct remedial meas-
ures against the \Vhite Fly is largely de-
pendent upon concerted action among the Citrus growers. Frequently several groves form a natural group isolated from other infested territory in such a way that a local organization only is necessary. In other cases concerted ac—
tion may be best obtained thru County Horticultural commissions. It is grati-
fying to note that in several instances organizations of one kind or another have already been affected, or are planned,
with the object in view of conducting a systematic campaign against the \Vhite Fly.
Spraying is not practised by any large proportion of the owners of infested groves but as a remedial‘ measure against the \Vhite Fly it is of considerable im-
portance. Spraying is proﬁtable when properly conducted, but it is in many cases impracticable on account of the difﬁ-
culty of obtaining labor which can be re-
lied upon to make the application with the necessary thoroness. When applied with care and in liberal quantities the best sprays give results considered suc—
cessful by numerous orange growers.
The observations of the agents connected with the present investigation and the ex-
perience of numerous owners of infested orange groves show that spraying is especially useful in connection with the checking of the spread of the
ﬂy when it ﬁrst becomes estab—
lished in a grove or in a new local-
ity. In such cases money and time spent in spraying will bring manifold re-
turns. It is evidently proﬁtable to spend
$100.00 a year on a single acre, if neces-
sary, in order to delay to the utmost the time when it may be necessary to expend
$500.00 or an average of only $25.00 per acre in controlling the ﬂy in a twenty-
acre grove. From the outlook it seems probable that spraying for the \Vhite Fly will continue to be desirable under certain circumstances. The subject of spraying constitutes, at present, a minor phase of the investigations, inasmuch as it has al-
ready been demonstrated by the experi-
ence of numerous orange growers that this can be practiced with success; and inasmuch as other means of control are

either known to be more economical or are in greater need of investigation. The matter of discovering new spraying ma-
terials is not an important one since there are several already in use, which are en-
tirely effective in that, when properly mixed, all of the larvae and pupae hit by the spray will be destroyed. Ineffective-
ness, in most cases, is due to poor methods of application and failure to ap-
ply the spray in sufﬁcient quantities. The report, soon to be prepared, to which I have previously referred, will give the results of experiments in spraying and will discuss fully those things which are concerned with obtaining the greatest ef-
ﬁciency from the practice.
Fumigation is far more economical than spraying and at present can be most strongly recommended for general use as a reliable method of controlling the \Vhite Fly. The principal advantages of fumi-
gation over spraying are: ﬁrst, greater thoroness: second, less expense; third,
easier and less disagreeable labor. The work of the Bureau of Entomology has resulted in placing the process of fumiga—
tion for the \Vhite Fly under Florida con-
ditions on a basis such that Florida or—
ange growers will be able to use this method more intelligently and with more uniform results than California growers have used it heretofore. The so-called expert fumigators, relied upon in Cali-
fornia to estimate the dosage, are un-
necessary in Florida. The experimental work conducted during january and Feb-
ruary 1907 serves as the basis for a bul-
letin on fumigation which will be ready for distribution in the course of a few weeks.
During the past winter more than
4,000 citrus trees have been fumigated under the direction of the writer and his associates. The complete results of the past winter’s work cannot be obtained for several months; but it may be said that they have been most satisfactory, both from the standpoint of the experiments and from that of practical results in con-
trolling the \Vhite Fly. In one small grove of two acres the results are already so striking that it is very evident that the treatment would have been very proﬁta-
ble even tho the expense were twice as great. The results obtained in destroy-
ing citrus scale insect pests by fumiga-
tion, conducted primarily as a measure against the ﬂy, have fully justiﬁed the writer’s assertion made at the last meet-
ing of this society to the effect that the beneﬁts derived from destroying the va-
rious scales in most groves are of suf-
ﬁcient value to offset the entire cost of the fumigation, leaving as clear gain the beneﬁts resulting from the destruction of the ﬂy. The agents connected with the investigations have been making careful inquiry into the matter of damage in Florida due to scale insects. Without the aid of the fungus diseases and insect parasites of these scales, it seems evident that frequent spraying or regular
'fumigations would be necessary to pro-
duce proﬁtable citrus crops. \Vith their aid the damage is reduced to an estimated average of between ﬁve and ten per cent. ,In some cases, however,
the damage is as high as ﬁfteen or twenty per cent. of the value of the crop. while in others there is no appreciable damage.
Usually the damage by the scale itself does run justify the expense of direct remedies, but the effect on them of fumi-
gations for the White Fly is an extremely important consideration.
In addition to the foregoing main sub-
jects of investigation attention is being

given to numerous subjects of less im-
portance, or narrower scope. Among these may be mentioned the study of the effect of food plants, other than citrus,
on the efﬁcacy of remedial measures; the study of the result of removing water shoots from citrus trees at advantageous times; the collection of data concerning the losses from the ﬂy; and data con-
cerning the distribution. The results of the investigation thus far indicate that conclusive results can be obtained from most lines of the experimental work in a shorter period of time than is usually re-
quired for insects of a like prominence and destructiveness. At the present time,
from the results we have obtained, we are unable to predict the results of the efforts to control the White Fly thru its natural enemies, but whatever the results obtained this line of work should be continued un-
til every practicable effort has been made to substitute natural control for the more expensive direct means.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—Do you have different size tents, or the same tents?
Dr. Morrill—Tents for the largest trees will do, if necessary, for the smaller trees, but if a grower has one grove of large seedling trees and an-
other of medium-sized budded trees,
it would be better for him to have two sizes of tents.
Mr.—-—Do the tents have to be black?
Dr. Morrill—That is not necessary.
Most of our work has been done at night and after a little experience this is not as objectionable as it would ap-
pear. It is much cooler, and much pleasanter. '

Mr. What effect does the fumi-
gation have on fungi?
Dr. Morrill—So far as I have ob-
served, no effect whatever. It is gen-
enerally considered by plant patholo—
gists that hydrocyanic acid gas is not fungicidal. I believe Prof. Rolfs will agree with this.

Prof. Rolfs—It has no effect on fungi.
Mr. At what stage is it best to fumigate?
Dr. Morrill—It is best to fumigate in the winter time, because at that time there are practically none of the
ﬂies on the wing. As Dr. Berger has said, there is no time when you can-
not ﬁnd a few adults, but there are comparatively few in the middle of the winter; too few to be taken into con-
sideration. Occasionally, there is more or less shedding of leaves following fumigation, but of the four thousand or more trees fumigated under our super-
vision during the past winter, in no case was the tree injured more than was offset by the beneﬁts of destroy-
ing the insects. In one case in Man-
atee county we fumigated a tree that was shedding its leaves from some un—
known cause, 'and I believe only ﬁve per cent. of the leaves were left on the tree, but there were trees near by which were not fumigated which shed their leaves to nearly the same extent.
Mr. How long does it take to fumigate a tree?
Dr. Morrill—The tents are left on about forty minutes.

I would like to say, in connection with the injury from fumigation. that there is some misunderstanding with regard to this. owing to injury some-
times caused by emptying the contents

of the jars known as “residue” on the roots of the trees after fumigating.
Of course, this should not be charged to the fumigation of the trees any more than we would charge against the cost of spraying the injury that would result from emptying against the base of a tree a half barrel of spray mixture left over at the end of the day. Such carelessness must, however,
be guarded against.
Mr. What is the cost of fumiga-
tion?
Dr. Morrill—The cost of fumigation for the average size tree, is about 50
cents. For large trees, the cost may go up to $I.oo,_or more. But, as I have said, it is better and cheaper to fumigate than to spray, and spraying will cost more in one year than a sin-
gle fumigation that will last two years or more. The eggs of the insect will probably hatch out by the middle of December, and the best time for fumi-
gating, I would say, would be from the ﬁrst of January to the time of the appearance of new spring growth of the citrus trees in February.
In connection with the scale insects question, I would say that in one case where we have made pretty careful observation, we have been unable to
ﬁnd a single live pupae or red scale in any of the trees in a ﬁfty-acre grove,
though in previous years they had caused much trouble and caused injury to the extent of several hundred dol-
lars per year.
Mr. In your cost of fumigating,
do you include labor, etc.?
Dr. Morrill—\Ve ' include every-
thing; the work, material, and the wear and tear on the tent as well.



Mr. It seems to me the tents should be mildew proof.
Dr. Morrill—That should be done if it can be done without increasing the weight too greatly. However, I know one preparation that will do it.
Mr. Did you ever use sugar of lead and alum?
Dr. Morrill—That is what I speak of.
Mr. How much would it add to the weight of the tent?
Dr. Morrill—It would not add ap-
preciably to the weight.
Dr. Inman—What is the size of the tents you use?
Dr. Morrill—The largest tents are about eighty feet in diameter, and octagonal in shape. These are large enough for seedling trees thirty-three or thirty-four feet in extreme height.
Budded trees twelve feet high require tents about thirty-ﬁve feet in diameter.
Mr. Mote—After you have thor-
oughly and carefully fumigated a grove that is badly infected with white ﬂies, do you consider that you have done away with the white ﬂies for two seasons?
Dr. Morrill—From our observation of the groves we have fumigated, we believe it will take at least two years before the ﬂy will increase to the point of smutting the leaves or fruit. By fumigating it thoroughly every other year, I'think you can keep your fruit entirely free from smut, unless sur-
rounding conditions are unfavorable.
I refer to neighboring groves where no attempt is made to control the ﬂy.
Mr. Does it kill the rust mite?
Dr. Morrill—It kills the adult, but not the eggs.

Mr. In spraying, how often dur-
ing the season is it necessary to spray to get good results?
Dr. Merrill—Not less than three times a year. I would recommend two in the winter and one later on, about the middle of June. There are no two men who spray alike and good results are dependent upon thoroughness.
The results from spraying would not be as satisfactory as by fumigation,
but I believe, personally, that I could spray a grove three or four times a year and keep the white ﬂy from smutting the fruit. The average or-
ange grower has to depend on care-
less hands to spray, and it is not done carefully and thoroughly, and half the good results are lost.
Mr. Mote—\N’hat do you think will control the rust mite?
Dr. Morrill——-To control the rust mite, you would have to add sulphur to the spray.
Mr. Did I understand you to say


that one fumigation would equal the results of four sprayings?
Dr. Merrill—Yes, sir. The four sprayings in one season would not be as effective as one fumigation, and they would have to be repeated each year. Fumigation has been done so thoroughly that it was impossible to
ﬁnd a single white ﬂy on more than two hundred trees, but absolute ex-
termination should not be expected.
Mr.—Can you fumigate during the summer months?
Dr.Morrill—We fumigate very little in the summer time, but two or three weeks ago we fumigated some trees that were heavily laden with fruit, and while it seemed to cause quite a large percentage of the fruit to drop, we found that surrounding trees contin-
ued to shed their fruit, and altogether the fumigated trees have not shed as much fruit as the unfumigated trees.
However. it is not desirable to fumi-
gate for scales or the ﬂy while the fruit is green.

Rep0rt on Plant Diseases.
By Ernst A. Bessey.
Afr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Owing to lack of the. necessary time in which to prepare a more extended pa-
per I shall conﬁne my remarks to two topics, viz.: withertip fungus and nema-
todes.
In taking up the ﬁrst—named topic I realize that I am entering upon a ﬁeld
. well worked by our respected President,
but I am sure he will pardon me if I ap-
pear to trespass upon his preserves.
As Professor Rolfs demonstrated some years ago and made known in addresses before this society, as well as in Govern-
ment publications, various citrus diseases including withertip, blossom blight and tear-staining of pomelo, lemon spot, and several other troubles are caused by the fungus Colletotriehum gloeosﬂorioides.
Of course, not all cases of dying back of twigs, nor of the rotting of fruits are due to this cause, for other organisms as well are capable of causing these injuries,
but in a large proportion of cases the fungus above named is responsible.
Under Professor Rolf’s direction, be—
fore he severed his connection with the Subtropical Laboratory, inoculation ex-
periments were begun, which have been continued with some interruptions under my direction since I assumed charge of the Laboratory. These have demonstrated that this fungus is the same one that causes the blossom-blight, leaf—spot and fruit-rot of the mango and avocado, the tear-staining Of'the mango and leaf-spots and fruit-rots of various other plants.
These investigations make it almost cer-
tain, furthermore, that this fungus is, if not identical with, at least but a slight modiﬁcation of the fungus that causes the bitter rot of apples. We see, therefore,
that it is not a fungus conﬁned to but one or two hosts in a limited area with which we have to contend, but one of wide distribution, and capable of attack-
ing a great many kinds of plants. I have found apparently the same fungus on over
ﬁfty plants at Miami, some of them com-
mon weeds. This explains why, when the weather conditions or other circum-
stances are favorable, the disease springs up everywhere all at once, without any very apparent center of infection. Fur-
ther complicating the matter is the fact that the fungus is not conﬁned to living plants, but will grow with great readi-
ness—I will not say equally well—on dead parts of the same or other plants.
Often we ﬁnd that citrus trees dying back from some other cause, e. g. die—
back or blight, show this fungus in abun-
dance on the dead branches, although in this case the fungus has appeared after the death or weakening of the tissues by the other disease.
In view of the above mentioned facts,
we see why it is so desirable to keep the grove clean, trimming off and burning all dead branches, and destroying all
7

trash near the trees. Even this will not prove sufﬁcient to entirely prevent the dis-
ease from gaining a foothold unless we take other factors into consideration also.
One of the most favorable factors for the spread of the disease is moist weather, but since this is beyond our con-
trol it will need no further consideration except to point out that by allowing the trees 'to be planted .too [closely and to branch too low, an artiﬁcial condition of extreme moisture may be maintained in the grove that is very favorable to the spread of the fungus. In such groves the disease can be combated only with difﬁculty and cannot be conquered. An-
other factor that we can control to a large extent is the condition of health of the trees. My observations have shown me that anything that tends to weaken the tree makes it more susceptible to infec-
tion by this fungus and so reduces the power of resistance that when it has once gained a foothold it progresses much fur-
ther than is the case with a healthy tree.
Among the causes of weakness may be mentioned excessive moisture, or ex-
cessive drought, starvation or overfeed-
ing with nitrogenous fertilizers so that the new growth is soft and ﬂabby. In-
jury from insecticides and even from fungicides may favor the entrance of the disease, while the presence of scale in-
sects on leaves and twigs, or of lice and mites, is also very undesirable. Many of you have no doubt noticed the dead areas at the margins of the citrus leaves,
sometimes occupying half or more of the leaf surface—marked with concentric lines of minute dots. These are mostly caused by this fungus and will in a great many cases be found to center in a group of scale insects that have weakened the tissue so that at that spot the fungus was able to gain an entrance—a thing that it does with difﬁculty in an uninjured ma-
ture leaf. On the other hand, any treat—
ment that keeps the tree growing vigor-
ously with a ﬁrm, hard growth, reduces its susceptibility to the disease and en-
ables it, in the majority of cases, to check the progress of the fungus before very much injury has been accomplished.
One frequent source of entrance of the fungus is through wounds—especially if the tree be in a weak condition, so that it may often happen when one starts to prune withertip out of his grove he ﬁnds to his dismay in a few weeks that he has more of the disease than before, infec-
tion having taken place at every cut sur-
face and having followed down without any apparent check from the pruning.
In a case like this, I would advise that a second man follow the pruner right up and spray the trees thoroughly with Bor-
deaux mixture within a few hours after pruning. In this way the cut surfaces will be coated by a layer of Bordeaux mixture which will prevent the spores of the fungus from germinating and reinfecting the plant. If the disease is not abundant in one’s trees and they are in vigorous condition, it may not be found necessary to spray.
Recently there have come to my notice a number of cases where avocado trees have been very seriously injured by this disease. Three or four years ago a large grove of budded avocados was set out in the southern part of the state. The owner fertilized it with a great excess of phosphoric acid (18 to 25 per cent.)
while but two or three per cent. of am-
monia and three or four per cent. of potash were applied. The trees did not make any too vigorous growth and a year ago this spring, although not yet old

enoughmto blossom much, came out into excessively abundant bloom. The wither-
tip fungus attacked the ﬂowers and, the trees being in a weakened condition, fol—
lowed down the ﬂower clusters into the twigs, destroying a great many twigs,
many of the larger branches and, in a good many cases, the whole tree, the fun-
gus continuing down the trunk to the surface of the ground. In another ,case,
more recently, several hundred budded trees were obtained from a nursery and kept for several weeks in a lath shed be-
fore being set out. At the time they were set out the man in charge noticed brown spots near the bases of the cions on a good many of the trees. These rap-
idly enlarged and ﬁnally girdled the trees,
destroying quite a large percentage of those set out. In this case also the with-
ertip fungus was to blame, having gained entrance either through some wound made at the time the top of the stock was lopped off, or through some of the little lateral shoots that started shortly above the bud on the cion, or through the wounds caused by their removal. An-
other case was that of a little avocado tree growing in very poor, rocky soil,
with no water except the scanty rainfall we had last year. No fertilizer of any kind was given to the tree and it made a very weak growth, losing its leaves this past winter before the new leaves came out. It blossomed quite abundantly and the fungus passed on into the twigs and is now entering into some of the large branches.
I have contiued my work on nematodes,
on which I made a report before the So-
ciey two years ago, and have a few things that I would like to add. I have made several extensive trips to determine the distribution of the rootknot, and ﬁnd that it is more widely distributed than any—
body supposed, occurring as far north as New York, West Virginia, Michigan, In-
diana, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah and California, thus being found in parts of the country where the winters are very cold, at times with the ground freezing to considerable depth. It also occurs in Eu-
rope, Africa, Asia, East Indies, Australia,
New Zealand, Hawaii, \Vest Indies,
Mexico, Brazil and Argentina and doubtless elsewhere in South America.
According to the reports of others and my own observations, it occurs on over 375 species of plants and if careful observations were made wherever it oc—
curs, this number would doubtless be mul-
tiplied many times. Nearly all of the large families of ﬂowering plants are represented by plants that are subject to rootknot, while even the comptie, which is not a ﬂowering plant, is not exempt.
Of the cultivated plants, as I mentioned two years ago, beggarweed, peanuts, and velvet beans seem to be about the only important leguminous crops that are not injured, while among the grains, corn,
sorghum, wheat and rye seem to be exempt. Oats, on the other hand, which in all my previous observations showed no signs of the disease, I have found to be subject in certain cases. I have tested further the effects of different fertilizers on the rootknot injury. Those fertilizers containing large amounts of potash I have found to be of value in that they reduce the amount of injury and seem to act—
ually reduce the amount of rootknot pres-
ent, the plants not only having a more vigorous appearance, but actually show-
ing smaller and less numerous knots.
Kainit and Potassium magnesium carbon-
ate are superior to sulphate of potash.
Formalin treatment of the soil I have

found to be of some beneﬁt, using one part of commercial formalin to I00 parts of water; but it is necessary to apply sev-
eral gallons of this solution to the square yard, and it is impossible to get the ground thoroughly and evenly soaked so that its use is entirely out of the question.
Carbonbisulphide, about a teaspoonful poured into a hole six inches deep, at intervals of about I 5 to 20 inches, the holes being immediately covered with soil,
is very efﬁcacious, but is entirely impac-
ticable except for very small areas, on account of the expense which would would amount to $60 to $100 per acre for the chemical alone, not including the cost of applying it. I do wish, how-
ever, to report success with certain rota-
tion experiments that were conducted at my suggestion in Denison, Texas. A gentleman was very much troubled by rootknot in his muskmelons, it becoming so abundant that he lost his whole crop in 1904. At my suggestion he planted his ﬁeld that fall with winter grain. The following spring, 1905, he sowed Iron cow peas on the land, this variety, if pure seed is obtained, being absolutely immune to rootknot. In this connection, however,
I must emphasize the fact that it is necessary to have pure seed, for I have observed, and so have others, rootknot in seed alleged to be Iron, though in the pure bred Iron cowpea I have never seen it. The owner of the land carefully de-
stroyed all weeds that came up among the cowpeas until the latter covered the land so thoroughly that all weeds were smothered out. In the fall the land was again sown to grain and in’the following summer Iron cowpeas were planted the second time; in the fall of 1906 the land was again put in grain and in the spring of 1907 was planted partly to melons and partly to other crops. All proved to be absolutely free from rootknot. Another piece of land in which he had Iron cow-
peas but one year was found to have very many less nemaclotes than before, but was not yet entirely free from the trouble.
Regarding the methods of introduction and spread of this nematode, my observa-
tions lead me to believe that to a large extent nursery stock has been responsible for the introduction. Once introduced in-
to a man’s farm, the disease is easily spread by his tools or the dirt clinging to his feet or the feet of his animals, and even by washing rains. If the proper pre-
cautions were taken on new land that had never been cultivated before to use only clean tools and to see that the horses,
wagons and plows did not bring dirt with them, the disease would not prove serious.
When once introduced, however, it does not take very long, if susceptible crops are grown, for it to become thoroughly established and injurious, .for from the time that the egg is laid until the mature worm is laying eggs herself‘is only about four weeks, and one worm is able to lay from 400 to 500 eggs. ,

SCALY BARK DISEASE OF CITRUS.
By H. S. Fawcett.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Scaly bark, a recently discovered dis-
ease of the orange tree, is becoming a serious menace to many growers in that part of Hillsboro county which is known as the Pinellas peninsula. The year be—
fore last it was estimated that from 35
to 75 per cent. of the fruit in many old groves was injured by the spotting due to this disease, and this was in addition to the injury to the limbs and trunks by the killing of the bark. Last year the disease was not so severe on the fruit.
Scaly bark has been known to the Exper-
iment Station for not more than three years, and the Serious nature of the dis-
eaSe has been recognized for scarcely more than a year and a half. According to the older growers in the Pinellas pen-
insula, however, it has been known there to some extent for many years. Whether it occurs in any other part of Florida, or in any other part of the world, I have as yet been unable to determine,
About a year and a half ago I was del-
egated by the Experiment Station to take up, along with other plant disease work, the investigation of this trouble;
in order to ﬁnd the cause, if possible,
and also a practical remedy. When I
ﬁrst took up the work the older growers told me that the disease was thought to have originated near Safety Harbor, on Old Tampa Bay, in what is known as the Phillippi hammock. In following up these reports I found that nearly all the older groves in which the disease was worst could be traced back as coming from trees that had ﬁrst grown in a nurs-
ery owned by Mr. Phillippi. It was in a large tree next to this nursery as reported by Mr. Phillippi’s grand—
son, that the disease was ﬁrst noticed at about the year 1860. These trees had been planted about 1840, and were twenty years old when the disease was
ﬁrst noticed. Just how the disease got into the grove and where it came from,
no one knows.
As to the varieties affected, I ﬁnd it is only serious on the sweet orange. Grape-
fruit is very resistant. Tangerines are almost immune, as is also the Mandarin.
I found Tangerine trees surrounded by diseased sweet orange trees, but could
ﬁnd no'trace of the disease upon them.
This disease has three fairly distinct appearances on the tree:
(I). On the bark of the trunk and larger limbs there appear roughened,
ruptured areas, in which the old bark cracks and scales off with more or less gumming, and a new bark forms under the old; and this again cracks and scales off in the same way later on. This ap-
pearance has suggested the name Scaly Bark.
(2). Another manifestation of the disease is apparent on the small branches and twigs. Small lemon-colored areas on the bark are ﬁrst noticed. They turn reddish-brown, and the bark becomes brittle and cracks. They develop quite slowly, and scarcely ever appear on wood that is less than nine months to one year old. New spots form between the old ones, until in a year or two the limb be-
comes girdled at some point. As the

limb weakens, the ever—present wither-
tip fungus comes in and kills it back very rapidly.
(3). A third manifestation of the disease is seen on the fruit, on which there appear, usually in July or August,
faint rings. These rings slowly become colored and sunken, while in many cases the interior of the ring remains green and apparently uninjured. The fruits so attacked color prematurely, and many of them drop before picking time.
About a year ago I began experiments on a grove near Bayview on about 175
trees, with the view of getting some def—
inite information that might lead to a remedy. It is too soon to report def-
initely on these experiments, as they must be continued another year before any conclusions can be drawn; but I might say that experiments with Bor-
deaux mixture were made every two months through the year, in addition to other experiments of a different nature.
I found that the spraying diminished the amount of spotting on the fruit to some extent; but that where it was used every ti-vo months three times or more in all, the Purple Scale increased so rap-
idly that it was a question whether these scale insects did not do more harm than the disease would have done if let alone.
Considerable progress is being made in learning how the disease develops and spreads, and it is hoped that in time we shall have worked out a remedy for the trouble. Such scientiﬁc work is usually quite slow. As you know, the die-back of the orange was ﬁfteen years under investigation before a practical way of controlling it was worked out. The Fed-
eral Government has spent $30,000 to
$40,000 in the investigation of the blight of citrus; and although considerable progress has been made in ﬁnding out the nature of this disease, no practical remedy has as yet been found. In most diseases it requires years for such investi-
gations. In rare instances a remedy may be worked out in a short time. Profes-
sor Rolfs worked out a remedy for the phytoptosis of potatoes in ten days, and this remedy has never been improved upon; but this is a rare case. It cannot be known in advance whether it will re-
quire ten days or ten years to ﬁnd a remedy for any given disease.

ORANGE TREE SCALE.
By Cyrus W. Butler.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I was surprised to ﬁnd myself upon our program for a paper upon Scale, for hav—
ing sold my grove interest and even left,
temporarily, at least, the land of the best orange, I had considered myself dis-
charged from the army of those who bat-
tle against the enemies of the citrus;
but I feel pleased to be remembered by my companions of old and, being at pres-
ent in the land of that best orange, will take one more shot at the enemy, even though it is a “hot air” one and along lines that have often been over before.
In approaching the subject, I do so with a sense of incompleteness of knowledge;
but when I recall one orange grower,
whom I found killing lady birds, and who offered me one dollar apiece for every scale that I would ﬁnd upon his badly infested trees, and again another who.
in advocating a certain insecticide, stated that when applied to orange trees, the scale could at once be seen leaving the tree in clouds,—I reﬂect that there are degrees of lack of knowledge of this, as well as other subjects.
!,
By the word “scale, the Florida or-
ange grower usually means the purple or oyster shell scale (mytilaspis citri-
cola), which is the only species that oc-
curs throughout Florida in sufﬁcient numbers to constitute an important fac~
tor in the culture of the citrus, but is not now so dreaded a pest as it was be-
fore its natural enemies had become numerous, for we hear the oldest of growers tell of a time when orange groves were not only killed by them, but the entire business threatened.
\Vith its life history most of us are more or less acquainted, but all of us are most interested in methods of making their lives entirely historical, and I will mention such methods as are known to be of value.
These methods come under three heads: ﬁrst, Prevention; second, Natural Enemies; and third, Insecticides.
PREVENTION.
In the multiplication of scale, like that of all life, food is one of the great fac-
tors, which the orange tree best furnishes these parasites when the bark is soft and juicy, with large pores, this condition is most often brought about by using an ex-
cess of nitrogen, and most especially when of an organic nature, such as stable and hen manure. Even a moderate amount of nitrogen of this class is almost certain to cause an increase of scale, and quite cer~
tain to do so if used in connection with clean culture, which by admitting the air to the soil, causes rapid nitriﬁcation of the ammonia present in the manure.
Also we remember how, after the freezes of ’94 and ’95, the fast growing sprouts from the roots of the frozen-
down trees were afflicted with scale throughout the State.
As to the idea of this pest being in-
creased by poverty of soil and neglect of cultivation, I must differ even with such authorities as our much respected Hub-

104
FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
bard, as such conditions produce a close bark, not favorable to scale; but what is better proof, is that I have never been able to ﬁnd any neglected trees that showed any unusual amount of scale,
unless around some old barn or hen house, where the ammonia may linger longer than one would expect. Of course cultivation will cause and increase scale by increasing the nitriﬁcation of any am-
moniates that may be in the soil and thus causing a more sappy growth; provided the ammoniates are in the soil.
Any covering, greatly increases scale,
and this true, not only when immediate,
as in the case of spider webs, birds’ nests,
etc., but when the cover is much above the trees, as in the case of overhanging forest trees, and is well illustrated in shedded groves. Also, in shedded piner-
ies scale abound in proportion to the amount of shade.
In addition to the above causes, we must admit, that at times we have a gen-
eral increaSe of scale, probably owing to climatic conditions. _
For instance, last year we had a long spring drouth, followed by a meager rainy season, thus seriously handicapping the fungoid enemies of the scale, which are now very numerous.
But the worst of all attacks of scale is that following the white ﬂy, the usual dead wood inside of Whiteﬂy trees,
being less due to the whiteﬁy than to the scale that follows them.
NATURAL ENEMIES.
Upon our Sub-peninsula, at least, I would give the ﬁrst place to the black fungus ( myrangium duraci), which is well distributed with us; and, while it conﬁnes itself mainly to the trunk and larger limbs and does not become abun-
dant until the scale are also in sufﬁcient numbers to injure the trees, still I think it our best ally against the scale. I ﬁrst saw this fungus some eighteen years ago,
in the grove of Mr, Moffet McClung, of Dunedin, and scraping it from the trees,
got a mixture of fungus, bark and scale.
When my trees were still wet from a summer rain, I'rubbed the above pow-
dery mixture along the upper sides of such large limbs as showed scale, being careful to work high in the tree, so that the rains would wash the spores of the fungus down the limbs. All conditions must have been favorable, for every tree treated got a good start.
While we have long heard of the white fungus (ophionectra coccicola), it did not appear in our vicinity until the last two years, and was ﬁrst noticed in the grove of Mr. W'. E. Heathcote, and is now spreading. It works upon smaller limbs than the black fungus, and will thus supplement the effect of the latter.
Considering that it has been doing good work during the past dry year, it prom-
ises well under more moist conditions.
As Cuba has one or two species of fun-
gus preying upon scale that I do not think that we have, it might pay to make some importations.
Of lady birds, the only species numer-
ous enough to be of value is our common twice stabed one, which, like our lady friends, are ever with us, and are ever busy, both in larvae and adult form, de-
stroying what scale their stomachs will admit, but (again like our lady friends)
are not quite equal to the occasion of ac-
complishing all desired results for our good. Incidentally, I might say that inat least one shedded pinery I found this lady bird to be a speciﬁc for the pineapple scale. The covering of this scale being

105
quite thin, the lady bird forces its man-
dibles through the covering and into the scale, then drags it out through the roof of its house, eating at times as many as three scale per minute. Cuba has a small steel blue lady bird that might be of use to us.
While we always ﬁnd many micro-
scopic, but predacious appearing mites running around among scale, I have never been able to detect them in prey-
ing upon the latter.
Also, if hymenopterous ﬂies attack the purple scale, I have never noticed it, but have seen them clean up a tree badly in-
fested with' wax scale.
INSECTICIDES.
\Yhere man interferes with the bal—
ance established by Nature, he is quite apt to bring about a series of reactions,
often unlooked for by him, and this is especially true in spraying orange trees,
where the insecticide used not only often directly injures the tree, but usually de-
stroys the natural enemies of the scale,
and the grower thus places himself under obligations to do much work that Nature would otherwise do for him; but upon the other hand, where the grower is sufﬁ~
ciently informed, he can keep his trees clean of scale and rust mites by spraying,
and without injury to the trees, but at a cost justiﬁed only by a fair price for oranges,
Of the most effective insecticides for scale, we would ﬁrst place either resin compound or resin wash, but the former is apt to gum the pump: this can, how—
ever, be remedied by adding, say ﬁve per cent. of kerosene to -the compound in making and thoroughly incorporating the same. Both of these washes, if used two or three times during one season,
\
will show bad results upon the trees,
probably by gumming up the pores of the leaves and bark.
Second comes kerosene emulsion,
which is rather less effective upon scale than the resin washes, and is quite varia-
ble in its effect upon the trees, depending upon whether the weather be clear or cloudy and also whether the trees are thrifty or not.
During clear weather the oil evaporates quicker, and thus affects the tree less,
and a thrifty tree will withstand much more kerosene than a hardened up one.
Besides, kerosene emulsion has killed many large trees by being carelessly made, the oil separating and being sprayed upon the trees unnoticed by the workman.
Third, and safest of all our scale spray-
ing compounds, comes the various pot—
ash ﬁsh oil soaps, often called whale oil soaps. At the strength advisable to use these soaps are not as effective as the above resin washes; however, its non-in-
jury to the tree enables the grower to use it so repeatedly as to thoroughly clean a tree of all insect enemies, except-
ing rust mites, which for some reason seem proof against the soaps, perhaps because of their diet of oil; this can be remedied, however, by adding some sul-
phur and caustic potash compound to the soap. Many of these soaps are made with caustic soda, which makes a hard soap, while caustic potash makes a soft one, which is to be preferred to that made from caustic soda, for its fertilizing prop-
erties, if for no other reason, but again it mixes with water more readily than a caustic soda soap.
Personally, we have not sprayed for scale but one season during the last twelve years of our orange growing, and

that one season was after using Bor-
deaux mixture; but, needing bright or-
anges, we did spray with a sulphur and caustic potash compound that not only was effective on rust mites, but was al-
most equally so upon young scale, even after they were partially covered.
Ever since we have been in Florida we have heard of using salt around trees,
as a scale insecticide to be administered through the sap, but have made only one trial, and that on but six two-year-old
“trees, giving them from three-fourths of a pound to two and one-half pounds each, and for want of rain, soaking it in once per week with water from a hose.
The salt did kill nearly all the scale; but it also hurt the trees so that they dropped most of their leaves, even when I used less than one pound of salt; and where I used the most salt, the small limbs died back for a few inches and the tree was a long time without foliage.
To recapitulate: We would say, ﬁrst,
avoid conditions favor-able to a multipli-
cation of scale, by hardening up the bark by a maximum percentage of potash and a moderate amount of nitrogen from inorganic sources—preferably sul-
phate of ammonia, and avoiding any un-
necessary cultivation of trees.
Second, encourage all natural enemies.
such as scale destroying fungi and lady birds.
Third, if justiﬁed in spraying and in-
tending to do so but once during the sea-
son, use one of the resin washes, but do not use it while the fruit is quite small.
If continued spraying is intended, use one of the ﬁsh oil potash soaps; and where rust mites are also to be destroyed, add some potash sulphur compound,
But preferably get the natural ene-
mies of the scale to work, and do not ex—
pect immediate results; for, while the mills of the gods grind exceedingly ﬁne,
they are unusually slow, in the time ideas of man.
SAN JOSE SCALE.
By F. P. Henderson, Gainesville.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The general subject of Diseases and Insects has been so thoroughly and ably discussed by persons more competent than myself that I think it more proﬁtable to this body that I give very brieﬂy my experience with the San jose Scale. Per-
haps no one in the State has had more loss by the San Jose Scale or succeeded better in its destruction than I have.
In 1901 I planted at Arno, Fla., a 60-
acre peach orchard. In 1903 nothing could look more promising, when the San Jose Scale appeared in two or three places. I immediately cut down and de-
stroyed the ﬁrst trees infected. But this failed, as by winter several hundred trees were affected. During the winter of 1903
to 1904 I sprayed all the infected trees and all the trees around them with the Lime-Sulphur Salt solution. This seemed to destroy most of them, but during the summer and fall of 1904 they spread very rapidly. I again sprayed the whole or-
chard very thoroughly during the winter of 1904 and 1905, with only temporary results. so that by the fall of 1905 al-
most every tree in the orchard was in-

fected so much that three-fourths of the trees died back to the trunk.
I had read the bulletin written by our Honorable President about the destruc-
tion of the San Jose Scale by the Sphae-
rostilbe Coccophila or Red-head Fungus,
but I did not know how or where to get it. But I succeeded in getting three or four small pieces of what was told me was black fungus. I put this on some of the worst infected trees early in 1905.
I paid no more attention to it. At this time I did not know the red or black fun-
gus when I saw it. Early in the winter of 1905 I began spraying again and I kept seeing trees covered with the red fungus and I began to examine and I found where the trees looked red the scale was dead. I very carefully re-read the bulletin and found I had the red and black fungus both pretty well distributed over my orchard, I immediately quit spraying and wrote to Prof. Rolfs and stated the facts to him and asked him if I could safelv trust the orchard in the hands of the fungus, and he replied I could: and I have not used my spray pump since. By January 1906 I could not ﬁnd a live Scale in my orchard.
Earlv in the spring of 1906 I cut al-
most all the trees back to the trunk and by the fall of 1906 I had almost as good an orchard as ever. The Scale were so completely killed that I almost lost the fungus.
During the fall of 1007, during a long spell of dry weather. the Scale appeared in large numbers, sufﬁcient to do a little damage; but as soon as we had some rain the fungus verv soon appeared again and destroved the Scale.
In May 1906 I introduced both the Red and Black fungus into the 300-acre or-
chard of the Gainesville Orchard Com-
pany, near Archer, which at the time was very badly infected with the Scale. The fungus spread very rapidly and within a few months the Scale were all dead, and the trees put on a nice fall growth of healthy wood_
In June 1906 I introduced both the Red-head and the Black fungi into the
5oo-acre orchard of the Grifﬁng Florida Orchard Company at Komoko, with the same results and the fungus has held the Scale down completely ever since.
During the summer of 1907 I visited nearly all the peach orchards in the State and I only found one orchard that was not affected with the San Jose Scale. I introduced the fungus in nearly all, with the same results, so far as I have learned.
My experience has shown conclusively that the fungus is not only by far the cheapest, but also the most effective re-
medy for both the San Jose Scale as well as the orange Scale.
After obtaining the genuine fungus, of either variety, the application is very sim-
ple. Just tie a small piece of wood con-
taining the fungus, in about every tenth tree, and your work is done not only for one year but as long as you have an or-
chard. One man can make the applica—
tion on about twenty acres per day_
I very seriously doubt if spraying is the best means of ﬁghting any of the in-
jurious insects of Florida. What we need to do is to ﬁnd out through our Experi-
ment Station what the natural enemy _of these insect pests is and .then use it to exterminate it.
And here permit me to say that I do not believe we, as horticulturists, appre—
ciate the work our own Experiment Station is doing for our fair State. They have redeemed the peach, plum and Ja-
panese persimmon industries from com-

plete destruction from the San Jose Scale,
and I feel sure that the orange industry will be saved thousands of dollars from the ravages of the orange Scale as soon as it is learned that these same fungi will eradicate the orange Scale. Besides,
they will yet deliver us from the ravages of the white fly.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Hart—I want to again call at—
tention to what I consider the most serious matter of all. It seems to have been slighted and has been mentioned only once or twice in an incidental way in this convention. That is, blight of the orange trees. I consider that is the most serious disease we have to contend with, and it should be given
ﬁrst attention. This disease is so bad and so hard a problem that it seems our professional men shy around it and do not want to say anything about it. We will have to hold them to it.
It is to them that we look for relief,
and without doubt they must give it to us, if we get it. But, as orange growers. we must help them.
Professors Weber and Swingle came down here from Washington because of the action of this Society, and if it had not been for the freeze I think they would have accomplished valua—
ble results. This disease never attacks a tree until it is seven years old, or older. and it requires expert study for years to work out the necessary ex-
periments to locate the cause of the trouble. Our professional men must work the problem out for us. We. as individuals. cannot afford to put the time and study into it that it requires.
Now. can’t we take some action right here and now that will bring about more effective work on that line?
Our president has worked on it, but he had a whole lot of other work to do that took up his time, and although he put good study into it, we have not got the results we hoped to have. We must do all we can to get hold of this question of blight, and ﬁnd out what the remedy is. If it is going to take twenty years, let’s begin this year and that will cut off one of the twenty.
The government is ready to help us on anything that we need help on, but we must ask for it; we must make it known to those having these matters in charge that we need help, and then we will get it.
It is perfectly astounding to me that year after year goes by, each season we dig out some of our most valuable trees spoiling the symmetry of our groves, yet little effort is made to ﬁnd a remedy. It certainly does a great amount of damage. The best trees we have will show blight, and then they are gone. All you can do is to dig them up, leaving great open spaces in your groves, and plant anew. It knocks off a third of the value of the grove if you wish to sell. The buyer won’t pay within a third of the value.
Now, we have here those who have suffered with blight and those who are bound to suffer sooner or later. It seems to me that we should make an effort to get good work started on the matter, and we should begin where Weber and Swingle left off.
Mr. Mote—I am not suffering with it very much, but I am interested in the subject. If Mr. Hart will offer a suggestion, I think this whole body will take it up.

Mr. Hart—I have been offering sug—
gestions, and have got the matter so far along that the Society has en-
dorsed it, passed the resolution I have oﬂered each year for several years in succession, and that is about all we have heard of it, except that Mr.
Painter conferred with Secretary Wil-
son at one time concerning it. The thing for us to do is to press the mat—
ter as individuals. If our Secretary writes to the Secretary of Agriculture and that is all that is done, it will re-
main just as it is. we must pass a resolution that means business, and then we want to get right after it and stir up those in authority and get the matter before them and keep it before them so that they will say as the Southern Express agent at Savannah said of a man who had paid express at both ends of the line. The man found out what was being done and that express charges had been col-
lected from him and from the people to whom he had shipped oranges as presents, and he grew tired of it. He started in and made such a noise with no cessation that after awhile the Ex-
press superintendent said to the agent at this man’s station, “For the Lord’s sake; do something to stop that d——
man’s mouth.” If we can talk to them
'like that, maybe we can get them ,to think we are in earnest.
Mr. Mote—I move that a committee of ﬁve be appointed, and that Mr. Hart be made chairman.
Mr. Painter—If you will refer to the report of last year, you will see where I made a report of this matter. I did not trust the mails, but saw the Sec-
retary of Agriculture in person and presented our resolution to him.
About the ﬁrst question he asked was,
“What are you people doing?” He said, “We are willing to help you if you help yourselves along any of those lines. just now, however, all the ap-
propriation is used up and we cannot do anything at present.” His intima-
tion was that they were willing to help us, but they were not going to do it all.
Mr. Rose—I would suggest that it is necessary for the whole body as a body to move in this matter. The depart-
ments will receive with courtesy a let-
ter from the secretary, but it is nec-
essary for us to act together. If you will remember a little while ago, there was considerable agitation about the white ﬂy, particularly in the Second Congressional District. Our Congress-
man was talked to by a large number of growers and the necessity of action being shown to him, he exercised him-
self and got an appropriation and sent a white-ﬂy man to the state. Now,
in this instance here we have repre-
sentatives in Congress who are anx-
ious to represent the people, and it is the duty of every member of the So-
ciety to correspond with his Congress-
man and the Secretary of Agriculture.
When it is known that a people re-
presenting the orange industry of Florida require assistance in scientiﬁc work. when it comes up in the proper shape, it will be attended to. There is no doubt but that after this meeting is over. we will lose all interest; we de-
pend on the secretary or upon a com-
mittee for effort to be made, and the body as a body does not support the men who should be supported. The thing to do is to show that you want these things, make it clear to your

Congressman, and he will help you to get them.
Mr. Gaitskill—I would suggest that Mr. Hart get up a resolution to be passed by this meeting, and the secre—
tary do as he has done—present it to the Secretary of Agriculture. At the same time, we, each and every one, get our friends and neighbors and all to write a letter to the Secretary of Agri-
culture and to both Senators and to the Congressmen, asking them to see that this thing is attended to. By that means there may be something done.
It is the constant dropping of water that wears away a stone. If you can’t write a letter, write a postal card, but let’s do something, _
I move that Mr. Hart prepare a re-
solution and present it to the meet-
ing, we pass it and put the matter be-
fore the Congressmen and the Secre—
tary of Agriculture in the regular way.
Then each and every member of the Horticultural Society, and not stop—
ping with the members, but get all our friends who are interested in the mat-
ter, to write to the Secretary of Agri-
culture, to the Senators, to the Con—
gressman from his district, and see that this resolution is acted upon.
Mr. Hart—I don’t think that I could formulate any better resolution than that which has been passed repeatedly by this Association, and I think most of you remember what is in it. It states our needs and states the effect of the disease; it states the conditions that make it difﬁcult to combat in-
dividually and without the organized effort. and I think to just readopt it would be all that is necessary. I could not, on such Short time, undertake to write anything near so good.
I think, Mr. President, that Mr.
Gaitskill’s motion is a good one, and I second it heartily, only I am afraid that if we merely pass the resolution nobody will do anything. I would sug-
gest that we have a show of hands of those who will act in the matter.
Prof. Rolfs—You have all heard the resolution, and those of you who are in favor of the motion, and who will write to the Congressmen and the Sen-
ators as suggested, please rise to your feet.
(Nearly every member responded by rising to his feet, thereby promis-
ing to urge it on our representatives in person or a letter.)
Mr. Hart—Now I am sure we will get something done.
Mr. Gaitskill—I know that our Con—
gressmen are glad to help us in any way; and if they are not, we can do a lot to keep them from being sent back.
The resolutions were adopted and are as follows:
WHEREAS, The orange growers of Florida are annually suffering the loss of many thousands of dollars in the reduc-
tion of their fruit crop and still more in the market value of their groves through a. disease known as orange tree blight.
which usually selects the largest and most productive trees for the attack; and WHEREAS, Though the disease has been carefully studied for many years by very table Department experts, it is not
'yet well enough known to allow of its positive identiﬁcation, in many cases, be-
fore the second or third year after its appearance, while investigations pretty surely prove that the disease is con-
tagious, which makes each diseased tree

a nucleus from which it is carried to others when caring for or working the grove; and NVHEREAS, Progress has been made that encourages the belief that if addi-
tional help with special ﬁtness can be sent here and allowed to devote their whole time assisting in this select work, we have reason to hope that the cause may be found for it; therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the Secretary of this society be instructed to correspond with the Florida Representatives in 'Washing-
ton and earnestly request them to call upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon.
Wilson, and urge upon him the import—
ance of this 'work and the pressing need
-that we feel for further assistance from his Department. Be it further RESOLVED, That each member of this society exert his or her inﬂuence as an individual to secure increased appropria-
tion for this work and its more vigorous prosecution.

Report of Committee on Fertilizers.
By E. O. Painter.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The most expensive form of plant food that the horticulturist and farmers have to buy is ammonia. Therefore I deem a little information as to the different kinds and sources of ammonia would not be out of place with the members of the Florida State Horticultural Society.
Ammoniates should be divided into three different classes: Chemical, Animal and Vegetable. The chemical sources are the most expensive per ton but as a rule are the cheapest per unit. Being soluble they are the quickest available and can be used to great advantage where quick crops are grown.
CHEMICAL AMMONIATES.
There are some chemical ammoniates that are high in plant food but are very seldom used as a source in fertilizer mainly on account of the small quantity produced.
NITRATE AM MONIA.
Nitrate ammonia contains the highest percentage of ammonia of any material that is offered as it contains on an av-
erage of 38 per cent. This nitrate am-
monia is a byproduct in the manufacture of high explosives and for years has been thrown away as the manufacturers were not appraised of the value of it as a plant food. Recently 40 tons of these goods were sold for $100.00 per ton. This ni-
trate ammonia is made by mixing and neutralizing nitric acid of a high grade with a good grade of aqua ammonia in the same manner that sulphate ammonia is manufactured. It is very high because it not only contains ammonia from sul-
phate but also the nitrate from nitric acid.
As stated above this article has been a waste product for years but is now bring-
ing the manufactures a clear $100.00 a ton. It would be an excellent form for the farmers to use if it was to be had in sufﬁcient quantities, but as the whole amount made in the entire United States is probably less than 100 tons there is not very much danger of the market be-
ing stocked with this article.
SULPHATE OF AMMONIA.
ISulphate of ammonia is another one of the valuable byproducts in the manu-
facturing interest of our country. For-
merly the ammonia from the gas works and coke ovens was all allowed to escape into the open air but now it is caught and combined with sulphuric acid producing sulphate of ammonia, for the beneﬁt of the farmer and mankind generally. In making gas, the coal undergoes a process of destructive distillation in the closed retort or oven. This liberates the am-
monia which passes away with the gas and is absorbed by water through the scrubbing or cooling process. The liquid containing the ammonia is heated and the ammonia liberated by lime water which is led through a bath of sulphuric acid through a bath of sulphuric acid where where the ammonia combines with the

113'
acid forming the white crystals, known as sulphate of ammonia. The crystals are then taken out. and by means of cen-
trifugal forces are dried and are then ready for the market.
\Vhile a large amount of sulphate of ammonia is made from coal in the pro-
cess of making coke there is a large quan-
tity made from bone while making bone charcoal. The process is practically the same as when it is made from coke.
The difference being that the bone is used in the retorts instead of the coal.
After the bone is treated in this way it is used in the sugar reﬁneries for puri-
fying sugar.
NITRATE OF POTASH.
Nitrate of potash is another very high grade chemical and has the advantage of not only containing a large percent-
age of ammonia but is very high in pot-
ash and this makes it doubly beneﬁcial to the grower. Nitrate of potash which is usually called salt peter is found in In-
dia, Egypt, Persia and Spain where it frequently appears as a white incrusta-
tion on the soil and is sometimes mixed with the soil to some depth. To extract the nitrate the earth is leached with water and the solution evaporated either by the sun or artiﬁcial heat. This develops the impure crystals which are exported as impure salt-petre. Nitrate of potash is formed wherever nitrogenized organic substances decompose in the presence of potassium hydrate. It is also manufac-
tured artiﬁcially by exposing to the air a mixture of animal matter with wood ashes and lime moistened with stable drainings or stale urine.
The greater part of the nitrate of pot—
ash, however, is made from nitrate of soda. The recrystallized nitrate of soda is dissolved in water and an equivalent quantity of potassium chloride, is added to the mixture and the solution boiled down. \Vhile the water is hot the chlo-
ride of sodium is deposited and separated from the nitrate of potash which crystal—
lizes while cooling.
Any one who has ever seen nitrate of potash can recognize it at once by the pe-
culiar form in which it crystallizes. It forms into long six—sided prisms and when freed from impurities is nearly transparent and has a cool and slightly bitter taste. Nitrate of Potash is very soluble in water, the solvent power of water increasing as its temperature rises.
While 100 parts of water at zero dis-
solves only I 3.33 parts, at 100 degrees it dissolves 246 parts, -
Nitrate of potash is used for a good many other things besides fertilizers. It is used in the manufacture of gunpowder,
matches and as a preservative for meats.
The pure nitrate of potash contains 13.87
per cent. nitrogen which is equivalent to
16.84 per cent. ammonia and 45.31 per cent_ potash as K20.
Until within the last ten years all the nitrate of potash used in the United States was imported. It is however,
manufactured in the United States now in limited quantities by the sheep dip manufacturers. It comes to them as a byproduct in the process of extracting the nicotine from the tobacco stems. For years the nitrate of potash would settle in the cans of sheep dip and became a source of annoyance until a process for eliminating it was discovered. At ﬁrst this deposit was considered to be a use-
less product and a large quantity of it was offered to the writer at a very nom-
inal price, which was quicklv accepted,
but he was unable to renew the contract two years later when the true nature of the goods was known to the manufactur‘

ers. Nitrate of potash manufactured from tobacco stems does not usually an-
alyze as high as the imported article on account of the impurities in the Shape of
ﬁne particles of tobacco that accompanies it. It could be made as pure as the im-
ported goods by ﬁltering and recrystalliz-
ing but the increased price would not warrant the increased expense. The to bacco contained in the nitrate of potash is not detrimental as a fertilizer conse-
quently the manufacturers have no trouble in selling their entire output at a good price without going to the trouble of recrystallization,
NITRATE OF SODA.
Nitrate of soda is more largely used than any other form of commercial am-
moniates because of the large quantity obtainable and the fact that the Chilian government several years ago instituted a nitrate of soda propaganda which has spread over the United States by adver-
tising and otherwise, information in re—
gard to the use of same.
All the nitrate of soda used in fertiliz—
ers and the arts comes from Chile al-
though it has been reported at various times that nitrate has been found in other parts of the world. On the high elevated plateaus of Chile the nitrate of soda is found in beds varying from a few feet deep to 25 or 30 feet mixed with earth and other foreign material. The mining is a simple process of blasting the earth and sorting it out and hauling to the mills where it is run through the crusher and dissolved with boiling water in tanks.
When the material reaches the desired temperature it is run off into huge vats where it crystallizes. It is then taken up from the evaporating pans and stored in immense piles where it is ready for sack-
ing and shipment abroad. The nitrate of soda is left out uncovered and no ware-
houses are built for its keeping. There is no fear from loss on account of rains or dews as it has never been known to rain on the plateaus and they are not troubled with dews. If the case had been the reverse Chile would not be giving us this valuable plant food because the rains would have dissolved it and carried it down and out to the sea,
The use of nitrate of soda is increasing wonderfully and will continue to increase more and more as the people become fa-
miliar with its value. In 1844 there was
14,646 tons of nitrate of soda shipped from Chile and in the year 1903 there was 1,384,349 tons, the average increase being about 50,000 tons a year.
There are two grades of nitrate of soda imported to the United States, one called the 95 per cent. goods and the other 96 per cent. The former is used more exclusively by the fertilizer trade while the latter is used in the arts and the manufacture of sulphuric acid.
ANIMAL AMMONIATES.
It was only a few years ago when the present forms of animal ammoniates were a waste product and it was a burden on the producer to get rid of same. Now it is a source of revenue that is adding not only wealth to the producer but aiding the farmer to acid to his wealth.
DRIED BLOOD.
It is hardly necessary for me to go over the different stages that lead up to the separating and manufacture of dried blood, tankage, blood and bone, etc.
The enormous amount of blood that comes from the slaughtered animals is now saved and is used as a source of


## p. 115 (#659) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURALSOCIETY. 115
ammonia in almost every section where fertilizer is used. The blood is run through presses which extract a large amount of the moisture and the residue is put through a drier and screened. The value of the blood depends on how care-
fully the separation of other materials is made in the slaughter houses. Dried blood frequently analyzes as high as 17.75
per cent. ammonia and it’s not unfre-
quently as low as 14 per cent. Dried blood is one of the best sources of animal am-
moniates and is considered by chemists and agriculturists to be ﬁrst on the list of value as an animal ammoniate.
BLOOD AND BONE.
The name blood and bone is familiar to the users of fertilizers but to the man—
ufacturers and trade the name is tankage.
All blood and bone is tankage but all tankage is not blood and bone. In the slaughter houses every scrap of meat,
bone and blood that cannot be used for some other purpose is gathered together and put into a large tank and cooked.
The cooking process is continued for some time or until all the matter is so broken up that the grease will ﬂoat on top. The grease is then drawn off and the residue dumped into large hydraulic presses and the water squeezed out and the remaining material run through a drier, ground and screened. Then we have tankage or blood and bone.
The value of the blood and bone de-
pends of course on what goes into the tank. The more bone that goes into it the higher in phosphoric acid and the lower in ammonia and vice versa. The many uses to which bones can be put out-
side of the use for fertilizer has made a valuable market for same consequently but a small proportion of the bone pro-
duced at the slaughter houses goes into the fertilizer and the tankage now pro-
duced usually runs high in ammonia and low phosphoric acid. The most popular kind on the market now is what is known as 10 and 10 tankage, that is 10 per cent.
ammonia and 10 per cent bone phosphate of lime.
The small slaughter houses, however,
do not as a rule produce as high grade tankage because they do not have ma-
terials enough to warrant close separa-
tion, consequently their tankage contains more bone and less ammonia, usually running 6 to 6 1-2 per cent. ammonia and
25 to 30 per cent. bone phosphate of lime.
When the slaughter house managers found an outlet for their waste material they thought their troubles were at an end, but the enormous amount of water that was pressed out of the tankage found its way into the city sewers and polluted the streams, which soon called for a change. This was brought about bv put-
ting in large evaporators and evaporating the water that comes from the presses.
When this water is evaporated it leaves a thick substance in the pans which is al-
most equal to dried blood in its value as an ammoniate. It has a very objection-
able quality, however in not being “con-
sistent.” It will not remain in a me-
chanical condition any length of time after it is made up, without the addition of foreign material. From its stick na-
ture and tendency to dissolve and become solid it has been called “Stick” or con-
centrated tankage. In recent years, how-
ever. methods have been discovered for handling this concentrated tankage so it is added to the other tankage and remains in a good mechanical condition and makes in every way a very desirable source of animal ammoniate.

STEAM ED BON E.
Notwithstanding every piece of bone in the animal that is large enough for buttons or knife handles is used for that purpose there is a large accumulation of knuckle bones and bones from the head that are put into tanks and thoroughly cooked to extract the grease and glue.
This cooking not only puts the bone in a better condition for grinding but it also adds to its value as a fertilizer. The.
value of steamed bone depends entirely on how the material is graded when it goes into the tank. The average steamed bone will analyze 3 per cent. ammonia and 45 to 50 per cent bone phosphateaof lime. “here the bone is carefully sep-
arated the analysis will average I to 1 1-2
per cent. ammonia and 60 per cent. bone phosphate of lime. The latter is usually termed degelatinized steamed bone.
RAW BONE.
The demand for bones by the farmers has caused the ends of the earth to be searched for this article. For years the plains of the West gave up carloads after carloads of buffalo bones. South Amer-
ica and India have also been the source of large quantities of bones. These
ﬁelds however, have been pretty thor-
oughly gone over so that the supply of bones from that source in the future promises to be very small indeed. At present the raw bone that is on the mar-
ket is made from bones gathered from the small butcher shops and slaughter pens scattered over the country. A car-
load here and a carload there, not very much at any one place but all together making a considerable quantity.
“'hile the raw bone analyzes higher in ammonia than the steamed bone it is not considered as valuable owing to the fact that the grease and glue is still in the bone. The grease retards decompo-
sition consequently delays the time when the plant food will become available, For crops that are a long time growing or for fertilizing orchards the raw bone is not only a good source of ammonia but also of phosphoric acid. On crops that are grown in 60 or 90 days_.raw bone would be of very little use as a fertilizer.
GARBAGE TAN KAGE.
The demand for fertilizer of all kinds and.the continued increased prices of same has caused the manufacturer, chem-
ist and any one interested to be on the alert for some material which would fur-
nish plant food.
One of the articles that comes in this line is garbage tankage. For years the garbage of the large cities has been gath-
ered and dumped into waste places, the sea or burned. Now nearly all the up-to—
date cities have large garbage plants where all the garbage of the city is gath-
ered together. The tin cans, glass, china-
ware, rags, etc., are all separated from the kitchen garbage. This latter is put into large tanks along with any dead an-
imals, spoiled ﬁsh and meat and cooked in the same manner as the blood and bone in the slaughter houses. The grease is skimmed off and the residue pressed and dried and we have what is known as gar-
bage tankage. This tankage is usually low in plant food containing 3 to 4 per cent ammonia and 5 to 6 per cent bone phosphate of lime and about I per cent.
potash. The farmers who live close to the city have an opportunity to get their source of ammonia cheap, as the price the tankage is sold at is usually below the market price of ammoniates of higher grade. It is also a cheap source of am-
monia where freight rates are not high Whenever the goods are shipped any dis~

tance the freight rate makes the cost per unit run up so the goods cannot be used to advantage very far from the garbage plants,
FISH SCRAP.
Fish 11 5 been used as a fertilizer long before any other material. The New England Indians were the ﬁrst to discover the value of ﬁsh as a source of fertilizer.
They buried a ﬁsh at the base of a hill of corn with the idea that the spirit of the
ﬁsh would enter the corn stalk and en-
courage it to produce a larger yield. They were satisﬁed of this fact because they knew that a hill of corn under which re-
posed a good-sized ﬁsh gave a more abundant yield than when no ﬁsh was put there.
The ﬁsh scrap produced now is quite a different article from what it was ten years ago. The old method of handling the ﬁsh was so crude and the stench so great that the factory was almost un-
bearable to all except those constantly working in it. Their methods were crude and the ﬁsh was usually dried by the sun after coming from the kettle. It frequently happened that before the ﬁsh was thoroughly dried a rain would come and wet it and the ﬂies would blow it and it would become a putriﬁed mass.
\V hen this class of material was ﬁnally dried and sacked it is no wonder that the odor was not only penetrating but very objectionable to anyone. Under the present method for quick handling of the ﬁsh and the quick process of drying it. it is delivered in perfect shape with-
out an objectionable odor, no more ob-
jectionable than the smell of dried her—
ring.
Fish scrap is a byproduct in the manu-
facture of Manhattan and ﬁsh oil. The oil is the ﬁnest article sought after but the scrap has proven to be of such value as a fertilizer that the revenue from same goes a long ways towards keeping the balance on the right side of the ledger.
Fish scrap produced at the present time very seldom analyzes below 9 per cent.
ammonia and frequently as high as 12
per cent. So great has been the demand for ﬁsh scrap that whale meat from the whaleries has been saved and made into whale tankerage or whale meat, which like ﬁsh makes a splendid source of am-
monia for general farm crops, especially where it can be applied and worked into the ground. Anyone who has once be-
come acquainted with the odor of ﬁsh scrap or whale meat tankerage can read-
ily detect it, not only when they are us-
ing it themselves but when their neigh-
bors are using it some distance away.
HOOF AND HORN‘ MEAL.
Hoof and horn meal has been used for a long time as a source of ammonia and yields in the neighborhood of 18 per cent.
If the ammonia were quickly available,
this would be an excellent source, but un-
fortunately it takes some time for hoof meal to decompose and give up its am-
monia. The hoofs and horns of the slaughter houses, after being steamed and ironed out and the better parts cut out and saved for the manufacture of “tor-
toise-shell” combs, the balance is ground and sold as hoof meal. It is sometimes mixed with blood and bone to bring up the percentage of ammonia. For long-
feeding crops, or for use on moist land,
the hoof meal is an excellent source of ammonia. It decomposes slowly and there is no danger of its being leached out by moisture, consequently it can be used on land where nitrate of soda or sulphate of ammonia would be a loss. On the other hand, if it were applied on quick

growing crops or on soil that was dry and inclined to be thirsty, very little good would be derived from its use.
IEATH ER SCRAP.
There is always some one on the look-
out for something that they can put on the market at a less price than the market is paying and still give them a good proﬁt.
It has been known for a good many years that leather contained a considerable quantity of ammonia and it was also known that a piece of leather will re-
main in the ground for years and the plant would be no better [or its being there as the ammonia was Fi‘ert. The demand for ammoniates has caused a number of experiments with leather to be made and different methods have been used to put it into marketable shape. This has been effectually done during the last few years. The leather is scorched and pulverized and treated in different ways so from the appearance you would never recognize it as once being leather. The nostril is the only means of detecting it.
Notwithstanding all the treatment you give it it still holds the leather odor. In some states it is against the law for fertilizer manufacturers to use leather scrap as a source of ammonia in their goods and it is well that it is so. A man-
ufacturer who uses leather scrap can guarantee a given analysis and the chem-
ist will bear him out in the guarantee by showing the fertilizer to contain that amount but the plant _w0uld be unable to
' assimilate any very large portion of the ammonia. As ammonia in leather scrap is sold considerably below the market of other ammoniates it is very easy to un-
derstand why a brand of fertilizer can be cheaper than another and yet have the same analysis. \Vhile an analysis is a good method of recognizing the value of a fertilizer the true value is the ability of the plant to utilize or assimilate it un-
der climatic and soil conditions in which it is used. 10 per cent. ammonia from leather scrap would not give the grower of lettuce and cabbage one-half the ser-
vice that 5 per cent. from nitrate of soda or dried blood would,
Q GUANO.
One of the ﬁrst fertilizers used to any extent in this country in a commercial way was Peruvian guano which was ini-
ported from Peru. The ﬁrst deposits that were discovered had been hundreds of years in accumulating and were thor-
oughly rotted, frequently analyzing as high as 12 per cent. ammonia. \\'hcn this grade of guano was used on the gar-
den the results were wonderful as the ammonia, owing to the long time the de-
posits had been there was iii an available form. The demand for Peruvian guano soon exhausted the supply of the higher grade goods. It is now very seldom that we ﬁnd guano analyzing IO per cent, am-
monia on the market. There are guanos offered that analyze from 2 to 8 per cent.
ammonia, from 8 to 18 per cent. phos—
phoric acid and from I to 2 per cent.
potash.
At different times we hear considerable about bat guano that has been discovered in caves on different islands. This guano when it is in caves that are perfectly dry is a very valuable article often analyzing as high as I7 per cent. ammonia, but there are very few caves of this kind, in-
deed nearly all of them, contain more or less moisture. When the guano becomes wet with lime water the chemical action is to free the ammonia, consequently it is of very little value. Those buying bat guano should only buy it on a guaranteed analysis as one ton may be worth $40
while another would be dear at $5.

VEGETABLE AMMONIATES.
corron SEED MEAL.
Among the most valuable of the veg-
etable ammoniates is cotton seed meal.
This like other fertilizer products for years was a waste product but now is a source of~much proﬁt not only to the oil mills but to the farmers themselves. The process of making the cotton seed meal is a very simple one. The seeds are crushed and passed into a hot tank or re-
ceptacle and heated and from there it goes into a hydraulic press where the oil is pressed out and the cotton seed cake is the result. This cake is then ground and we have cotton seed meal.
The value of the meal depends on how much lint is ground in with the meal and also on the general condition of the seed when they were ground. Bright cotton seed meal will average 8 per cent. am-
monia when properly made but the in-
creased price of meal of all kinds has been a great temptation to the mill people to increase their tonnage by increasing the amount of hull or lint in the meal. This reduces the percentage of ammonia and where the meal should analyze 8 per cent.
it frequently goes as low as 6 1-2 and 7
per cent. During the last few years the demand for meal has increased and the price advanced so the mills are not very particular about making 8 per cent, goods and are satisﬁed with 7 1-2 per cent.
The bright meal is made from the short staple cotton while the dark meal is made from the long Staple and does not contain as much ammonia at any time as the bright meal owing to the hull being much harder and forming a larger pro-
portion of the hull. The analysis of the dark meal is from 5 to 6 per cent. am-
monia. The dark meal is as good as the bright for fertilizing purposes unit for unit.
CASTOR POMACE.
Castor Pomace is now very largely sold as an ammoniate and is made in a similar way to cotton seed meal, that is the castor beans are ground and the 011
pressed out and the cake pulverized. The analysis of castor pomace varies from 5
1-2 to 6 I-2 per cent, ammonia with a small percentage of phosphoric acid and potash. It is considered a valuable source of plant food where crops are long feed—
ers. This is especially the case in rais-
ing pineapples.
TOBACCO STEM S.
In former years tobacco stems were used more largely as a fertilizer than now. Formerly they could be purchased at $2.00 per ton in bulk at the stemeries and now their value is placed at from
$16.00 to $20.00 according to the kind of tobacco. The nicotine extract has be-
come so valuable that the manufacturers can afford to pay a much higher price for the stems than the farmer. They are considered a very good source of fer_
tilizer where the price will warrant their use.
TOBACCO DUST.
In the manufacture of all kinds of to-
bacco there is more or less 'dust which heretofore has been thrown away but is now carefully saved and sold to the grow-
ers. Besides containing ammonia and potash it is also used as an insecticide and is considered of considerable value for that purpose. The ammonia, how-
ever, of the average tobacco dust does not exceed 4 per cent, and frequently is not over -1 1-2 to 2 per cent.
GROUND TOBACCO STEMS.
The sheep-dip manufacturers had an accumulation of soaked tobacco stems on

their hands which were very hard to get rid of and learned men were put to work to devise a means by which the nicotine could be extracted and the remaining stem handled without loss to the com-
pany. This work resulted in the pulver-
ized or ground tobacco stems that is now on the market which is very high in pot-
ash and contains a good percentage of ammonia. This was somewhat of a sur-
prise to everyone as no one supposed that the tobacco stern could be so manipulated as to give an analysis of 3 per cent. am-
monia and IO per cent. potaslr yet this is a fact and today hundreds of tons of ground tobacco stems are used and it is considered one of the best sources of am-
monia and potash. It is easily applied and quickly available,
Besides the information gathered above we should take a lesson from what has been said, not only from a fertilizer view,
, but from an economical standpoint. There are only a few of the products mentioned above that are not byproducts. The great wealth of the fertilizer business is from byproducts or things we are now saving that were formerly thrown away. If one goes to the slaughter house he cannot help being impressed with the carefulness with which everything is saved even to the minutest piece of bone, drop of blood and even the hairs. Everything is pre—
served to add to the proﬁts of the com-
pany. If our growers and farmers were as careful in preserving everything on the farm as the slaughter house people are to save and care for the waste pro-
ducts, they would be able to live closer at home and not have to ask the fertilizer men for credit for his yearly supply of fertilizers.

DISCUSSION. ,
Mr. Kilgore—I would like to know if there is not a commercial value on our muck beds on account of the am-
monia there is in muck. It seems to me there should be plenty of by-pro-
ducts to render the investigation of this phase of the question proﬁtable.
Mr. Painter—The problem has been looked into, but the trouble is that there is no main product that can be derived from the muck that would make the by-product proﬁtable. There is about 3 per cent. ammonia in a ton of muck when it is thoroughly dried,
but that ammonia is inert; almost as much so as in the leather.
we are getting sulphate of ammonia in a ton of coal varying from one to one and one—half per cent. I do not from coal. The amount of ammonia think we can ever get any ammonia from the muck except to use it on the farm and let the ammonia be freed by decomposition. Lime applied to the muck will hasten that decomposition.
Adjourned.

SOME PROBLEMS OF FERTILIZING.
By E. S. Hubbard.
Zl/I r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In presenting this individual report as
.a member of the standing committee on fertilizers I shall depart from the ques-
tion of fertilizers as mixtures to their ef-
fects in fertilizing.
The A. B. C. of fertilizers is well un-
derstood by all intelligent horticulturists.
The nature of the various materials, their percentages and the proportions neces-
sary for complete or special fertilizers have been fairly well worked out in prac-
tice but our knowledge of the physiolog—
ical effects and defects of their action on plant life is in its infancy and I wish to suggest a few of the problems that have occurred to me on which exact sci-
entiﬁc knowledge would be of great value.
The primary elements of plant growth are nitric and phosphoric acids. Nitric acid to nourish and stimulate the life principle and phosphoric acid to act as a clarifying and transferring medium in the interconversion of carbon dioxide into fluid gums and sugars to the ﬁxed forms of starches and cellular tissue.
These acids, however, are corrosive and unstable. They can only be assim-
ilated as acids in a high state of dilution in small quantities. They must be neu-
tralized by combination with alkaline bases when they are gradually dissolved or absorbed by the plant rootlets.
They are most healthfully assimilated as nitrate of potash and phosphate of lime. This is the ideal condition of plant fertilization. The other salts found in plants are either accidental or of small tonic value. Unfortunately, however,
our soil conditions are hardly ever ideal and we have to use many commercial materials that must undergo chemical changes either by bacterial nitriﬁcation in the case of ammoniacal compounds or of decay and disintegration in the case of phosphates before they can be most healthfully assimilated by plants and there are several commercial chemical salts one element of which is unnecessary or detrimental.
In a state of nature the equation of plant nutrition is self-regulating. Given a soil with sufﬁcient mineral bases, moist-
ure and drainage, all the plant waste and decay remains as humus to hold the ni-
trogen and other food elements and the soil increases in fertility till limitations of room, light and air deﬁne the amount of vegetation that can flourish.
In agriculture and horticulture all this is changed. Plants chieﬂy foreign to the soil and climate are grown and the mar-
ketable products are removed, thus car-
rying away the stored-up fertility of the soil, while the remaining fertility is often still further dissipated in the air and drainage by improper exposure and cul-
ture.
Here man, to continue growing crops,
steps in with artiﬁcial fertilizers com-
posed largely of unassimilable, unneces-
sary and even detrimental materials and often applies them far in excess of the plant’s needs or requirements.
The commercial results are then meas-
ured by the endurance or tolerance of the plants.
I consider this the great unwritten

chapter of the agricultural chemistry of the future, for which only scattered and unharmonized data have been gathered,
the tolerance of plants for unsuitable fertilizers.
To illustrate: Some twenty-ﬁve years ago when I ﬁrst began orange culture on my own account, when the spring growth was pretty well matured, some time in April, I dumped about four quarts of brine from a mackerel kit near the trunk of an orange tree that could carry a box of oranges, as an experiment, to see what effect it would have as a fer-
tilizer.
In a week's time all the leaves had dropped from that tree and most of the new growth was dying. It was two months before the tree had got back half its foliage again and the effect was as bad as a severe freeze. This was a most striking example of the tolerance of an orange tree for chlorine and soda. I say chlorine and soda because it is a well known chemical fact that there are points of saturation in common salt solutions in which the chlorine and soda are in very loose combination and there might be some separation in the sap of a tree.
Some people have an idea that plant rootlets have considerable power of se—
lection of the solutions with which they come in contact and take only what they need or is beneﬁcial. This experiment convinced me plants have to take what-
ever is offered them in the soil water and that plants with green foliage or in a growing condition are continually sus-
ceptible to sap poisoning.
In the case of the orange tree and the brine it is evident that as the brine as-
cended in the sap to the leaves and was evaporated from them a point of satura-
tion or crystalization was reached that killed the life principles of the sap and the leaves dropped off.
In this most simple case a chemical analysis of the leaves for salt and a com-
putation of the total foliage on the tree would have determined the extreme tol-
erance of a tree of that size for chloride of sodium. After the leaves were all fallen there still remained the salt solu-
tion in the twigs, branches, trunk and roots. As the fresh growth of twigs had an evaporation function partly as great as the leaves the solution was strong enough to kill most of them also.
The solution in the branches, trunk and roots being weakest of all had proba-
bly to be mostly excreted by the roots and the solution in the soil leached out at one-half the cost of imported nitrate by rains before the tree could grow again.
This brings us to the root excretions of plants.
Root excretions of plants have long been recognized but so far as I know no exhaustive experiments have been con-
ducted to determine their character and effects. It is well known that many crops cannot be grown successively on the same ground without losing so much vigor as to be unproﬁtable or suffering from disease.
In my opinion the study of diseases has drawn attention away from the speciﬁc salts and humic acids these plants may leave in the soil that are poisonous to succeeding crops of the same variety.
' There is also, of course, the natural acidity of some soils that is detrimental to many crops unless corrected with lime and it may be lime would be a good ap-
plication for root excretions. Lime has succeeded in some cases where tomatoes grown successively have been affected with blight. Tomatoes will not do well

on very acid soils and lime is not a cure for blight. An acid soil is not very de-
trimental to Irish potatoes, and stable manure or lime favors scab, of Irish p0-
tatoes in Florida grown successive winters seems to fall off even with inter-
mediate summer crops.
There are a great many questions in plant nutrition that ought to be settled and as to which we can only conjecture.
Rev. Lyman Phelps discovered that an excess application of sulphate of am-
monia in summer or a spray of bi-sul-
phate of soda prematurely sweetened or-
anges. W inognadsky of Zurich, the dis-
coverer of nitrifying bacteria, found that liquid grown plants would healthfully assimilate considerable sulphate of am-
monia. The ammonia of sulphate of~am-
monia takes the place of an alkaline salt like lime or potash combining with the sulphuric acid.
\Vhat becomes of the sulphur?
sulphate of ammonia solution is ab-
sorbed by orange trees? Small percent-
ages of sulphur are found in the nitro-
genous protoplasm of the sap of the plants.
Reasoning from analogy, is it not pro-
bable enough sulphuric is freed to have a similar effect in sweetening oranges to sulphuric acid in the manufacture of glu-
cose or grape sugar from starch?
There must be considerable sulphuric acid excreted by the roots. Is a small yearly application of lime to orange trees indicated to neutralize the unstable sul-
phur acid compounds if they exist?
I found premature sweetening of or-
anges with sulphate of ammonia depress-
ing to the trees.
Nitrate of Soda—In an Irish potato fertilizer experiment years ago on the plot using nitrate of soda alone, the foliage
\Vhen had a sickly, gray color and the tubers a soapy taste. A recent German experi—
ment shows that grains and grass largely absorb the soda of nitrate of soda, but Irish potatoes, beets, etc., excrete it from the roots, leaving soda in the soil.
Organic Nitrogen—The albumens of organic nitrogen compounds in decay split up into poisons similar in chemical com-
position to strychnine and morphine and decompose still further to ammonia. The soil must not be too acid and nitrifying bacteria must be present under favorable conditions of tillage, moisture and alka-
line bases to secure nitriﬁcation. Who has not had plant roots burned by organic ammonia?
Die-back and foot-rot of the orange tree are often traced to the use of or-
ganic nitrogen and there is no doubt in my mind that the trees absorb so much of these decomposition poisons that the sap is wholly or partially paralyzed, the sugar, starch and wood forming func-
tions deranged and similar symptoms ex—
hibited to animal blood poisoning.
Phosphoric Acid—Experiments have shown that a small percentage of the phosphoric acid needed by plants can be absorbed in its water soluble state. A full ration of soluble phosphoric acid in pineapple culture on the East Coast spruce pine ridges is corrosive and poisonous. There is little lime or humus in these soils to revert or hold the acid for root acid action. On the other hand,
I consider the partial sterility of hog ore iron hard pan soils due next after their acidity to the immediate iron basis re-
version of the soluble phosphoric acid of fertilizers, so that quick-growing plants cannot get phosphoric acid fast enough to harden and perfect their growth.
Potash—Potash, besides forming a

base for nitric acid before entering the plant also forms a base for the plant's organic acids after being separated by the sap from the nitric acid and is carried along till it ﬁnally forms part of the plant's tissues. Impure nitrate of potash can be bought as fertilizer, but the sup—
ply is limited. It leaches so rapidly as to be desirable only for fractional appli-
cations.
Nitrate of potash can be formed by mixing heated solutions of nitrate of soda and muriate of potash and recrystallizing the resulting nitrate of potash and chloride of sodium. It would be a boon to horticulture if this could be done with little increase in cost. We need informa-
tion as to the effects of the sulphuric acid and chlorine of sulphate and muriate of potash both before and after nitriﬁca-
tion.
The cheap nitrate of the future prom-
ises to be the electrolytic nitrate of lime. It is said a 20,000 horse water power will soon be used for this purpose in Sweden,
and that nitrate of lime can be produced of soda. Experiments on the efﬁciency of these new lime nitrogens are being con-
ducted in Germany with results averag-
ing about the same as nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia. There is no doubt moderate quantities of nitrate of lime can be healthfully appropriated by most plants and that its use will open up new problems in plant nutrition.
In this paper I have touched on only a few of the more prominent problems of fertilizing but enough I trust to stim-
ulate thought on this subject. There is no doubt in my mind that we are entering an era of soil and fertilizer specialization in plant growing that in thoroughness will compare favorably with the intricate manufacturing processes of the industrial arts.
By B. M. Hampton.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
For some reason unknown to me I have been asked to contribute a paper on “Fer~
tilizers” to be read before this meeting.
Now, I can assure you I would very much rather have sat still and listened to the other fellow, and let him have written this up. You have, or a good many have,
had a trial at this fertilizer business; and while it is something that is vital to every farmer, truck grower, and especially so to those who make a specialty of Citrus culture that I am loath to attempt to write on a subject that is of such vast import-
ance to one and all. '
But, after all. perhaps I am not ex-
pected to tell what I know, or rather what I might think I know about fertilizing,
and was perhaps expected to write about what I didn’t know; but that would be a still greater task, so I will strike a hap-
py medium between what I don’t know and what is just possible I might know,
and what those have known before me.
There is one point I think you will all agree with me on, and that is, it is one of the most vital questions of the day.
and one that after all the centuries that have rolled away since man became a tiller of the soil, the least understood:
still we are gaining ground a little, a ray of light here and one there, in time it will become of much more of an exact science than it is today. It seems strange when we come to think of it that so little was known by the ﬁrst settlers of this

country of the importance of fertilizer,
even of the three main ingredients, Ni-
trogen, Phosphoric Acid and Potash;
these three ingredients did not seem to be understood at all by our Pilgrim Fathers when they ﬁrst landed on the rather bleak shores of the New England coast. It must have humbled their pride and lowered their self—conceit when they had to turn to the Savages, as they termed them, for assistance to keep from starving; for it seems that a friendly Indian came to their aid and show-ed them how. not only to prepare the ground, but to fertilize it as well. So here was the beginning of “How to Fertilize,” so far as the people of this great nation are concerned. The advice as to how to pre-
pare the ground was crude and the fertil-
izing was then meager; but meager as it was then, it was in advance of what the colonists themselves knew: at least,
they had not been able to raise corn, the great staff of life, even more so then than now. So they were compelled to turn to the aborigines and learn of them, so when one Squanto, an Indian well versed in the mode of corn culture, came to their aid and gave them a practical lesson of the land to choose, and how to prepare it. then how to use the fertilizer so as to produce corn as well as stalk. This may be said to have been the ﬁrst practical Farmers’ Institute ever held in America,
and it seems odd to think that it was the Indian teaching the white man the art of successfully raising corn on the New England coast. Even at that day the fer-
tilizing question was of great importance as it is today, for without the fertilizer the corn was so slow of growth that it failed to mature in their short season.
It was much in knowing what kind of soil and where to locate it and how to prepare the land, crude though it was,
yet it was vital to the colonists to learn even this much, and even more so to learn how to fertilize it; so you see the fertil-
izer question was a vital one then, as it is today. The clearing of the land and burning of the brush on the ground was part of the fertilizing, but this did not seem to be thoroughly understood even by the teacher of the “Institute ;” yet he did know it was necessary that the brush should be burned 011 the ground intended for corn, but the wherefore neither he nor his pale-faced pupils understood that it was the Potash and the Phosphoric Acid in the ashes of the hard wood burned on the ground that caused the grain to ma-
ture; but he did know it was needful to burn the brush, and in this he was ahead of the Pilgrims.
Then, again, he knew that ﬁsh was a good fertilizer for the corn, and while-
he did not understand, as we do today,
that it was the nitrogen they contained that was needed to give the grain a more rapid growth, he did know and so taught,
that “no ﬁsh, no corn.” This latter as-
sumption on his part, it seems, was re-
sented by the settlers at ﬁrst, but after failing they were glad to take the advice from this ﬁrst Institute and Experiment Station Instructor. So Squanto taught them to fertilize the hill for the corn with a couple of ﬁsh, ﬁrst placing the ﬁsh in the soil, then covering it with dirt, then to drop the corn and cover with the ﬁne soil, then to ﬁrm the soil with the foot and the operation was completed, and in due time the harvest, and thus ended the
ﬁrst Institute. '
And so the colonists thus had learned all there was to be learned in the art of fertilizing and growing corn: but once more they had to go to the Experiment

Station to ask for further information as to the cause of their once proliﬁc ﬁelds failing to bring forth their usual yield of the precious grain; and once more Squanto came to their rescue and proved equal to the occasion after hearing their story. He held another Practical Insti-
tute, showing them that though they put an extra quantity of ﬁsh in the hill for the corn, and though they still had ﬁne stalks but no corn, that the land was worn out as we say today, and they must clear new land, burn the brush as before,
drop their ﬁsh and corn as before and all would be well. This they seemed loath to believe, but they had but one experi—
ment station to go to to get information that was so vital to their very existence,
and so they started anew as before, and—
lo l—Squanto was right, as at ﬁrst, just as our Experiment Station should be to-
day. It must have been humiliating in the extreme to the Pilgrims to get their information from such a source, but they must learn or starve.
But time rolled on and the Pilgrims taught their instructor; for they noticed that the corn was always the best where there had been the most ashes left on the ground near some large brush-heap; this gave them an idea perhaps, after all, it was just the ashes, as they had learned from the Indians that a ﬁeld worn out would be as good as new after it had been allowed to grow up again with a young growth of timber, this in turn cut'
down and burned as before, and presto!
the land yielded crops as before, with the aid of the ﬁsh to supply the nitrogen.
When they ﬁrst noticed the fact that the corn was the best near where an extra large brush-heap had been burned, that was a step forward in the art of fertiliz-
ing; the next step was to save the ashes from their log piles and from chimney cor-
ners, and in the following spring these ashes were applied to their worn-out land and the usual amount of ﬁsh to each hill,
when—lol—a better crop of corn than they had grown at the start was produced on this worn-out ﬁeld by applying Nitro-
gen in the form of ﬁsh, Phosphoric Acid and Potash in the form of hard-wood ashes, and thus a long step in advance in fertilizing had been made. But neither the colonists nor the Indians knew the why or wherefore; they knew such was the fact and so were content. So for a long period but little advance was made in the art of fertilizing as a science, that is, in furnishing the crops with the com—
mercial fertilizer as we know it today.
But some ﬁfty years ago or so an awak-
ening seemed to take place, then came Guano, Bone Meal, and such like. more into general use. I remember quite well when both were introduced in my im-
mediate neighborhood in Pennsylvania.
Lime and Plaster had long been used in a haphazard way; I don’t think any of the farmers of those days had little, if any, idea why they used Lime, Guano,
Fishescrap, Bone Meal, etc.
They knew, like Squanto, that such and such things gave certain results, and I think that was about all there was to it; but the use of these various ingredi-
ents showed they were feeling their way,
slowly but surely, so that in the last twenty-ﬁve years there has been a tre-
mendous awakening, until today the art of fertilizing is becoming more of a science, not an exact one by any means.
but far in advance of what it was a few years ago. But we have much to learn,
we are just in the A. B. C.’s as yet so to speak, and it is of this uncertainty that I hesitated to produce this paper before

this assembly of progressive farmers and fruit growers today.
Had I been called on twelve or ﬁfteen years ago to write this article, I would have given vastly more information on the art of fertilizing than I can today,
at least I thought so. If you want to know just how to fertilize an orange grove for any purpose under the sun, al-
ways go to some novice, some one that has not been in the business more than
ﬁve or six years, and you can generally
ﬁnd out just what you have been striving for all these years to learn; rank ignor-
ance on your part. But in a few years go to this same person and broach the subject, and he is mute as a clam.
Squanto and the Pilgrim Fathers would be outclassed by him for a lack of exact information, and yet he is learning.
I very much doubt if we could ﬁnd half a dozen in this house who could agree as to the exact way to treat a grove for the best results; some would stand out for a clean culture the year round, and others seem to think to get best results from your grove and from the commer—
cial fertilizer applied there is nothing like Humus.
stand for all decaying vegetable matter in the soil; to my way of reasoning it is the storehouse of Nitrogen, one of the most expensive and most necessary of all plant foods. It contains the food upon which the soil organisms live, whose function is to convert organic nitrogen into nitrates in order to be available for the use of plants. It even assists in decomposing the mineral constituents of the soil, thus making them available for plant food. It serves to increase the drouth-resisting power of sandy soils; it also conserves the fertilizer we apply to the soil and holds them within reach of plant life to Humus is a term we under- ~
feed in; so I can’t help but think that Humus is especially needful to our high pine lands. You all know the history of the grove of Dudley \V. Adams, how he took an old worn-out farm and by the use of all kinds of vegetable matter changed the soil from a barren waste to one of the most proliﬁc tracts of land in that vicinity.
Of course, he added Phosphoric Acid and Potash. Of 'the many ingredients that enter into plant life, from carbon to iron, none of them are so vital to the average fruit grower as Nitrogen, Phos-
phoric Acid and Potash. I wish our experiment stations would go to work and analyze a box of oranges, for instance grown on the average sandy soil in Flor-
ida, and let us know in plain English just how many pounds of Nitrogen, Phos-
phoric Acid and Potash that box con-
tains; give it to us in plain ﬁgures in the pounds and ounces, so those not versed in chemistry may understand at a glance just what that box contains. Don’t carry out the analysis in the hundredths and thousandths of parts, but just say a box contains so many pounds or so many ounces of each ingredient, without any technicalities attached to it at all; then send this broadcast over the state, and a long step will be made in the art of citrus culture. I well remember when I was in the West, engaged more or less in the mining business. I used to analyze the different samples of rock for myself and others. Now, it would have been useless for me to have given an analysis as a rule of a sample of rock in the technical terms that I used in the ofﬁce.
What they wanted to know and paid for was to ﬁnd out just how much of the valuable minerals the rock contained, and wanted that in dollars and cents, or in

pounds and ounces, as the case might be.
I very much doubt if I could make out one of my own certiﬁcates today as I took them down in my book at the time. So now let the Experiment Station give us one, two or three analyses of a box of citrus fruit from different sections of the state, grown on different soils and, as I said, give it to us in plain English; just say right out: box No. I, for instance,
contains so many pounds and ounces of each of the ingredients, then we will know what we are doing.
We will know for every box of oranges we expect to get from a tree we must ap-
ply to the soil so much Nitrogen. Phos-
phoric Acid and so much Potash. Of course, we must give the soil enough to supply not only the fruit, but the natural growth of the tree as well. After we have learned just how much to apply. we can soon ﬁnd out when to apply it. I used to think I knew just what to apply to make my fruit small or large, sweet or sour. or to make it bright or other-
wise. I am not so sure now, so we will pass that by.
Again, as to the time when to apply,
if the season is normal I prefer November for the fall application, and of late I have been using a fertilizer heavy in Phos-
phoric Acid and Potash, with a low per cent. in Ammonia: in the fall this has given me quite satisfactory results. But so many questions spring up that I am loath to set any cast-iron rule. But if I were going to apply it myself, little and often, ﬁrst when the tree seemed to need it; but if I were going to hire it done,
and only give one application, then I should give it in November. For one application, I think, this would give the best satisfaction.
Here in South Florida, if you apply the fertilizer much earlier and weather continues warm, the trees are likely to start to grow and in the end cause an injury. Farther north it might be ap-
plied earlier, but as I said before, there are so many sides to this question that it is hard to give any iron-bound rule that will apply to every section or locality. The seasons often are so different that what would suit one year might not the next;
then again there is so much we don't know for sure, as intimated at ﬁrst; we are just in the a b c department as to-
fertilizers and fertilizing. But I must draw this, to me, interesting subject to a close, and yet I have just begun. But the time is precious. You notice I have departed somewhat from the beaten track usually followed on this subject and gone out into the by-ways, so to speak, think-
ing a little variety might not be amiss to one and all.
I am like the Pilgrim Fathers, Still seeking light on this most vital question-
up before the American farmer and fruit grower of today.
So, thanking you for your kind atten-
tion, I am sincerely yours, seeking for more exact knowledge on this subject.

By Mrs. Nettie M. G. Prange.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am assured it is the wish of the Society to have a plain talk on fertilizer and its value, by a beginner, to those even newer to the work, so I will make no excuses, but gladly relate my humble experience.
When I decided to make a grove I wrote to several prominent orange grow-
ers to ascertain which was, in their opin-
ion, the best nursery in the state. In the spring I engaged the best trees in,
that nursery, to be delivered the next fall.
My land lay beside a ﬂourishing grove,
so I thought, after securing my trees properly, I had settled all vexing ques-
tions, for, of course, all good groves were made with "Smith’s" fertilizer.
A valued correspondent w r o t e :
“Though ‘Smith’s’ fertilizer is good, he asks more per unit of plant food than
‘Brown’ does.” About all I understood of this sentence was that there might be a chance to save some money; and you know that idea appeals to any of us. But,
was “Brown’s” fertilizer as good? I felt the need of being able to judge for my-
self. My ﬁrst step was to take prices from a list of agricultural chemicals, and get cost of contents in the two formulae under discussion. I struck all the av-
erages, ﬁnding price per pound of each ingredient, and worked it all out in reg-
ular schoolma’am- fashion. The ﬁgures showed my correspondent to be right, but for further information I submitted the work to a person experienced in that line.
I do not begrudge his quiet smile, for he wrote me the kindest of letters, tell—
ing me the easy way to reckon fertilizer values, and many other things of interest and importance. Neither do I begrudge the work I did. Try it yourselves and you will see it is just what one needs to make him realize that fertilizer is not just fer—
tilizer!
\Vhen one sees it is a combination of plant foods, mixed in stated proportions;
that three of these nutrients, ammonia,
phosphoric acid, and potash, have a mar-
ket value, and only these three; and that the name of Smith, Brown or Jones has nothing to do with it beyond his relia-
bility as to work and materials, and that,
as we shall see later on. we do not have to trust him very far even in this—one next wonders which of the numerous formulae presented is best suited to his purpose. ‘This calls for a knowledge of the effects of the different plant foods .
There are many good books on this subject for sale, but I will speak only of those to be had for the asking, though I am to append a list of the others I have found useful.
Send to German Kali Works, 93 Nas-
sau Street, New York, for their “Orange Culture,” and then for the other dainty booklets listed in it. Peruse carefully the pamphlets from all the fertilizer ﬁrms.
There is something to be learned in every one. To be sure, one must always bear in mind, the ﬁrms issue these books to sell their goods, and while all presented may be facts. yet each emphasizes that fact which is to its own interest; also remember, no law controls these state-
ments, and if a company wants to mis-
represent its goods in the pamphlets, it can do so. It is the tag on the fertilizer that has to tell the truth.

on the monthly mailing list. Also to the Experiment Station, Gainesville, Fla., for a list of the publications issued from there, and to the Commissioner of Agri-
culture, Tallahassee, Fla., for the Quar-
terly Bulletins sent out from that ofﬁce.
I secured a copy of every availabke bul-
letin, circular and press notice, pertaining to this subject and have learned from each one.
From our State Bulletins, Nos. 22 and
43, both by A. A. Persons, we gain a very good knowledge of plant food, its sources and effect on different soils. But they were written years ago and the pro-
portions given were based on chemical analyses of the soil and the crop desired;
so it was a pleasure to ﬁnd in United States Farmers’ Bulletin, No. 238, by our Prof. Rolfs, statements of the effect the different foods have on trees and fruit, and other necessary knowledge. In fact, it is a description of the citrus in-
dustry in a nut shell. While in Farmers’
Institute Bulletin No. 2, which will be sent from our Experiment Station on re-
ceipt of postage, I marked on page 23,
in the interesting address of Chemist Rose, his statement of the need of— ’
“Nitrogen to produce foliage, suc-
culent leaves, * * * and immature wood.
“Phosphoric acid * * * to produce mature wood in fruit trees.
“Potash to assist in formation of starch and sugar * * *”
Later I learned farther that while ni-
trogen is most essential, it has to be used with the greatest of care, for too luxuri-
ant a growth means weakened tissues,’
and weakened tissues are prey to insects and diseases, organic nitrogen being es-
pecially likely to produce bad effects on the citrus family.
Too much phosphoric acid may bring about abnormal conditions, such as pro-
fuse bloom, or an over-supply of seeds,
and thus be detrimental to the general health of the tree; while too much potash may retard growth somewhat by harden-
ing the ﬁbers too soon; but the worst ef-
fect of an excess of either phosphoric acid or potash is on the pocketbook. When we pay for more than we need we are out just so much money.
The discourses by Brother Painter in Farmers’ Institute Bulletin No. I, and by Brother Wilson in our Annual Re-
port 1906, are instructive; especially the latter. Study carefully United States Farmers’ Bulletin No. 44 by Dr. Voor-
hees. It is a thorough discussion of com-
cial fertilizers. I could name many more free helps, but time is passing.
Without cost one can lay a good founda-
tion upon which to build the real knowl-
edge which comes only by experience.
“lhen needing help on any point, write to our advanced brothers. They show unfailing patience and kindness in helping the weaker ones. Up to the point I have taken the study of plant foods in this talk, all au_
thorities are practically agreed. Beyond,
there is a great diversity of opinions of those seemingly equally well—posted, as to proper formulae and methods of cul'
tivation. It seems to me that this is caused by different situations,-and that we must each adapt the general principles to his own need.
But we all have to pay for our fertil-
izer. Now we come to this:
How are we to know we get what. we order, and which formula gives us best value for our money?
The state protects us in this if we avail ourselves of the privileges given. Our

worthy Commissioner of Agriculture at Tallahassee will send you copies of the fertilizer law and bulletins containing just what we are looking for. The law al-
lows us to have the fertilizer analyzed free of cost, so we need never be in doubt of what is sent us; but read instructions carefully and send samples for analysis just as 'they direct. Florida is the only state in the Union that gives this chance for free analysis. The out-of-state fer-
tilizer companies have striven hard to have the Legislature strike out this clause. \Ve, as horticulturists, ought to see that the law remains as it is. The inspection costs us an exceedingly small amount. I say “costs us,” for since the fertilizer com-panies‘add the inspection fees to their expense accounts, we, who use the fertilizer, pay the bills, so why should a company object unless it wants to hide the true content of its product?
The honest manufacturer is protected as well as the consumer_
If the statements on the tag are proven untrue there is trouble ahead. Study the tag and believe exactly what it says.
Don’t think “animal matter” on the tag has to mean what is described in the pam-
phlet. It means “animal matter” and probably the cheapest animal matter ob-
tainable. or the description would be more explicit. Study the tag for all these points and doubt any obscurity; for trade does not “hide its light under a bushel.”
Well, if the materials are all right, let us see about the formula. It reads: Mois-
ture, 8 to IO per cent. “Ah ha!” says our neighbor, “Jones' fertilizer has only
5 to 8 per cent moisture. You must like to buy water!”
\Ve tell him with a superior air that one pays only for actual plant food when he buys fertilizer; and never “let on”
that a few weeks ago we made the very same mistake ourselves. Next comes:
“Ammonia, 4 to 5 per cent.” and we re—
member? that ammonia is sort of an in-
ﬂated nitrogen. Sounds like they give us more for our money, when they call it “Ammonia.” “Available Phosphoric Acid, 6 to 7 per cent.” That’s the phos-
phoric acid we get. “Insoluble Phos-
phoric Acid, I to 2 per cent.” That’s the phosphoric acid, we don’t know sure whether we get or not. “Potash, Actual K20, 5 to 6 per cent. H’m, this has it all in “Potash, Actual KZO." Another calls it “Potash Actual,” and another
“Potash KZO;” but we have found out it’s all the same.
Those scientiﬁc fellows Would have a good laugh could they look into our minds and read our “translation” of the formula; but so long as we understand the meaning, our crude expression does not matter.
Now, let us see what this ton of fer-
tilizer is worth. \IVC have learned to use the smallest per cent. given; 4 to 5 per cent doesn’t guarantee a bit' better content than a plain 4 per cent.. so our formula is:
Ammonia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 per cent.
Available Phosphoric Acid . . 6 per cent.
Insoluble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. I per cent.
Potash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 5 per cent.
Perhaps we “hate to ﬁgure,” but any of us can turn to the State Chemist’s work and read: “A unit is 20 lbs. or I per cent. in. a ton,” and ﬁnd prices he gives per unit.
Ammonia . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$3.30 per unit Available Phosphoric Acid 1.00 per unit Insoluble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .20 per unit Potash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.10 per unit

Therefore:
4 units of Ammonia are worth. . .$I3.2O
6 units Available Phosphoric Acid 6.00
I unit Insoluble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .20
5 units Potash
5-50
The least plant food that can be in this ton of fertilizer, legally, is worth at sea board jacksonville, $24.90; and we take
. this value in comparing with other for-
mulae. But when comparing with the catalogue price, we must remember the analysis runs above the lowest ﬁgure,
really, and every ounce of plant food has costrthe manufacturer and is worth mo-
ney to us. Then there are the handling,
storage. mixing and bagging, the inspec-
tion fees, the general ups and downs in trade, and so forth. Don’t for a minute think the manufacturer can sell the fer-
tilizer at this price, still he must not ask too much, for now we know when he claims too big a proﬁt and save many a dollar by that knowledge.
But the ﬁnancial saving is the lesser gain from our study, after all; for as one learns he looks more and more to the how’s and why’s, and his whole life is broadened by the study of Nature’s won-
drous ways.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Skinner—I notice this lady made a Statement in her paper that potash Stopped growth.
Mrs. Prange—I do not claim to know anything by experience. What I have presented here is gathered from authorities and experts on the subject.
Mr. Skinner—I might give you a little experience I had in the potash line. It was the ﬁrst lemon crop I grew. I thought I would mature that lemon crop early and get it on the market in nice shape; so I gave it a dose of high-grade sulphate of potash.
Well, my neighbors gathered and shipped their lemons, and while my lemons looked nice, they kept on growing, and they grew, and they grew, and they grew, and they grew.
I was not able to market them until the ﬁrst of December, but I got a good price for them. My experience has been to Show that too much potash makes late ripening fruit.
Mr. McCarty—In pineapple culture.
in the summer application of fertilizer we do not use much potash. but in the fall application we use a higher percentage of potash. we ﬁnd that the more potash we use. the closer the texture of the fruit and the better are the carrying qualities. It is said that it hardens the pineapple, but I don’t know.
Mr. Grifﬁng—The peach also carries much better. We know that an excess

133
of potash for peaches will retard the ripening. This we know by sad ex-
perience, as when we used too much of it we came in a week or ten days later than some of the orchards ad-
joining us. But potash does materially aid in the carrying quality of the fruit.
Mr. Hart—My experience with or-
anges in the free use of potash is that it has a tendency to prevent softening of the fruit. _
Mr. Longley—My experience in us—
ing potash was in the fall. I fertilized in the fall and didn’t think there was enough potash, so I sent to Brother Painter and got a carload. The next summer we got the ﬁnest crop of le-
mons I ever saw. They were big and
ﬁne looking, and brought a good price in the market. I think a good deal of it was due to putting it on in the fall.
I also put on an extra amount.
Mr. In the spring, my trees set a good crop of fruit, and I gave them a good application of potash. As the result, I lost nearly the whole crop of fruit. A friend of mine said he had the same experience. It was just about this time of year that I put the potash on; perhaps a little earlier.
Mr. Hart—“’as it a dry year? Per-
haps that was the cause of your losing the crop instead of too much potash.
Mr. No, it was not a particularly dry year. I saw no reason except too much potash. The season was an av-
erage season.
Mr. Jones—One fall we had drops to the tune of 500 boxes. They began to drop in September. Somebody told me what the ground needed was pot-
ash, so I got ﬁve tons of high-grade potash and put it on the grove, which


was about nine acres, and the next year I could not get a box of drops.
They were ﬁne oranges; clear and smooth and ﬁne.
Mr. Did you put on in the fall?
Mr. jones—No, it was put on in June.
Mr. Griﬂing—I understood the lady to say that potash had a tendency to harden the wood ﬁbre. Now, take it in the growth of nursery trees. In the early season we use fertilizer more largely composed of nitrogen, and in the fall we increase the potash very materially, running up to eight and nine per cent. \Ve ﬁnd the trees will carry better and stand more cold than trees that have been given more nitrogenous matter. In the fall we leave out one per cent. of the ammonia and increase the potash three or four per cent.

For the orange nursery trees, we fertilize them in the early part of the season, then give them about two more applications during the season;
in all, about three or four times a year, increasing the potash every time.
We fertilize the peach seedlings as soon as they are about four or ﬁve inches in height, giving a strong pot-
ash fertilizer in the fall, and it un-
doubtedly hardens the wood ﬁbre.
Mr. Skinner—Why do the formulae run so high in phosphoric acid for young trees? All the formulae run very high.
Mr. Rose—I can only surmise that it is a business proposition. The phos-
phates are the cheapest source of plant food that we have, particularly in Florida, and it is the predominating

material in all fertilizers, and is used as a ﬁller. It is the basis of fertilizers.
Mr. It seems to me there have been many conflicting statements made. Now, suppose I fertilize this year's crop; does this \year's crop or next year’s crop get the beneﬁt of it?
Mr. Hubbard—You fertilize both crops. That is, if the application is put on before the fruit has matured.
The fruit keeps on growing and ma-
turing and the sap takes up the food elements and carries them to the fruit already on the tree. If you use a well-
balanced fertilizer, you fertilize the present crop and also put in the foun-
dation for the next year’s crop.
There has been a good deal of ex-
' perimenting done since we have be-
gun using commercial fertilizers, both as to discovering what constituents a complete fertilizer should have, and with the different elements used sep-
arately. It is generally agreed that the ofﬁce of phosphoric acid in the sap is to assist in the transference of su-
gar and starch to build up plant tis-
sues. I believe the general experience in using potash alone after midsum-
mer or early in the fall after the trees have stopped growing, is to increase the acidity and retard the ripening of the fruit. Liebig, the father of agri-
cultural chemistry. stated in substance that after the alkaline salts had served as bases for nitrates, they were used by the plant as bases for the organic acids that are transferred into the starches which build up the plant.
Potash without nitrogen misses its
ﬁrst ofﬁce in plant growth.
Mrs. Prange—As I understand it.
it is better to start the growth with the an'monia anl harden it with the

potash. My father's grove was af-
ﬂicted with die-back until he used more potash.
Mr. Rose—In .the last few years we have gradually increased the potash until now we are using ten per cent.
in many instances. The method of applying is the question. It depends very much upon the condition of the tree, the location of the grove, etc. No two are alike any more than two cases of illness present the same aspect to a physician. Now, we have fought this out at session after session ever since I have been a member, and we will never agree upon a general proposi-
tion. If a speciﬁc case were given where the condition of the tree, the season, the former treatment of the tree. its present growth, and every-
thing known about that tree. it might be possible to tell just exactly what that tree needs, and when and how to be applied. The general supposition,
as our Professor Hubbard has said, is that potash is a vehicle for the trans-
ference of sugar and starch from the root to the foliage and tree.
Mr. Longley—I have been fertiliz-
ing my trees in November, usually.
for the next year. and have met with very good success. My trees bear a good crop right along. This year I fertilized in October. for the reason that help is very scarce and I had get my trees plowed before the or-
ange packing began.
As Mr. Hubbard says, he thinks it retards the growth to put on too much potash. I think it retards the ripen-
ing of the fruit.
Mr. Reaves—I fertilized with potash after the fruit had set. the blooms had shed and you could see little oranges.

The prices were good and we thought it would be a good thing for us to get some oranges in to market right away.
So we put on a good application, and lost the fruit.
Iylr. Painter—That experience has been had by a good many, not only with potash. Some time ago, a man wrote me that his trees had just put out a ﬁne bloom and wanted to make an unusually ﬁne crop of fruit. He ordered an extra amount of fertilizer,
applied it, harrowed and worked it in,
and the result in due course of time was that the young fruit dropped. You can do that without the fertilizer if you happen to have a good rain about the time you do the cultivating. It is the stimulating effect given to the tree that causes the dropping. My experi-
ence has been that the orange trees ought to be left severely alone during the setting period.
Mr. How long do you consider the setting period?

Mr. Painter—Until the orange reaches the size of a good-sized marble. Of course, up to that time there will be a good deal of fruit drop-
ping on account of being imperfect.
Mr. \Vill the cultivation of trees alone, without fertilizer, cause the fruit and foliage to drop?
Mr. Painter—I have known of cases of that kind.
Prof. Rolfs—I congratulate the au-
thor of the paper, which has brought on more discussion than any other we have had.

Controlling Capilliary Moisture.
By A. w. Blair,
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
When rain falls upon ﬁelds and groves a part of it runs off to the lower places,
and a part sinks into the soil and per-
meates it. The amount which runs off is determined by the condition of the surface and the rapidity of the rain. If the sur-
face is hard and compact and also some-
what sloping, much of the water will run off. If the surface soil is loose and mel-
low, and contains much organic matter,
it will absorb much of the water that falls on it._ When the rains are heavy and continue for some time, a part of this absorbed water will continue its course downward until it reaches the water-ta-
ble or ground—water.
Another part remains distributed in the soil,‘ and it is this part that is thus held in the soil against the force of gravity that we call capillary water. As the sur-
face of the ground dries out, some of the water that has ﬁltered through to the wa-
ter-table may be drawn up into the soil again and become capillary water. This may be illustrated as follows: Close one end of a glass tube by tying over it a piece of muslin, then partly ﬁll the tube with soil, and pour on water; the entire mass of soil becomes saturated and :1
part of the water runs through, provided a sufﬁcient quantity has been added. If now the soil in the tube is allowed to dry for a few days, and then the end over which the muslin was tied is dipped into a basin of water, the water will slowly rise in the tube, being lifted up by cap-
illary attraction against the force of grav-
ity. The water in the basin may be com-
pared to the ground-water in the soil;
though the cases are not strictly parallel,
since under natural ﬁeld conditions the soil is constantly in contact with the ground-water. The principle however is the same. It is from this capillary water,
for the most part, that trees and plants obtain the water necessary for- their growth. We can readily see then the im-
portance; of knowing how best to control this source of water supply. The prin-
ciple on which the water, known as capil-
lary water, rises in the soil, is a well-
known law of physics. \Vhen small glass tubes of different internal diameters are placed in water, the water will rise high-
est in the smallest tube. That is, the height to which the water rises is in—
versely proportional to the diameter of the tube. A knowledge of this law helps us in the study of the movements of soil moisture. The small spaces between the soil particles or grains, may be likened to ﬁne tubes: though in this case the tubes are neither straight nor of uniform bore. By capillary attraction water is drawn up through the pore spaces or ﬁne tubes, to take the place of that which is lost by surface evaporation or used by plants and trees.
The size of these tubes will be deter-
mined by the size of the particles or grains that make up the soil; that is,. if the soil is composed largely of coarse particles, the capillary tubes will be

large,-and if it is composed of very ﬁne sand or clay loam, the tubes will be much smaller. Then, according to the law al-
ready stated, the water will rise highest in the soil that is made up of the ﬁnest grains. This is well illustrated bv tying muslin cloth over the ends of glass tubes as described above, ﬁlling each tube with a different soil, and letting the ends of the tubes dip into a basin of water for a few days. The results of such an ex-
periment are shown in diagram I. In the coarse sand from Saint Lucie county the which compose the Hillsboro county soil are one-half millimeter (about 1-50 inch)
or less, in diameter. However, the odds are not all against the coarse soil. True,
it does not lift the water so high as the
ﬁner soil, but neither does it allow this water to evaporate from the surface so rapidly. It has been shown that a mulch of coarse, dry sand is more effective in preventing surface evaporation than one of ﬁnely pulverized clay loam.
Furthermore, we have shown by exper-
iments similar to those already described TABLE I.—Showing Moisture in Cultivated and Uncultivated Land.

water rose in four and a half days to the height of eight and a half inches. In the moderately coarse soil from Alachua county it rose ten and a half inches in the same time; and in a very ﬁne soil from Hillsboro county it rose sixteen inches in the same time. The tables which accom-
pany this diagram show the relative amounts of the different sizes of soil grains in these three soils. It will be seen that over 99 per cent. of the particles that while a coarse, sandy soil (Alachua county soil) lifted water to a height of nineteen inches in sixty-eight days, the same soil when it had 4 per cent. of muck intimately mixed with it, lifted the water to the height of twenty-seven and a half inches in the same time.

muck, cover crops, straw, or leaves. may be used to increase the capillary power of the soil. '

been made of the water by surface evaporation. The loss of water in this way is great, but it is pos-
sible to very materially reduce this loss.
This may be accomplished, as is generally known, by plowing and frequently stir-
ring the surface. King, in \Visconsin,
has shown that a piece of ground lost in seven days, in consequence of not having been plowed, no [less than 9.13 pounds of water per square foot more than an ad—
joining piece that had been plowed; an amount equivalent to 1.75 inches of rain,
and to more than 198 tons of water per acre. Hilgard, in California, reports some investigations of moisture condi-
tions in adjacent orchards differently treated in regard- to cultivation. In one case investigated, two orchards of apri-
cots were separated by a lane only, and the soils were identical; but one owner had omitted to cultivate while the other had cultivated to an extra depth in view of a dry season apparently impending.
Table I shows the difference of the two
ﬁelds in moisture content in July to the depth of six feet. This difference of
244 tons of water per acre he regards as quite sufﬁcient to acoount for the observed difference in the cultural results. These results were that on the cultivated ground the trees made about three feet of annual growth and the fruit was of normal size,
while the trees on the uncultivated ground made barely three inches of growth, and the fruit was stunted and wholly unsal-
able. Hilgard adds that, instructed by the season’s experience, the owner of the uncultivated orchard cultivated deeply the following season. His trees then showed as good growth and fruit as his neigh-
bor’s. Hilgard attributes the cause of this difference to the fact that in the un-
cultivated ﬁeld there was a compact sur-
Mention has loss of capillary face layer of several inches in thickness which forcibly abstracted the moisture from the substrata, and evaporated it from its surface; while the loose surface soil on the cultivated ground was unable to take moisture from the denser subsoil.
In diagram II I have undertaken to rep-
resent this condition graphically. In the unplowed ground the capillary tubes or openings, through which the moisture is brought from the deeper subsoil, extend all the way to the surface, and thus permit the evaporation of this moisture.
W' here the ground has been plowed, the capillary tubes are broken a few inches below the surface, and much of the moist-
ture is thus prevented from escaping into the air. However. the movement of capillary moisture may take place in any direction, even downward. if the conditions are favorable.
NOTE—The diagram is necessarily very much exaggerated, and represents only very imperfectly what takes place in the soil. It is not intended to convey the idea that cultivation will entirely prevent surface evaporation.
At the Experiment Station we have re-
cently determined the moisture in plowed and unplowed land with the results shown in table II. The plowed land selected is a cotton ﬁeld that was plowed about March 24, and harrowed twice between that date and the time of planting the cotton on April 16. The unplowed land lies just across a path from the cotton
ﬁeld, and has not been plowed since last December. Samples for moisture deter—
minations were collected on April 18, 24.
28, May I and 7. (On the twenty-
eighth of April, 0.86 inch of rain fell. On the thirtieth, 0.30 inch fell; and on May 6, 0.70 inch fell; making a total of 1.86 inches from April 28 to May 6.)
We ﬁnd here a difference of 164.66

tons per acre, to the depth of four feet,
in favor of the plowed land, which is equivalent to 1.45 inches of rainfall. If we consider for a moment what it would mean to have missed 1.45 of the 1.86
inches of rain that fell during this period,
The low moisture content in Grove A at Lake \Veir may possibly be explained by the fact that here the roots of the trees are unusually near the surface of the ground, and as a consequence cultiva-
tion has been shallow; and by the further TABLE III, SOILS—Tons of Water Per Acre in the First Foot.

Report of Committee on Tropical Fruits.
THE EAST INDIAN MANGO IN FLORIDA.
By John M -r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The East Indian Mango, with its spicy,
resinous sap and luscious pulp, stands pre-eminent the king of all fruits. The only reason it has not assumed the posi-
tion that belongs to it centuries ago in the markets of \Vestern civilization is the fact that it cannot be reproduced true from seed. Consequently it has been con-
ﬁned to its home, Hindustan, and ad—
jacent countries to which trees could be transported. For the past ten or ﬁfteen years, with the aid of fast steamers“, the fruit has been ﬁnding its way into the London markets from Bombay via the Suez Canal. Its remarkable keeping qualities render this long journey possi-
ble, yet the fruit surely cannot develop its full ﬂavor when gathered so long be—
fore maturity. as is necessary in this in-
stance. For the past twenty years I have made a hobby of the East Indian mango,
and have ridden it pretty hard at times. I rode it into the ground at Melbourne in
1894. Then I moved to Palm Beach and conducted pretty exhaustive experiments for ﬁve summers in propagation methods,
assisted by Mr. F. Bergin, who is now manager of the Tropical Fruit Associa-
tion’s mango plantation at Bayamon,
Porto Rico. It was our object to ascer-
tain the cheapest and most feasible meth-
B. Beach od for commercial production of East Indian Mango trees. I am informed that the results of our work have proven the same as those conducted in the green-
houses at Washington. We have fallen back on the old East Indian principle,
though we greatly improve on the method of marching. Under certain conditions budding is perfectly feasible, also root-
grafting or root inarching. But when it comes to turning out a maximum per~
centage of healthy, vigorous trees, ﬁtted for long—distance transportation at a min-
imum cost, inarched pot-grown trees take the lead. A half-inch seedling tree can be grown in a ﬁve-inch pot, a two or three-foot vigorous East Indian top can be grown on it in six or eight weeks, and this tree properly planted and cared for will in three years produce several dozen fruit. They can be packed very light with sphagnum and oiled paper in pine-
apple crates and will readily stand four or ﬁve weeks’ shipment through the tropics in the Spring and Fall.
Up to the last few years the only speci-
men of this wonderful fruit that had ever been produced in Florida was a Mulgoba tree (and its descendants) which was im-
ported with a number of others by the Government. This tree was the only one that survived the cold of ’94 and ’95 and

is growing on the place of the late Rev.
A. Gale at Mangonia. I have just seen the tree (April 25th) and it has enough fruit set to make ﬁve bushels if they all mature. Mr. Geo. Gale has or-
ders for all he can produce at 25 cents each f. o. b. The tree is two feet in diameter and has a spread of twenty-ﬁve feet. It is on the very poorest kind of spruce pine land, coarse and white, with-
out fertilizer or irrigation. It is wonder-
ful that anything could live and grow under such conditions, and speaks well for the vigor of the East Indian Mango.
I have a tree budded from this ten years ago, that stands twenty-ﬁve feet high. and has yielded from 500 to 1,000
inarches per year, since I began to pro—
pagate from it. Before I began this it had produced two crops of fruit, but since then I have been working it so hard on propagation that it only sets a few fruit each year. It is on spruce pine land, but I give it fertilizer and water, which everything here needs to produce max-
imum results. If Mr. Gale’s tree had had the same treatment that mine has had,
it would undoubtedly be yielding 25 to
30 bushels of fruit per year. All the imported trees that we have bearing pro-
duce fruit that is free from ﬁbre. There is a little down on one side of the seed,
but no ﬁbre at all in the body of the fruit. You can cut around the seed and lift off a fruit cup just as you would I with a free—stone peach or an avocado pear. The pulp is far richer than the
ﬁnest peach, melting and juicy with a spicy ﬂavor not to be found in any tem-
perate fruit.
The Mulgoba weighs fourteen to six-
teen oz., has a ﬁne red cheek, and is a
ﬁne market fruit. Shape is often nearly cylindrical, and never very lopsided. The Alphonso, one of the recent importations via Washington, is considered in India the best of all. It is superior in ﬂavor to the Mulgoba but inferior in size and appearance. Sundersha weighs from two to three pounds, but is not equal to Mul-
goba in quality. Fernandez, one of my own importations, has a distinct subacid
ﬂavor, unusual in mangoes, and which will make it popular when known, though the size is only 6 02. It is a most pro-
liﬁc bearer, and I have to pick off half the fruit to give the rest a chance. Young trees just inarched will often start to bloom the ﬁrst year. There are quite a number of other varieties imported by the Department, by Mr. E. N. Reasoner and by myself that have,n0t as yet fruited,
selected from the ﬁnest in India that may develop other qualities that may appeal to the taste of the public, but it will be hard to beat the Alphonso. The develop-
ment of these we await with interest, and next year expect to hear from some of them, as many have blossomed and set fruit.

PINEAPPLE GROWING AND SHIPPING.
By B. K.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Growing and shipping—these two words represent the nucleus of the pine-
apple industry, upon them rests success or failure; and I will treat the subject as fully and clearly as it is possible to do in a limited address.
The ﬁrst and most important step in the growing of pineapples is the choosing of the land. There are two kinds of this that are best adapted to pineapples, viz.:
Spruce Pine and Hammock. Spruce Pine, as the name implies, is high dry land covered with spruce pines, the best having an undergrowth of scrub oak and hickory. Hammock land is more densely grown with larger timber usually of hickory and oak. Opinions differ as to which is the best, but it is generally con-
ceded that the hammock land raises the largest pines both as to plant and size;
the spruce pine land does not seem to have as much humus in the soil, but the plant seems to last a greater number of years upon it. A combination place con-
taining some of each kind of land is de-
sirableif you can obtain such. After the careful choosing of the land, the next step is the clearing, i. e. placing in proper shape; this is done by ﬁrst removing the tree’s brush, etc. The process of grub—
bing the land consists in taking a tool known as a grub hoe about six inches wide and shaped like a mattox; with this implement all the roots are removed to a depth of about fourteen inches. Ground should be grubbed during the winter for the summer planting; do not, however,
McCarty.
remove the roots and brush until sum-
mer when you fork the land, because this shades the ground and prevents the sun from baking the same. Pine stumps are not grubbed out, only the roots are cut up to the stump and the tree is cut down. This stump soon rots and makes humus for your land. Hickory, Bay and all other stumps are dug out either with a grub hoe or a stump-puller. All brush and large roots are forked into the trails which are from four to six feet wide, six feet preferred; here it is burned. The land is now ready for raking. Before this is done, in order to level, a harrow is run over, thus removing all bumps; the land is now raked; all the ﬁne trash and rootlets are raked into where your trail is to be,‘ or the same place that the trash was burned. When these rootlets and
ﬁne trash are worked into the ground by rolling over it with the wheelbarrow and other work done in the trail, it forms a hard path which enables the man who wheels to carry bigger loads. we have now reached the point of setting.
Select good plants; of whatever va-
riety you wish to plant, the universal opinion is that Red Spanish are the most desirable both from the commercial and safety point of view. The slips range in length from eight to fourteen inches;
the stocky heavy-butted ones are the best growers; slips are shucked or the hard butt is cut off, and the ﬁrst eight or ten shucks are removed, thus allowing the roots to be exposed so when the slip is planted they will start quicker and be

147
rooted ﬁrmer. Usually about 12,500 Red Spanish slips are planted to the acre;
twenty inches square being the proper distance.
The ground is laid off with a marker which is pulled by a man, thereby giving you an even and symmetrical ﬁeld. Plant-
ing is done by the use of a trowel; the ground is simply broken and the slip is inserted to the depth of about one inch.
Be sure not to set too deep. A slip set too deep becomes choked by the sand working into the bud and the plant does not make the proper growth. Equally as bad, however, is shallow setting, be-
cause the wind blows the unrooted plant from its place. The point of proper set-
ting cannot be overestimated and should receive the careful attention of every pine-
apple grower. We have three methods of working pineapple plants; the most pop—
ular as well as the best is shufﬂehoeing.
This is done by means of a shufﬂe-hoe.
When the plant is young you work care-
fully up to the base of each plant, being sure to stir all of the ground. Opinions differ as to how often young plants should be shufflehoed; as for me, I do this early and often, every three weeks,
if the ground is in the proper condition,
until the plant becomes too large to per-
mit. A small plough is used also to stir the ground in young ﬁelds; a rake is also used by some people, but it is much slower and more expensive,
The shuffle-hoe is our most used tool,
for with it are the trails kept clean of weeds and stirred, as well as the ﬁelds.
Upon our sandy soils we have to fer-
tilize extensively, almost from the time the plant is set, and continue to do so until the ﬁeld has grown too old to bear properly. The question of fertilizing is an intricate one,‘ requiring a great deal of study and close attention to details.
I have used Painter’s fertilizers for some time, with the best of results. It seems
' to be the census of opinion that a bearing
ﬁeld of pines should be fertilized twice a year._ What is called the summer ap-
plication is usually put on about July 10th to 30th; and the fall application is put on about October 15th to 30th. It is almost impossible to tell formulas, be-
cause of the differences in ﬁelds, age of plants and, last, the difference in land;
there are not any two- pieces of land which would require the same kind of fertilizer;
climatic conditions change the whole status of affairs,
The watch-word in shipping pineapples is carefulness in handling. Let it ever be the foremost idea in your mind, that a fall which will injure an egg will do the same to a pineapple. The ﬁrst thing in shipping pines is the picking; upon this point lies success or failure; i. e., how to pick, when to pick, color and methods of picking. There are two ways to pick;
ﬁrst to snap the apple from the stalk; this is done by placing your knee or wrist against the stalk at the base of the ap~
ple and giving a quick downward motion toward the body. If there are slips around the base of the apple, one should be re-
moved. The snapping process is a very good one where the slips are not thick and when there has been rain, thus mak-
ing the stalk brittle. The second method is by cutting with a knife; an ordinary all-metal oyster knife is the best; one or more slips, if necessary, are pushed off from the top of the stalk, the point of the knife is here inserted and the apple is removed by this method, the slips are saved, and it also prevents the apple from becoming plugged so it leaks and rots while in transit. The census of opinion is that the ﬁrst-named method is the best,
although many of the best growers use IO

both; the grower will have to use his own judgment in this matter to a large extent.
When to pick the fruit so as to get it to the market in the best possible shape is one of the all-important points of the in-
dustry. The apple should show a light greenish cast around the base. It should always be remembered that a Red Span-
ish pineapple always ripens from the out-
side in; also from the base to the top of the apple. When pines are picked in this condition they will keep for some time,
even in the heart of the summer, if they are not bruised.
Step number two is the method of get-
ting the apple from the ﬁeld to the pack-
ing house. Some people use a wheel-
barrow with a rack; into this the apples are placed where they are then taken to the house; others use pineapple crates that are ﬁlled by the wheeler as they are thrown by the picker. These crates are picked up and hauled to the house with a wagon, where they are carefully laid in-
to the bins, being now ready for wrap-
ping. Baskets are also sometimes used in place of crates on the wagon, When the pines arrive at the packing-house they are placed in long bins about four feet wide and three feet deep; from this they are packed. If the fruit is wet when it is brought to the house, it is always let dry in order to save spotting the paper.
Pineapples are packed in crates 10%, by
12 by 36 inches; they are wrapped in strong paper 15 by 20 inches. Most grow-
ers use plain white, because it is stronger;
still many growers use the colored paper with varied success.
Sizing is all done with the eye and is a most particular job; the crate must be packed snug but not full enough, so when the covering is put on that it bruises the apples. The point should be carefully borne in mind, that the apple in transit shrinks a triﬂe, so that what seems to be a perfect package on leaving your pack-
ing-house will not be so when it is re-
ceived by your commission house. Ex-
perience is one’s only teacher in the mat-
ter of packing and the man who feels that he is shrewd enough to beat the buyer on his pack will ﬁnd, to his sor-
row, that he is receiving from 10 to 25
cents less for his fruit than his neighbor.
Pineapples run in size from 18 to 48
to the crate; they are laid in the crates crossways, alternately apple and crown;
this is done to prevent bruising if one apple came in direct contact with an-
other. The crate is made the wide way,
so as to give the apple more room, Each package should be packed with carefully selected fruit both as to size and quality.
Never pack an apple that is the least bit doubtful, because you not only lower the price on that crate, but you lower the reputation of your brand which is price-
less.
An ordinary packer packs Ioo crates a day and does it well. Of course, size has a great deal to do with the number a man can pack, but for all season’s work
100 crates a day is plenty.
Your crate should be stenciled or, if you prefer, stamped with your name, va-
riety, etc., so as to present a neat and attractive appearance. _
My whole article has dealt with the Red Spanish Pineapple, which is king of all varieties; it has won its place justly in the great markets of the world against the bitterest competition. Cuba with her immense crops of pineapples combined with both Florida’s and Porto Rico’s form a stupendous business. It is SUITICICHI to say that if we are to retain our enviable position as producing the ﬁnest pineapple

in the world we must watch our ﬁelds,
watch our competition and watch our packs.
I trust I have in some small way cast a little light on the methods of growing and shipping pineapples.
PLANTING OF FRUIT TREES.
By Aubrey Frink.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Early in April I received a letter from President Rolfs asking me to prepare a paper for the Horticultural meeting, but he did not suggest a topic. After some correspondence with Prof. Rolfs, we de-
cided upon the subject of Planting Fruit Trees.
My reason for selecting this topic is that there seems to be a very general de-
sire for information along this line.
Scarcely a day passes during the planting season that I don’t receive inquiries as to when to plant, how to prune for plant-
ing, about fertilizers and fertilizing, best sized trees to set, etc. And, no wonder,
for the success of an orchard depehds to a considerable extent on proper meth-
ods in planting.
WHEN TO PLANT.
The_ best time for setting fruit trees is one of the ﬁrst things to be considered.
As a general rule fruit trees do better when set during late fall or early winter
—,as soon as they have hardened up their growth and become dormant. Trees planted then will have time to become established in their new positions and nearly all of them will have put on feeder rootlets before time for growth to start in the spring; thus enabling them to start promptly and make and sustain a good
ﬁrst growth in the spring, as well as suc-
ceeding growths, an d to withstand drouth.
Many people suppose that when a tree is dormant, it is dormant in root as well as in top, but if you care to test this,
dig up a few trees during the late fall and heel them in or transplant them, and then during late winter or early spring before top growth has started, dig them up and examine the roots. You will nearly always ﬁnd small rootlets long be-
fore the top shows any signs of starting.
If planting is left until spring, the top will start out immediately and before the roots have time to throw out feeders,
thus drawing severely upon the stored-up sap within the tree, with the result, too often, that the vitality of the tree is weakened and not infrequently it suc-

Deciduous trees can be planted success-
fully only when dormant, during the late fall, winter or early spring. But Citrus trees can be planted at almost any time when conditions are favorable; that is,
when the ground is moist and weather cloudy, although they, too, generally do better for being planted during late fall or early winter. Some planters like to plant during the rainy season of mid—
summer.

It is desirable always to plant all kinds of trees only when the ground is in good moist condition.
'PRUNING.
The pruning of fruit trees at time of planting, or before, is a matter that is given entirely too little attention. A very large percentage of trees are set out exactly as received from the nursery,
whether pruned at all or not, in an en-
deavor to save as much of the top as possible. This oftentimes results in los-
ing a large percentage of trees, for the root system of the tree has been deranged while the top is left as it originally was,
with the result that the tree has to draw upon the sap stored up within itself to support the top and, if evergreens, all the foliage, while the roots are getting started. This heavy drain upon the vital-
ity of the tree not infrequently causes it to die. Nearly all fruit trees should be severely pruned when planted. They will start__out better, make better and quicker growth, and actually‘ form good heads sooner than when planted with all their tops left on, besides materially reducing the percentage of loss in planting. Fruit trees should nearly always be cut back to a straight stem of about twenty to thirty inches. This gives the point at which the top will form, thus making a low branched tree, giving a larger fruit-
ing surface than would be possible were the top started four or ﬁve feet or higher.
It also allows 0f the fruit being picked with greater ease and less expense than from high-topped trees, because a good portion of the fruit can be picked with-
out the use of a ladder.
The roots should also be primed to some extent. but I do not believe what
-
is known as the Stringfellow method of pruning off all the roots is good practice;
in fact, it has not proven so in my own planting of many thousands of trees an-
nually, except in some instances where trees are very small and the top is also cut to within a very few inches of the ground.
In pruning citrus trees, it is advisable to cut out the ﬁbrous roots almost en-
tirely, the belief of many planters to the contrary notwithstanding. These ﬁbrous roots are but feeders and are an annual growth, and when a tree is transplanted with these ﬁbrous roots left on it, they will simply rot off before new rootlets will start, thus hindering the starting of new feeders. If anyone doubts this as-
sertion, let him heel in a few orange trees during the early winter, and then examine them during the late winter. He will
ﬁnd the ﬁbrous rootlets rotted OH. and new rootlets starting. In making the test, try a few with ﬁbrous rootlets cut out and see if he does not ﬁnd that they have started new feeders much sooner than those with the ﬁbrous roots left on them.
A pretty good plan, when ordering trees from a nurseryman, is to instruct him to have the trees pruned ready for planting. He will seldom make any charge for this’ and the plan has several advantages. In the ﬁrst place the trees will be properly pruned; with many plant-
ers it takes considerable nerve to prune as hard as trees should be pruned.
In the second place, this will save you the trouble and expense, and will save considerable useless weight and, con-
sequently, transportation charges. And in the third place, evergreen trees will be the better for being pruned and defoliated immediately when dug. This stops, to a large extent, the evaporation of sap. a1-

ways going on through the foliage,and re-
duces considerably the drying out in tran-
sit that would otherwise be hard to over.
come. Evergreens should nearly always be defoliated when transplanted, for otherwise the evaporation of sap is so great through the foliage that the trees have a hard struggle for life, and if ship-
ped during hot weather they are apt to scald in transit, especially if out for some time.
PREPARATION OF THE GROUND, AND FERTILIZING.
The preparation of the ground for the tree is of great importance and is too often neglected. The ground should have 1
been broken up very deep with a turn plow And thoroughly pulverized some time in advance of planting. If the land is new, this will enable it to mellow and sweeten up, that is, lose the acidity which so often occurs in our Florida soils. And,
right here, I want to say that new land should always be used for trees subject to attacks from the root-knot nematode,
such as peaches, mulberries, ﬁgs, etc. The root-knot nematode is generally plentiful in old lands, while new lands are fairly free from it. By using new land your trees have a chance to get started well before this pest becomes sufficiently abundant to do any damage, and then the tree is generally able to resist its at-
tacks.
It is a pretty good plan to use half a pound to one pound per tree of some good high grade commercial fertilizer at time of planting or before, mixing it thor-
oughly with the earth in the holes where the trees are to be set. This puts the fertilizer right where the tree can take advantage of it immediater it puts out new feeders, thus enabling the tree to put on and maintain a good ﬁrst growth,
and by reason of this good ﬁrst growth,
the succeeding growths will be much bet-
ter. In other words, this will get your tree established in a way impossible if you depend upon using the fertilizer after the tree has started growth.
The particular brand of fertilizer does not so much matter. There are a num-
ber of excellent brands sold by manufac-
turers and dealers in the state. It should,
however, contain about the following pro-
portion of chemicals: Ammonia 4 to 6
per cent; Phosphoric Acid 7 to 9 per cent. ; Sulphate of Potash 3 to 5 per cent.
SETTING THE TREE.
In setting the tree, generally consid-
ered a simple task, care should be used to see that roots are placed as near as possible in the same positions they orig-
inally occupied, and to have the earth packed very ﬁrmly around them. It is
‘a good idea to place your tree in its proper position, then pack earth around the lower roots with your hands, then pour in a bucket of water and allow that to settle into the earth. This will ﬁrm the earth around the roots far better than you can do it otherwise. Then ﬁll in the hole, and pack the earth down hard by stamping it with your feet. After the hole has been ﬁlled, make a basin of earth around the tree, say, a couple of feet across and pour in another bucket or two of water, and after that has soaked in,
throw some loose earth over that to pre—
vent scalding.
Ordinarily trees should be set the same depth in the ground they originally were in nursery. Nature marks the proper earth line, and it is generally a good idea

to accept this, not trying to put the tree either deeper in the ground or higher out of it.
PROPER SIZED TREES TO SET.
As to the most desirable sized trees LO plant. This is a question about which there are many different opinions, but my experience and observation has been that sizes usually listed in nursery cata-
logues as Standard, are about as good as can be used. In deciduous trees, like peaches, plums, pears, mulberries, apples.
persimmons, etc., this means 4 to 6 feet;
while in citrus trees one year buds 4 t0
5 feet. Either medium size, 3 to 4 feet,
or extra size, 6 feet and up, is all right,
and some planters prefer smaller sizes,
while still others want only two-year old buds in citrus trees. Two-year buds of deciduous trees are seldom as desirable as one-year buds and nothing is to be gained by using them, for the one-year buds, if thrifty, should give you fruit just about as soon and as much as the two-year olds.
But, if good thrifty trees are planted,
and sizes within reason, the size does not count so much. It is the proper care at time of planting and afterward that makes for success in fruit-growing, pro-
vided always that proper varieties have been selected.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Hart—Do you make it a point to plant trees in relation to the points of the compass; that is, do you plant them in exactly the same position as they were originally, with the north to the north?
Mr. Frink—No, I don't think' that makes any difference. Of course, I have not had a very long experience.
but I never could see that it makes any difference whatever.

SELECT BULBOUS AND TUBEROUS-ROOTED PLANTS FOR FLORIDA GARDENS.

By H. Nehrling
1141'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Florida is the land of “unlimited pos-
sibilities” as far as ornamental horticul-
ture is concerned. We are able to grow in the open hundreds—no, thousands—
of species of tropical and subtropical plants which farther north can only be grown with considerable trouble and many expenses in glasshouses. I have wandered through many parts of our country in quest of birds and plants. I have sojourned in Texas, and made my home for a number of years in the Ozark region of south-western Missouri. I have lived on the prairies of Illinois, and spent my boyhood days in the idyllic forest regions of \Nisconsin, my native state.
I have seen all the elaborate gardens around Boston, New York, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, Chicago, M i l w a u k e e,
’Washington, and New Orleans; but no-
where have I found such a wealth of beautiful native and exotic plants as in Florida, very aptly called the land of sun-
shine and ﬂowers. Even if we were de-
prived of exotic plants, we could make glorious gardens from the material found in our woodlands and along our water-
courses. Native plants should form the foundations of all our gardens. Plant
ﬁrst of all the cabbage palmetto, the noble Magnolia grandiﬂora, the sweet bay
(Magnolia glauca), the loblolly bay
(Gordonia Lasianthus), the holly (Ilex opaca), the dahoon (Ilex Cassine), the red cedar (Juniperus Barbadensis), the laurel cherry (Prunus Caroliniana), the wild olive (Osmanthus Americanus), the live-oak (Quercus virens), and do not forget that jewel among climbers. the Carolina or Yellow Jessamine (Gelse-
mium sempervirens). This greets you on New Year’s day with a wealth of de-
liciously sweet—scented, yellow ﬂower-
trumpets,
Our worthy president has suggested to me to read a paper on bulbous and tuberous-rooted plants adapted to our soil and climate. This suggestion is very timely, because only a very limited num-
ber of our people really know what has been done along these lines in recent years. It is true, gifted writers of high intellect, like P. W. Reasoner and E. N.
Reasoner, Theo. L. Mead, Walter N.
Pike, W. C. Steele, Mrs, Jennie S. Per~
kins, and others, have pointed out, time and again, the great possibilities of grow-
ing bulbous and tuberous-rooted plants in Florida. Many and important have been the articles that have appeared from time to time in The Florida A gric'ulturist, and in the older volumes of The Farmer and Fruit Gro'rt'er; but as far as I am aware

the subject has never been treated in a systematic manner.
I begin with the Lily Family (Lilia-
ceae).
This is a very large group of plants,
comprising the true Lilies (Lilium), the Gloriosas, Sandersonias, Littonias, the Tulips, Hyacinths, the Lily of the Valley,
the Mariposa Lilies (Calochortus), the Blue African Lily (Agapanthus), etc.
The genera Trillium (Wake Robins),
Erythronium (Dog’s-tooth Violet), Bes-
sera, Blandfordia, Funkia, Milla, Allium,
Kniphoﬁa»(the Tritoma), Albuca, Hem-
erocallis, etc., all belong to this family.
Though I have experimented quite ex-
tensively with almost all the genera of this family, I have not been successful with most of them. The Tulips and Hyacinths, which form such an important part of all the gardens of the North, are a failure in Florida. It is useless to meddle with them. We have numerous tropical bulbous plants, outrivaling them in beauty and in easy culture, and only these should be largely planted in our gardens.
The true Lilies (Lilium) are the gems of this noble family. They all belong to the Northern Hemisphere, being num-
erously represented in the cool mountain glens of the Californian Sierra Nevada and Coast Range, and reaching their greatest beauty and highest development in Japan. China is likewise rich in ﬁne Lilies, and some of the most beautiful are found in the Himalayas. They abound in Europe and Northern Asia, and some of the species attracting the attention of all ﬂower-lovers grow in our northern meadows (L. Canadense, L. superbum and L. Philadelphicum). One species,
Catesby’s Lily (L. Catesbaei), grows abundantly in the ﬂatwoods of our OWn State. Its large, orange-yellow, upright
ﬂower chalices, spotted with deep-brown,
'form glorious masses of rich color in September. The bulb is small, but is easily transplanted to our gardens in rich,
moist soil. It seeds freely, and batches of young plants are usually found around the old bulb. Though I have experi-
mented quite extensively with most of the species ,of the true Lilies; I have not found their behavior encouraging. This was, however, at a time when I did not understand the soil and climate of Flor-
ida thoroughly. Even at the North, most Lilies are very capricious. They thrive splendidly for a time; then they suddenly disappear. Since I began the cultivation of bulbous plants in a systematic way under sheds and in well-prepared soil, 1
have had better results.
None of the European Lilies, not even the chaste Madonna Lily (Lilium candi-
dum) of Southern Europe, will grow here. The species of our northern states are also a failure. The gigantic Hum-
boldt’s Lily (L. Humboldtii), and the fragrant Washington Lily (L. Washing-
tonianum), being sojourners of the high and cool mountain regions of California refused to grow with me. The only American Lilies which may ﬁnallyy after many generations, adapt themselves to our soil and climate, are the Californian L, Parryi, a very fragrant lemon-yellow species, and the vigorous L. pardalinum.
Both have ﬂowered with me, but they died shortly after the blossoms had faded.
The Golden-banded Lily of Japan (L.
auratum) and its varieties, the most im-
posing and beautiful of all the Lilies and the most fragrant, has not proved a suc-
cess with me; though some bulbs made a vigorous growth at ﬁrst. The Japan Lily (L. speciosum) and its varieties, L.

155
speciosum album, L. speciosum rubrum,
and Melpomene, grow much better and bloom abundantly. They seem to do best in pots on verandas ; but I have had them frequently in ﬂower in the well-drained,
rich and moist soil of my shed. All are very beautiful and exhale a delicious per-
fume.
Henry’s Lily (L. Henryi), discovered several years ago in the mountains of Junnan, in southern China, by Dr. Au-
gustine Henry, grows vigorously in Florida. It has been termed the “Or—
ange-yellow Speciosum Lily." Its con-
stitution is robust; the plant growing four to six feet high and bearing from ten to twenty rich, orange-yellow blos-
soms, well set off by its ample deep-green foliage. I have crosses now growing vigorously between this species and L.
speciosum rubrum,
The Tiger Lily (L. tigrinum), a Chi-
nese species which has been repeatedly reported to be successfully grown in our State, never made itself at home in my garden.
The most satisfactory of all the true Lilies, growing admirably in Florida,
provided they are well cared fbr, are those belonging to Endlicher’s Eulirion group—the Funnel-ﬂowered Lilies. We all are acquainted with the Easter Lily
(L. Harrisii), a variety of the Japanese L. longiﬂorum, carrying a magniﬁcent crown of long-tubed, snowy-white, frag-
rant blossoms, usually at Easter time, on a stem two to three feet high. L. longi-
ﬂorum has branched out in quite a num-
ber of distinct and superior varieties. The type usually only bears one or two ﬂow-
ers; the Easter, or Bermuda Lily (L.
longiflorum Harrisii), usually from four to six. L. longiﬂorum giganteum is an improvement on the last-named variety.
It is of very free growth, carrying from six to ten ﬂowers on each stern. They are large and well-formed, of great sub-
stance and purity, lasting a long time when cut. The ﬁnest variety of all is undoubtedly L. longiﬂorum Takesima grandiﬂorum, very strong—growing, with glossy foliage and dark-brown stems,
bearing from six to ten long tubular
ﬂowers, white inside and tinged with brown externally. All these Lilies have proved a perfect success with me, ﬂower-
ing abundantly in the latter part of April and early in May.
Have you ever seen the beautiful L.
Brownii in bloom? The form of the
ﬂower reminds one of the last-named species, but the outside is a deep choco-
late brown. Of still greater beauty is its variety, L. Brownii leucanthum. It is more or less ruddy-brown externally,
milk-white inside, with a rich yellow throat. The type is rather difﬁcult to grow, while its variety grows as easily as the L. longiﬂorum varieties.
In 1872 the celebrated botanical col-
lector, Gustav \Vallis, discovered a beauti-
ful funnel-shaped Lily in the Philippine Islands. the L. Philippense, which was scientiﬁcally described by Baker in 1873.
At that time it did not attract much at-
tention. Only recently, since the United States has taken possession of the islands,
this lily has become better known and American ﬁrms have distributed it largely. Though occurring in a tropical country it has proved hardy even in Ohio.
The stems are rather slender, and the grass-like leaves grow all along the stems,
as in all true lilies. Usually only one pure white ﬂower is carried on the extremity of each stem. The ﬂowers exhale a de-
licious perfume. It grows well in my

garden, and I have raised quite a number of seedlings from it.
The Neilgherry Lily (L. Neilgher-
rense) is another species adapted to our soil and climate. Coming from the mountains of the Indian peninsula, where it grows in great abundance, in the rich vegetable mold of half—shady positions, it is not quite hardy here in Florida. It insists on pushing up its stems late in autumn and during winter, and therefore
,is easily damaged by one of our cold spells; though it can stand a few degrees of frost with impunity. The ﬂowers are pure white and very fragrant.
VVallich’s Lily, also known as the Sul-
phur Lily or the Himalayan Lily (Lilium sulphureum, syn. L. \Vallichianum) is a native of the Himalayas. at an altitude of from 3.000 to 4,000 feet, growing in the same places with the tree-like Rhodo-
dendrons (R. barbatum, R. arboreum, R_
grande, R. Falconeri, etc.) which are awaiting introduction into our gardens;
when in bloom it transforms the moun-
tain sides into an earthly paradise. It is a vigorous grower, with large funnel-
shaped ﬂowers, rich yellow inside, tinted rosy and brown outside, of a rich fra—
grance; it produces small bulbs at the base of the leaves like L. tigrinum. I have had this lily in good condition for years; but a species of burrowing mouse,
so common in Florida, destroyed these and many other Lily bulbs last winter.
A few days ago I received another con-
signment of bulbs of this and the next species from Burma. This species, with some protection, has proved perfectly hardy near Boston.
The Nepal Lily (L. Nepalense) is my special favorite. It grows wild in the western and central portions of the Hima-
layas, and has recently been collected in quantity in Burma. The slightly fra-
grant ﬂowers have a purplish crimson tube, and the segments are broadly tipped with creamy white—a most beautiful color combination. Though growing at a higher altitude than the last-named species, it is much more delicate.
For all the true Lilies I have found the following mode of culture the one most likely to give good results. Prepare a bed under half shade. Dig out the soil to the depth of three feet, and place on the bottom a layer of oak trunks. Cover this with a mixture of rich muck, leaf-
soil, old cow-manure, along with some lime and a liberal quantity of crushed charcoal. Fill up to the rim. Mix thor_
oughly, and dig the bed repeatedly be-
fore planting. All the bulbs should be planted in November or early in Decem-
ber. Surround each bulb (which should be covered with three inches of soil)
with crushed charcoal, and press the soil
ﬁrmly around it. When in full growth,
I apply a small quantity of Painter’s Si-
mon Pure garden fertilizer. This also helps to keep out the burrowing mice,
which are so destructive to all the Lily bulbs. Never order Lily bulbs in spring
—they are always a failure. I also sur-
round'all my choice Lily plants with broken bricks and stones. This helps to keep the soil cool, an essential point in Lily culture. The Lily will never flour-
ish where the surface of the soil becomes hot. Almost all the Lilies are in full growth in our dry season. If the growth is in any way checked during this time, they invariably perish; with the exception of the L. longiflorum section. For this rea-
son they must be kept well watered.
THE GENUS GLORIOSA, OR CLIMBING LILIES In the foregoing I have pointed out that the true Lilies need careful attention,
if success is to follow. It is quite differ-

ent with the Gloriosas. They are per-
fectly at h0me,in Florida, No plants are grown more easily and with less care.
Deep rich soil, and a support to climb upon are all they require. They are all tropical plants, one species being found in India and the others in Central Africa.
This genus, evidently so closely allied to the true Lilies when we consider the foli-
age and ﬂowers, is a puzzle to the biol-
ogist as far as the rootstock is concerned.
In the Lilies we have typical bulbs made up of numerous loose scales; while Glori-
osas have peculiarly shaped solid tubers,
giving no clue to their relationship.
The most magniﬁcent of all the species is the new Uganda Climbing Lily
(Gloriosa Rothschildiana). It starts into growth with me by the middle of April, and is in full ﬂower by the middle of May. (Some varieties, however, start‘
much later.) It is a very vigorous grower,
climbing to a height of from six to ten feet. The ﬂowers, as in all the species,
are axillary, near the ends of the stems.
The points of the leaves are provided with tendril-like apices, with which the plant fastens itself to bushes and tall herbage.
The ﬂowers are large and very gorgeous.
lily-like_ with reﬂexed segments, and of a dazzling orange-scarlet color with yel-
low edges. Each stem bears from eight to ten ﬂowers, which open successively:
the lower ones ﬁrst and the terminal ones last. This species was discovered several years ago in Uganda, Africa. and was introduced into cultivation by Lord \Val-
ter Rothschild of Tring, England; from whom I received about a dozen tubers in the spring of 1905.
The Malabar Glory Lily (G. superba)
starts into growth much later, usually not before the beginning of June. It is also a very strong grower and exceedingly
ﬂoriferous, each stem producing from ten to thirty of its showy blossoms. The stems, attaining a height of from six to ten feet, often throw out side-shoots at their tops. The ﬂowers are rather dis-
appointing at ﬁrst, from the predominance of green in them; but after a few days,
bright orange-yellow hues supersede the green almost entirely. Nothing can be more striking than this lily in full bloom,
clambering over a ﬂowering specimen of Pleroma macranthum. The bright, glow-
ing, orange-yellow ﬂowers of the Glori-
osa, and the large, glossy, bluish-purple blossoms of the Pleroma, show a charm-
ing and strikingly beautiful contrast. I have fertilized this species with the pollen of G. Rothschildiana and vice versa; and I have now quite a number of promising hybrids from both species. In 1906 I raised several hundred seedlings of the Malabar Glory Lily. and most of them
ﬂowered last year. I have never noticed such a variation as was displayed here,
though the plant was crossed with its own pollen. Some plants were strong grow-
ers; others showed a weak constitution.
Many had broad, large leaves; others small and narrow foliage. But the great-
est diﬂ‘erence was displayed in the blos-
soms; the color ranging from a dull yel-
lowish green to the deepest orange-yel-
low. Some of the ﬂowers even were pure yellow.
The Mozambique Glory Lily (G. vire-
sccns), as its name implies, was intro-
duced from Mozambique. Its prevailing color is yellow, with some green.
Leopold’s Glory Lily (G. Leopoldii)
seems to be intermediate between two already mentioned. The ﬂowers are Pure yellow when opening, changing ﬁnally to

a much brighter and deeper hue. The segments show rosy-red streaks and spots in the center.
A friend of mine in France sent me this spring an evidently new species,
which was collected on the Congo. .The tuber is very thick and shaped like a wedge, not branched in tomahawk-like fashion as in other species.
Plant in deep, rich soil; either near a shrub over which the plant may clamber,
or give a bamboo stem with branches left intact as a support. Do not disturb the tuber for a number of years; and give,
each spring, an application of good com-
mercial fertilizer.
Sandersonia aurantiaca and Littonia modesta are allied plants from Natal.
Both have bell-shaped, yellow-orange blossoms; both are climbers and both grow well in Florida,
Tritomas (Kniphoﬁa) grow well in Florida, and flower {in profusion; blllt they need attention and good soil rich in humus, not too dry and not too wet. An application each spring of cow manure as a top-dressing is essential to their wel-
fare. Several years ago I had a collec-
tion of about twenty-ﬁve different sorts.
They were planted out on rather high and dry pine-land, where they grew fairly well. A few years later I intended to improve their condition, and prepared a bed in the rich soil near the lake. When the rainy season came, the bed was soon entirely submerged; and my entire col-
lection, consisting of several hundred plants, was lost. All the Tritomas are natives of Africa.
The Day Lily (Hemerocallis) grows as well in Florida as anywhere else, soon forming large and conspicuous clumps of great beauty. Though the individual
ﬂower only lasts one day, the blossoms are produced in such abundance, and are so showy, that Day Lilies should ﬁnd a place in every garden. The most vigor-
ous grower is the common Tawny Day Lily (H. fulva), with large lily-like,
tawny-orange flowers. The double form of this (H. fulva ﬂ. pl.) and another double form from Japan (H. Kwanso ﬂ,
pl.)—-the latter with strikingly varie-
gated foliage—deserves extensive dissem-
mination.
The Lemon Day Lily (H. ﬁava) is an exceedingly beautiful plant, with large lemon colored flowers, strongly fragrant.
I also greW' H. Middendorﬁii with golden yellow ﬂowers, and H. Thunbergii with sweet-scented bright yellow blos-
soms, and some hybrids which I raised from the various species,
Day Lilies require a very rich soil.
They are splendid objects among, or in front, of shrubbery.
THE IRIS FAMILY (IRIDACEAE).
This very large family is rich in ﬁrst-
class garden plants, comprising such well—
known genera as Gladiolus, Watsonia,
Antholyza, Crocus, Babiana. Ix i a,
Sparaxis, Moraea, Tigridia, Montbretia,
etc.; but the most important is the genus Iris itself. About 175 species of Iris are known to science. With the exception of a few North African species, all are natives of the North Temperate Zone,
inhabiting North Amerioa, Asia and Eu-
rope. The most important of all, and the most easily grown, is the German Iris
(Iris Germanica), the glory of northern gardens in June. It is a failure in Flor-
ida. When I made the State my per-
manent home, in 1902, I brought with me about a thousand rhizomes, in about forty distinct and beautiful garden forms.
They died out one after the other, and in three years none were left. This Iris is so beautiful that it is worth all the

trouble to grow it. I have had the dwarf Iris pumila in ﬂower in the autumn months. Some plants which were set out on my place in 1886, were still in exist-
ence in 1896; but they never made much growth. '
In moist rich soil the Japanese Iris
(1, 1aevigata) ﬂourishes with all the vigor of a native plant. It will not grow on high dry pine—land or in poor soil. The soil must be rich in humus. A rich black vegetable mold near the edge of the water is just the right place for this exquisitely beautiful plant. Before planting add a very liberal amount of old cow-manure to the soil; also apply good commercial fertilizer early in spring, just before
ﬂowering. There is such a wealth of rich and delicate colors in the different vari-
eties, and they ﬂower so abundantly, that it seems strange that they are not grown more in Florida. There are hundreds of
ﬁne varieties, single and double, which almost all originated in Japanese gardens.
Our Florida Iris (I, hexagona) should not be omitted from this list; as it is a very beautiful and easily grown plant,
growing well where the Japanese species
ﬂourishes. There is also a pure white form of it. This species offers a good
ﬁeld for the hybridizer.
The Roof Iris (I. tectorum) of Japan thrives ﬁnely in my garden in half shade and in rich moist soil. As its name im-
plies, it grows largely on the straw roofs of Japanese houses.
There are undoubtedly numerous spe-
cies of the rhizomatous Irises which will thrive splendidly in our gardens. I only experimented with them in a limited way;
but hope to take up the genus as a spe—
cialty in the near future,
I have never planted the bulbous Irises,
such as the English and Spanish, and I Nazarina, I. Sarii and I. Bismarckiana have found Iris Susiana, I. Iberica, I.
a failure. In their native home they rest in a dry hot soil during the summer and autumn months; while here they grow and ﬂower in the dry season, April and May, and rest in the rainy season, which invariably makes the thick rhizomes rot.
To Mr. E, N. Reasoner belongs the credit of having introduced to our gar-
dens an Iris-like plant, which is at once a most vigorous grower and an abundant bloomer. It is at home on our high, dry pine-land, and also in moister soil, but it will not ﬂourish in places where our wild Iris and the Japanese Iris thrive best.
This is the Natal Iris (Moraea iridioi-
des), a veritable jewel for our gardens.
If well cared for, it will soon form large clumps and will ﬂower four or ﬁve times during the spring and summer months.
In order to see it at its best, it should be planted in groups or large beds. The HOWers are three to four inches across,
pure white, and marked with deep yellow on the claws of the outer segments; the style is marked with blue—a very strik-

The Gladiolus (the Gandavensis as well as the Childsii and Groff varieties)

izer, Max Leichtlin, of Baden-Baden,
Germany.
Last year I received from my friend,
Dr. \V alter Van Fleet, another celebrated hybridizer, a number of tropical African kinds. Among them G. Quartinianus,
with dazzling red ﬂowers having an or-
ange-yellow throat. These ﬂower in Oc-
tober and November, at a time when all other Gladioli have gone to rest. They are all vigorous growers, and the stems attain to a height of from three to ﬁve feet.
The Gladiolus also does best in half-
shade, and the soil should be made rich with old cow-manure. The ﬂowers are not of long duration here in Florida, and therefore the stem should be cut when the ﬁrst flower opens. Placed in the house in a vase, all the flowers will open, and they last much longer in this condition and give much better satisfaction.
THE AMARYLLIS FAMILY.
DACEAE.)
(AM ARYLLI-
The word Amaryllis sounds to me like poetry. No other word is so charming to my ear_ The mere thought of it carries me away into the world of my ideals.
Noble form, gorgeous colors, indescriba-
ble beauty, reﬁnement, delicacy, delicious fragrance—all these attributes are com-
bined in the Amaryllis. I have given up the cultivation of Orchids in order to devote all my time, my undivided interest,
to these plants. I came to Florida with the sole object in my mind of growing and hybridizing Amaryllis. I bought my place in 1883 with the view to make the cultivation of Amaryllis my specialty.
When I say Amaryllis, I mean the word in the broader sense of the Amaryllis family. This noble family comprises such superb genera as Amaryllis, Hippeastrum,
Crinum, Hymenocallis, Pancratium, Is-
mene, Griﬁinia, Eucharis, H'aemanthus,
Ammocharis, Buphane, Brunsvigia, Spre-
kelia, Lycoris, Nerine, Vallota, Habran—
thus, Zephyranthes, Cooperia, Clivia, Al-
stroemeria, etc.—all names sounding familiar to those who take a deeper in-
terest in ﬁoriculture, all very important and beautiful garden plants. Though closely allied to the true Lilies—which they not only rival but eclipse, alike in beauty and fragrance—they are of much easier culture, and flower more abundantly,
I am sorry to say that I have not been successful in ﬁowering' the true Amaryllis or Belladonna Lily (Amaryllis Bella-
donna) a native of South Africa. I am of the opinion that this is the most ex-
quisite of all bulbous plants. It invaria-
bly ﬂowers in August, before the leaves appear; and the large ﬁnely formed blos-
soms, varying from a delicate pink to a deep purplish rose, exhale a very strong and delicious perfume—the very ideal of perfumes.
About ten years ago, I planted several hundred bulbs, partly on high dry soil,
partly on lower land, and partly in a half shady position. All grew well and multi-
plied rapidly and those on low ground flourished best: but not one bulb ever flowered. In Texas, and. even much farther north, and also in California, the Belladonna Lily ﬂowers profusely. Evi_
dently it needs a heavier soil, or it may dislike our wet summers.
The most valuable, the most gorgeous,
and the most showy of all bulbous plants are undoubtedly the Hippeastrum species and hybrids, everywhere known as the Amaryllis. The scientiﬁc name which was given to this genus by Dean Herbert,
the great Amaryllis specialist, means

Knight's Star. They are all natives of the American Tropics, occurring in a wild state in the rich vegetable mold of the primeval forest; in cool mountain glens; among the grass of the llanos; or even as epiphytes on trees, among Or-
chids, Bromeliads, Aroids, Ferns, etc. One species, the Blue Amaryllis (Hippeastrum procerum), grows in the full tropical sun on rocks near Petropolis, Brazil. When in ﬂower all the species are strikingly beautiful—so beautiful that even the dull Indian or the indolent peon cannot help pausing a moment to admire them. With the exception of the fancy-leafed Cala-
diums, no plants in our Florida gardens are admired as much or create such en-
thusiasm as the various Amaryllis and their still more gorgeous hybrids. When I saw the ﬁrst clumps of Johnson’s Ama-
ryllis in a garden in Houston, Texas, in May, 1879, I stood speechless. Their en-
chanting beauty, their brilliant color and reﬁned form overpowered me. From that time on to the present day, I made the cultivation of this class of plants my spe-
cialty. I entered a ﬁeld with unlimited possibilities. I began to collect the vari-
ous species from their native countries,
and added the best hybrids from Eu-
ropean collections. I began myself to hybridize with excellent results from the start. This was about thirty years ago;
and at present my own hybrids rival in beauty of color, perfect form and sub-
stance, the best European collections. I grow at present all the species that could be obtained, with all the best old and re-
cent hybrids of European plant breeders;
and my collection of named hybrids con-
sists of about a thousand different vari-
eties.
All the species are most valuable gar-
den plants here in Florida. There are about ﬁfteen species in cultivation, and about as many varieties or local forms of the different species.
In April, most of the Florida gardens are aglow with gorgeous masses of the Orange Amaryllis or Orange Lily (Hip-
peastrum equestre). It revels in the ap parently poor sandy soil, soon forming imposing clumps which produce numer-
ous stems, each carrying two large, some-
what nodding, bright orange-red ﬂowers,
with a yellowish-white star. Planted in large groups or beds, these Amaryllis in full ﬂower produce a magniﬁcent sight,
being far more beautiful than Tulips and other bedding plants of the northern gar-
den. Planted around palms and in front of shrubbery, they are particularly ef-
fective. They form a charming picture in long lines on borders, and along ver-
andas, backed by such beautiful shrubs the sky-blue Eranthemum (Daedalacan-
thus nervosus), and the deep-blue Thun_
bergia erecta, which ﬂowers at the same time. This species is a native of the West Indies, Central America and North-
ern South America. A beautiful form
(H. equestre VVolteri) was lately intro-
duced into cultivation from Costa Rica.
Its ﬂowers are glowing deep orange-scar-
let.
The double Orange Amaryllis (H.
equestre Alberti) is common in the gar-
dens of Havana, and is frequently found under cultivation in Florida. Its ﬂowers last considerably longer than those of the single form.
Johnson’s Amaryllis, the so-called Scarlet Lily (Hippeastrum Johnsoni), is one of our most valuable garden plants.
It does not thrive as well in our state as in Texas, at Mobile or at Charleston, but I have seen magniﬁcent clumps, beds, and long borders of it in Orlando. With a

little care it will thrive everywhere in the State. The ﬂowers are produced on stems about two feet high, and each stem carries a magniﬁcent umbel of from four to six large trumpet-shaped blossoms.
The ground color is a very brilliant cherry-red, and each segment has a dis-
tinct white band. It exhales a delicate aromatic fragrance, which becomes quite powerful when thousands of ﬂowers are open at the same time. This is the ﬁrst hybrid that was ever raised. In the be-
ginning of the last century, an English watchmaker by the {name of Johnson,
crossed Hippeastrum vittatum with H.
Reginae, and the result was this ﬁne Amaryllis, which ﬂowered for the ﬁrst time in 1810. Thousands of hybrids soon followed, but this is the only one which has held its own—“the survival of the ﬁttest.” It is so beautiful that it should ﬁnd a place in every garden in Florida.
Hippeastrum Reginae is said to be a native of Mexico and the West Indies to Brazil and Peru. I have not succeeded in obtaining it from its native wilds. A bulb received from Europe about ten years ago has only formed two offsets so far. It grows well and ﬂowers reg-
ularly each year. The color is a glowing scarletJ with a greenish-white star. My plants are evergreen.
H. vittatum exhibits funnel-shaped,
slightly fragrant ﬂowers. The ground color is pure white, with broad white bands, which are bordered on each side by a very distinct purplish-crimson stripe.
Its native home is in the rather dry re-
gions of the Andes of Peru. This species grows much better in California than in the humid climate of Florida, and most of the Amaryllis hybrids, have origin-
ated in the former state, are produc-
tions of this species. No other species has been used so much for hybridizing purposes in bygone days. Very beautiful forms were frequently obtained. They were, however, weak growers. They had small, long-tubed ﬂowers with narrow segments, and the form was invariably imperfect. For this reason, neither the species nor its hybrids are used any longer by the best plant-breeders. I have abandoned its use long ago,
The Funnel-shaped Amaryllis (H.
solandri ﬂorum), I have received repeat-
edly from Caracas, Venezuela. It is de-
ciduous, like the last-named, and grows abundantly on the grassy plains or llanos. The color is greenish—white and the tube is about ten inches long. It exhales a very strong fragrance.
H. solandri ﬂorum conspicuum. This is one of the most beautiful Amaryllis in existence and deliciously fragrant. The
ﬂowers are long trumpet-shaped, some-
what reminding one of the Easter Lily;
and its stems, which carry a magniﬁcent umbel of from six to eight ﬂowers, grow three to four feet high. The ground color varies from pure white to deep pink,
striped and lined with deep purplish-red,
and suffused a little with scarlet. It is much superior to the type. Some years ago a friend of mine in San Jose, Costa Rica,
whom I had asked to keep an eye on the different wild and cultivated forms of Amaryllis in Costa Rica, informed me that only H. vittatum was growing abun-
dantly in the gardens. He sent me at the same time a few bulbs. When opening the box, I saw at once that it could not be H. vittatum, as the bulbs were of different form, and they were covered,
moreover, with deep brownish-black tunics. while in H. vittatum they are light grayish-brown. When the bulbs began

to bloom a few weeks later, I recognized them at once as the above-named variety,
A little later I received another lot of a hundred bulbs, which are now growing beautifully here in my garden. I have used them largely in my hybridizing work, with the following points in view:
ﬁrst, to introduce vigor and strong growth into my strain; second, to make my Amaryllis hybrids fragrant; and third, to obtain a more numerous ﬂowered umbel. After having accomplished this,
I never used the variety again. The ﬁrst and second generation of seedlings had comparatively long tubes, but in the third,
the wide open form and the short tube predominated. I still grow this Amaril-
lis, however, for its own sake, and I always greatly admire it when in bloom.
The long blunt leaves have a decidedly glaucous green color.
The Parrot Amaryllis (H. psittaci-
num), from southern Brazil, is not a gor-
geously colored species; but it has been very fruitful in the production of ﬁrst-
class hybrids. The celebrated hybrid,
“Empress of India,” raised by De Graal’f Bros., 0f Leyden, Holland, one of the parents of the new race of show Ama-
ryllis, was raised from this species. The tube is very short. The ground color is greenish-white and all the segments have a crimson edge and a green keel, with crimson stripes radiating from the keel.
At one time, common in cultivation, it is at present diﬂicult to obtain true to name. It grows vigorously in Florida,
and is very interesting.
H. rutilum is perhaps the most com-
mon Amaryllis in the forests of southern Brazil near Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo,
etc., branching out in a number of very beautiful and distinct varieties. All are stoloniferous, producing numerous blind offsets around the base of the bulb, which may lie dormant for years. In the type the ﬂowers are bright crimson with a green keel extending half-way up the seg-
ments. In Milwaukee, where the Amaryl-
lis belongs to the most popular house plants, I frequently noticed a beautiful bright yellow Amaryllis suffused with or-
ange. It was even more common than Amaryllis Johnsoni. I frequently saw spe-
cimens with IO to 20 ﬂowers all open at the same time. These specimens usually
ﬂower twice a year and the bulbs multi—
ply rapidly by offsets. This Amaryllis proved to be H. rutilum fulgidum, from southern Brazil. I procured a few bulbs and planted them out in my Florida gar-
den, where they soon formed imposing specimens. A former Floridian, a grad-
ua-te of Rollins College, now in the em-
ploy of the Brazilian Government as a horticultural expert, Prof. Adolf Hempel,
sent me another beautiful variety, H. ru-
tilum equestriforme, a very strong grow-
ing kind. The ﬂowers remind one some-
what of an Orange Amaryllis. There is also a yellow form, H. rutilum citrinum,
and a saffron colored subspecies, H. ru-
tilurri crocatum. These two forms, which would be very important for hybridizing purposes, I have not yet been able to add to my collection,
H. aulicum, the Lily of the Palace,
and its ﬁne variety, H. aulicum platy-
petalum, are natives of the Organ moun-
tains, Brazil, where they grow abundantly among old rotten wood in shady places.
Another still more ﬂoriferous variety. H.
aulicum robustum, comes from Blume-
nau, southern Brazil. They all have beautiful glossy evergreen leaves, and all
ﬂower about Christmas or New Year’s time. The form of the large, widely open ﬂowers is rather unsymmetrical II

from a ﬂorist’s point of view, and the color is a deep, dazzling crimson, very glowing and rich. My ﬁrst attempt to grow these plants in the open proved a failure. They need a rich vegetable soil,
and a liberal supply of old, well rotted cow-manure. As they all are evergreens and ﬂower in winter, they also need some protection. I now grow them in beds surrounded by boards, so as to be easily covered, when cold weather sets in. The soil consists of half-rotten wood. old cow-
manure and black soil from the mucky edge of the lake. In this compost the plants grow vigorously and ﬂower abun-
dantly. When in full growth they also receive a liberal application of commer-
cial fertilizer. preferably bone-meal. This species and its varieties belong to the most important ancestors of our new race of show Amaryllis.
H. Organense, also from the Organ Mountains. is similar to the above,
though quite distinct when closely studied. It is a vigorous grower and
ﬂowers in winter with H. aulicum. It thrives luxuriantly with the same 'treat-
ment.
H, pardinum. This exquisite species was discovered in 1866 by the late Mr.
Pearce, in the Andes of Peru. It ﬂow-
ered ﬁrst in 1867, and created a sensa-
tion among ﬂower lovers, on account of its ﬁne form and unique coloration. The short-tubed, star-like ﬂowers have a greenish-white ground color, and are pro-
fusely and minutely spotted with crim-
son. Some of the varieties have a de-
cided yellowish ground color and some are, in addition to the spots, ﬂushed with red. This species has opened a new ﬁeld for the hybridizer. The progeny, how-
ever, though of very beautiful form, is of weak constitution. I have used it at
ﬁrst but have ﬁnally abandoned it. The inﬂuence of this species is still noticeable in many of my hybrids, which are min—
utely spotted with deep red on a white or pink ground.
H. Leopoldi, Leopold’s Amaryllis. This species was also discovered by the late Mr. Pearce, in the Andes of Peru, and it ﬂowered ﬁrst in cultivation in 1870.
It is so beautiful and distinct, so perfect in form and so reﬁned, and its color is so unique and so strikingly gorgeous,
that Amaryllis lovers at once placed it at the head of the entire group. The ideal of perfect form and exquisite color combination had at last appeared, and it was used at once in cross-breeding. The very large ﬂowers are short-tubed. The ground color is a beautiful bright red in the center, with a biﬁd white keel in the lower half of the red, and a large green-
ish-white throat: the tips of all the seg-
ments are white. The beautiful perfect form of our new race of show Amaryllis.
their broad rounded segments, and their great substance have been derived from this species. No _other species has in—
ﬂuenced the progeny in such a decided manner. The grand hybrids raised by James Veitch and Sons, London. the still
ﬁner Aigburth hybrids. produced by Robt.
P. Ker and Sons, of Liverpool. and the Westorbirt strain of Col. G. L. Holford.
the ﬁnest of all, were only possible after H. Leopoldi had been introduced. _I also used this species largely in my cross-
breeding. Many of my hybrids show its inﬂuence, not only in form but also in color, though I have lost the species long ago.
The foregoing is a list of Amaryllis which I have grown, and which I mostly still grow. All of the species and vari-
eties mentioned have been used in cross-

breeding. Though the blood of H. vit—
tatum has been avoided, it is still tracea-
ble through H. Johnsoni, a hybrid of this species and H, Reginae. I have not been able to use H. aulicum, but its blood,
nevertheless, ﬂows in the veins of my strain, as I used H. Ackermanni pucher-
rimum largely in my hybridization work,
and this is a cross between H. aulicum and H. _Iohnsoni.
Though I have cultivated and raised Amaryllis since 1879, I did not start cross-breeding on a large scale before the year 1890. In the year named, I added to my collection a few dozen of De Graaff’s best hybrids and many of Veitch’s new productions, such as Southey, Enchantress Madonna. Giant, Giantess, etc. Em-
press of India, a magniﬁcent kind with broad rounded segments, and of a glow-
ing orange-scarlet color with broad white bands, was my starting-point. My aim was to produce a vigorous strain with short tubes and broad rounded segments,
of symmetrical form and good substance,
The ﬁrst attempts were very encouraging and the resulting hybrids were far su-
perior to their parents. But the seedlings were very much alike. In order to obtain new breaks of color, I used these hybrids as well as those obtained from Europe,
in crossing them with the various species in my possession and vice versa. Finally many thousands of seedlings were grow-
ing in my greenhouse in Milwaukee. The
ﬁrst began to ﬂower at an age of three years. I watched their development with a restless anticipation. Most of these hybrids were inferior to one or both of their parents, but new colors were abun—
dant. I only kept a few of the best, and all the rest were discarded. The most beautiful of all were the crosses between the best show Amaryllis and H, Leo-
poldii. Hybrids between Empress of India and H. equestre exhibited ﬁne or-
ange and salmon-red tints. This cross-
breeding and weeding out of all inferior kinds was continued for many years, un-
til the colors were ﬁxed. Since I900,
I have not made much use of the species any longer, only using now. in cross—
breeding the best of my own hybrids. I also employ frequently, as pollen plants,
such English hybrids as have received a
ﬁrst-class certiﬁcate or an award of merit from the Royal Horticultural Society of London.
All my hybrids at present combine a vigorous growth and brilliancy of color with a ﬁne open symmetrical form and great substance. The usual size of the
ﬂowers of the true species is from ﬁve to six inches, in the new race of show hybrids it ranges from seven to eleven inches. They range in color from an almost pure white to a deep glowing crim-
son, without a trace of any other color.
There is rarely a poor ﬂower in a batch of a thousand seedlings. _ The green star in the center of the tube, 'so prevailing in the species and the older hybrids, and so objectionable to the ﬂorist and ex-
hibitor, no longer mars the beauty of the flowers. It has given place to a pure white or a yellowish tint. The variety of colors is really marvelous in these new hybrids. There are numerous kinds with a deep glowing crimson. a dazzling scar-
let or vermilion, a bright orange red and a delicate salmon ground color. Then we have deep pink and deep rosy purple varieties. Most of the brilliant red colors sparkle in the sun as if overlaid with gold-dust. Many are crimson selfs.
Others have broad pure white bands;
others a white or lemon yellow star.
Some of the red hybrids have segments

with a pure white edge; others are tipped with white. There are ﬂowers mottled red and white, and a crushed strawberry color is by no means rare. I have ob-
tained a few hybrids with a sulphur-yel—
low ground color, lined and penciled with red. Some almost pure white ones with a narrow red band around the edge of the segments are particularly valuable and so are other white ones which are densely and minutely freckled with red. I have succeeded in raising quite a number of an almost pure white color, showing only a few traces of delicate red on the seg—
ments. These are very effective. Many of my hybrids show the inﬂuence of H.
Leopoldi in their form and color; having either a deep crimson, a scarlet or even a salmon ground color, with a white star and white-tipped segments. All are ever-
green and of vigorous constitution. The leaves are from two to three feet long,
and are of a deep green or glaucous green color. When grown in rich soil, they often exhibit deep reddish-brown or chocolate-colored tints. In many varieties,
the entire lower part of the leaves shows a deep purplish-brown hue.
This strain of Amaryllis is of very easy cultivation, but in order to do their best,
they must have some attention. They grow as well in sunshine as in half-shade;
on high pine land as well as on lower soil On a bed a hundred feet long and three feet wide. three hundred bulbs can be easily planted. Two loads of cow-man-
ure should be spread over this bed, and then it must be deeply spaded. Some clay mixed with the soil will prove beneﬁcial.
The bulbs should be planted in such a way that the point of the neck is covered with at least one or two inches of soil.
After having ﬁnished their ﬂowering,
and again in September or October when in full growth, they require either a top dressing or two inches of cow-manure or some good commercial fertilizer, either bone meal or, still better, Painter’s Simon P‘ure garden mixture. If in any way neglected after ﬂowering, the bulbs be-
come so weak that they do not ﬂower the following season. These Amaryllis are gross feeders, but manures too rich in ammonia should be avoided. They rather require foods rich in phosphoric acid and potash.
Hippeastrum Johnsoni is hardy as far north as Washington, if given some pro-
tection. In the gardens of Raleigh, N.
C. it is a rather common plant. The Or-
ange Amaryllis is much more tender, My show hybrids I think will prove hardy in all the southern states bordering the Gulf of Mexico. They will not suffer by cold if the soil does not actually freeze. They may lose their foliage, but the bulbs will remain unhurt. A large bed of these Amaryllis in full bloom will outrival in beauty and brilliancy all the true Lilies,
and most other plants.
All the Amaryllis, and even the Cri-
nums and particularly the Hymenocallis
(Spider Lily). suffer a good deal from the ravages of the Amaryllis caterpillar and the lubber grasshoppers. The former often appears in countless numbers on the underside of the foliage. Here they can be easily killed. If left undisturbed they will soon defoliate the entire plant. W hen larger, they even damage the bulbs by eating into their centers. Usually on March I 5, when the Amaryllis are 'in full bloom, the earliest hordes of lubber grasshoppers crawl out of the ground;
at ﬁrst small and brownish. then black with red stripes on their backs, which change into brighter yellow stripes a little later. They are ravenous feeders from

the beginning, preferring the members of the Amaryllis family, particularly Hip-
peastrums, as food plants. They mar the foliage, eat holes into the ﬂower-stem and greedily devour the ﬂower-buds. A constant vigilance is necessary. They take their meals twice a day—the ﬁrst right after sunrise, and the second a little after noontime. After having fed, they crawl upon a bush or a small tree where they can easily be seen and killed. The young ones are gregarious. In dense masses they alight on slender stems where all can be killed with one stroke. After two and a half months have elapsed, they again change color. This mature color is a yellowish gray. Their wings are short and red. Being very clumsy in their movements, they are easily caught and killed. It is surprising how much damage a full-grown lubber grasshopper can do. Ismenes and Eucharis Amazon-
ica, as well as the beautiful and deli-
ciously fragrant Hymenocallis macroste-
phana, H. fragrans and H. speciosa are perfectly at home in our garden; but on account of the lubber grasshoppers it is scarcely possible to enjoy their flowers or the beauty of their luxuriant foliage.
Hand picking is, as far as I know, the only way of getting rid of these two pests.
The late afternoon hours of spring,
summer and autumn in Florida have an indescribable charm, a charm peculiarly their own, and the early morning hours are scarcely less enchanting. This is the time to enjoy nature, to enjoy our gardens and ﬂowers. In the evening glow or very early in the morning, I am fond of wandering through my Amaryllis and Caladium garden to meditate on the in-
effable glory of nature, to think of my ideals and of all that makes life beautiful.
H‘ow charming is this Florida evening glow as it falls on the brilliant blossoms of the Amaryllis or on the gorgeous leaves of the Caladiums! In the cedars near by, the cardinal sings. in jubilant notes its evening hymn, the mockingbird pours forth its unrivaled melodies from the top of an orange—tree, and the loud whistling calls of the chuck-Will’s widow resound from the thickets of near woodlands. It is tWilight. The air is Wonderfully soft and salubrious, and the bright stars appear and shine as they only can shine in Florida—the landof ﬂowers,
the land of my ideals in horticulture.

PLANTING FOR HOME ADORNMENT.
By W. C. Steele.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
When I was notiﬁed that I had again been appointed as a member of the stand-
ing Committee on Ornamentals, I felt that there was nothing which I could say that would be worth the time which it would occupy.
So many able committees have already made reports covering the entire subject that it did not seem that there was any-
thing left for me to say.
After some study, I thought that I would recommend the planting of native trees for home adornment; but that would leave out some things which I wanted to mention, therefore, after changing my plan several times, I ﬁnally settled upon the title given at the head of this report,
which will admit of the introduction of anything which can be made useful for the purpose.
Those of you who heard President Taber’s address to this Society at the meeting in May, 1905, or who read it as printed in the annual report for that year, will remember the eloquent tribute which he gave to the beauties of the na-
tural growth in a thicket near his home.
It is a fact, greatly to be regretted, that the American people do not appreciate the beauties of the natural growth around them. If they can get something which has been imported at great expense, they will buy it at a high price, when the woods are full of much more beautiful things which may be had for the trouble of going after them and digging and bringing them home.
I am a believer in the use of native plants so far as possible, not to the ex~
clusion of the many beautiful and desira-
ble foreigners which have come to stay,
but rather to supplement them, or to take their place around many homes where the expense of these foreign beauties cannot be afforded.
Of course, the evergreens stand at the head, the list including Magnolia grandi-
ﬂora and Magnolia glauca, the latter be-
ing known as Sweet Bay. Both are indis~
pensable where the space can be spared to allow them the room needed for proper expansion. To them I would add the Hollies. the common species Ilex opaca,
is so well known that it needs no farther mention, but it may not be so well known that there are other species, Ilex Dahoon and I. cassine which are quite as valuable and are even Inore showy, when in fruit,
as the red berries are borne in greater profusion.
It is often desirable to have a tree during summer where shade is not wanted in winter, a deciduous species is much more desirable for such a situation.
One of the best, if not the very best.
of our native species is Acer rubrum, the soft or swamp maple. It usually blooms in February or early in March, but this year it blossomed in January. A single
ﬂower of this tree is small and incon-
spicuous, but a large specimen covered with clusters of blossoms, which are found at the end of every twig, is very showy and attracts a great deal of atten-
tion. The ﬂowers are bright scarlet and the seeds as soon as formed, and until ready to "drop, retain the same bright

color. The only objection to it, is the fact that it produces large crops of seed which drift a long ways when the wind blows hard and as they germinate readily they become a nuisance, unless there is a drouth at the time when they fall. Al—
though this maple is a native of swamps and low land, its common name being swamp or soft maple, still it will grow well on dry soil if it is not too poor,
Probably the next most desirable native deciduous tree for ornamental planting,
is the Sweet Gum, Liquidambar styraci-
ﬂua. Like the maple described above, it is found naturally, in swamps or moist land, but it still more easily adapts itself to dry land culture and is not so depend-
ent on rich soil. It is one of the most symmetrical trees that we have, when al-
lowed space in which to develop itself properly. In autumn it shows the most brilliant coloring of any of our native trees. Although it is a deciduous species,
it retains its foliage later than most spe-
cies; often the old leaves hang on until pushed off by the swelling of the buds as the new leaves open. Occasionally the same thing happens with the soft Maple.
I had a small maple this season which re-
tained much of last year’s foliage on the upper twigs, when the lower part of the tree was in bloom, and a few still hung on when the seeds were grown and the new leaves were more than half grown.
I have more than a dozen of these trees on the place, and this spring was sur-
prised to notice that there was a great difference in the time when they opened their leaves; on some the leaves would be almost grown, while on others not forty feet away, on exactly the same soil, the buds were but little more than fairly open.
While on this subject of curious varia-
tions in the habits of growth of trees,
I will call attention to a fact which may or may not have been noticed by you.
All evergreen trees shed their leaves, but usually it is done so gradually, while the new ones are coming, that it is not not-
iced. This year some Magnolia glauca trees near my house shed their leaves so nearly all at once, that they were quite bare and looked for a time like deciduous trees; it happened just as the ﬁrst ﬂow—
ers were opening, and their almost leaf-
less branches showing here and there scattered blossoms were a striking con-
trast to their usual appearance.
Another plant, also a native, which is usually classed as a shrub, but which can easily be grown as a small tree, is the common Elder, Sambucus Canadensis.
At the north it is called a weed, but here it is an evergreen shrub or small tree and is almost everblooming. A specimen on my own place trained to a single stem,
stands between eighteen and twenty feet high with a trunk over six inches in dia-
meter. It is seldom out of bloom, ex-
cept for a short time in the coldest weather of winter. During the summer it usually has ﬂowers and fruit of all sizes from that just formed to fully ripe berries, though the latter are soon taken off by the birds.
Vines, especially woody perennials, are always favorites with all ﬂower lovers.
Three native hardy climbers are worthy of special mention. Bignona capreolate sometimes called Cross—vine, is perhaps the most showy in the early spring. The individual ﬂowers are rather dull red in color. but when you come to a large oak literally covered with a sheet of Bignonia capreolata blossoms, it is a sight worth going miles to look at. I have good-

sized oaks when there was hardly a leaf visible so thoroughly was the top covered with the bloom of this vine.
Tecoma radicans, usually catalogued as Bignonia radicans, is another vigorous growing native vine; the ﬂowers are scar-
let, a much brighter color than those of capreolata, but it is not so profuse a bloomer at one time; that is, while it may produce as many blossoms in a season,
yet as they are scattered over a period of several weeks, instead of all opening at once, they do not make so great a display.
Bignonia capreolata is found in high ham-
mocks on dry soil, while Tecoma radicans is generally found in cypress ponds; but,
like many other natives of low land, it easily adapts itself to circumstances and will grow well on high land, if not too poor.
Last, but by no means least, I will men-
tion the Yellow Jessamine, Gelsemium sempervirens. The wild species is so well known that I should not mention it at all, were it not that I wish to call atten-
tion to the fact that the double-ﬂowered form is much more desirable than the single. It is- not quite so profuse a bloomer as the wild form, or at least it does not show as many at one time, but as the blooming period is much longer,
it may produce as many in a year. Last fall my double-ﬂowered vines began to bloom in November, and kept it up until the latter part of February or the ﬁrst of March.
So far I have conﬁned myself to native species which anyone can have for the trouble of going into the woods and dig-
ging them; the last mentioned is an ex-
ception, it is not offered, so far as I know,
except by the P, J. Berckmans Nursery Company of Augusta, Ga., and they will not send any plants by mail. I hope that some uf our Florida nurserymen will pro~
pagate and offer for sale this very de-
sirable variety.
Three years ago, Mrs. Gates, in her report on Ornamentals, recommended a wild vine, a species of Smilax, very highly. I do not think that she said a word too much in its praise. Unfor-
tunately she did not know its botanical name, nor have I been able to learn it; it is a wild Smilax and that is all that I am able to tell as to its name; but I can tell you how to ﬁnd it. If you will watch the hammock woods very closely, in early spring, until you ﬁnd a vine that is a strong, vigorous grower and bears a pro-
fusion of small greenish ﬂowers which have the fragrance of Mignonette only intensiﬁed, that is the one for which you are looking.
While on the subject of vines, I want to recommend some which are not natives and therefore must be purchased or pro-
cured by exchange with some neighbor.
Foremost stands Rhynchosperum Jasmi-
noides, sometimes called Star Jessamine,
although it is not at all related to the Jessamine family. The vine is a strong,
v i g o r o u s grower, perfectly hardy throughout this state, and for several weeks in early spring it covers itself with a sheet of pure white, very fragrant blos-
soms; the ﬂowers are so thickly set on the branches that the foliage is hidden from sight. The only objection which I have ever felt towards this vine was that in the evening the perfume is so strong that it is almost overpowering. If you are at all sensitive to strong odors, do not set this vine very close to the house.
Bignonia speciosa, Bignonia Thun-
bergiana, Pithecoctineum clematideum,
usually catalogued as Bignonia alba, and Pithecoctineum Kayense ( ?) ; the last

name was given me provisionally by the Missouri Botanic Garden from specimens which did not reach them in very good condition. These four species are all hardy, are vigorous growers and bear a profusion of beautiful ﬂowers in the spring. When I say that they are hardy,
I mean throughout the orange belt; they will not stand an indeﬁnite amount of cold, but have not been killed on my place for several years.
A m p e l o p s i s tricuspidata, the A.
Veitchi of the catalogues, and commonly called Boston Ivy or Japanese Ivy, is per-
fectly hardy, but not evergreen. This vine has every desirable feature for a screen, except that it sheds its leaves in winter. In some situations this is not a drawback and for such places no better plant can be found. The north-east end of my house is covered from the ground up to the roof by this vine, except parts of two windows which it is difﬁcult to keep clear enough to allow the light to enter. The light green leaves are so close, lapping like shingles, that no rain can reach the siding during the summer.
When the wind blows strong, from either side, the foliage moves up and down like waves of water.
Another climbing plant which I have tested quite thoroughly, deserves to be more generally cultivated. I refer to Gloriosa superba, the climbing Lily, this plant is a member of the true Lily family,
and is so gloriously beautiful that it well deserves the name Gloriosa. The ﬂowers are perfect Lilies in form and when fully developed are a rich scarlet in color. The opening buds are a greenish yellow,
which changes to pure yellow and then to scarlet. No lady who has ever seen it on my place has failed to express great delight at its wonderful beauty. The plant is an herbaceous perennial, the bulbs live over in the open ground without any protection, coming up year after year.
One caution is necessary; when growth
'starts be careful that the tip of a shoot is not broken off, for if it is, then all growth stops. Most plants will sprout from the axil of a leaf, if the end is broken off, but the Gloriosa never does.
My subject is a fascinating one, and when I begin I hardly know where to stop. There are so many plants worthy of cultivation which are but little known,
that it is difﬁcult to know what to men-
tion and what to leave out. Probably the best plan will be to stop right here and tell you to study the uncultivated lands around you; you will be surprised to ﬁnd how many beautiful things are growing there which are unknown to you.

THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THE FLOW ER GARDEN.
By Mahlon Gore.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Horticulture, as a commercial asset,
should not be underestimated. With us, who are interested in this Associa-
tion, horticulture, in its reﬁning and elevating inﬂuence upon the human family, is no less valuable. We seldom see a real lover of ﬂowers who is coarse and vulgar in his nature. How many of us can trace our ﬁrst noble impulses to Mother’s ﬂower garden? How many of us plucked ﬂowers from that garden with which to win the smiles of our chum’s coy little sister? Babies love ﬂowers and are attracted \by their beauty and fra—
grance. We ornament our houses and our tables with them; we bedeck our bride with ﬂowers, and we place ﬂowers on the graves of our departed loved ones.
The ﬂowers of Florida have already attracted thousands of visitors who, later on, have cast their lots with us and are now counted among our most desirable citizens. “There is a use in beauty,”
and nowhere is the adage exempliﬁed with more force than among horticultur-
ists. And still we do not make the most of these gifts of the Creator in adding to the attractiveness of our homes and our state. As a purely business proposi-
tion I believe that we might add twenty-
ﬁve per cent. to the commercial value of our possessions if we would give suf-
ﬁcient time and attention to the cultiva-
tion of ﬂowers and ornamental plants and shrubs. What is of more value still,
would be the added charm of home to our children; their greater interest in and love for home, and the reﬁning ef-
fect upon their developing intellects. The boy who loves ﬂowers to such a degree that he will delight to cultivate them, will
ﬁnd little time to spend in the saloon, and will have little inclination to go there for amusement.
We old men know that the girl who cultivates ﬂowers for love of them is far more lovable than her sister wh05e chief delight is matinees and social excitements,
although these last are not to be tabooed by any means, for they give the girls the opportunity to add to their own charms through dainty ﬂoral adornment.
We all love beauty, and we are richer in mind for this love. \Ve might be richer in purse if we would devote more time and attention to aesthetic horticul-
ture. I believe that one hour a day on the part of each member of this Associa-
tion, devoted to the cultivation of ﬂowers and ornamental plants, for the period of
ﬁve years, would add one hundred thou-
sand intelligent, reﬁned people to the population of Florida. Every city and town in the state should vie with all the others in adding ltO its attractions for new settlers. The competition should be sharp, determined and continuous. Each home should have its ﬂoral gem of a
ﬂower garden. Each resident should try to outdo his neighbor. Each town should try to outshine all of the rest. Every country home should have its little orna-
mental park.
With such a state of things, Florida would be the most charming state in the

Union, the most talked-about, the most thoroughly and favorably advertised spot in all the world. This is no ﬂight of fancy.
It is easily within our reach if are but wake up. I would make the work State-wide;
organize ﬂoriculture associations in every community, with ﬂoral exhibits at each monthly meeting; study landscape gar-
dening and ﬂoral and plant effect; and,
ﬁnally, forever end those oft-heard and oft-repeated ("pressions of disappoint-
ment indulged in by tourists and visitors over the fact that “there are so few ﬂow-
ers in Florida.”

Irrigation.
By Francis L. Wills.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In reply to your letter asking me for a paper on irrigation, would say that we installed our irrigating plant on this grove in April, 1905. The plant consists of a twenty-horse-power,
White-Blakeslee gasoline engine and a No. 4 Rumsey Improved Rotary Pump, located in a house thirty feet from the pond and about two hundred feet from the grove. The pump has a
ﬁve-inch suction and a four-inch dis-
charge giving two hundred ﬁfty gal-
lons of water per minute; we have a four-inch main pipe, running the en-
tire length of the grove, every 150
feet; laterals branch off from the main,
running the entire width of the grove;
the laterals start out with two—inch pipe, running down to one-inch pipe, at the extreme end.
Our stanchions consist of a three-
quarter—inch pipe, with a hose valve on top, and are 150 feet apart through-
out the entire grove. When irrigating we use loo-foot sections of three-quar-
ter-inch hose, connecting one end to the stanchions and the other end to a six-foot piece of three-quarter-inch iron piping, drawn together and sharp-
ened at one end to stick into the ground with a tee and nipple for hose connection eighteen inches from the bottom, the top ﬁtted with a three-
quarter-inch brass Magowan Spray,
the stanchions when running throw a spray that will cover thirty feet and we move the stanchions from one mid-
dle to another, until every middle has been thoroughly wet down.
We usually run twenty stanchions at a time and leave them standing in each middle forty minutes, thus giving each middle or tree 480 gallons of water,
which I think is equal to a little over three-quarters of an inch of rain.
We have made it a practice to irri- '
gate the grove whenever the moisture sinks three inches below the surface.
summer or winter, during the months of March, April and May we run an Acme Harrow over the grove as soon as it is irrigated. During a drouth we
ﬁnd it necessary to irrigate once every two or three weeks, harrowing the grove once every week; this keeps a good moisture under the sand mulch at all times.
We have under irrigation thirty acres of grove.
The plant, as I have described it,
cost us a little over $6,000 and as yet,
the plant being new, we have not had to lay out anything for repairs. I run the engine myself and have one man at $1.50 a day to move the stanchions from place to place.
The engine consumes practically twenty-ﬁve gallons of gasoline, run-
ning from nine to ten hours a day, and

it takes practically two days to irrigate ten acres; so I calculate that to irri-
gate ten acres costs—

When irrigating in hot weather we start our engine up as soon as it is light enough to see, and run it ﬁve hours; then we start up again in the afternoon at three and run until seven.
The ﬁrst year we irrigated we ran the engine steadily from daylight until dark; but I became convinced that it was not a good plan to throw water into the grove in the heat of the day.
Of course, it would be much better to irrigate at night rather than the day,
but this is not practical, as I have yet
.to ﬁnd men who will drag hose around through the grove in the dark.
Some say it is a question whether or not irrigation pays. All I can say is that our trees look well and we seem to get a pretty fair crop of fruit each year.
By J. W. Hoard.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
To the tourist or winter visitor,
Florida presents a most beautiful pic-
ture or panoramic view of ﬂowers and sunshine; of magniﬁcent and extensive evergreen forests, dotted here and there by beautiful lakes whose waters are as clear as crystal, and as pure and sparkling as the morning dew. He is delighted with our glorious climate,
our orange groves laden with their golden fruit, and our truck farms em-
bracing broad acres of growing veg-
etables. He is impressed by the scenes of nervous activity and evidences of enterprise and prosperity on every hand, and especially in and around our packing houses during the shipping season. He hears and reads of vast sums of money being made by the fruit and vegetable growers in various parts of the state. He is delighted with all he sees or hears, and, in fact, it seems to him that Nature has almost ex-
hausted her resources in making of Florida a veritable horticulturists’
paradise, leaving nothing to be desired which could in any way contribute to his happiness or success. And from his standpoint the tourist is right in his conclusions. Florida is a grand state, possessing many natural advan-
tages and horticultural possibilities for which we hereby express our thanks and gratitude to the One from whom all such blessings must come. We all love our Florida and appreciate her many natural advantages and also those which have been brought about by the efforts of her enterprising citiz-
ens; and our hearts are bound to her by invisible and mysterious ties which we cannot possibly understand nor ex-
plain and which grow stronger as the years go by.
But, at the same time, those of us

who have spent many years here, and have on several occasions seen the smiling features of our fair state dis-
ﬁgured almost beyond recognition by natural causes, are forced to admit that Florida also has several natural disadvantages, among which may be mentioned the poverty of the soil, un-
expected visits from jack-frost in win-
ter, the insufficiency of rainfall during the growing season, and a pretty good supply of insect pests of all of the lead-
ing and up-to-date varieties; and one or two other disadvantages from which nature is not responsible, viz.: the high freight rates and poor services im-
posed upon us by the railroads.
Some of these adverse conditions have been overcome by artiﬁcial means, and most of the others can and must be, or the horticultural in-
dustry will be overcome by them; and as I understand it, one of the principal objects of this Society as a body, and of each member as an individual, is to give each other the beneﬁt of what-
ever knowledge or experience we may have gained in our attempts to meet and overcome any one or all of these difﬁculties.
The problem of poor soil has been solved to the satisfaction of all con-
cerned by the fertilizer manufacturers of the state, who have placed within our reach, in convenient and available form, all of the necessary elements of plant food so essential to plant life,
and in which our Florida sand is so deﬁcient; thereby enabling us to not only make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, but even making it possible for us to grow good crops of fruits and vegetables where nothing could grow before; thus, in my opinion, placing the fertilizer man-
ufacturer in the front rank of public benefactors. The Florida Experiment Station and also the United States De-
partment of Agriculture have given and are still giving us valuable infor-
mation along the line of insect exter-
mination, by sending to our assistance specialists of the highest order, men specially trained and ﬁtted for this kind of work, who are industriously devoting their time and talents to sci-
entiﬁc investigations and experiments along these lines. It has been my privilege to become acquainted with several of these gentlemen during the past two years and make myself some-
what familiar with the work they are doing, and it gives me pleasure to say to this Society that they are meeting with success and are getting results which could never have been obtained in any other way and which will be of inestimable value to the horticulturists of Florida.
We look to the Railroad Commis-
sion, to the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Growers’ Protective Asso-
ciation, for reduced freight rates and better transportation facilities.
50 with all of the other problems disposed of, we now come to the ques-
tion of irrigation. This scarcity of rainfall during the growing season,
just when rain is most needed, is, in my opinion, the most serious difﬁculty with which the fruit and vegetable grower has to deal. It causes him more disappointments, more heart aches than all of the others combined;
it sours his disposition, causes him to

grow old before his time and, in fact,
at times it causes him to almost doubt the existence and guidance of an im-
partial and all-wise Providence.
These conditions have been grad-
ually growing worse for the past two or three seasons, until at the present time irrigation, which is, of course, the only remedy, is regarded as an almost absolute necessity. A good many growers who happened to be favorably situated as to water supply, who were sufﬁciently informed as to what kind of irrigation they needed and had the means to pay for it, have put in irri-
gating plants which are working suc—
cessfully and which have made their owners independent of rainfall. But most of these plants have been in-
stalled at an expense which places them out of reach of the orange grower, one of my neighbors having just completed a plant which cost him over $10,000.00. It consists of one mile of six-inch wrought iron pipe,
enough smaller pipe to form a com-
plete network under his grove of about I20 acres, and a rotary pump driven by a ﬁfty-horse-power engine. The water is delivered through patent sprinklers which are placed in the centre between each four trees; he can run forty of these sprinklers at once,
thus watering forty trees at one time.
This kind of irrigation is all right for those who can afford it, but is be-
yond the reach of about ninety-nine per cent. of us, and for this reason it is not necessary for me to enter into a detailed description of it at this time.
What is needed is a system of irriga-
tion which can be installed at a cost within the reach of the average grower of limited means and yet of sufficient capacity to meet all of his require-
ments.
For the past eight years I have had charge of the property of Chase & Co.
at \Naco. This property consists of the famous Isleworth groves and nurs-
eries and, incidentally, an extensive ir-
rigating plant of about the same ca-
pacity in gallons of water as the one above mentioned and costing about one-eighth as much. I have visited and made myself familiar with the workings of irrigation plants of nearly every kind or system now being used in our part of the State, but for hand-
ling vast quantities of water 'at the least possible expense, which is, of-
course, what the grower of limited means wants to do, I have never seen anything to equal our plant.
A description of our pump and method of distributing the water over the grave will be found in the report of last year’s meeting, but for the beneﬁt of those who may not have been present at that meeting I will give a brief description here. The pump consists simply of a square box two feet in diameter inside and \about eigh-
teen feet high, or about six feet above the highest point in our grove. This box stands one end in the edge of the lake, where water should be two to three feet deep. Through the center of this box, from top to bottom, there is a steel shaft, with a water wheel on the bottom end; another one of the same kind in the middle and a pulley at the top for connecting with the en-
gine. This bottom wheel, by being revolved at a high rate of speed. lifts a column of water two feet square, up to the upper wheel, which catches it in the same way and carries it out at an opening near the top of the box,

and just below the belt and pulley. In case of a higher lift being required all that is necessary would be to increase the length of the box and shaft, put in another water wheel about seven or eight feet higher up, put on more power and go ahead. From the top of the pump the water is conducted across the middle of the grove through a ten-inch terra cotta pipe; thence from this ten—inch main to either side of the grove through a ﬁve-inch gal-
vanized-iron pipe of about the thick-
ness and weight of small stove pipe and connected up in the same way, but in sections ten feet long.
Our pump will supply about four of these lines of ﬁve-inch pipe at one time; sometimes in case we are short on piping we run one or more of these
ﬁve-inch openings in furrows. This running water in furrows in Florida sand has always been theoretically im-
possible, but we have proved beyond question, by actual experience, that it works very successfully indeed; and, in fact, I consider it one of the best, if not the very best, method now being used; and I would especially recom-
mend it to vegetable growers. We can ﬁll four or ﬁve furrows from each opening in our ten-inch main, and by using the furrow system exclusively we can have about twenty furrows 600
to 700 feet long running at one time.
This will give you some idea of the capacity of our pump, and also give you an idea how effective this system would be in irrigating vegetables. The imagination of the trucker could not possibly conceive a more pleasing pic-
ture than to go out some evening about sundown and ﬁnd twenty little rivers of cool, fresh water ﬂowing gently down between twenty rows of his withering vegetables.
I had, as the title of this paper sug-
gests, intended giving quite an exten-
sive collection of facts and ﬁgures as to cost of irrigation supplies of differ-
ent kinds, but as I believe this part of the subject will be more thoroughly and ably covered by Mr. Skinner, I will only give a few points along this line in connection with this particular system of irrigation.
The pump we are using is known as the Menge pump and is manufactured in New Orleans at a cost of about $150
at the factory. The terra cotta- piping of various sizes can be had at about the following prices, delivered to dif-
ferent parts of the state:
10-inch 25 cents per foot
8-inch 17 cents per foot
5-inch IO cents per foot
4-inch 8 cents per foot The ﬁve-inch galvanized pipe comes at about ten cents per foot, delivered.
For locations where lake water is available, and the lift not more than
ﬁfteen feet, there is nothing better nor cheaper than the Menge rotary pump.
For higher lift I would recommend a centrifugal pump, which will not only lift the water but also force it to any height up to about thirty-ﬁve feet.
The capacity and cost of these four-
teen pumps range about as follows:
A pump with a capacity of 100 gallons per minute will cost about $110; 450
gallons per minute, $210; 1,000 gal-
lons per min., $360; and others, large or smaller in proportion. A pump fur-
nishing 600 gallons per minute will cover one and three-tenths acres one inch deep in one hour, or 13 and one-
ﬁfth acres one inch deep in ten hours.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I received a letter from Prof. Rolfs asking me to give a little talk on irri-
gation. I am always ready to talk on irrigation, but I was not posted as to what special branch of irrigation I was expected to talk on, until I came into Gainesville. ‘
My experience has been entirely with what is called the sprinkling sys-
tem. \Vhen I ﬁrst had an idea of tak-
ing up irrigation, I felt that I had to take it up if I were going to grow or-
anges as a business and make a suc-
cess. Of course, the ﬁrst question that came into my mind was, where to get the water. There were only two ways: from a pond and from a well.
I spent a little time going to see the irrigating plants through the state,
and among them was one of Mr.
Adams of Thonotosassa. His struck me as being the best I saw. It con-
sisted of large pipes with small mains connected with them. running to dif-
ferent parts of the grove. From these laterals were standpipes to which the hose was attached. By using the hose he was able to get along without using so much iron pipe. To the hose were attached the McGowan sprinklers,
which he considered the best in all re-
spects. They throw a large amount of water and throw a very ﬁne spray with plenty of force all over between of water over an acre or, in other words, one inch of rainfall, will wet thoroughly six to eight inches of per-
fectly dry Florida sand.

the trees. It struck me as being the best and most successful system I had seen, and_he had a ﬁne crop of fruit from his grove.
At that time, iron pipe was beyond my reach, and I investigated the ad-
visability of using cement pipe. The best iron main will cost thirty-ﬁve and forty cents a foot for four-
inch pipe. I think a six-acre grove irrigating plant with steam pump and boiler, iron pipe, etc., will cost in the neighborhood of $1,000.00. I had plenty of muscle, time and some labor.
I investigated the cement pipe and made up my mind that it would do.
I bought a machine and a car of ce-
ment and went to work. \Ve turned out lots of pipe; I now have about 35.000
feet of that cement pipe. It has cost from three to six cents a foot; gen-
erally about four cents; but there is no time to stand around when you make it at even four cents. I think you can possibly make it at an average of ﬁve cents. .
You dig your ditch and put your machine right in it, and make the ce-
ment pipe as you go along. cleaning out your machine when stopping at noon or night and starting again. I tried to make a solid joint by pressing the cement together with my hands about the core of the machine, but found that it would not do. \IVhen I put on my
12

power, every joint burst and there was
‘ trouble right away. A gentleman who has made and uses this pipe told me that though the weak places in his ce-
ment pipe had broken, he had patched them until the pipe was all right. I began to ﬁnd that there were weak places and ﬁxed them up by this method. \Vhen I stopped making the-
pipe at any one joint, I set the ma-
chine down in the ditch farther along and went on, leaving that gap. After-
wards I put the machine on the ground and made some pipe for ﬁlling these gaps and sawed it into the proper lengths (you can pick up ﬁve or six or seven feet) and set it in the section.
Then I set the right length into the gap and wrapped some wire loosely around the joint; then took some ce-
ment well mixed and spread it around and in the wire completely. That joint will never break. Just wind some wire loosely around it and ﬁll it in with cement, spreading it quite liberally,
and it will answer every purpose. Any small wire will do; I generally use small, galvanized wire.
\Ve generally put in the hydrants the following morning after the ce-
ment pipe is made. Scrape the top of the cement away so as to give a new- surface. When you are running your irrigating plant and the hydrants break out, by using this wire plan,
winding wire around again and again loosely and ﬁlling it up with cement,
it will be tight and ready for use on the following day.
I ﬁnd this cement pipe very satis-
factory. I have tried the McGowan nozzle. It has a little small top that screws down to regulate the amount of water. Sometimes it is screwed down too tight and sometimes too loose and you are apt to have trouble if you don’t look after it pretty care-
fully. Cement pipe will stand a good deal of pressure, but not as much as iron pipe. You have all heard the story of the man down at the Tampa Bay Hotel, who had a big head on him the morning after a festive even-
ing. The manager took one of our
ﬁnest Florida grapefruit and ﬁxed it up with a little ice and sugar and a little French brandy and gave it to him. Pretty soon the man came down and asked for his bill and said, “I am going to New York to tell the boys,
‘Eureka, I have found it.’ ” The Cac-
tus sprinkler affected me very much the same way. \Vhen I saw it I felt like exclaiming, “Eureka, I have found it and must tell the boys." From a four-inch pipe I have seen it throw the water in a circle thirty-ﬁve feet in diameter, wetting it well in just a few minutes. It puts water on in the ﬁnest kind of spray. They are very simple and last a long time. There is only one that is any good for our irrigation,
and that is No. 10, one-inch size. It will put on lots of water and in ﬁne shape and at low pressure.
In the above system of iron pipe, the laterals are of two-inch pipe from a four-inch main. It waters about forty acres and costs about $3,000.00. To
ﬁx it up with cement pipe it would cost about one-third as much. The Chase
& Co. system at Lake Butler, where there is an ample supply of water, is the cheapest plan there is, but you must have unlimited water. If your water supply is unlimited. you can take terra cotta pipe and the Mean’s pump and throw a world of water on

the ground, but where you have a limited amount of water and the ground is not situated where you can make the water ﬂow, I think the ce-
ment system with Cactus sprayers is the best and cheapest system I have even seen.

DISCUSSION. .
Dr. Inman—How far under the sur-
face do you lay the cement pipe?
Mr. Skinner—Twelve inches.
Dr. Richardson—VVhat is the name of the sprinkler of which you speak?
Mr. Skinner—Cactus Lawn Sprin-
kler, No. IO. They are made by the Phrenger and Hanger Company and are for sale by the Baird Hardware Company, Gainesville, who are the state agents.
The most perfect system of irriga-
tion for vegetables that I have ever seen is at Sanford. It is a revelation.
Their system of irrigation with ar-
tesian wells is really marvelous.
Mr. Rose—I am not well acquainted with the Sanford system. As Mr.
Winters has described it. there are varieties of the same system. There are admirable systems where the tile is perfectly laid: where the irrigation where needed is perfect and drainage where wanted is perfect. The greatest trouble is that the ﬁelds frequently get more water than they want and their plants take diseases and die.
Mr. Skinner—The place I visited specially, had the tile so arranged that the gardener could draw the water off.
I was told by Mr. Chase and some of the ,men who lived there, that in former years water would stand all over the country, but now the drains are all open, and when the artesian wells are shut off by the gate valve,
the water ﬂows off in a few hours.
The men who had the best ﬁelds had level ﬁelds.
That system has gradually grown up by their needs and their wants, and it certainly has served their purpose. It certainly has proven a great success.
I do not believe I have seen so many new homes going up in Florida. Men who used to get two dollars and three dollars a day are now getting thou-
sands a year. easy.
“'e all agree that with plenty of fer-
tilizer, plenty of water when we want it, and a way provided to carry off water when we do not want it, there is no place on earth that will blossom like Florida.

Shipping and Growing of Vegetables.
v\
-_
By N. 0.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am called on at this meeting for a paper treating on the growing and ship-
ping of vegetables,—a large and an im-
portant subject, one that not only re-
quires, but deserves a great deal of thought; and unfortunately for me one that I am not as familiar with now as one should be when preparing a paper.
It is now several years since I have had any active experience with the veg-
etable business, and accordingly I shall only give you some of the conclusions arrived at at that time together with my observations since. '
I have no apologies to offer for know-
ing so little about this subject. I am sim-
ply here with this paper because I am called upon, and I feel that it is the duty of every citizen to respond when called upon to the best of his ability, and that is what I am now doing.
The demand of our markets is for strictly fancy produce as well as fruits and it is only by catering to this de-
mand that the grower is able to make money. Poor and inferior stuff seems to be a drug on the market at any price,
a thousand crates of fancy goods will sell before one of inferior grade.
Among the most successful practices seems to be that of irrigation and drain-
age. There does not seem to be any standard for water supply, some are us-
ing windmills, others artesian wells.
while still others are using gasoline en-
Penny.
gines and pumps. The locality and source of supply seem to be the deter-
mining features. As far as we can learn results are good from all, but probably the least efficient is the windmill, which I think is being gradually superseded by the gas engine, especially so where large quantities of water are required.
Drainage also appears to be one of the fundamental requirements. It appearing to intelligent growers that if we cannot depend on Dame Nature for water when we need it, neither can we depend upon her not to send us more than we need,
and growers ﬁnd that a ﬂood is as bad as a drouth.
Drainage is usually accomplished by means of open ditches and underdrains,
I believe that the most approved prac-
tice is in having the system so arranged that they can be used for both irriga-
tion and drainage at the will of the op-
erator. The grower can then protect himself in either a wet or a dry time.
More attention is being paid to inten-
sive culture, intelligent growers ﬁnd that one acre properly cared for will produce more than two indifferently cultivated,
and at the same time there will be a larger per cent, of that most important essential fancy quality.
A great deal of attention is also being paid to the use of fertilizers, and it is not uncommon for growers to use two and three thousand pounds per acre where but a few years ago it was only

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 183
customary to use that many hundreds of pounds. This is not becoming necessary
_ on account of any impoverished condition of the soil, but growers ﬁnd that it is a paying investment, one that pays very large dividends.
There also seems to be a tendency to specialization at certain points. I will cite Sanford for celery, Hastings for p0-
tatoes, etc. There are many advantages derived from this, and where it is possi-
ble for him to do so the grower will do well to take advantage of them. I will not undertake to enumerate all the ad-
vantages that may be derived from so doing, but will mention a few that occur to me at this particular moment. First we are sure of our land and the crops it will produce; we get the beneﬁt of car lot rates, direct line transportation, cash buyers, and lastly but not least we se-
cure the beneﬁt of all prestige and reputa-
tion this particular point has in the markets of our country. That this is a very valuable asset, is best illustrated in this way. It not only amounts to quick sales, but very often in an advance or higher price of at least 25c. on the crate over the same quality of unknown goods. All these things are a handicap to the grower who does not avail himself of these advantages, and quite frequently it amounts to all his proﬁts.
I do not mean to say that a grower or growers cannot build up a reputation for any particular point, or any particular product, but I do say, my friends, that it is uphill work, and a long pull; and if we can arrange to take advantage of a reputation already established it will more than pay to do so.
METHODS OF PACKING.
Growing a crop is scarcely half the battle. The successful grower provides a packing house of ample size, wherein to handle his crops with rapidity, he has also provided all the facilities that are essential for the handling of his crops.
He will provide the best of crates. He has also furnished himself with stencils for each and every mark that goes on a crate, and under no circumstances al-
lows a pencil to be used for any mark.
He has also provided each year printed wraps if his crops are such as can be wrapped, each wrap being printed with a fac-simile of the brand that is used on each crate. He will gather his crops at the proper time, see that they are very carefully handled to avoid all damage from bruising, etc. See that his crates are all neatly and securely nailed, and made in the best possible manner, the bet-
ter to withstand transportation, and that they may present a better appearance on the market. He will see that his produce is all properly cleaned, and washed if needed, that it is properly graded to a high standard, that it is carefully sized,
and well packed. All crates being uni-
form, only one grade and size in each crate, and that grade and size plainly and neatly stenciled on one end of each crate.
He also sees that each crate bears his own particular brand either stenciled or printed on one end, and that all stencil-
ing is done in a neat and systematic man-
ner, and presents a good appearance.
And when delivery is made to the trans-
portation company each crate is in a con-
dition that barring accidents or delays it will arrive on the market in prime con-
dition,
There is a tendency among the best growers, especially individual shippers to select one good ﬁrm in one or two cities

that can handle their goods to advan-
tage, and ship to them each year, year after year. It places their goods on sound business basis, and does not bring it into competition with itself. and in a short time they will often build up a trade that is enviable. No sensible grower will change his house without serious cause. He cannot afford to do it for in so doing he throws away all the pfestige and reputation he has been years in building up. He would in chang-
ing have to begin all over again with a new ﬁrm, and the new ﬁrm’s customers.
It is like going into a strange city. It requires a long time to become ac-
quainted with its people, and it is the same way in the produce markets,
GROWING AND SHIPPING CELERY AND PEPPERS.
By W. E.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The ﬁrst thing necessary is good land,
well drained and irrigated; subirrigation is the best. The next important thing is good seed which can be obtained from any good seedsman. The best varieties to grow are “Golden Self Blanching Cel-
ery,” and “Ruby King Peppers.” An-
other consideration is good fertilizer.
This can be obtained from any reliable fertilizer company. Be careful not to use fertilizer that runs high in ammonia,
as it will cause heart-rot in celery and black-rot in peppers. Fertilizer should run at least IO per cent. in potash and not over 3 per cent. in ammonia. Lands should be thoroughly cleared off, well plowed and harrowed thirty days before planting. Fertilizer should be applied broadcast and harrowed in both ways ten days before planting and land thor-
oughly irrigated. For celery one ton per acre should be applied before planting,
and one-half ton ﬁve weeks after plant-
ing by spreading in the middle of rows,
harrowing or plowing in, always plowing Robinson.
shallow after planting. For peppers. one-
half ton should be applied before plant-
ing, and one-fourth ton in four weeks after planting by drilling in middle of rows. One-fourth ton should be applied in eight weeks after planting for last application. Pepper will grow and con-
tinue to bear till frost comes or season closes for shipping. Seed beds are the most important of all in these crops. Celery should be sown about August 20th broad-
cast and not too thick on seed bed well prepared and raised eight inches above the level of the ground. Seed beds should be partially shaded—the best way is to cover with slats four feet above the seed bed slanting towards the south with cracks two inches wide. All shade should be removed after September the
20th. Seed beds should never get dry,
and should be watered twice a day for eight days after sowing and then kept wet. Plants should be sorted so all will run one size as near as possible and set in straight rows three feet wide and eight inches in drill, either single or double

rows, single rows are preferred; if double rows in drill, then rows should be four feet wide.
Peppers should be sown the same as cabbage or tomato seed, seed beds are prepared about the same as for other things. Any farmer can raise pepper plants. Peppers should be {planted in rows three and one—half feet wide and twenty inches in drill.
Celery and peppers should be sprayed with Bordeaux Mixture, celery every ten days, and pepper as often as black rot appears. Celery should be sprayed in seed beds from the time it comes up to the time of setting out. Celery should be well blanched with boards by standing the boards to the side of the row close to the celery as possible, and all cracks should be stopped to exclude the light.
It will take from ten to twenty days to blanch celery, and the boards should re-
main till celery is white. Twelve-inch boards are the best. Gather the celery by cutting around the root with a knife and leave a part of the roots on the cel-
ery, but be certain to keep the celery clear from dirt, especially do not get dirt in bud or plume. All dead leaves should be removed and it should be packed in large crates with roots all one way and as many stalks in crate as possible. Crates are always packed from the side. Be certain to use plenty of nails and ship by express or by refrigerator cars.
Peppers should not be packed till thoroughly matured when it looks slick and feels ﬁrm, it should be allowed to grow as long as it will before turning red and it should be packed in tomato carriers or in lettuce baskets, as you prefer. Al-
ways use the largest package for the same freight. Select your commission merchant before you get ready to ship and get in touch with him. All markets are about the same on celery and pepper,
supply and demand governing the price.

“Shall Rudimentary Agriculture and Kindred Sciences be Taught in the Common Schools?”
"9.
7' By Capt. R. E. Rose.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I ﬁnd myself on this occasion in rather a peculiar situation. On coming in last night and listening to what Dr. Sledd had to say in regard to the relation of the University to the Horticultural Society I found that he had, to a very large extent,
anticipated the remarks I expected to make this afternoon. It reminds me very much of an anecdote which has gone the rounds of the Florida political campaign for many years. Some years ago, a prom-
inent candidate for Governor and Con-
gressman Davis were canvassing the State for different political oﬂices. The rule was that the gentleman running for gov-
ernor should make the ﬁrst speech,
followed by Davis. At one point, the candidate for Governor was invited by a friend to stay all night with him; conse-
quently they were belated in going to the meeting the next morning. The local committee, not desiring to delay ‘ the speaking, asked Mr. Davis to address the audience. Davis had heard his friend speak so often that he got up and gave the candidate for Governor’s speech almost verbatim. \Vhen the other man came in and found that his speech had been taken thus unceremoniously from him, there was nothing else to do but be taken sud-
denly ill and not make any speech at all.
I could perhaps have overlooked one speech of this kind, but at the close of the meeting our worthy president had a paper largely along the line of common education in the public schools. That re-
minded me of the little boy when the min-
ister was taking dinner with his father and mother. The little fellow was very fond of chicken and chicken was scarce with them. His mother said, “Now,
Tommy, you must only take one piece of chicken.” Tommy said, “Well, but,
mamma, I want more than that.” She said, “I know, but there must be one piece left for manners.” It so happened that the minister took the last piece for his second or third helping and Tommy cried out, “Oh, mamma, there it goes;
manners and all 1”
That is the way I feel today. I am very glad to see that this session has deaIt very largely with the interests of educa-
tion, I am very glad to see that our col-
lege men, literary as well as scientiﬁc men are beginning to realize the fact that a slight understanding, at least, of the principles of a man’s calling, are abso-
lutely necessary to his success.
The question, Shall we teach rudimen-
tary science in the common schools?—
Physics, Chemistry, Biology and kindred sciences. relating to agriculture, and d0-
mestic science, better known as nature studies, is now occupying the attention of


## p. 187 (#729) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 187
many thinkers. The question is dis-
cussed from many points of view, by per-
sons of divers professions,-—the scientist,
the editor, the professors of our colleges,
both literary colleges, and scientiﬁc schools; the political economist. and the layman.
The fact that the discussion is univer-
sal among thinkers, shows its importance.
No one at this day will deny the value of education; no one would dare suggest the abolishment of the common schools.
The question is therefore, What is the purpose of public education? The reply would certainly be, to improve the man;
to make of him an active, useful member of society; to teach him the principles of the calling he is to pursue; to broaden his conception of the laws underlying his chosen profession; to give him the beneﬁt of knowledge accumulated from the ex-
perience of others, without the care, toil,
research and time necessary to be .given in the personal experimenting, and study of the subject, in gaining the information as to the facts, laws, and reasons underly-
ing the work he is to perform; inciden-
tally to improve his reasoning powers,
broaden _his mind, and develop his intel-
lect.
The common school has greatly broad-
ened its scope, in the last three decades,—
much useless matter has been eliminated,
and better methods adopted.
The science of teaching has been recog-
nized, teachers are trained. Pedagogy is now recognized as a science, and taught as such. To become a teacher one must study the science and art of teaching.
Most of us can remember when the teacher in the common schools, was gen-
erally an untrained workman, knowing little of the teacher’s profession, having more or less knowledge of the “Three R’s” and little if any capacity, or inclina-
tion, to impart what little he did know.
The demand for training, or education,
has grown wonderfully in the past thirty years—particularly for training along special lines. In all walks of life the spe-
cialist is now recognized,-—in law, medi-
cine, the sciences, teaching, agriculture,
chemistry, physics; in none is the special-
ist more evident than in the teacher’s profession.
Agriculture, “the oldest art, the young-
est science,” occupies by far the greater number of our people, while the trades,
and other productive occupations; man-
ufacture and transportation, the next larger part of the population of this and other countries. The proper ﬁtting, or training, of this vast majority of our cit-
izens, for their future occupations, be-
comes a question of the utmost import-
ance to the State.
In a recent address delivered in this city, by an eminent authority, Dr. An-
drew Sledd, President of the Florida University, he said:
“For some years the public schools of the United States have not been fully meeting their obligation to the general public. According to the census of 1900,
of the 29,000,000 persons over 10 years of age engaged in gainful occupations,
10,400,000 were following agricultural pursuits, or 35.7 per cent; 24.4 per cent.
were employed in manufacturing and kin-
dred labor, domestic and personal occu-
pations claimed 19.2 per cent., trade 16.4
per cent. and the professions only 4.3
per cent. In Florida the percentage of farmers is even greater, or 44 per cent.,
and of men engaged in the professions,
smaller, or 3.5 per cent.
“A public school system, established for the greater good of the greatest number,
would, if free from prejudice and from traditional inﬂuences, base its educational

policy along the line of bulks of popula-
tion. The curriculum would be made to prepare the major part of the youth for their life work, instead of those pre-
paring to follow some profession. Until
_recent times the major part has been ig-
nored.
“The present situation gives promise of what is to be, although the struggle with tradition is still going on. Modern ed-
ucation is for the masses. Practical edu-
cation is coming to the front. The cul-
tural and humanizing subjects are not to be ignored, yet the practical should as-
sert its rights.
“Washington, in his ﬁrst message to congress, advocated the fostering of ag-
riculture. The ﬁrst organization of farmers in the United States was founded in 1785 at Philadelphia: Of this society
\Vashington and Benjamin Franklin were members. Among the committees appointed was one to promote agricul-
tural education. This committee advo-
cated the founding of professorships of agriculture in the colleges already estab—
lished, and the giving of courses of agri-
culture in the high schools. The ﬁrst professorship of agriculture was estab-
lished at Columbia in 1792. The ﬁrst State Agricultural College was founded in Michigan in 1855; although private schools, some of college rank, were in existence before this date, and a few of these had State aid.
“The Federal government early mani-
fested its interest, the ﬁrst action being taken even in the time of Washington.
In comparatively recent times this interest in the practical education,-—in the educa-
tion for agriculture and the mechanical arts—has grown greatlv. Various acts have passed and several are now pending in congress for the fostering of educa-
tion in agriculture and the mechanical arts.
“In these acts the Federal government seeks solely to promote instruction in ag-
ricultural and mechanical arts. It be-
lieves that the masses need instruction where their work lies. There are several acts still pending.
“In its aid the Federal government seeks to throw emphasis where it is most needed to help the masses, to enable the man who toils in the sweat of his brow to do his work more efﬁciently. It seeks to uplift the mass of working people. Schools founded for this purpose should keep it in mind; they should strive to serve most of the people in the best way.”
“I have taken the liberty to quote Dr.
Sledd liberally, his position as an educa-
tor; his knowledge of the subject, gives his opinion an'.’l statement, weight ani authority.
“I desire to call your attention, however,
to the fact that the effort to teach agri-
culure, and its kindred sciences, has been to establish colleges, and schools of higher learning,—-a very necessary course per-
haps in the early days; when trained agri‘
culturists and scientists were few. when the science of agricultre was drabtically unknown; when text-books on th . subject were few, and not adapted to the school~
room; in fact only of value to the trained scientist, and so cumbered with scientiﬁc terms, that the ordinary teacher. to say nothing of the school children, failed to grasp their meaning or understand their truths, which were, frequently. simply as-
sumptions, and not yet demonstrated facts,-—There were doubtless reasons for beginning the structure at the roof and building down to the foundation. As Secretary of Agriculture Wilson has apt‘ y said, “Place a faculty of agricultural pro-
fessors in the top story of a building with-
out a stairway. and say to the boys and girls of the country, jump up here and we will teach you scientiﬁc agriculture."

When we remember that of the manv millions of school children, only one per cent. or less, graduate from the high school, (of which 80 per cent are fe-
males), that by far the greatest number never enter the high school, but have to begin their life work, with_but a few years (or months) training in the com-
mon schools, we realize how few of our boys and girls destined to be the farmers,
and farmers’ wives, of the country, ever receive in school any practical or scientiﬁc knowledge of the subject which will be the principal, if not the only, pursuit of their lives.
I will not indulge in the usual plati-
tudes, “The farm the basis of wealth, the mudsill or foundation of the nation's prosperity.” The object of my talk is to stimulate a demand for teaching those things that will be of the most value, to the greatest number of the future men and women of the country, that will ele—
vate their conception of the dignity of their profession, and stimulate them to excel in its pursuit.
Ninety per cent. of our boys and girls,
particularly in the rural districts, “quit school” before reaching what is known as the seventh grade of the common schools; very few enter the high schools,
and still fewer graduate therefrom.
By far the larger part of our people begin their life’s work without ﬁnishing the course in the common schools, with a smattering of “Reading, Riting, and Rithmetic,” with no effort made to teach them any of the facts, or laws, underly-
ing the profession they are to pursue.
It would be folly for me to decry the value of the necessary preliminary stud-
ies, arithmetic, spelling, reading and writing, and such fundamental branches.
I do contend, however, that the rudi-
mentary principles of Physics, Biology,
and other natural sciences, “nature studies,” should be substituted for the ordinary “reader,”—with its fables and glittering generalities, elocutionary gym-
nastics, and singsong poetry. Our read-
ing exercises could be made useful and entertaining, and impart knowledge at the same time, language equally as pure taught, and correct ideas as to natural science imparted at the same time.
Equally as interesting stories, inculcat-
ing facts, can be substituted for the fables.
and stories, of the present reading les-
son.
Many of the text-books on agriculture.
—now abundant,—are interesting to a degree to the youthful mind,—always hungry for information. That child once taught the ﬁrst law of physics, ex-
pressed in simple language,——that “force and reaction are the same and in opposite directions,” will not in future life spend years in the futile effort to create perpet-
ual motion,
That child taught a few lessons in Physiology, or animal ,structure, will never be guilty of removing an animal’s inner eyelids to cure the “hooks,” nor bore a cow’s horn for “hollow horn.”
When taught a few of the fundamental laws of Agricultural chemistry, he will not buy a ton of “guano” because it is cheaper than another ton; nor will he be persuaded to buy fertilizer, or feeds, on account of a name, or brand. and pay more for an inferior material with a catchy name.
No lesson is more quickly absorbed.
nor more easily taken in, by the average child than Physical geography, simply because it deals in facts, as to produc-
tions, and conditions of various countries.

toms.

deﬁnition of a continent, peninsula, is-
land, or isthmus is, he knows however,
that oranges and alligators are found in Florida, that “Uncle Sam” is cutting a big ditch at Panama; that monkeys, cof_
fee, jaguars and India rubber come from South America.
We do not appreciate the capacity of our children for facts,—-they care little for the reasons, but want facts,—these should be given as fully as, possible.
Rules mean but little to children, facts much.
How many of you remember the old
“Murray’s Grammar?” with its pages of rules,—which we “learned by heart” and did not understand, (and don’t yet). The old “Davies” or “Todd’s” arithmetic,
with its rules and terms,—all Greek to us then, and to most of us now.
\Ve did know (when the teacher, or our parents told us) that certain con-
struction of sentences, or certain words were not correct. We learned good lan-
guage from hearing it spoken.
We now teach grammar and arithme-
tic almost unconsciously, by absorption we might say.
The same may be said of science, or
“applied common sense,”—the facts which experience, and experiment have proved to be facts, governed by natural laws.
How many of us members of the Hor-
ticultural Society, would have avoided serious mistakes, expensive in time and money, had we as children been taught a few facts, as to the composition and use of fertilizers,-—why they were neces-
sary, and for what purpose applied; the functions of nitrogen, phosphates, and potash, in the plant economy?
How many of us have had to learn by experience, more or less expensive, the facts well known to the scientist of the day? though forty years ago he knew little more than the average pupil of the common school does now.
There is little chance to teach agricul-
tural science, (and art), to the adult farmer; barring the Farmers' Institute,
there is no efﬁcient method of reaching him. However, teach these facts to the children, furnish them with authentic and trustworthy text-books, and very soon the parent will himself absorb a very considerable part of the sciences.
It has been said, “The education of the child should begin in the cradle,” no greater truth was ever spoken.
“The child is father to the man,” and on his early training depends the future citizenship of the country,—while teach-
ing the child,—-the common school pupil,
—the rudimentary truths, facts and laws,
of science,——“nature study,”—by simple statements of facts, with little discussion,
rules, or reasons,—put before him in an interesting manner in the shape of nar-
ratives or stories, illustrating the subject;
together with simple experiments and il-
lustrations, we unconsciously, but none the less certainly, teach the parent many truths, and broaden his conception of his calling. For rest assured, that whatever deeply interests the child at school, is discussed at home,—c0mmented on and digested to a degree, not generally under-
stood nor allowed for.
Why have our children’s imaginations excited, their faith in the wisdom or truthfulness of their teacher,—and text-
books lessened, by such tales as the “Ad-
ventures of Sinbad the Sailor,” “Gul-
liver’s Travels,” “Don Quixote,”-—inter-
esting and exciting to the imaginative.
and credulous mind of the child—and other equally useless, in fact, injurious matter; used in the schoolroom? When equally choice and interesting reading

matter, describing wonderful occurrenceg beautiful processes, and surprising re-
sults,—all inculcating truths, that will be of value in succeeding years, can be given them; equally as interesting and ex-
citing to their imaginations, making last-
ing impressions on their plastic minds.
Truths told in simple language, free from scientiﬁc jargon, comprehensible to the youthful mind, or to the ordinary adult,
who has had no scientiﬁc training, of which the mass of our people are com-
posed.
Among scientiﬁc literature, written in plain, simple language, that should be found in every schoolroom, and read by every teacher, or pupil of our common schools, is the little monthlv publication of our State Board of Health, called Health Notes. It deals with common things, common diseases, their cause and effects in such simple, though forceful language, as can be readily understood by any one, child or adult, who can read.
As a pattern for a child’s or adult’s pri-
mary, scientiﬁc, text-book, it is com-
mendable, and should be found in every household in the State.
I am pleased to say that this subject is now attracting the attention of school ofﬁcers and educators everywhere.
I note our next summer schools for teachers, will have the beneﬁt of twelve lectures on agricultural subjects, by such men as, Dr. Sledd, Prof. Rolfs, Prof.
Floyd and Prof. Fawcett, of the Univer-
sity of Florida, and the Florida Experi-
fnent Station. Lectures that will doubt-
less go far towards instructing the teach-
ers of the State, as to the importance of acquiring a knowledge of the rudimentary principles of agriculture, that they may be better ﬁtted to successfully prepare the children of the State for a broader view and more comprehensive knowledge of their future callings ; that they may be able to dignify the farmer’s profession,
by teaching that it is truly a science, as well as an art, requiring more knowledge of all the sciences, than does that of any of the learned professions, to master its details, and successfully practice it.
I believe the place to begin the teaching of agriculture is in the common school,
just where we begin the teaching of liter-
ature, and the science of numbers and language. That the farm, the school,
the experiment station, and agricultural college, should be linked together, and properly co-ordinated: that we should be-
gin at the foundation,—the child,—and build upward toward the complete ediﬁce,
the college, and not from the college downward.

Roselle.
l Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Of the smaller fruits that have been introduced into the State for a compar-
tively long time, none, with its seeming commercial possibilities, have been more neglected than roselle (Hibiscus sab-
dariffa), also known under the name of Jamaica sorrel. Even as a household plant, it is not, considering the ease with which it is cultivated, grown as widely as it deserves. At the Subtropical Lab-
oratory we have paid particular attention to the cultivation of this plant for nearly four years, and on receiving an invita-
tion from the President of the Society to deliver an address at this meeting, I se-
lected this as a timely subject, so much the more as during the existence of the Society only once, in 1899, if I am rightly informed, has the attention of the mem-
bers been called to the roselle. This pa-
per is Farmers’ Bulletin No. 307 con-
densed, where the subject is more fully treated, with such additional data as have been obtained since that bulletin was written,
As those of you who are acquainted with roselle know, the plant is an an-
nual and resembles somewhat the cotton plant in habit, attaining a height of from
ﬁve to seven feet, with about a like spread, under favorable conditions. Its large, red-eyed yellow ﬂowers indicate its relationship to the okra, the various species of ornamental hibiscus and the By P. J.

cotton plant. It is indigenous to the Old
_World tropics, but is now probably dis-
seminated to all the tropical and subtrop-
ical countries. Some twenty or more years ago-the roselle was introduced into Florida, the name Jamaica sorrel being probably an indication that the plant was introduced from Jamaica.
Keeping in mind that lands subjected to ﬂooding and insufﬁciently drained lands should be avoided, as well as lands infested with the rootknot nematode
(Heterodera radic‘icola) to which the plant is very much subject, the roselle seems to thrive on any of our Florida soils that are moderately rich or sup-
plied with the necessary plant food in the form of commercial fertilizer. If sta-
ble manure is used it should be supple-
mented with phosphates and fertilizers that contain potash, as an excess of am-
monia in the soil tends to the develop-
ment of large plants at the expense of their productiveness.
The plants may be started in a seed-
bed in the spring and planted out in the
ﬁeld similarly to tomatoes, or the seeds may be planted in the hills where they are to remain and thinned out to one plant to a hill. The rows should be from six to ten feet apart and the plants set out four to eight feet apart in the row according to the fertility of the land and the supply of moisture. In our experience a mixture similar to tomato

fertilizer has been found to be very sat-
isfactory, applied at the rate of 1,000 to
2,000 pounds per acre. \Nhere a few plants are set out for home use most fertilizers that are available would probably serve the purpose.
The greatest drain on the vitality of the plant is the ripening of the seed and if the calyces are picked as soon as they are full grown instead of allowing them to become more mature, the plant, in the effort to reproduce itself, sends out new
ﬂower-buds that set fruit continuously until cut down by frost if it is not injured by diseases or insect enemies.
In a report from the Porto Rico Ex-
periment Station, 1906, the yield per plant is given as four pounds of fruit while some plants were estimated to yield double that amount. At the Sub—
tropical Laboratory during the past few years we have been engaged in the breed-
ing of a variety having larger calyces than the common kind and during the last fall and winter weighed the fruit from eight plants of this variety to as-
certain the average yield. The data ob-
tained, which are given in the following table, are quite interesting.
Nos, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent one plant each and No. 6 represents calyces from three plants weighed together. The yield from No. I was so markedly larger than from the rest of the plants that it was thought desirable to save the seed for breeding purposes, which ex—
plains the omissions in yield from Jan-
uary 6 to February 8, 1908, at which latter date part of the ripe calyces were saved and the remainder February 18.
January 25 the calyces of all the plants except No. I (which was tented) were picked for fear that the plants might freeze down in an approaching cold wave.
Subsequently all the plants in this exper-
iment died from the attack of rootknot nematodes, except No. I, which was pruned back, has continued to bloom and is still in active growth and setting fruit.

Porto Rico as compared with that ob-
tained by the Subtropical Laboratory,
due partly to continued breeding and se—
lection, and probably in part to more fa-
vorable conditions and perhaps to better cultivation.
In Florida the plant has thus far been grown for home use only and the caly-
ces used in making a sauce similar to that made of the cranberry, or in jelly making. Besides the two products already mentioned, the roselle yields a most ex-
cellent fruit syrup that can be used in the home in various ways. It can also be used as a ﬂavoring extract at soda foun-
tains.
When the calyces are used as a sauce the seedpods must of course necessarily be removed but last fall we found that this is not necessary in the making of jelly. In the manufacture of jelly on a commercial scale this is an important con-
sideration, as the removal of the seed-
pod is at present a slow and tedious pro-
cess.
Several years ago Mr. W. W. Tracy of the Bureau of Plant Industry, made jelly of the tender twigs and branches,
but did not follow up his discovery to ascertain its commercial possibilities.
Acting on this suggestion, during the past year the writer experimented with extracting the acid from the whole plant by boiling both the young stems and the leaves. The jelly obtained in this way was perhaps a little more difficult to make than that made from the calyces,
but it is possible that some mistake in making it was the cause of this, for I understand that Mrs. P, H. Rolfs has made jelly from the stems and leaves that she considered fully equal to that made from the calyces of the plant. An excel-
lent fruit syrup is also obtained from the same source that may be used in the household or used as a ﬂavoring extract in soda water fountains. Utilized in this way the plant can be grown in a large territory of the United States and the ease with which the plant is cultivated probably renders it a cheaper source for
ﬂavoring extract than any other plant.
The only disease that has so far been observed on roselle is a mildew that at-
tacks all parts of the plant above ground and if the disease appears early it is apt to do considerable damage if it is allowed to spread unchecked. An experiment to ascertain the comparative value of dry sulphur, sulphuric acid diluted one part to 500, 1,000 and 2,000 parts of water,
respectively, and liver of sulphur as a remedy for the disease was made last fall at the Subtropical Laboratory.
Their comparative values as fungicides were found to be as in the order named.
The sulphur should be applied early in the morning while the plants are still wet with dew, -
In addition to the soft scale (Coccus hes/Jeridum) another scale was noted on roselle last fall. Specimens were sent to Dr. L. O. Howard, Chief of the Bu-
reau of Entomology, United States De-
partment of Agriculture, who identiﬁed them as Hemichionaspis aspidistrae. It appears, however, to do very little dam-
age as, while multiplying itself rapidly,
the scale is followed by a parasite (Aspi-
diotiphagus cit-rinus) that seems to keep it well in check.
In Queensland the cultivation of the roselle has_assumed a commercial aspect during the past few years and consider-
able quantities of roselle jam are yearly exported to Europe. In the Unitel States, aside from the home use as a sauce, the .most popular products would

probably be jelly, a fruit syrup for the table use, or diluted with water as a cool-
ing drink and as a ﬂavoring extract for cool drink stands. The writer ventures to express the opinion that when the man-
ufactured products of roselle become known to the public the roselle will fur-
nish the basis for a considerable indus-
try along these lines in the United States at no distant date, in which Florida, due to her geographical position, should have a large share.

Efforts to Secure Better Shipping Facilities and Rates.
By F. D. Warner.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
For as far back as most of us can remember we have been complaining of high freight rates on our fruit and vegetables, but it is only within the past year that any concentrated effort on our part has been taken to remedy the evil. Many cases of individual ef-
forts have been made, but to no avail.
But today we have a strong organiza-
tion to ﬁght for our rights, and if we can have the co-operation of all ship-
pers we can accomplish much, we be-
lieve.
As most of you will recall, the Gainesville Melon Growers’ Associa-
tion called a meeting in Jacksonville in February, 1907, for the purpose of securing a car-lot rate on our fruits and vegetables to the eastern markets and to form an association for that purpose. At that meeting there were some sixty members who joined and now we number over ﬁve hundred,
with only one resignation during the year.
Shortly after this meeting we had a conference with the representatives of the various railways leading out of the state, at the oﬂice of our secretary, J.
C. Chase, Jacksonville, at which time they promised to take the matter up and give us some relief, but failed to do so; but instead asked us to meet them in \Vashington on November
6th, which we did, our attorney also being present at this conference. \Ve made them a compromise proposition,
as follows: 5 cents reduction on stan-
dard crates and 10 cents on bbls. 0r-
anges and pineapples, with a refrigera-
tion of 15 cents a package instead of
20 cents, with a minimum of 20,000
pounds to all eastern points. This they refused, but came back to us with a proposition granting about one-half of our compromise; which we in turn refused and took the matter before the Inter-State Commission in its original form, which amounts to much more than we were willing to compromise for. The ﬁrst hearing before the Com-
mission was held at Washington on February 4th, at which time we had eight witnesses from Florida and sev-
eral from the commission merchants at the north. This meeting. as you know, was adjourned to Jacksonville on March 18th for the want of time,
and as you all know we had a large representation. The ﬁnal hearing takes place tomorrow at \Vashington,
and we can look for some decision some time in June.
There was a called meeting at Lake-
land on April 21st, which meeting

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 197
took the place of the annual meeting which should have been held in Feb—
ruary. At this meeting the old ofﬁcers were re-elected and several added to the board of directors. The matter of adopting a standard size box for both the celery and orange was gone into to considerable extent, but no action was taken to make the Florida orange box to conform to the California size,
i. e., 11%x11y2x26.
The matter was laid over until the next meeting, which will be held in Jacksonville some time in July, when we will have heard from the Commis-
sion. F "I It was decided at Lakeland to con-
tinue the Association and to take up the many matters which we are dis-
criminated against both by express and freight. Some of our best markets are south of the Ohio and Potomac rivers and yet the rate is often higher than points beyond.
There is no salaried office in this As-
sociation and the ofﬁcers have been faithful and loyal to the cause and have sacriﬁced much time and money, and we want the help of every person who ships a package of fruits or vegetables.
We would also like to have the en-
dorsement of this Society in good,
strong terms.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Warner—This report is simply to show what has been done to secure better rates, especially car-lot rates for eastern points, than we now have.
They have given us a promise that they will make a decision before they adjourn about the ﬁrst of July. We would also like to have the endorse-
ment of the Society. The railroads have tried to belittle our efforts, but we contend that we represent about seventy-ﬁve per cent. of all fruits and vegetables shipped. If all you people will come with us and stick to us and all of us hold together, we can get pretty nearly what we ask for, which,
of course, is only our rights. I believe I have given you an outline of what has been done. We have here a copy of our attorney's brief, but the testi-
'mony in our case amounts to volumes and volumes. I will be glad to answer any questions that any of you care to ask.
Mr. Have your efforts been con-
ﬁned to oranges and pineapples?
Mr. \Varner—No, sir; we have been working for better rates on everything that is raised in the state.
Mr. Frink—I would like to ask Mr.
\Varner if the object of this Fruit Growers’ Association is to make aper-
manent organization of it and continue the ﬁght for better rates and better facilities of all classes of fruit and veg-
etables. not only now but in the future.
Mr. VVarner—Yes. sir; that is the object of this Association, and in the meeting at Lakeland it was moved that the Association be continued. The
ﬁnal hearing that comes up tomorrow is for a carload rate to the East, which we do not now enjoy. we want to enjoy the same blanket rate that Cali—
fornia has now on oranges, both East and \Nest.
Mr. Frink—I am in favor of Mr.
Warner's work, and think the mem-
bers will all be in favor of it if they understand it. It is a great work and needs to be looked into more carefully in the future than it has been in the past.

I” FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. Hart—It has a membership of about ﬁve hundred, hasn’t it?
Mr. \Narner—Yes, sir.
Mr. Hart—\Vhy didn’t they call on us?
Mr. \Varner—They did. \Ve have written letter after letter, and asked everybody to help us that we possibly could. But we have not had funds enough to foot the bills, and have had to go down in our pockets, because we thought we were doing the right thing.
Mr. Skinner—The penalty of being a Director is about $500.00.,
Mr. \Varner—We have hired the best attorneys we could hire. We have hired attorneys to get up briefs and have had all kinds of expenses to con-
tend with and nothing to meet them with, unless we paid them ourselves.
The next meeting will be held in Jack-
sonville some time in July.
Mr. I would like to ask if any re-
duction was asked for anything less than carload lots.
Mr. \Narner—No, sir. \Ve thought we had a ﬁght big enough for us to handle when we asked for a reduction on carload lots. There is a great deal of shipping done in less than car lots.
They made a proposition to us say-
ing that they would give us a carload rate provided we would accept their terms on less than carload lots. We refused to do this. However, the ﬁght was taken up originally to get a car-
load rate on fruits and vegetables.
Mr. Skinner—The Clyde Steamship Line pays the Atlantic Coast Line Company ten cents for every package they deliver to them at Jacksonville,
as a sort of compromise for not carry‘
ing it to Savannah and delivering it to the Ocean Steamship Line. The rate

to Jacksonville is from 17 cents to 20
cents on‘ oranges. The rate to New York is 35 cents, 10 cents of that goes to the A. C. L. we contend, and I think we are supported in our belief,
that they are transgressing the law,
and that they should carry it to New York for 25 cents. The grower should have the benﬁt of the 10 cents that is paid to the A. C. L.
Mr. Warner—In other words, the Clyde Line pays the Coast Line 10
cents for not hauling it to Savannah.
Now, gentlemen, if we will join to-
gether and stick together, there is no doubt but that we can get our just de-
serts and I think it is the duty of every one of us to uphold this Association in its ﬁght.
Mr. Skinner—It means about $200,-
000 to the state if we win out. This is worth ﬁghting for.
Prof. Rolfs—I think we ought to hold up the hands of the Association,
like holding up Aaron’s hands of old.
I understood, Mr. Skinner. that a com-
mittee was appointed this morning to prepare resolutions of some kind com-
mendatory of the work this organiza-
tion has been doing. If you have them ready. we would be glad to act upon them at this time.
Mr. Skinner—“\Vhereas, The fruit and vegetable shippers of Florida have for years been discriminated against by the railroads and have been obliged to pay a much higher rate of freight than our competitors for a less haul:
therefore be it

Orange and Grape Fruit Statistics.
By P. Phillips, M.D.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Enclosed please ﬁnd letters from the different railroad companies, in the state of Florida, with the exception of the East Coast Railroad, which I explain here below.
The crop for the year of 1906-07,
three million seven hundred seventy-
six thousand naught eighteen (3,766,-
018). I estimated the crop for the year of 1907-08 to be sixty per cent.
of the above amount. This will make it 2,265,610. I will gladly get up the statistics again from the different rail-
road companies of Florida, the num-
ber of boxes shipped the past season and compare it with my estimate, pro-
vided the Society desires me to do so.
The East Coast Railway Company,
I estimated, had ﬁve hundred thousand boxes, and after correspondence with them, I found that my estimate was not far wrong. I, therefore, think I have it as near as possible to the cor-
rect amount that was shipped out of the state during the year of 1906-07.
Hoping the State Horticultural So-
ciety will continue to prosper, and with you—its president—I know they will succeed, I beg to remain,

Nursery Inspection From the Inspector’s Side.
By E. W. Berger.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The essential parts of this paper were written nearly a year ago, and were then intended to be a contribu-
tion toward supplementing Nursery Inspection (1) and (2), published by Prof. H. A. Gossard as Press Bulletins Nos. 6 and 7 of the Florida Agricul-
tural Experiment Station, and repub-
lished in the Florida Agriculturist for June 19 and 26, 1907, pp. 5 and 7, re-
spectively. The purpose of the paper was to set forth more fully the prac-
tices of inspectors as understood by the writer, based upon his own experi-
ence, and the experience of other in-
spectors obtained verbally and from their writings. The writer realizes that, considered from the standpoint of the ideal, the inspection of nurseries,
as practiced in the United States, is frequently open to criticism; but the subject has been treated here as modi-
ﬁed by the conditions which exist,
rather than from an ideal point of view. In other words, we have to deal with a practical question and not a theory.
THE RIGHTS OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES.
These naturally come under three heads: those of the buyer, the nursery-
man, and the inspector.
THE BUYER—The buyer, or grower,
is perhaps the most vitally interested of all, and generally has the least to say in regard to the inspection of the goods he desires to buy. That the buyer might have much to say will be brought out later. The buyer has the right to be protected; but at its very best, a certiﬁcate from an inspector cannot be a perfect guarantee of free-
dom from insects and diseases; a fact noted in Nursery Inspection (2), and generally recognized by experienced inspectors. The point is, that it is physically impossible to examine every tree in a nursery, to say nothing of examining all parts of a tree. Never-
theless, a certiﬁcate signiﬁes much.
After the inspector has examined, say,
the four sides of a large block of stock and has passed through it in several directions, carefully scrutinizing ab-
normal appearances as well as making a close inspection of an occasional tree,
he feels reasonably certain whether the block is clean or not. Besid'es signifying that a diligent search has been made, a certiﬁcate implies that moral obligations have been assumed by the nurseryman. It thus becomes especially obligatory upon him to send out nothing but clean stock. Then there is a further deterring inﬂuence,
namely the fear of exposure and for-
feiture of the certiﬁcate if he sends out infested or diseased stock.
In view of the fact that a certiﬁcate cannot be an absolute guarantee, it has been suggested that a written guaran-


## p. 202 (#744) ############################################

202 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
tee from the nurseryman should be substituted for a certiﬁcate. But why should a written guarantee from the nurseryman not be required to accom-
pany the inspector’s certiﬁcate? Every buyer has the power to demand such a guarantee. Again, it has been sug-
gested, that fumigation should be sub-
stituted for a certiﬁcate, or that a cer-
tiﬁcate of fumigation from the nurs-
eryman should be required to accom-
pany each shipment of certiﬁed stock.
The requirement of a certiﬁcate of fumigation from the nurseryman, to-
gether with an inspector’s certiﬁcate,
is the law in Georgia and some other states. Again, defoliation together with the cutting back of the tender growth should be required in all ship-
ments, and several nurserymen now make this practice. In fact, one should practice not only defoliation and cut-
ting back, but fumigation as well.
There remains only the addition of the written guarantee, and I hope soon to see some nurserymen take this for-
ward step. A nurseryman could give a guarantee which the inspector can-
not give, because every tree sold ought to come under his or some competent person’s scrutiny at the time of digging and packing.
It has been objected that fumiga-
tion, defoliation, and cutting back are injurious to trees. In regard to de-
foliation, the preponderance of evi-
dence, so far as the writer can judge,
indicates' that, at least under certain climatic conditions, it is not injurious;
and some even state instances where defoliated trees started off better than others not defoliated. Should fumiga-
tion cause the death of some trees and retard the growth of others—a doubt-
ful contingency—yet the loss of a few trees should not be deprecated when it may involve the saving of a whole grove from becoming overrun by in-
sects. It is the writer’s opinion that defoliation, together with cutting back and fumigation, should be practiced by all nurserymen, in fact insisted upon by the buyer, whether any n0xious in-
sects are suspected to be upon the stock or not; for there are other pests,
such as rust mite, red spider, orange weevil, and perhaps still others, living on the leaves and roots [the grubs of the orange weevil live on the roots],
which would probably be completely eradicated by this means.
No stock should be shipped partially exposed [leafy tops left uncovered],
but it should be so covered and wrap-
ped as to make it secure against be-
coming infested in transit. We need only to bear in mind the possibility that a package of citrus trees may come in contact, either in the express car or at the railway station, with a crate 0f scale-infested citrus fruit, or a package of peach, plum, or other similar trees, or with some San Jose scale-infested fruit; when the in-
festation may spread to the previously clean stock, if it was not completely and properly covered. All these re-
quirements, I believe, are quite within the reach of the buyer, and need simply to be insisted upon when he contracts for his trees.
Further. in regard to a written guarantee from the nurseryman, it will be evident that the nurseryman could not give a guarantee of freedom from insects and diseases extending ahead over any long period of time. The best form of written guarantee would pro-


## p. 203 (#745) ############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 203
bably be one to the effect that the stock was guaranteed to be free from all living insects (mites included),
insect larvae, insect eggs, or other dis-
eases, at the time of its delivery. If newly-set stock is found to be free from infestation when it has matured a new crop of foliage, this would be fairly clear evidence that it was clean when received. If infestation with in-
sects, or infection with disease, was discovered by the time a new crop of foliage had matured, expert evidence
[inspection of the neighboring prem-
ises, and of the nursery from which the stock was obtained] would have to decide the case. Such a guarantee would also be in the nature of a chal-
lenge to the buyer or grower to ﬁnd insects and disease if he could; and no nurseryman would make such a challenge if the stock he shipped was not clean.
In conclusion. the writer believes that the grower can best protect him-
self by making the following require-
ments the conditions of buying a nurs-
eryman’s stock:
I. A written guarantee that the stock is free from noxious insects and diseases at the time of its delivery.
2. A written guarantee that the contents of each package have been properly fumigated prior to shipment
[ornamentals and other stock which would be killed by fumigation alone not to be fumigated, or fumigated with a smaller dose].
3. The complete defoliation and cutting back of- all stock (especially citrus‘) prior to shipment [ornamentals and other stock which would be killed by such treatment alone excepted].
4. Complete protection of the stock from outside contamination through insects and diseases during transporta-
tion, by a properly constructed box or other covering.
The writer also desires to direct the growers’ attention to the following law:
Ch. 4814, Acts 1899, Sects. I and 2.
3701. The Sale or giving away of Diseased Nursery Stock or Seeds'.—It shall be unlawful for any person to
.knowingly sell or give away any dis-
eased nursery stock or seeds in the State of Florida. Any person violat-
ing this section shall 'be ﬁned not more than ﬁve hundred dollars or impris-
oned not more than six months—Gen.
Statutes of the State of Florida, 1906.
From the foregoing it will be seen that the grower has these matters wholly under his control, and all that is necessary is for him to take advan-
tage of his rights.
THE NURSERYMAN.—That the nurs-
eryman also has some rights must be conceded. When nursery inspection has become deﬁnitely established un-
der well-deﬁned laws and regulations within a State; and when a larger num-
ber of nurserymen have learned to realize that a knowledge of insect pests and plant diseases is quite as im-
portant to their business as the ability to grow plants; and when by the bringing of gradually increasing press-
ure by inspectors from year to year,
greater vigilance will be exercised and thoroughly up-to-date methods be em-
ployed in all nurseries: we may assume it proper to refuse a nurseryman a certiﬁcate in whose stock but one spe-
cimen even of a species of noxious in-
sect is found. But where, as in Flor-

ida, nursery inspection has not become systematized; and where, furthermore,
citrus nursery stock has not before been certiﬁed [the writer did this for the ﬁrst time last fall, when several states and foreign countries required citrus stock to be admitted under cer-
tiﬁcate only] ; it appears no more than fair that conditions of fumigation, de-
foliation, etc., should sometimes be re-
quired in giving a certiﬁcate in lieu of absolute freedom from insects. I admit that to the buyer one insect is as bad as a thousand, and the case merits careful thought and considera-
tion. But the nurseryman having spent thousands of dollars to grow his trees,
feels that to be refused a certiﬁcate means bankruptcy. The grower hardly desires to see the nurseryman bank-
rupted, neither does he wish to see his own property jeopardized. In such an instance the inspector almost invaria-
bly steps into the breach, so to speak.
His knowledge of a certain pest, for instance, convinces him that the stock ‘
should be absolutely safe when cut back, defoliated and fumigated. He requires this as a condition of giving the certiﬁcate. The nurseryman as-
sumes the moral obligation of good faith and the other conditions previ-
ously referred to, and the case is gen-
erally settled; unless the nurseryman,
to his discredit and to the detriment of the inspector, breaks faith. Besides the above stipulations the inspector may require the destruction of all in—
fested trees, and the exclusion of cer-
tain blocks of stock from the market;
or the entire nursery may be placed under quarantine pending a period of cleaning up. All of these practices are in the nature of a compromise; but they are practiced by all inspectors in some form or other, as will be evident-
from a perusal of the literature availa-
ble on the subject.
In connection with this same point we may imagine the case of two nurs-
erymen, one of whom succeeds in con-
cealing any disease in his stock; while the other one does not attempt this,
and even points out the doubtful trees to the inspector. Under a cast-iron rule of “one insect—no certiﬁcate,"
the honest man would fail to get a cer-
tiﬁcate, while his less honest neighbor would get one. Again, of two neigh-
boring small nurseries, the one is per-
haps found infested or diseased; the other one is not, and gets a certiﬁcate.
The whole of a large nursery is as large as two small ones; one portion is perhaps infested, the other part not. In view of the fact that the inspector can hardly, under ordinary conditions, re-
fuse a certificate to the small clean nursery; then ought not the large nursery to be certiﬁed, with proper re—
strictions, to the extent of its clean portions, leaving the infested portion without any certiﬁcate? Besides, if the man with the clean, small nursery is dishonest, he may buy infested stock from his neighbor and sell it under his certiﬁcate.
T HE INSPECTOR—The rights of the inspector—what are they? He is en-
titled to a hearing if anything is sup-
posed to be going wrong. He should be the ﬁrst one to be notiﬁed. Thus,
last fall, the entomologist of a certain southern state wrote to me stating that there were rumors of unclean stock having been shipped into that state'from Florida. I asked him to send me particulars at once. He answered

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
205
that he would as soon as he had seen th stock in question; but as he was never heard from again in regard to this matter, it is to be presumed that the rumor was without foundation.
The inspector must insist upon the right to use his judgment. It is not unfair to assume that his knowledge of insects qualiﬁes him for this beyond all others, few excepted. In the facts already discussed, the writer has im-
plied that, under certain restrictions and preliminary operations, certiﬁcates are sometimes issued where adherence to a ﬁxed rule would prohibit this. In-
spection in Florida is not for Florida itself, but for other states and coun-
tries which admit stock only under certiﬁcate. The inspection require-
ments of these states and countries will therefore naturally be made the chief guide in the inspection of Florida nurseries. Furthermore, when the writer was in doubt he wrote to the entomologist of a certain southern state into which he knew that large quantities of citrus would be shipped from Florida, and received the follow-
ing answer: “Our plan in Louisiana is to give a certiﬁcate of inspection to nurseries, even when whiteﬂy is pres-
ent; provided, of course, that we have no reason to believe the nurseries in question will not thoroughly defoliate the stock.” With this statement in mind, I acted so as to meet the exig-
encies of the case, and I believe that the interests of the grower have been safeguarded; for no one has yet claimed to have found whiteﬁy on citrus stock sold under the writer’s certiﬁcate. I did more than the previ-
ous statement exacted, for I required the stock to be fumigated besides;
which to the best of my knowledge,
together with cutting back and com-
plete defoliation, makes citrus trees safe from whiteﬁy. The following cir-
cular was sent to nurserymen on No-
vember 12, 1907, and a revised form will be ,issued during this summer or fall.
G PRELIMINARY CIRCULAR TO NURSERYMEN.
Following are several simple re-
quirements, compliance with which is expected from every nurseryman re-
ceiving a certiﬁcate:
I. To fumigate all nursery stock prior to shipment: excepting ship-
ments to states and countries that fumigate all stock at the port of en-
try; excepting to parties desiring to do their own fumigation; and except-
ing a few ornamentals, such as roses,
that do not stand fumigation, and coni-
fers.
2. To defoliate all stock, if not al-
ready defoliated, at the time of ship-
ment. A few ornamentals that do not stand defoliation are alone excepted:
and shipments of citrus stock may be excepted during November and De-
cember if the buyer so requests, pro-
vided the same are fumigated and
.completely enclosed in a box or in bur—
lap.
3. Since it is impossible for the in-
spector to examine every tree in the nursery, it is imperative for the nurs-
eryman to see to it that no diseased stock is sent out. This should be a simple matter, since each tree must be handled several times in preparing it for shipment.
4. The inspector reserves the right to re-inspect, at the expense of the nurseryman, any nursery previously

certiﬁed, for the purpose of verifying that all conditions have been, or are being, fulﬁlled; and to annul the cer-
tiﬁcate if the conditions in the nursery prove unsatisfactory, or if any require-
ments upon which the certiﬁcate is conditioned are violated.
N. B.—The purpose of Rule I is not to encourage nurserymen to be less careful in keeping out whiteﬂy, scales,
etc.: for a badly infested nursery will not be certiﬁed under any conditions.
E. W. BERGER.
Entomologist to Florida Agricultural Experiment Station, Gainesville.
In conclusion, the present inspector can in no sense be considered a state ofﬁcial, and inspections have been carried on by the Experiment Station solely to meet the exigencies of nurs-
erymen doing business with other states and with foreign countries.
THE GROWER’S SIDE.

C. B. Thornton.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
As a member of the Committee on Nursery Inspection would say: In my opinion, the only measure to insure jus-
tice to all, is a State law, so framed that all nurserymen in Florida large or small,
selling trees in the State, especially citrus trees, are compelled to have a certiﬁcate duly attested, from a State oﬂﬁcer, com-
petent to judge, stating the absolute con-
dition of the trees offered for sale and'
this done often enough to give security to the buyer. This is a drastic remedy but in no other way can positive security be given the buyer nor an impartiality hin-
dered between the different nurserymen.
As a prominent nurseryman writes me:
“How much good will it do you if I sell a lot of nursery trees to you, duly in-
spected, passed, and' ﬁnally to make sure,
fumigated and your neighbor “J”-—,
going to a little out of the way nursery,
buys a lot of trees infested with scale,
mealy bug, white ﬂy and all other ills?
How long will your trees stand in their neighborhood without becoming in-
fested? At present nursery inspection is simply of no value to Florida and with the exception of out of the State and West Indian business, it does not amount to a row of pins.” This is from an experienced, successful nurservman. Un-
less a severe State measure is passed, all that should be required of a Florida nur-
seryman is, that he has his stock free from white ﬂy and mealy bug. These two are the most dreaded and justly so. Un-
less radical measures are taken at once.
the white ﬂy will be prevalent in all citrus growing parts of the State as the common purple or long scale is at present and this in spite of all sprays, fumiga-
tions, fungus or other preventatives.

Cultivating and Fertilizing Citrus Trees.

J. D. Bell.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is not to be expected, since horticul-
tural science has become a lifetime study in what may be called: the producers col-
leges, established by our government all over our country, that much that is new can be brought you by a lay member of our brotherhood. I shall endeavtor to remind you anew of well known facts.
upon the principle that line upon line and' precept ujpn precept is needed in our business as in all others. Cultivation is a word having a vast range, applying not only to the every day business of the hor-
ticulturist but to 'every department of human activity. In the limited sense in which we are to consider it today let us call to mind why we cultivate. First, to conserve moisture; second, to put the soil in good tilth; third, to kill grass and weeds which are taking tree food from the soil; fourth to decrease evaporation.
During the months of 'March, April and May in Florida the orange grove should be cultivated every ten days. In the fall the grove should be plowed Shal-
low, this being the best method of put-
ting it in a clean condition for winter and thus reducing danger fromv cold. As to the tools and minor particulars of cul-
tivation every grower should judge by his own experience what is best for him-
self or follow the example of his most successful neighbor. In the dry weather of spring and early summer cultivate shallow, cultivate often. During the rainy season cease cultivation.
Prof. H-ume says “the horse and cul-
tivator are often a most excellent sub-
stitute for an irrigation plant.” Some one has said “cultivation is fertilization.”
Theory and practice strongly enforce the necessity of frequent and thorough cul-
tivation during our dry season. An equally important duty of the orange grower is a liberal use of fertilizers.
Citrus trees amply repay good care and attention. Not less than one ton of the best quality of fertilizer should‘ be ap-
plied to each acre of bearing grove. A good way of guaging the quantity of fer-
tilizer for a bearing tree is to increase your applications until your tree has a good crop of oranges and is at the same time making a good growth. Look over your grove and endeavor to make every tree in it as good as the best one. Scat-
ter fertilizer broadcast through the grove,
except for young trees, then scatter upon the feeding roots. Some successful grow-
ers fertilize in January, May and Octo-
ber. Others in February, June and No-
vember. Three applications are better than a less number, having the same amount of fertilizer. Work in fertilizer soon after it is applied. Always be lib-
eral with your trees, a stingy man can—
not make a great success in orange growing.

Reports from Local and Horticultural Societies.
By Lawrence C. Moore.
'M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
At the time I received President Rolf’s circular letter (which was doubtless mailed to every member),
naming certain subjects which should have the attention of our Society, and then mentally examined my- stock of knowledge upon said subjects I threw the letter in with my answered mail,
satisfying my conscience with the thought that he would ﬁnd more fully equipped men to discuss and entertain-
ingly present all the leading facts; so,
donning my hat. I wandered forth to my orange trees, drying up for want of water and cultivation, with work enough in sight to keep three men busy for a year! But—two topics kept persistent hold of my mind and I found myself repeating the old adage, “\Vhat is everybody’s business is nobody’s business,” and, in my egotism, I ap-
plied it to the letter of our President,
and persuaded myself that it was my duty to do the little I might, to hold up his hands—send him some response and leave it to him to present the best thought offered on any given subject,
or to dissect each paper, and combine the best ideas, to the end that individ-
ual knowledge might be increased and some progress be the result. I there-
fore throw upon him the whole respon-
sibility should this paper reach other eyes—or ears—than his own!
Having determined my duty, next came the selection of the subject. This was not difﬁcult; it was suggested on every hand by the wilting trees, the encrusted ground, the hot, dry winds and eight or ten neighbors sitting around whittling, smoking and dis-
cussing everything but the improve-
ment of surrounding conditions. Per-
haps it was the strong contrast to all this.which caused my mind to revert to my boyhood’s days, when I had the good fortune to spend several happy vacations in that wonderfully thrifty Quaker settlement. ’Sandy Spring,
Montgomery county, Maryland, where both my grandmother and my honored father ﬁrst saw the light. Here the local Horticultural Society has ce-
mented the neighborhood into one homogeneous 'whole, and no such con-
ditions as those surrounding me could exist under the unity plan. Neglected trees, idle men have no part or place in that community, but persistent labor and the helping hand of neigh-
borly neighbors have converted it into one of the garden spots of this country.
And so I wrote to our President and accepted an assignment on “Local Horticultural Societies.” Then came the rub; I was committed; had to work out a given thing in a given time,
and that is always a nerve-strain.
Suddenly a brilliant inspiration came:
why not write for a full account of the organization and life of the Society at Sandy Spring and substitute it, warm from its birthplace, for any colder facts which I should have to cook over?

And so I will give you the reply which came to my letter, with only such al-
terations as are necessary to elucidate facts otherwise obscure because of lack of familiarity with the surroundings.
“SANDY SPRING, MD.,
2nd month, nth, 1908.
My dear Cousin—I was glad to have thy letter, for I believe it has been twelve years since we have met. I send thee, as requested, such information as I possess regarding our Horticultural Society. The Horticultural Society of Sandy Spring has been in exist-
ence about forty years, and it seems to us to be a fair model of a local organization. It was started with the double object of promoting a desira-
ble social life among country people,
and to cause them, by this contact of minds, to learn better ways of living and better methods of producing. thus enabling the community to discover and put into practical use new methods of doing old things, as well as the most modern and economical manner of producing, harvesting and marketing the products best adapted to its local-
ity.
Our Society meets once a month,
from March ﬁrst to November ﬁrst.
but in thy locality this would doubtless be changed, and possibly twelve de-
lightful meetings might be held. About
ﬁfteen different households belong to the Society, with an average of three to a house in attendance; guests often bring the numbers up to seventy-ﬁve.
Meetings are held in rotation at the homes of the members, and each one is expected to bring small samples of his wheat, best fruits and ﬂowers, or specimens of plants to be discussed,
looking to improvements in its propa-
gation, or to the extermination of some enemy. We meet at 3:30 p. m.,
and have the usual ofﬁcers—President,
Vice-President, Secretary and Treas-
urer—who are elected annually. The latter is a mere complimentary posi-
tion, as funds are not much in evi-
dence, nor are they needed; hence there is no membership fee. The read-
ing of the minutes of last meeting is disposed of in the usual way, and also the minutes of the last meeting held at the farm of the present hosts, since this takes up the work most interest-
ing and valuable to them. For exam—
ple: Thee may be devoting thy time to orange growing; another to pine-
apples; another to grapefruit; and so on; each wants the ideas on his spe-
cialty, and it is the aim of the presiding ofﬁcer to keep this subject uppermost.
Then comes the report of the “Fore-
thought Committee,” which is always bright. Then each member is asked a question, or may read a brief, suita-
ble selection. Generally two readers are appointed, with the understanding that they will not be called on if busi-
ness prevents. An early collation is served in any informal manner selected by the hostess. The collations are purposely kept very simple and consist of'tea, coffee, hot rolls or biscuit, ham,
chicken, or better still, a salad; or else coffee and sandwiches, with a simple dessert of cake or melons, in season.
This is served either by handing round with paper napkins or is placed on a table on the lawn, each guest helping himself.
I have gone into particulars to show how easy it is to serve seventy-ﬁve or a hundred guests when it is done sim-
ply. It seems unnecessary to say that neither politics, religion, nor any sub-

ject calculated to provoke heated dis-
cussion, is permissible.
Our Society always has a waiting list. There are two similar ones in the same country neighborhood. of forty members each; this speaks volumes for its usefulness. Your cOusin,
M. B. Thomas.
Mr. President, this article is sufﬁ-
ciently lengthy to stop here, but I ask your indulgence for a single moment,
to say that no place in our country of-
fers a better ﬁeld for local organiza-
tions than Florida. We boast of the most cosmopolitan citizenship of any State in the Union. Local jealousies and petty personal differences are sap-
ping the life of many communities;
men antagonize progressive local measures because others advocate them, and I have yet to see the neigh-
borhood unanimous even for good roads. One neighbor withholds the price obtained for a shipment, and makes a secret of the name of the house to which he consigns it. An-
other will write your customer, whose name he has obtained at depot from your shipment, underselling you.
These and similar local unpleasant-
nesses are rendered void by local as-
sociations, and the old but true state-
ment is exempliﬁed, that “There is a giving that does not empoverish and a withholding that doth not enrich.”
If this be true, then go home and or-
ganize, and let the ﬁrst Society render us a synopsis of its year’s work,
through its secretary, at our next an-
nual meeting.
ORGANIZATION OF LOCAL SOCIETIES.
By H. B.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I said I did not have any paper; I might have said also that I did not have any speech. If you want to or-
ganize a Society, go ahead and do it.
If you succeed, you succeed; and if you fail, you fail. We organized a Society in DeLand to ﬁght against insects, and the people, through that organization,
have become more interested in horti-
culture. If you organize a local soci-
ety, you will ﬁnd it is an easy way to get members into this Horticultural Society. The Fruit Growers’ Protec-
tive Association will be a great help to us, and our society saw at once the advantage of taking hold of it and the great need of carrying on its work.
Stevens.
When they made an appeal for money,
$300.00 was raised with us in about
ﬁfteen minutes. If you have an or-
ganization like this, it is an easy and quick way to bring matters of vital in-
terest to you all, before them, and it is an advantage to have as many or-
ganizations as you have neighbor-
hoods I think it well to get together locally and form other organizations and all join together against the things that are working against our interests; the railroad transportation, etc., and to work with the Horticultural Society.
There is everything for us in co-opera-
tion, and failure for a good many if we insist on standing as individuals.

Agrichltural Organization.
By C. K. McQuarrie.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me the greatest of pleasure to present to you for consideration and dis—
cussion a subject that every member of
_ this Society is interested in, viz., Agri-
Cultural Organization,
In dealing with this subject I want to say at the start that the word Agricultural in this case means Horticulture as well as Agriculture.
There is no doubt whatever of the beneﬁt to be derived individually and col-
lectively where there is a wide-awake.
up-to-date organization of farmers and fruitgrowers in existence. and it would be to the advantage of the country at large if their numbers were largely in—
creased. 'One can easily understand how uniformity of prices can be maintained and the proper distribution of products controlled by an organization. where the individual would be hopelessly lost. We have had ample proof of this in West Florida during the last twenty years and if it would not seem to be out of order. I would like to give a little history of a couple of these organizations of which I happen to be a member.
Eighteen years ago there was a rush of new settlers around DeFuniak and every last one of them going in for peach1
pear and plum growing. \Ve found that collectively we could buy nursery stock to greater advantage in car-load lots; so we organized “The West Florida High-
land Fruit Growers Association.” we had a membership of more than one hun-
dred. For three or four years everything went along smoothly; bought nursery stock and fertilizer in car-load lots and saved considerable money in so doing.
G. W. Mellish was our energetic and capable secretary, and A. G. Hollowell was president, and under this manage-
ment things did very well. \Ve held meetings once a month and in the sum-
mer time, or when weather permitted these meetings were ‘held at members'
residences in rotation. At those meetings was laid the foundation of the greater interest that West Florida takes in farm_
ers’ meetings than any other portion of the state. And here let me digress a little from my subject to say that the at-
tendance at Farmers’ Institutes in West Florida is far beyond any other section of the State both in attendance and in-
terest in the subject on hand.
When our orchards began bearing. we tried to ship in the same way that we bought, but it somehow would not work.
The varied individuality of the member-
ship caused considerable friction. Poor packing, packing unripe fruit. and pack-
ing fruit that was too ripe were some of the causes and we found that, generally speaking. the man that did the worst packing and was not particular as to uni-
formity in size and coloring was the one who did the most kicking and loudest grumbling.
The L. & N. (the only road in this

section) would not give us the rates to which we “were entitled. They had us by the neck, and they knew it. So when our Association came to the marketing side of its usefulness it did not prove as successful as the purchasing side of it, and, to add to our calamities, our enemy, the San Jose Scale, came in among us to stay for good, and in a very few years we were as busy grubbing up dead trees as we had been planting, and the grubbing was the more laborious job of the two.
For a few years after that our Asso-
ciation drifted along with a very small membership waiting to see how affairs would turn out. Brown-rot and crown-
gall, and other enemies made themselves at home gmong the few remains of our orchards. \Ve knew we had one of the best fruit sections in the country and our faith was strong that we could devise ways and means to overcome most of our difﬁculties. .
On July 4th, 1899, was formed the
“\Vest Florida Agricultural Society,”
whose formation was the outcome of a general farmers’ picnic at Grand Ridge.
This picnic was gotten up by Judge Por-
ter so as to get West Florida farmers together in a social way and discuss mat-
ters relating to their calling.
The Society was launched at that meet-
ing, but at a later one, at DeFuniak. the ofﬁcers were appointed and a constitution and by-laws adopted. The Society has been very successful along purely agri-
cultural lines. The president at that time, Judge Porter. called on the pres-
ident of the L. & N. R. R. (Mr. Smith)
and was successful in getting a one-cent rate for members to attend meetings.
The territory covered by the Society ex-
tends from River Junction to Pensacola,
160 miles. In its earlier history meet-
ings were held once a month in the sum-
mer and every two weeks in the winter.
At these meetings all subjects relative to farming interests were discussed. In fact, they were equal to Farmers' Insti-
tutes; but as we had no funds at our dis-
posal to pay expenses of state lecturers,
were conﬁned to members for speakers.
At each meeting the place for holding the next one was decided. The favorite places were Grand Ridge, Chipley and DeFuniak.
Members attending from a distance had to deposit a certiﬁcate of membership with the ticket agent to get the one-cent rate for distance traveled. The condition to be observed in getting this reduced rate was to notify the division ticket agent a week ahead of any meeting to allow him time to notify the local agent.
The membership of this Society at one time numbered nearly three hundred of
. the most progressive farmers of West Florida.
In 1901 it was decided to try to ship canteloupes and other early farm pro-
ducts in car lots, the railroad agreeing to give us certain facilities by placing pick-up cars at our disposal. This worked fairly well, but we found a great many obstacles in the way; the different soils and different modes of planting causing uncertainty in time of ripening: also the different fertilizers used and the different modes of culture. Every small thing had in the aggregate quite a decided in- ‘
ﬂuence on the general success of any one crop, and the studying of results along these lines was a very valuable education to those interested, and as the writer hap-
pened to be the secretary, the informa-
tion he got and the means of observation at his command, were very valuable to

him for further work in this connection.
The death of C. P. Atmore, the gen-
eral ticket agent of the L. & N ., gave the Society a severe setback; for Mr. At-
more’s successor cancelled the arrange-
ment for the one-cent fare, thus giving us a blow from which we have not yet recovered, for the regular passenger rate on this division of the L. & N. is four cents a mile, and few farmers are going to leave home, lose time, and pay this rate to attend meetings, let the subjects be ever so important.
We are still holding together nom-
inally, waiting for better times to come to us in the shape of the return of the old rate. We may not get it, and we may, but the good the Society has al-
ready done in awakening interest among the farmers of our section and in educat-
ing them in the meeting-habit is of great value to all concerned, for it is a very difﬁcult matter to get agriculturists to at-
tend meetings. They think they have no time to devote to meetings and yet these are schools of education to them. The very fact of meeting each other and get-
ting interested in each other’s doings awakens a livelier interest in all matters -
pertaining to their good.
We all know that the real prosperity of the country depends on its agriculture.
It is the real creator of wealth, and if those engaged in it would only wake up and get more mutual conﬁdence in each other the good they could do is incal-
culable. To get this ideal state of mat-
ters, we have to begin early. VVle have to start in the district school house. Edu-
cation is at the bottom of it. An ignorant man or woman is always a suspicious one; thinks someone is going to get ahead of him; for this lack of education keeps his mind cramped and his outlook narrow. In all agricultural meetings, the man who knows least thinks that he know most, and this holds true everywhere;
and the past history of agricultural so-
cieties all over the country will bear out what I have said.
The outlook for this usefulness of agri-
cultural organization is very bright.
Their past history is full of achievements,
but their future history will be yet fuller.
The solving of the present problem of the age, good roads, is in the agriculturists'
hands, and they are leading the way in a wonderful manner. About ﬁfteen years ago the farmers of New jersey pro-
claimed the fact that the state at large was as much interested in good roads as the farmer; that every individual resident of the state, through the market, was affected for weal or woe by road condi-
tions, and demanded that the state treas-
ury pay at least half the cost of good-
road building. This really was the birth of the state aid for good roads in Amer-
ica, and the New Jersey agriculturist was at the bottom of it. This work was not done by leading individuals among agri-
culturists, but by the combined efforts of the agricultural organizations of the States. Their good work was so evident that others caught on to the New Jersey idea and the good work spread rapidly,
until today state aid for good roads ob-
tains in fourteen states. All save two east of the Alleghenies have it. Michi-
gan has a sensible law whereby the state pays a bounty on every mile of good road, ranging from two hundred and ﬁfty dollars to one thousand dollars per mile according to the class of improvements.

amendment providing for a bond issue of ﬁfty million dollars available at the rate of ﬁve million a year, all for good roads.
The New York farmer, strange to re-
late, did not share his New Jersey brother's enthusiasm for good road-s at
ﬁrst, but now he has fallen into line and goes one better in that the state does more for this purpose than any of the others.
Let us look at our own state and see the paltry efforts the farmers are making for good roads and compare it to those mentioned, and yet we could make good roads at less cost than any of those. The Middle West is setting the pace in this direction. The Indiana agricultural or-
ganizations have been the means of get-
ting that state to lead all others, as thirty-
ﬁve per cent. of the entire roads of the state are 'hard roads. Ohio comes next with thirty-three per cent.., Wisconsin seventeen, Kentucky sixteen, Michigan ten, Illinois eight, Missouri two, Iowa one and seven-tenths, and Mississippi
0.38. Where is Florida? Too low to be
ﬁgured out. I hope the day is not far distant when we can also make a show-
ing in this direction.
The Highway Commission of Illinois has been collecting some very valuable data on the beneﬁts of good roads versus mud roads. Travel is uniform all the year round on good roads, while mud roads show a falling off of at least three-
fourths during February, March and April, showing fully that the economic beneﬁts of good roads are not fully un-
derstood by the ordinary individual.
The need of the hour is the road-
builder and our agricultural organization more than any other must be in the lead to get him here as soon as possible.
“The schoolmaster and roads are the most important agencies to advance civilization,” declared a great statesman in the U. S. Senate years ago. The schoolmaster is in evidence and doing good work; but where are our good roads? Now, let us, as an organization of horticulturists representing the best in the state in our particular line, lend our aid to hasten this good movement for the common highways of our country are the veins of commerce and civilization, and the greatest need of our day is good roads. This question outweighs the Panama Canal or the irrigation of the arid West. The world’s food supply passes on wagons over our country roads and that tells the story in a sentence.
‘Any interruption of traﬂ-ic upon our roads affects market conditions. The fact of the matter is that prices of farm pro-
ducts have depended more on road con-
ditions than anything else. In the great grain-producing section, crops must all be hurried to market in about two months’ time for later than that the roads will be impassable, thus crowding into a few weeks what should have six and eight months to do it in. The conse-
quences are stringency in the money mar-
ket, depression of prices, and a good time for those parasites on the so-called Boards of Trade who feed on what they don’t produce and gamble with other people’s property.
I could give this subject all the time at the disposal of the Society during the whole meeting and then I would be touch-
ing only the fringe of it,
And now let me ﬁnish by saying that the good that can be done by a live agri-
cultural organization is beyond calcula-
tion, if conducted along proper lines. The subject of immigration is one that could be proﬁtably handled by such, for the en-

couragement of the right class of settlers is one that calls loudly at our doors for solution.
The agitation for uniform rates from our railroad company is another live is-
sue that could be taken up and properly settled, and a score more of abuses that exist to keep the agricultural industry in a backward condition. And not the least of these is the subject of compulsory edu-
cation, for until we compel careless parents to keep their children at school we cannot expect a ﬁrst-class citizenship from the rising generation.
In recommending the consideration of these very important questions that con-
front us as citizens and agriculturists, we must by all means steer clear of giving any of them a political aspect, for the history of the past goes to show that politics has been the rock on which the most of agricultural organizations have been wrecked in the past. So by all means let us keep away from giving any ques-
tion under consideration a political color-
mg.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I leave the subject with you for your criti-
cism and discussion. My remarks have been made with a view of bringing out the best point in the subject under con-
sideration by the after-discussion which I hope it will bring on in a lively manner.

Pasadena Farmers’ Club.
By H. Roberts.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Pasadena Farmers’ Club con-
tinues in a prosperous condition, with meetings well attended and interest in the discussions increasing.
This is primarily a social club, de-
signed to promote friendly intercourse among all the people in our rural com-
munities, both natives or old residents and those who have come in later from other states. We realize the fact that,
especially in sparsely settled districts,
farmers and fruit growers are apt to live too much to themselves. They fail to take advantage of the opportun-
ities afforded them to enjoy and de-
velop the social side of life, thus un-
willingly imposing upon themselves and families privations that could well be avoided, and failing to obtain the full beneﬁts to be derived from the freedom and healthfulness of a life among the trees.
In this effort to amend social con-
ditions we have succeeded even beyond our expectations. Our people are united and in hearty sympathy with each other. New-comers are intro-
duced at once into the best society and old neighbors who had not visited each other for years are brought pleasantly together and old friendships renewed.
Our discussions are on some matter of general interest, on some line of our work as home-builders. For that is,
after all, our principal aim, to make of our little corner of Florida a land of happy homes, such as can only be found among a prosperous and united people.
We should be more than pleased if this club idea would spread to other districts and that a system of inter-
correspondence could be established between the clubs so that the people of one county or section might feel a closer interest in the people of other sections; that all might work together for the better settlement and upbuild-
ing of our beautiful state.
A very interesting feature of our work during the past year was a Farmers’ Institute held under the aus-
pices of the Club, at which lectures were delivered by Prof.- Rolfs and Prof. Blair, of the Florida Experiment Station, the exercises being inter-
spersed with talks and discussions by local workers, and not neglecting the generous picnic lunch supplied by the ladies who are. after all, the mainstay and support of the Club.
With many thanks to your Society for the invitation to “report progress,”
we remain. yours for a still better and more prosperous Florida,
The Pasadena Farmers’ Club.
Per H. Roberts, President.

REPORTS OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Executive Committee met at the Secretary’s ofﬁce in jacksonville on July Ist, and instructed the Secre-
tary to print the report of the meeting held at St. Petersburg last May. This volume was dedicated to the memory of our deceased president, C. L. Mc-
Carty. Sundry bills were approved and ordered paid.
On March 19th, your Committee met in Jacksonville and named the date of May 12, 13, 14 and 15 as the r time for holding the twenty-ﬁrst an-
nual session at Gainesville, and in-
structed the Secretary to secure rail-
road rates and arrange with the local committee at Gainesville for place of meeting and hotel rates.
The Executive Committee- met at the Brown House Thursday morning May 14th; bills as presented by the Secretary were examined and ordered paid. The accounts of the Secretary and treasurer were examined and found correct. The treasurer’s report showed a deﬁcit previous to this meet-

ing of $136.85, which amount the treasurer has advanced.
The amount paid in by the Secretary at this meeting amounts to $311.11,
which will give only $174.26 towards printing this year’s proceedings and other necessary expenses. It is evi-
dent that the Society will be over
$200.00 short of meeting expenses.
This time seems opportune for an endeavor to secure state aid for the Society.

Final Resolutions.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
\VHEREAS, The members of the Flor-
ida State Horticultural Society in its twenty-ﬁrst annual session have been so well entertained and so well cared for by the citizens of Gainesville, and in view of the courtesies extended to us by the State University and the ofﬁcers of the Experiment Station,
therefore be it RESOLVED, That we wish to thank the citizens of Gainesville for our royal entertainment (they have made good),
the ofﬁcers of the University for a very proﬁtable and entertaining afternoon and evening and the best of suppers.
and for showing us that we have an interest in so great an institution. We feel gratiﬁed to know its size and scope. and pledge it support and good will.
RESOLVED FURTHER, That we wish especially to acknowledge the very efﬁcient work and interest in our en-
tertainment of Dr. C. L. Crow and Messrs. Wilson and Ellis. Their. work has been thoroughly and carefully done. and we appreciate and thank them. \Ve wish further to thank Mr.
Ino. Billing, Press Secretary, for the very complete reports of our proceed-
ings. and congratulate the people of Gainesville on possession of so bright a Sun. This paper has given us the use of several columns daily.
RESOLVED FURTHER, That we feel under especially heavy obligations to President Rolfs for the wonderfully interesting and instructive program he has been able to prepare for us, and extend to him our hearty thanks.
RESOLVED FURTHER, That we thank the gentlemen in Uncle Sam’s most efﬁcient ranks of workers, who are en-
gaged in solving for us the difﬁcult problems that confront us, and wish them speedy success. We also wish to thank the Transportation Com-
panies for the courtesy of giving us good service and in reducing the rail-
road fare, thus enabling more of us to come to the meetings, and hope that they may some day see the wisdom of inaugurating a lower rate in the move-
ment of our produce to the markets of the country. We hope that they may see that our interests and theirs are identical and that they prosper as we prosper.
It is also desired to extend thanks to the two ladies who added so much to our pleasure and entertainment——
Mrs. Prange and Miss Hubbard.

Necrology.

EULOGY OF REV. LYMAN PHELPS.
E. S. Hubbard.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
On April 26th our friend and fellow worker, Rev. Lyman Phelps, embarked on his last journey to “the undiscovered country, that bourn fr0m which no traveler returns,” and I would render a tribute to his memory. The lofty brow,
the piercing eyes, the Dantean nose, the grim yet tender mouth, the prognathous jaw, the countenance that was index to his character will be seen among us never again. The distinguished presence that graced our gatherings is a memory of the past. The subtle intellect that coun—
seled and guided in our deliberations is a shade with the host of departed spirits,
and the place that knew him once will
. know him no more.
Thirty-ﬁve years ago, broken in health from overwork in his chosen profess'on,
having buried the wife of his youth, with even life despaired of, he came to Florida.
In our balmy climate he gradually gath-
ered strength and courage and began mis-
sionary \vork among the scattered settle-
ments. The long drives through the wild forest _country gave him an intimate ac-
quaintance with Orange county and stim—
ulated anew his interest in botany, giving him a knowledge of the species and habits of the Flora of Florida equalled by few.
From this he became interested in the horticultural and business advancement of his surroundings. For a time he was postmaster at Sanford, connected with the bank and an encourager of all legi-
timate enterprises; but what appealed to him most was the growing and improve-
ment of citrus fruits.
For a time superintendent of General Sanford’s Bellair orange grove he made an intimate study of the great number of new varieties imported by General Sanford and was the chief factor, in se-
lecting the most desirable and introduc-
ing them to the public. At that time nearly all the oranges in Florida were grown on sweet seedling trees from seeds of the old Spanish strain of stocks and the groves planted by Zephaniah Kingsley.
Mr. Parsons, the nurseryman of Flush-
ing, Long Island, had made quite a list of importations from Rivers of England.
including the Excelsior, also known as Hart’s and Valencia Late and imported by General Sanford as Brown, but the varieties of Maltas, Jaffas.|etc., were mainly brought to public notice by Mr.
Phelps.
He was the father of chemical fertiliz-
ing for citrus fruits in Florida. \Vhen

he began his experiments the old groves were mainly fertilized by cowpenning with cattle; the muck mania was in full blast and the small amounts of commer-
cial fertilizers used were usually either organic nitrogen material or one-sided,
ill-balanced chlorine base mixtures that produced when used continuously unfa-
vorable results. The discovery of a well-
balanced chemical fertilizer produced from sulphates that can be used safely year after year was a triumph of which any horticulturist might be proud.
The inﬂuence of this discovery has been far-reaching not only with citrus, but with deciduous fruits and the principle in-
volved is now generally recognized as the correct method for high-grade results. He also discovered that an excess of sulphate of ammonia or a spray of bi-sulphate soda prematurely sweetens oranges.
Mr. Phelps was also a prime mover in the citrus exhibits and competitions started at Orlando and continued at San-
ford and Ocala. He used his full in-
ﬂuence for the judging of citrus fruits by scales of points and furthered the im-
provement of those scales to this present form. Nothing educated public opinion and knowledge as to the standards of ex-
cellence of oranges and the merits of different varieties as did these competi-
tions, and there was no greater object lesson on scientiﬁc culture and fertilizing than the thin-skinned, high-ﬂavored fruit shown at these exhibitions. I think Mr.
Phelps was most proud, however, ofhis discovery of the cause of bud-sports, va-
riations or so-called mutations of citrus fruits. The origin of new varieties,
types or species in plants is a complex subject. The production of new varieties or types by cross-pollination or hybrid-
ization and the culling and selection from thousands of seedlings is exempliﬁed by the work of Burbank and others.
To illustrate the small and inconclusive extent of experimental research into the origin of so-called accidental sports I will quote from Prof, H. ]. \Vebber, Bulletin
251, February 1908, Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station of the College of Agriculture, Plant Breeding:
“A second type of variation is that known to gardeners and horticulturists as sports and to scientists as mutations. These are large pattern, striking variations which do not occur very commonly, but which when found are likely to prove useful in the production of new types of value. The recent scientiﬁc studies of De Vries, a famous botanist of Holland, have empha-
sized the great importance of such varia-
tions in the production of cultivated vari-
eties and the evolutions of species. As is well known to gardeners, these sports or mutations appear suddenly without warn-
ing or reason so far as we know. We cannot produce them and must simply wait until they appear and then be pre-
pared to recognize and propagate them.
Mutations usually reproduce their char-
acters without much reversion to the parental type except such as is caused by cross-pollination. Mutations of self-fer-
tilized plants thus usually come true to type, while in cross—fertilized plants the mutations must usually be cultivated in an isolated place and carefully selected to weed out the effect of such crossing as has occurred. Many seedsmen exam-
ine their trial grounds regularly for the sports or mutations and many of our best varieties have resulted from the selection of such sports. Livingston, of Ohio,
who during his life was famous for the number of new varieties of tomatoes which he produced. made a practice to

224 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
regularly search the ﬁelds of tomatoes which he grew for seed purposes, for such sports, and almost all of his num-
erous varieties were produced by the dis-
covery of such striking variations.”
“Another kind of variation, probably of little value to the breeder of annual plants and about which we as yet know very little, is the so-called bud varia-
tions, sports or bud mutations. Chrysan-
themum. and rose growers know that it is not a very uncommon thing for a plant to produce a branch which will be entirely different from the remaining portions of the plant. Valuable new varieties of roses, chrysanthemums. carnations and some other ﬂowers and fruits have been secured by the selection and propagation of such bud variations. They seem in a large measure to be comparable to mutations except that they originate in a bud change instead of a change occur-
ring in the sexual reproduction. It is probable that they will ultimately be found to be due to similar causes, being produced in the same way..”
Prof. VVebber also speaks of the work of an experimenter stimulating plants to produce mutations by injecting chemical salts at certain periods. Mr. Phelps,
however, believed that no effect in nature is produced without some active, adequate cause and that the bud changes were ef-
fected by the organs of reproduction of the ﬂowers.
The citrus are the most highly organ—
ized plants I know of. The discovery that cross-pollination changes citrus fruits on the parent tree to hybrid fruits but not with hybrid seeds, goes back one hundred years to Gallesio.
Mr. Phel'ps discovered that not only was the fruit affected in these rare in-
stances by cross-pollination, but that the wood immediately below the fruit partook of the cross also and by taking buds be-
low the fruit when small be secured trees that bore the hybrid fruit and remained true to type. He also claimed that by forcing the trees with special combina-
tions of chemical fertilizers they were more susceptible and that he proved these results by artiﬁcial cross-pollination.
These were lost in 1895.
It is unfortunate no public experi-
menter has had the courage and patience to work on this line like Burbank on by-
brids. as the results when obtained are more immediate and certain. The estab-
lishing of a working plan, however,
would require considerable experiment compared with growing hybrid seedling plants, as a majority of hybrids show crossing from the start, while with cross-
pollinated sports the negative results might possibly be as great as the rejec-
tions from seedlings. The occurrence of these 'bud sports from bud wood used just after the spring bloom has been often ob-
served by citrus nurserymen and fruit growers.
So far as I know they have never been noted from bud wood taken before bloom-
ing. I have secured two and probably three varieties of navels in this manner,
The inﬂuence of the bud on the stock.
is also greater than imagined, as was shown in numerous cases after the
1895 freeze where lemon and sweet or-
ange sprouts sprang from the roots of sour stocks on which lemons and oranges had been previously budded but killed out_
Mr. Phelps was an original member of the Nurserymen’s Association that was reorganized into the old Florida Horticul-
tural Society. He was a charter member of the present State Horticultural Society

and chairman of its executive committee till failing health rendered him unable to fulﬁll its duties, and he did as much as any one man to steer the Society through the perils of its infancy and establish those conservative policies which have made it respected and a power in this state and country.
Mr. Phelps was a man of imagination and possessed the subtle outreaching in—
stincts that mark the prophet and the seer. His enthusiasms may sometimes have carried him to temporary erroneous Rev. Lyman Phelps, who was a native of New York State, was born December
12, 1833.
He early 'served an apprenticeship to a cabinetmaker. where he learned the art of working. polishing and ﬁnish-
ing woods which 'was to be in later life a source of pleasure to himself and friends.
He attended the Moravian Institute as a student in winter, teaching in various places during the summer months.
Later he attended the Theological Sem-
inary at Nashotah, Wisconsin.
He was ordained to the deaconhood of the Protestant Episcopal church at Nashotah Seminary, St. Sylvanns Parish,
VV'isconsin, June 15, I862. and to the priesthood at Zion church, Oconomonoc,
Wisconsin, June 28, 1863.
Under Bishop Jackson Kemper he did missionary work part of the time among the Indians; later he became rector of the parish at Mineral Point, \Visconsin and principal of the church school at that'
place.
While here he was married to Miss conclusions, but that happens to us all and it is the so-called cranks and visionaries that reach out into the unknown and dis-
cover and harness the unseen forces. Let his example be to us an inspiration, a stimulus to high resolve and stern en-
deavor, for a pioneer in the van of mod-
ern progress, a paladin in the crusade against ignorance, superstition and error,
a lofty and a knightly soul has passed from the realm of human endeavor into the great beyond.
Apia Hait,
school.
During the summer of his last year at Mineral Point, 'he went for his vacation to a resort near Magdaline Island where he was to hold services. He was accom -
panied by his wife.
Owing to bad sanitary conditions while 'here both Rev. and Mrs. Phelps contracted typhoid fever, which resulted in the death of Mrs. Phelps and complete loss of health to Mr. Phelps.
He was obliged to give up his charge at Mineral Point. He went cast for medical advice and treatment, stopping for some time at the sanitarium of Dr.
Foster at Clifton Springs, N. Y.
In the winter of 1875, accompanied by a devoted sister, he came to Florida.
Here much of his time was spent with gun over his shoulder, in taking long tramps through the woods studying the
ﬂowers, trees and birds of the southland.
His health improved and 'he became deeply interested in the culture of the orange and other tropical and semi-trop-
ical fruits.

On August 15, 1877, he was married to Mrs. Mary Lyman iWells, the widow of the late Philip Wells of Armenia, N.
Y., and (laughter of Moses Lyman, of Goshen, Conn., who had a winter home on Onoro lake near Ft. Reed, Fla.
Rev. and Mrs. Phelps chose for the site of their future home a lovely spot lying between Silver and Onoro lakes.
At this time Mr. Phelps applied the knowledge acquired in early life to dec-
orating his house 'with beautiful speci-
mens of Florida mahogany and curly pine; beautifully ﬁnished and polished doors, panels, mantels, tables and suites of furniture remain as monuments of his knowledge, skill and handiwork. Mr.
Phelps’ health continuing to improve, he did considerable missionary work through the county. He was rector of the church of the Holy Cross at Sanford for some time. ‘
He continued the study of the orange and all citrus fruits, was manager of the famous Belair Grove, owned by General Sanford, when in its prime.
It was while manager of this grove,
that under his direction were raised some of the ﬁrst and ﬁnest pineapples ever grown in the State.
He was appointed postmaster at San-
ford February 26, 1883, serving the pub-
lic faithfully during the term of his ap-
pointment.
He was one of the originators of the Lyman Bank, and director of- the First National Bank until failing health caused him to resign.
His grove at Denmere, his home, be-
came one of the ﬁnest in the State.
The freeze of 1895 was a severe blow to Mr. Phelps.
The death of his beloved wife in Jan-
uary, 1897,. was shortly followed by a severe attack of typhoid fever. Much of his time for the next two years was spent in rebuglding his grove.
During the winter seasons he went to Lake Maitland each Sunday to assist his honored and ‘beloved friend, Bishop Ben-
jamin Whipple, in the siervices at the church of the Good Shepherd‘. This he continued to do until the death of Bishop Whipple, which was another severe blow to Mr. Phelps.
On January I 7. 1900, he was married to Miss Mary Louise Blanie, of Sanford,
Fla., whom he had known for many years.
At this time Mr. Phelps became very much interested in the growth of lettuce and celery, which was attracting a great deal of attention in the State. During the two years in which he was engaged in this work he raised successively very
ﬁne crops of each vegetable on his lots in Sanford.
During the winter of 1905 and I906,
M.r. Phelps’ failing health was a source of great anxiety to his wife and friends.
He could take only short walks about his home.
After January, 1906, he was never able to leave the house. His days were spent in his roller chair. Much of the time on the east porch overlooking the beautiful lake Onoro, or on the south porch looking toward Silver lake. His favorite spot in the evening being at the west hall door to watch the sun sink to rest 'behind the orange trees.
There was little noticeable change in his health until the winter of 1907-8
when he grew gradually weaker. but suf-
fered very little pain.

him in his chair for the last time. By his own wish he remained up all day, and watched the sun set at evening.
Easter Monday he was too weak to get up. Each day he grew weaker, the last three passed in a semi-conscious state, recognizing no one but his sorrow-
in-g wife.
His spirit quietly passed away on Sun-
day morning, April 26, at about o’clock.
The funeral services were held at Den-
mere, Archdeacon Brown ofﬁciating.
The remains were laid in ‘the family burying ground near Silver lake, where in their season, the orange trees he loved,
may scatter their blossoms over his quiet grave.
ten WILLIAM H. EARLE.
William H. Earle for many years was a prominent and leading citizen of Tan-
gerine. He was born at Hubbardston,
Mass, on the 22nd day of May, 1831.
His father -was a farmer, and of, good New England stock.
The life history, and a detailed account of the work done 'by the subject of this sketch, would, as those best acquainted with him well know, ﬁll a volume. Being possessed of a mind, more than ordinarily bright and active, and having a natural inclination to literature, he at an early age became, and through all of his active business career remained a valued and constant correspondent of many of the leading papers not only of his native State, but also of the State of his adop-
tion. Nor was it by pen alone that he acquired the respect and' esteem of the citizens of his native State; for we ﬁnd him taking an active and leading part in the gran'ger movement; and as one of the strongest and most aggressive advocates of the cause of temperance, and it was upon the platform 'and the rostrum that he won his brightest laurels; eventually becoming the gubernatorial candidate on the ticket of the temperance party of his native State. Again we ﬁnd him actively engaged in mercantile pursuits, he having founded and for many years per-
sonally conducted the agricultural imple-
ments, feed and seed business, still car-
ried: on by: Ross Bros. \in the city of Worcester, Mass, and which owing in no Small measure to his care and forc-
thought has continued to flourish until at the present time it is one of the largest concerns of the kind to be found any-
where within his native State. Mr. Earle continued in the active management of this enterprise until about I885, when on account of failing health, he was com-
pelled to ldispose of |the 'business, and turned his thoughts toward‘ a more con-
genial climate than that aﬁ'orded by the old Bay State. His former schoolmate and life long friend, Mfr. Dudley Adams,
having acquired extensive holdings of real estate near Lake Beauclair, in Or-
ange county, Florida, it was perfectly natural that his thoughts should turn that way, and we soon ﬁnd him in com—
pany with two near and dear friend‘s, Mr.
George H. Rice, of Worcester, Mass,
and Mr. S. C. Davis of New York, lo-
cated near the small village of Tanger-

ine; this was about 1883, and the three friends at once commenced the construc-
tion of a cottage, for their winter home in the Sunny South. The genial and equable climate of Florida soon brought about a decided improvement in the health of Mr, Earle; and he.thereu-pon determined to make Tangerine his future home. His friend, Mr. Rice, and him-
self i-mmediately embarked in ihe orange culture, then in its infancy in their local-
ity.
They established a large nursery, and set out many of the orange groves in and about the village of Tangerine’ the subject of this SkCthll at once entering
" heart and soul in the enterprise.
Their groves grew, flourished and com-
menced to bear ﬁne crops of golden fruit;
then came that 'never to be forgotten freeze of 1895. Almost every tree was destroyed; and absolute ruin stared every owner of a grove in the face. The result was that most of the capitalists from the north withdrew from the ﬁeld, and aban-
doning everything returned to their northern homes in disgust.
Not so with Mr. Earle, and it is just here that his indomitable will, energy and perseverance most shows itself. He did not give up, but patiently, persistently and industriously went to work to repair so far as lay in his power the damage done to his groves, and 'by his acts and advice inspired a few of his neighbors to follow his example. The result is that we have the Tangerine of today, sur-
rounded by its tens of thousands of beau-
tiful orange and grapefruit trees; while many another settlement has for the lack of a man of Mr. Earle’s sterling worth and character. been absolutely deserted,
and literally wiped from the map of Florida.
During all of these years Mr. Earle was also an active member of the Horti-
cultural Society of Florida, and through his association with that society and its ofﬁcers, he was enabled to secure many choice varieties of fruits, plants and flow-
ering shrubs from other countries, many of which remain as a monument to his good taste and practical forethought.
There is still another enterprise in which Mr. Earle was interested. He became the owner of the only hotel in Tangerine.
about 1885, naming it The \Vachuset House and personally conducted the house for many years.
Here he hospitany entertained many of his friends from the north, during their winter sojourn in this land of sun—
shine, of fruit and of ﬂowers. Mr. Earle was twice married, his ﬁrst wife was Sarah R. Greenwood. Two children were born to them; one a son, William.
who died at the age of 17 years; the daughter now Mrs. W. S. Morehouse,
and her daughter, Reba Earle Morehouse.
reside at Seneca Falls, in the State of New York. Mr. Earle’s second wife.
Addie Greenwood Earle, survives him.

MR. F. LIPP.
Mr. F. Lipp, who died at his home in Cocoa May 8, was born in Bavaria, Ger-
many, 1844; 'he came to the United States, 1882, New York, and in 1886
moved to City Point, Fla., remaining for one year. After that 'he came to Cocoa and has lived here since. He was mar-
ried the second time 33 years ago to the present wife, who survives him. He was buried in the Cocoa cemetery Saturday evening, with only the formal burial cere-
mony, read by his old time friend Mr. R.
N. Andrews, and his remains now rest by the side of his little son who died 21
years ago. A large number of friends were present. Mr. Lipp has been unwell for almost a year, and bore his affliction with great patience. He was kind—a good neighbor, and his closest neighbors for
21 years bear testimony to his genuine worth as a citizen. The old song “kind hearted and' true” sums up the life of Mr. Lipp, and many admirers will miss him.

Question Box.
No. I—To what extent do orange and grapefruit growers practice cutting out the dead wood accumulating on the in-
side of trees? We would like to hear from some of our best growers on their practice along this line.
Mr. Hart—I think it is desirable to cut it out- and I do so when I can pos-
sibly ﬁnd time for the work. The dead wood there does no harm to the tree so far as I know, unless it is very large,
but it is very inconvenient to the pickers and it injures and destroys considerable fruit. I think it advisable to prune out all dead wood while the fruit is small.

N0. 2—Do 'we cultivate the soil, dur-
ing a dry time, to bring the moisture up,
or to keep it down?
Mr. Hoard—I do not see how cultiva-
tion could have any effect towards bring-
ing the moisture up, but think it would have the tendency to check it and keep it down.
Mr. Von Engelken.—I presume the practice of cultivating during a dry spell is for the same purpose as that accom-
plished in the Western States, where they raise crops with practically no rain-
fall whatever. They keep the soil stirred; in other words, keep the mois-
ture down where it will do the most good. _
Mr. Hart—The earth cools off at night and sucks in the ain that is laden with moisture, and in the morning as it warms up, that air expands and much of it goes out, leaving the moisture behind.
Cultivation just helps to retain that mois-
ture that is brought in the night before.
It also prevents the escape of moisture that is brought up by capillary action.

N0. 3.—W.ill you kindly tell me of Bermuda Onions? Can they be success-
fully and proﬁtably grown in the latitude of Gainesville, Fla?
Mr. ( )—At McIntosh the farm-
ers have been growing onions for ship-
ment on a small scale and have been very successful. They are pretty fair onions, too.

Mr. Taylor—You cannot grow them on very dry land. They must be planted on moist land, but not too moist. It is one of the surest crops we can grow.
They stand both cold and reasonably dry weather pretty well, and the man who puts them on the right kind of land is sure to make something of a crop.
Mr. Painter—A crop of Bermuda on-
ions grown so as to reach the early mar-
ket is sure to be proﬁtable. Late onions will seldom sell for over $1.00 per bushel.
They require a rich and moist soil, or the soil made rich with fertilizer. I grew seven successive crops and all were proﬁtable except one, when the seed turned out to be White Californias in-
stead of 'White Bermudas. The former made a large crop, but would not carry to market. By raising onions on irri-
gated land they can be pushed during growing season and when they are large

enough, withhold the water and let them ripen and dry up. Two weeks can be gained in this way and two weeks often means a difference of $1.00 to $1.50 per crate. The market does not want a large onion. The best size is three inches in diameter.

No. 4—Is it desirable to prune out watersprouts from orange trees?
Mir. Hart—If the sprout is where I can let it grow, I always save it. Their tops can be swung usually to where there is room for them. I do not waste any growth that I can put to use, and you can put almost any watersprout to use. It is very rare indeed that I take one out. I consider that more groves were killed after the freeze of 1894 and'
1895 by cutting off the sprouts, than in
> any other way. It takes away the leaf surface the tree should have, and I think every inch of leaf surface adds to the strength and bearing capacity.
Mr, ( )—Do they not take a great deal of strength from the tree?
Mr. Hart—No. sir; they bear the second year, and properly trained, soon become as proﬁtable as any part of the tree. The fruit bends them down and the next growth starts from the bend.
The limb thickens up, the rest of the tree grows out around it and it becomes a valuable part of a symmetrical tree.
Mr. ( )—Do I understand that you would let nature do its own pruning unless you found that the limbs were bending and rubbing against each other?


Mr. Hart—Yes, sir: that is pretty nearly right.
Mr. ( )——After the freeze of

1894, there were a lot of sour sprouts came up, sometimes as many as eight or ten. In most instances I have left all and they have made large limbs. Instead of having a large single trunk, I have a number of large limbs. The trees are about 25 feet from each other and in some cases they almost overlap, but there is a dense growth in the center. I have been in doubt as to whether it would not have been better to thin it out and get more fruit in the interior of the tree, but I have ‘been afraid to do it. I understood that you, Mr. Hart, did not do it, but I am a little in doubt as to whether I am losing fruit by not thin-_
ning them out, or not.
Mr. Hart—VVlhen the sour sprouts came up, I budded two or three of them and as the buds took, instead of cutting them away, I cut them partly off above the buds and laid them down. I would cut them partly off and then press my foot against them above the cut so that there would be a long break or split. In that way I retained the leaf surface of the sour wood in connection Wilth the root until the sweet buds became larger and could take care of the strength of the roots. After a year or two the sweet buds have gotten good tops, those limbs that I had laid down had served their purpose and I took them away. Do not cut them entirely away and destroy the leaf surface until the sweet stock is large enough to take care of the root system.
Mr. Seymour—After the freeze, I had to saw off my trees level with the ground'
and when the sprouts came up budded from four to eight, according to the size of the trunk. I have in my grove from one to seven or eight sprouts on the trees.
As to the fruit of a single stock bearing as much as one with four stocks, I have

proved that not to be so. I have one tree with one stock and some with four,
and I get a great many more off the four than off the one. As Brother Hart says,
I do not pull all the extra sprouts off.
I think the tree needs the leaf surface,
and I leave them on in big bunches and after awhile I pull them off I think my grove is as ﬁne a bearing grove as any in my neighborhood.
Mr. ( )—\Vhere you have a clus—
ter of limbs growing up from the ground,
do you prune or not?
Mr. Seymour—I let nature do its own pruning. Unless a limb gets across another one and“ rubs it, I never cut it out. I have a neighbor who is all the time cutting his trees and he never gets more than half a crop any time. I think in pruning too much, you stop the bear-
ing qualities of your tree.


No. 5.-—Is Frenching of the citrus family a disease in itself or simplya symptom of a derangement? How can it be treated?
Mr. Painter Frenching comes from malnutrition. This may be from differ—
ent causes, therefore the treatment that will cure in one case will not necessarily cure in others. The most prevailing cause is 'humic acid in the soil. Apply a liberal application of airslacked or hy-
drated lime to the tree or on the side of the tree affected and harrow or hce it in.
Fertilize with a few pounds of nitrate of soda in addition to the regular appli—
cation of fertilizer. In some cases three or four pounds of copperas applied to the diseased tree has apparently cured or helped the tree.

.No. 6—1 especially would like to know why it is set down so positively that we cannot grow apple trees in Florida. With me several varieties are growing quite as well as they do in my New York orchard. I rely on heavy mulching f0r all trees, but especially for apples, plums,
peaches, etc. I slope my mulch inwar-l so as to catch and retain the rains. This mulch [is made of any coarse material and covered with a layer of sand. If carefully made it equalizes the temper—
ature around' the roots. The hottest days do not affect the ﬁne roots seriously. I am having excellent success so far with King David (one of Stark’s new apples),
Stayman’s \Vinesap, and a few more of the fruits set down as hardly belonging in Florida. Of course my test has not yet reached the fruiting stage. I am suc-
ceeding so far admirably well with Lam-
bert and Bing cherries. I am planting f-reely of Mir. Munson’s hybrid grapes,
and they promise exceedingly well.
Among my peaches I have several from Stark Bros, in Missouri, that are doing quite as well as our Florida sorts. One of the best of these is W'right. The Early \Vheeler, (ﬁrst received from Mr.
Munson), is doing well. I think, how-
ever, that this variety has some of the Chinese blood in it.
\V'hat I miss in Florida is humus. and this I put forth every effort to create.
Fortunately n'ature offers us aboundiug material for this purpose. I do not allow a“ pound of humus material to be burned.
In such material I grew an 18 pound sweet potato this last year. Florida is full of problems, and is to me, immensely attractive.
er. Painter—It has been set down that apples cannot be grown in Florida.

after repeated experiments by some of our best horticultunists. Many of the varieties growing in the north haw been trier? with varying success. The ﬁrst year the trees are planted they apparently do well; the second year they may do fairly well and bear a fruit or two, but the third year generally winds them up.
The apple evidently was not intende-..l for this latitude, consequently will not thrive.
It may be that some day by hybridizing carried out on the same line that Prof.
Weber is following with the citrus, we may get an ZIJPPIC that will do fairly well in Florida. I believe that the Secretary
01' the Horticultural Society will be able to eat all of your next season's crop of apples grown in Florida, and would not object to trying.
