Proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual
Meeting of the Florida State
Horticultural Society


The proceedings of the Thirtieth An¬
nual Session of The Florida State Horti¬
cultural Society are presented herewith in our Year Book, and the members will find the papers read at this session and the dis¬
cussions following of more than usual in¬
terest.

The compiler with the ever present cry of economy before her, while attempting to preserve the germane portion of the many interesting discussions, was com¬
pelled to eliminate some of the items dis¬
cussed, and these omissions from the pro¬
ceedings were necessary chiefly to econ¬
omize space.

The papers read and the discussions covered a wide range of subjects of the utmost interest and importance to our membership, and these papers and discus¬
sions are made matters of permanent record in our Year book, as it is the idea of the Society that a complete series of this publication will constitute in itself a library of Florida Horticulture invaluable to the owner.

Before we closed our session in 1916 at


Arcadia where we had received so much hospitality at the hands of the good peo¬
ple there, Air. Biggers, the genial secre¬
tary of the West Palm Beach Board of
Trade, told us that when we came to his city we would have just as good a time as we had had at Arcadia.

We all left for the West Palm Beach meeting full of expectations and we were not disappointed. Those of us who passed through the country just north of
West Palm Beach in the day time felt when we drove into the city limits of this fair city that Jack Frost had heard that we were coming and did not want to make us feel gloomy by seeing the effects of his icy fingers on every hand, so he skipped by West Palm Beach and went on with his deadly work further south,
leaving even the most tropical growth practically uninjured.

The good people themselves were ever ready with their automobiles to take the members of the society to see the sur¬
rounding country, and the musical circle delighted us with solos and quartets ev-

ery evening. On Thursday afternoon we were the guests of the Board of Trade,
and they furnished automobiles for all of our members. After riding over the fine roads of Dade county and looking at the truck gardens in that section, we were all taken across Lake Worth to see beautiful Palm Beach and were given the added pleasure of visiting the “Garden of
Eden,’' the home of Mrs. C. I. Cragin.
It was a veritable Garden of Eden,
filled with tropical trees and plants, many of them very rare and some covered with blooms. As most of the plants and trees bore their names it enabled many of us to associate plant and name together for


the first time. All true lovers of horti¬
culture wished we had hours to spend en¬
joying the beauties, rather than the few minutes we could spare.

On our return to the city the ladies en¬
tertained us with an informal reception in the park, which was enjoyed exceed¬
ingly.

Our session this year was doubly inter¬
esting, owing to the fact that we had with us the Federal Loan Board, who came down to inspect our State after the cold, and also to take up the question of loans in this State. The full text of this discussion will be found in the re¬
port.


Addresses of Welcome and Responses


ADDRESS OF WELCOME ON BE HALF OF THE CITY OF WEST

PALM BEACH

W. A. Dutch, Mayor


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

It is my good pleasure in behalf of the
City to most heartily welcome the State
Horticultural Association, as our most worthy guest, whom we delight to honor and have partake of our hospitality.

I greet you in that spirit of freedom of the new day the glimmer of whose dawn is almost apparent. The gates and bar¬
riers between nations are fast being re¬
moved, and all hail the day when the song of freedom and welcome shall swell every breeze, and the kingdoms of the earth shall be free.

In so greeting you, I am truly glad that we can depart from that rather ancient custom of giving you the keys of the City in order that you may unlock closed doors and gates that stand between you and some coveted pleasure or desire. Friends and guests, I have no key to the City to give you; there is none.

We are glad to present to you a City wherein a united people are ever working to accomplish the greater and broader building thereof, breathing, in every ef¬
fort, the spirit of freedom and welcome,
and it is to the credit of such efforts that makes it possible for me to invite you into the City without gates or walls, whose


way is, and may it ever remain, open and free, to all who pass our way.

Blessed the City that has rolled the stone from its portals, that all may enter with a feeling inspired by the warmth and cheerfulness of its social atmosphere.

We bid you partake of our joys and pleasures, and share with us the great blessings this flower land, abounding in fruits, sweet to the taste, showers so gen¬
erously upon us.

We greet you with a friendship likened unto the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold. We want you to feel and enjoy that freedom and welcome while here, which our very surroundings suggest, as immeasurable as the depths of our great ocean, as broad as our thous¬
ands of acres of rich, fertile land with the bird songs to gladden the heart and the orange-blossomed, sweet-scented zephyrs of the morning to enrapture our very be¬
ing, making us to feel that

“God’s in his Heaven”

“All’s right with the world.”

Others will tell you of our great and wonderful resources, which make it possi¬
ble for the most successful cultivation and production of fruits, flowers and shrub¬
bery that you are especially more inter-

ested in, but I assure you that all these bid you come and welcome you.

Our birds in their songs welcome you.

Our pine trees nod their welcome.

The wings of the morning fan the branches of the palms bending low to whisper their welcome.

Our streams and lakes shall catch up


the glad refrain and bear it on to our great ocean until its roaring waves may greet and ever welcome you.

May your stay in the City afford inci¬
dents that will grow into fond memories,
such that you can say in one accord it was good to have been there, and with us you shall ever be welcome.


RESPONSE
Lloyd S. Tenny, Miami


Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and
Gentlemen :

The fruit growers of Florida are glad to accept your hospitality. They fear that you do not know, however, some of the promises that have been made to them. I am going to call your attention to a few of the things that we, as horti¬
culturists, are expecting to see. We are expecting to see them because for two years we have heard about them; they have been described in such glowing terms to us that I think it would be only fair that the Mayor of this City should know what has been told us.

We have been told that this is one of the most beautiful and prosperous cities in the State. We have already seen a little of the outskirts of it and can begin to appreciate the possibilities of your city.
We have been told that the Royal Palms,
the Royal Poincianas and all other Royal things, grow in such profusion that when we got here we would think we were in the heart of the tropics.

Well, fortunately for you, all of the rest of the state had an unfortunate affair


early in February, but the weather man protected you in such a way that we can come here and see your subtropical foliage in its richness and beauty, and it looks good to us.

We were told your streets were broad and long; that we could ride for a century if we wanted to and never come to the end of the beautiful streets and pave¬
ments. Well, we started out early in the day and have been over fine roads and are not at the end of them yet.

We were told your daughters were the fairest of the fair, and we can believe that right now, because we have seen a sample.
(Applause.)

Your secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce did not tell us, however, that there were any footlights in West Palm
Beach. If he had, a few of us never would have voted to come here. (Laugh¬
ter.) He did not tell us, either, that at the first meal we were to have in West
Palm Beach, we would be served with fruit from California. (Laughter.) I
am not sure we would have come if he had told us that. There can be but one




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY

thing worse, and that will be to have to¬
morrow, pineapples from the Hawaiian
Islands. (Laughter.)

Seriously, though, we agricultural farm people are glad to come here; we appre¬
ciate the possibilities of the East Coast,
and we have come, I trust, with our eyes wide open. It is an unfortunate day for any industry when that industry comes to feel that there is nothing more to learn,
and it is a good symptom in the life of
Florida today that we can see coming


from one section of the state, and another,
and another, growing in intensity, the spirit of rivalry, and yet the spirit of be¬
ing willing to appreciate what the “other fellow” is doing; to find out how he does it, and then going home, determined that,
after all, we have a pretty good place, even if there are some other places that have advantages we have not; and that is the feeling we will have when we go home from West Palm Beach.


ON BEHALF OF THE WEST PALM BEACH BOARD OF TRADE.


George Graham Currie


Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

It affords me great pleasure, on behalf of the West Palm Beach Board of Trade,
to bid you welcome. While I listened to
Mr. Tenny telling what he expected to meet at West Palm Beach, my heart some¬
what misgave me. It seemed as though he was expecting a good deal more than we could furnish, but when he finally told us it was our managing secretary who had told you what was here, I felt that we must back up whatever Mr. Biggers has said about West Palm Beach. I believe you will see, before you leave here, all that you were expecting to see, and more.

After all, Palm Beach is a state of mind; you will remember Shakespeare says, “nothing is good or ill but thinking makes it so.” If we can make you think and feel that you are welcome, I am sure you will not be disappointed.

This is the second time I have attended a meeting of this Society. Many years


ago I attended a meeting of the State
Horticultural Society at Miami. On that occasion there were two people present who were much though of, who have since passed away. They were very prominent in the meeting. One was your president,
Mr. McCarty, of Fort Pierce; the other was Henry M. Flagler, who made a most impressive address on that occasion. He was greatly extolled by the members, for the great good he had done for the east coast of Florida. Mr. Flagler in his usual modest way, when he rose to make his address, said, “You are making a mistake in so praising and flattering me; I have done only the same as many of you have done; you have done your best, at least you ought to have done your best, and I
have done mine, and we are both equally worthy of praise.”

That has often occurred to me as a most impressive and true statement.

Mr. Flagler, before leaving the plat-




6


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


form, told a story that was not quite so impressive, but equally memorable. He said, on one occasion a man had been com¬
mitted for some minor offense and ap¬
peared before the judge. While he was up before the judge, the judge asked him in a brusque manner;

“What is your offence?”

The man, who was a stammerer, got to his feet, and he was so overcome by his predicament, that his stammering was worse than ever, and all he could say was:

“S-s-s-s-pst-pst-ss-s.”

“What are you charged with?” the judge again demanded.

Again the man attempted to reply, but could only sputter and stammer worse than before.

Finally the judge turned to the police¬
man, who was an Irishman, and who had been watching the man’s efforts with a great deal of interest, and said,

“Officer, what is this man charged with ?”

“I don’t know, y’r Honor, but from the sound av him, I t’ink he’s charged with sody water.”

But enough about that former meeting;
we are now talking about this meeting,
and I want to tell you that the Board of
Trade, for which I am welcoming you,
was the prime mover in bringing you here.
Our Board of Trade is a bunch of live wires. We are proud of our Board of
Trade.

Away back about sixteen or eighteen years ago, it started. At that time we paid only about a dollar a year dues and we had volunteer officers, but we were interested in the upbuilding of the town


and we started out in the good work. We have advanced each subsequent Board of
Trade from year to year. In the course of our evolution, the circuit judge of this circuit was at one time our secretary,
serving without pay. About four years ago we decided to put off our swaddling clothes and become a stock company, and we sold stock and purchased a lot on which we are now contemplating the erec¬
tion of a building. The purchasing of the stock made us more generous in other lines, and we began to pay a secretary and get guarantors—people who would pay more that the usual dues and stand behind the Board of Trade, and we are now collecting $4,000.00, $5,000.00,

$6,000.00 and $7,000.00 a year for pur¬
poses of building up West Palm Beach.
We are expecting $10,000.00 paid into the Board of Trade in the coming year.

Almost everything that has ever been done for the good of West Palm Beach,
for the County of Palm Beach, has em¬
anated from the Board of Trade. We have just succeeded, through the efforts of the Board of Trade, in getting an inlet from the ocean into Lake Worth, and next year if you come, we can have you come to us from the ocean, or we can take you out to the ocean through an inlet of at least twelve feet of water.

We have just succeeded in getting the money for a road to Lake Okechobee, and will carry you out there by auto in a couple of hours when the road is built.
The Board of Trade is responsible for these accomplishments, and for the ac¬
complishment of bringing you here. One of the greatest ambitions of West Palm
Beach is to become a convention city, and

we are going to interest you to the best of our ability while you are here.

We want you, in your deliberations here, to remember we are one of the youngest counties in the state, but we have perhaps the most magnificent possibilities.
We contain more Everglades than any other county, and that ’glade land has been discovered to be wonderful in its fertility.

But we want you to remember that although we are so young we have many things that give us state-wide prominence.
We have an orange grove at Jupiter that has taken gold medals wherever it has been exhibited. The owner of that grove says there are 300,000 acres of just such land still remaining in our county, uncul¬
tivated. From one station, Delray, we ship more pineapples than from any other station in Florida.

Our truck growers all over the county are prosperous and but for that little un¬
fortunate freeze the gentleman told us about, they would all be a good deal hap¬
pier now than they unfortunately are.
But to prove to you how lucrative truck growing in this county can be, go down to
Hypoluxo and you will see the fine homes our truck growers are building and have built from the proceeds of the products of their farms.

Therefore, you will see that we are not altogether back numbers, but keenly alive to the prospects of fixing up those Ever¬
glades and the 300,000 acres I spoke of,
for the future.

In many ways we have set the pace for
Florida; we have a Superintendent of Ag¬
riculture and a Canning Club Agent; both of which this Board of Trade has been


instrumental in gettting here. We also have a County Fair of which we are justly proud. It has a bonus each year from our
County Commissioners, to show that they appreciate our possibilities.

We will, therefore, listen to the words of wisdom that will drop from the lips of your speakers, and we will listen with re¬
ceptive ears and try to get as much good out of this convention as possible. We want you here on account of the instruc¬
tion you will give us. We want you here to show you what we have, and we want you here because we feel you will leave here with good will towards us, and speak a good word for us when our name is spoken.

Therefore, I again bid you welcome on behalf of the Board of Trade.

Across the way is Palm Beach; the great Palm Beach; the millionaires’ play¬
ground, where people come even from
Europe to enjoy its advantages, and you,
ladies and gentlemen, are here and these advantages are yours. We want you to make the most of them. We want you to go away with kind memories of those ad¬
vantages.

Palm Beach is the emphasis of the whole State of Florida. We want you to know more about Palm Beach at the same time you are teaching us about the
State of Florida.

We want you to feel at home, but not like a friend of mine who once had some guests at his table. In an abrupt manner he said, “Now make yourselves at home.
I am at home and wish you all were.”
We want you to be at home, but in our home. We want you to feel when you come back here again, that you are coming

back home, and that you will want to come back and stay here for good.

In closing my remarks. I am going to read you a poetical invitation to Palm
Beach. It may not be entirely appropriate because you are all Floridians. It is en¬
titled :

AN EPISTLE

FROM THE PEOPLE OF PALM BEACH TO
THEIR LESS FAVORED BRETHREN
IN THE NORTH

All you who dread winter, with what ic implies,

In the far away realms of Jack Frost;
And you who are stricken when Dame
Nature dies,

And would fly from her snows at all cost;
And you, too, who toil, yet are tired of the strife,

And think you’ve earned leisure to spare;
And you who are seeking a new lease of life

But can find no environment fair;

Oh say, won’t you come to our City of
Flowers—

To our homes amid greensward and bloom;

Where, while o’er your bleak land the blizzard cloud lowers,

We are basking in bowers of perfume;
Oh say, won’t you come where the palms whisper low,

And the tall oleanders wave free;

Where the royal poincianas, in scarlet aglow,

Are bowing and beckoning to thee?

Oh say, won’t you come and enjoy, while you may


The enchantment of tropical skies;

And see the famed sunsets that hallow our day,

And the love-storied moonlight we prize;

Oh say, won’t you come and breathe zephyrs of health,

In a bourne where youth ceases its flight;

Where the days creep upon us with un¬
perceived stealth,

And we dream away care in a night?

Oh come, and be charmed with our red-
bird’s bright wing,

With the plumes of the lovely bluejay;

And list to the songs that the mocking¬
birds sing—

Feel the throb of the whippoorwill’s lay.

Oh say, won’t you come and be clasped in the brine,

Of the Southland’s warm billowy wave,

As it flashes and glints in the merry sun¬
shine,

Or breaks at our feet as we lave?

Won’t you come and hook “kings” from our ocean-swept pier?

Won’t you troll for lake trout as we sail?

Won’t you follow the fawn in our Ever¬
glades near;

And encamp on the Seminole’s train?

Or come, if you will, and be one at the feast

That we offer of grapefruit and pine;

Of the orange and banana and mango—
nor least,

Of the pear avocado divine.

Oh say, won’t you come—or if Fashion's the wile

That must lure you from Boreal Blast;

We can boast in “The Season” society’3
smile,

And of “functions” a daily repast.

Then come! Oh, do come! to our City of
Flowers,


And partake of our bliss we beseech!

In the North leave Earth’s storms and ex¬
change them for showers
Of the Heaven that you’ll find at Palm
Beach.


RESPONSE


S. F. Poole, Winter Haven.


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

I indeed consider this a great privilege and a great honor to be selected to make this response on this auspicious occasion.

As we came into your beautiful town this evening, we admired your broad streets, your beautiful yards and your fine buildings. We realized that you must have some “live wires” behind this town.

We have looked forward with a great deal of anticipation to this event, and I
do not believe we are going to be disap¬
pointed in the least. We have enjoyed ourselves every minute of the time.

I noticed as I was coming into town this evening, that you had no fences about your yards, and I have been told the reason for this is that people, when they get here, are so anxious to stay here that you do not need any fences to retain them. (Laughter.)

We have in our Winter Haven section,
a great many visitors coming to us every year, but we must have fences in order to protect ourselves and keep out a great many of them. (Laughter.)

I am glad to make this response for the Society, because we are in this beau¬


tiful place; also because of the Society that is represented here tonight. It is one of the great institutions of the State of
Florida; it stands for great things in hor¬
ticulture. It stands for extensive results.
We believe in getting the best that is pos¬
sible out of our labor, not only getting the greatest quantity but the best quality in our products, and by so doing we aim to make Florida and the products of the
State of Florida, known all over this broad country.

We are engaged in a wonderful work,
and as we come here this year, we hope to discuss these various phases connected with horticulture, and we hope that we shall all get great benefits from these dis¬
cussions. The officers conducting the affairs of this Society are the strongest men in the state in their chosen line. They are men, and women as well, who have a national reputation, and this speaks well for the Society. It indicates the great strength it has among our own people and the affairs of our nation.

Florida is a great state; it has wonder¬
ful possibilities, and we have only begun to scratch the very outside of our re¬
sources. Look at her agricultural possi-




10


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


bilities, look at her fruit interests, her trucking interests and other allied inter¬
ests, and you can see for yourselves what there is in the future for us.

We are farmers, and glad we are farm¬
ers, and when the day comes when we can dignify farming by making it a pro¬
fession, just as medicine and law and sur¬
gery are professions none of us will be ashamed of being farmers, for it will re¬
quire the very best from us in order to carry out the aims in our minds, for if we have the preparation Major Floyd spoke of, it will require an indefinite amount of patience and preparation on our part.

As I listened to the recounting of the possibilities and wonders of this region,
I was reminded of an experience of my


own when I was a young fellow and knew more than I do now. I had the temerity to sing in a male quartette in a little town called Paradise. We did not make much of a success, and we left that town rather in disgrace. My hopes for the future received a very rude jolt in Paradise. But as I listened to the alluring promises that have been held out to us by the Board of
Trade and your Mayor, I am fain to believe that perhaps my chances, as weli as those of the rest of you, have had a wonderful impetus. It seems as though we are near Paradise at least, and I am glad on behalf of the Society, to say that we appreciate this opportunity and that we will avail ourselves of it to the utmost,
and we shall expect to be near Paradise,
at least for a few days. (Applause.)


President’s Annual Address


H. Harold Hume


Mr. Chairman, Members of the Horti¬
cultural Society, Ladies and Gentle¬
men :—

Naturally at this time, the thought up¬
permost in our minds is of war and its influence on us and our surroundings.
Some of us may have hung “No War
Talk” signs over our desks or in our places of business. If we have, the best thing to do now is to hide them in the cellar or the atttic or somewhere among the things which have an ample covering of dust and cobwebs. Some of us may have been pro-German, others pro-Ally a few months or weeks ago, but now we must needs be pro-American not only in our speech but in our activities, in our daily goings and comings, for we are at war that democra¬
cy may not perish from the earth.

Being at war at this day and time, is not an abstract thing, not something that concerns a few men in the nation’s affairs,
the few men who today occupy positions of leadership in Washington or elsewhere in our country. And war today is not something that concerns only those who glide through the air, or sail the seas, or march o’er the land or go down into the depths thereof. Nay, being at war means that you and I, every member of this So¬
ciety and every man, and every woman and every child in this fair land of ours,
is at war. It is a concrete condition which embraces all, irrespective of age, posi¬


tion or degree, from the cradle to the grave. The burden is upon all, and if
America is to do her part in bringing this condition to a right ending, then it is for every one of us to take up the burden and manfully do our part. It is not that we must shoulder our muskets and march forth to the sound of fife and drum. Were we brave enough and strong enough and irresponsible enough to do that, the cause in which we are enlisted would be lost—
a fine example of misdirected effort. But back of the firing line, and away from those who direct our national affairs, back in the town, back in the village, back o’er all the country side, there is a place for all,
a place where one hundred per cent effort may count in results at least one hundred per cent. There, somewhere, is a place for all, the place where we, armed with hoe or rake or spade or shovel, or driving the armed cultivator or mighty plow may fight our nation’s battles. There may ap¬
pear to be little in common between a hoe and a sword, a cannon and a disk harrow,
but all the common tools and implements of farm and garden must be marshalled and used effectively before the war is won and this world made again a fit place for freemen to dwell in, in happiness and peace.

And having in mind the welfare of our nation, the welfare of our state, and the welfare and happiness of you, the mem-


11

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


bers of this Society, let me urge upon you the vital necessity of going forth armed with the tools of tillage to help our Coun¬
try in the task she has taken up. In a very personal way each of us must go forth to war.

Much has been said about the Agricul¬
tural and Horticultural resources and pos¬
sibilities of our State, and we are agreed that they are both rich and varied. Ca¬
lamities have been visited upon industries developed on these resources, and yet, how quickly have the effects of these been effaced, and how quickly have we resumed our every day order of existence. Yet with it all we have, in so many ways,
fallen short of the full development of these resources, and how far short we have come of that independence which the development of our resources might give us. We are so dependent upon other sections of our country for food stuffs for man and beast that any interruption of our ways of existence may entail suffering upon us. Nay! want may be at our doors.
Let me illustrate this point further. Last winter, North Florida was threatened with a salt famine. Not that there was not plenty of salt in the country, but diffi¬
culties in transportation had interfered with the forwarding of supplies to such an extent that for a time jobbers in Jack¬
sonville would not agree to furnish more than ten sacks to any one merchant. Now,
it is very likely that our railroad facilities for transportation may be taxed to their limits in the near future, coastwise ship¬
ping may be affected and what happened in the case of salt may happen with a mul¬
titude of things that we use on our tables or feed to our hogs, cattle and mules or


horses. There have always been good and sufficient reasons why we should produce more largely of what we consume but never were these reasons so backed up by the actual necessities of the case. It is indeed a condition by which we are faced and not a theory. It becomes imperative that every piece of cleared and tillable land in country, village, town and city throughout Florida should be utilized to the fullest extent. No spot is too small to be neglected and none too large to be left out of consideration. One crop should succeed another and the land used for high pressure farming. In every way possible we must increase the production of supplies for our own tables, and feeds for our own animals.

Moreover the time has come when we must give consideration to another phase of the problem. Labor has always been fairly easy to secure in Florida. It is so still, but there is a very strong probability that a change may come in this direction.
If large numbers of men are withdrawn for service in the Army or in the Navy or in the factory or for construction work,
we are bound to be affected and it then becomes necessary for us to take up the burden with our own hands in a way that some have not heretofore done, in some time at least. And in this work the boys and girls, the women and those unfit for field service must do their part. It means the enlistment for service of every avail¬
able labor force in the country. We must very closely approximate, what has at times been urged as a true basis for social and economic service, “He who does not labor, shall not eat”—every one must be¬
come a producer.


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY

While I have emphasized the public-
service side of this question, the results to each individual must not be overlooked.
In this time of high food cost and having in mind that still higher price levels are likely to be reached it becomes well nigh a necessity for every one on the land to raise everything possible from it, thereby making it possible to live at less cost than if everything consumed has to be pur¬
chased. Out of this war pressure some good is bound to come. The lessons learned under the hard hand of necessity will not be forgotten when normal con¬
ditions are resumed. We shall live the better for having passed through these trying times, we shall produce more of what we need, we shall be less dependent on other parts of our own country and other parts of the world than we have


heretofore been. And under present condi¬
tions the marketing of our surplus at re¬
munerative prices is a very much easier problem than it ever was before. In our production activities, emphasis must be placed on food stuffs and we may legiti¬
mately go outside our regular horticultu¬
ral lines and engage in stock raising, to the betterment of our economic condi¬
tions. We may look upon a live pig as nothing but a hog, at four cents a pound,
but at sixteen cents a pound, the once de¬
spised and plebian animal becomes an aristocrat.

And so let us awake at one and the same time to our necessities and to our opportunities — opportunities for world betterment, opportunities for national ser¬
vice, opportunities for personal independ¬
ence.


Co-operation


C. E. Stewart, Jr., Mgr. Fla. C

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

When Prof. Rolfs asked me to speak today, he did not mention to me the sub¬
ject on which he wished me to prepare an address. I suppose he thought there was no use in giving me a topic to discuss;
that there was only one thing any ex¬
change man could talk about, and no matter what subject he might give me to start on, I would wind up by talking about co-operation. We are all so full of the idea of co-operation that we talk about it whether there is occasion for it or not.

There is a principle coming into such common use in the business organizations of this country that many are misled into thinking that it indicates the dawn of a new era. No Trade Paper can be read today without hearing it advocated many times, and we who live in this the most progressive age since the world began,
forget that it is the rock upon which all civilization and progress are built. This principle is co-operation.

There are three main factors which are essential to the success of any great en¬
terprise or industry, and these are effi¬
ciency, economy and co-operation. The units of a vast army must co-operate as must the various departments of a large corporation for their progress depends on efficiency and economy, which cannot be attained without co-operation.

It is an old and familiar word used now


itrus Exchange, Tampa, Fla.

in a new sense. It has a different mean¬
ing from “co-operation” as defined in the dictionaries. The term is defined there as “United action for the increase of me¬
chanical power, as when several men join in moving a log or boulder because one alone could not stir it.” But industrial co-operation is a union for the purpose of obtaining the proper profit of a trans¬
action and distributing it equitably among those who do the work. It delivers the public from the conspiracy of capitalists,
jobbers and manufacturers who make the laborer work for the least, the customer pay the utmost for whatever he needs of money, machines or merchandise.

Co-operation is a word to conjure with.
It escaped frenzied finance and specula¬
tion by owning its ordinary interest val¬
ues, it builds up its trade and member¬
ship by giving them the profit which they have contributed. Mr. Carnegie believes that the future of the nation and the sound, healthy growth of our industries lie along the lines of mutual understand¬
ing and co-operation between employer and employee, producer and consumer.

During the dark days of ruinous com¬
petition, common sense and business cour¬
age evolved the scheme of industrial co¬
operation to bring the workman and con¬
sumer into partnership for their mutual benefit. It is organized self-help and its principle is a definite thing. As John



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


15


Stewart Mills said, “it is not co-operation where a few persons join for the purpose of making a profit from cheap purchases by which a portion of them receive ben¬
efit. Co-operation is where the whole produce is divided. What is wanted is that the whole of the working class should partake of the profits of labor.”

Co-operation is not a noisy or conspic¬
uous affair; it asks no laws in its favor;
it makes no appeal for aid or endowment from individuals or from the state; it disturbs no interests; attacks nobody’s fortune; but stands apart, clears its own ground, and gathers its own harvest.

Industry owes respect to hundreds of co-operators who have preceded today.
Heroditus mentions one hundred and
Aristotle one hundred and twenty forms of community life, all differing but all communal in some respect and all succeed¬
ing in their day.

Industrial co-operation had its incep¬
tion before this country was born. In
Rockdale, England, seventy-odd years ago was laid the foundation of the wonderful co-operative stores today. Some follow¬
ers of a man named Robert Owen first saw the value of combining, and gathered together under the name of the Equitable
Pioneer Society. This Society hired a little room, and after a year or two of struggle they raised fourteen hundred dol¬
lars and began the first co-operative store in England. That was the beginning. To¬
day the Co-operative Wholesale Society has three million members, is growing at the rate of seventy thousand a year; and does a yearly business of five hundred and fifty million dollars which is increasing at the rate of one million dollars annu¬


ally. It has buyers and warehouses in the United States, Canada, Australia,
Spain, Denmark and Sweden and owns steamers plying between continental and
English ports. How’s that for co-opera¬
tion? Some time ago a working man of this society was asked how he liked to work for the company, “I don’t work for any company,” he replied, “I work for us.” I11 Rockdale was fired the first shot from the gun of industrial co-operation that was heard around the world, and in every nation on this globe today this prin¬
ciple is being practiced. Four fifths of the population of Denmark alone belong to co-operative associations and in the
United States there have been filed, the names and addresses of over ten thousand marketing organizations, selling a com¬
bined agricultural product of over a bil¬
lion dollars. Fifteen years ago a pre¬
diction was made to Lloyds in London that co-operation once started in the Uni¬
ted States would reach a far greater de¬
velopment than in England and from these statistics it seems that this predic¬
tion is in a fair way to be fulfilled.

The handling and marketing of crops through co-operative associations is more highly developed in fruit growing than in any other agricultural industry in
America. These organizations are form¬
ed to purchase the supplies used in the production and marketing of the crops,
to standardize the harvesting, hauling,
grading and packing of the fruit, and to develop a selling organization giving prop¬
er distribution, keeping the products of the various members from competition one with the other, and working to stabil¬
ize the market by judicious shipments.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


We citrus growers of Florida must co-operate for the very life of our indus¬
try. The products of our labor have been exploited to an extent that few of us seem to realize. Consider for a moment the number of men that were in the state this year gambling and wild catting in oranges! And the grower who deals with these people for the sake of immediate profit is often undermining this business at its very foundation. Is it not by the advancement of this industry as a whole that you will reap the greatest individual profit ?

The citrus crop of Florida brings into the state an enormous amount of money each year and if growers could realize the power that the disposal of such crops puts in their hands, they would not waste a day in combining. Imagine the combined purchasing power of an organization buy¬
ing all materials needed by the growers of this state; consider the saving in trans¬
portation alone of large quantities of sup¬
plies ! It is a matter of record of the De¬
partment of Agriculture that a co-opera¬
tive association saved one thousand dol¬
lars in the purchase of only thirty-four spraying machines. There is an instance of the benefits of co-operative buying.

Do you realize that a co-operative or¬
ganization formed to handle the product of your grove has nothing in common with any independent company; that it is essentially a non-profit-making corpora¬
tion; that every cent that the fruit brings is returned to the growers, deduction be¬
ing made only for transportation and le¬
gitimate handling? Do you realize that it is your own business and that through the proper channel every one of you has a


voice in its every operation? Do you re¬
alize that your troubles are the troubles of every other grower, that your problems are the same, that your interests are iden¬
tical and that you are in business solely for the purpose of making orange trees pay? I think you do. Then why not help each other, why not throw aside petty differences and by giving and taking a little, combine and intrench yourselves in a position attainable in no other way.
The grove owners of Florida have been thinking of co-operation for a long time.
There is hardly a man connected with the citrus industry who has not considered its feasibility, and many have promised themselves that some day they would co¬
operate with their fellow growers. And that reminds me of a story.

An old negro living down south de¬
cided to get married. He went up and told his master about it, “Well, sah, Fse gwine to git married.” His master con¬
gratulated him on his decision, and thought no more about it. A month or two later, he saw the old colored man out in the field and remembered that he had recently become a benedict, and said,
“Well, Lucium, how do you like married life?” “Well, sah, married life is all very well, but I don’t like dis heah all de time fifty cents.”

“What do you mean, all the time fifty cents ?”

“De fust t’ing when I gits up in de mawnin’, it’s ‘Lucium, gimme fifty cents’.
Den at noon when my ’ooman bring my lunch to me in de fiel’, it’s ‘Lucium, gim¬
me fifty cents’. Den at night, when I
goes home, de fust t’ing I hear is ‘Lucium,
gimme fifty cents’.”


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY

“What does she do with all those half dollars?” asked the master.

“Lawdy, massa, I ain’t never give her none yit.”

Now Florida is the wife asking for co-operation and the growers are the hus¬
band putting her off.

The benefits of co-operation in this citrus industry would be farther reaching than the immediate profit from the main crop. The waste that goes on in all our groves is fully realized and it will take concerted action on all our parts to turn this loss into an asset. This is proved by the call for co-operation from various companies formed in the state which


manufacture their product from this class of fruit. So it is to co-operative growth that we must look for the general development among us of those princi¬
ples of thrift that perhaps our bitterest lessons have yet been insufficient to teach us; for the acceptance of a standard which shall regard care for small savings as an honor and not a disgrace, and which shall recognize as one of the most important teachings of the gospel, that wonderful lesson in economy, when after the manifes¬
tation of overflowing bounty its ministers were admonished to “gather up the few fragments that remain that nothing may be lost.”



Address


B. L. Hamner


Mr. Hume: One of the fortunate things about this Society is that we always have something in reserve.

I am going to ask Mr. B. L. Hamner to come up and talk to us a while. Mr.
Hamner needs no introduction, I am sure.

Mr. Hamner: In attending the Horti¬
cultural Society meetings from year to year, I have always noticed that Mr.
Hume touches upon a very important and timely subject. I think his message this year should be greatly emphasized.

If a person were to start the “wolf”
cry at this time to alarm the public, it would be tantamount to treason, in that it might make the public more insensible to the real call. But it is no “wolf” cry to state that our grain crop last year was a billion bushels short of the year before,
and it is no “wolf” cry to state that our wheat alone was fifty million bushels short of that disastrously short crop of the year before. It is no wolf cry to state that we are at war, nor is it a wolf cry that the people in Europe are engaged in a battle for civilization. Nor is the great amount of matter you see in the papers calling for increased production, a wolf cry.

Coming down to Florida is rather re¬
freshing and restful. In all of the north¬
ern cities on street corners, there are army tents and recruiting soldiers. Every


bridge we have is guarded day and night by soldiers against trouble from within,
and in the very atmosphere in the north there is a military feeling, and we begin to appreciate that we are at war.

But if I read history right, the battle line always waits on the bread line, and the farmer who increases the production of food products at this time is doing as much or more than he could do by shoul¬
dering a gun.

This should come home to the people in
Florida. We claim to the north and to the world that we have a country where we can produce crops the year around,
and they are going to be needed.

If I could show you the records of our road, and show you the food products you buy in Florida, and show you the great volume of food products imported from other states, you would not boast that you are a self-supporting people.

All of the lines have been called upon to take care of increased traffic along the
Atlantic seaboard. They are going to re¬
lease all vessels suitable for trans-Atlantic work from the coastwise trade, and the railroads in this country are being called upon, not only to handle the products they have been handling, but to handle this coastwise trade.

Unfortunately, we have been going through for the last several years, a de-

18



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


19


structive period, in that railroads have been attacked from every quarter, and there is today a complete breakdown of the railroads throughout the United
States..

You are not going to get your food products from the north and west be¬
cause we could not haul it if we would,
but our business now is going to be reg¬
ulated by the government, and the govern¬
ment is going to say to us that we must haul lumber with which to make these vessels, we must haul certain products to be forwarded to the allies, and they are going to control, perhaps not the move¬
ment, but the things that shall be moved,
the food products which shall be moved,
all throughout this country.

In the months to come you are not go¬


ing to have those things to which you are accustomed, unless you produce them yourselves. Cowpeas are going to be sub¬
stituted in the army and navy for other varieties of beans, and there is nothing you can raise in the way of food products that will not help your country. The Uni¬
ted States government is calling upon the railroads to do everything they can to stimulate the food production. They are drafting my department to the work of the government.

I hope that every man here who has an available acre of land, will plant upon it some food crop. It will not only be a patriotic act but good business judgment,
for before very long every food product will be high in price.

I thank you. (Applause.)
