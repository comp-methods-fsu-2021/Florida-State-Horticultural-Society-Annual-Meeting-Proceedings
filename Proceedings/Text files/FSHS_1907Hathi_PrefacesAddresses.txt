PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTIETH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE Florida State Horticultural Society.
For the twentieth time the Florida State Horticultural Society held its annual meeting, and the place of meeting this time was within the gates of the delight-
ful city of St. Petersburg. Owing to the poor schedules for getting to St. Peters-
burg it was thought that only a small number of members would be at the open-
ing session, but in this every one was dis-
appointed. The ﬁrst session was well at-
tended, and each meeting up to the close the attendance was above the average. In fact. there were more members in attend-
ance during this session than at any time since the meeting was held at Miami. So many of the members had never visited St. Petersburg or seen the Manatee sec-
tion, therefore they were delighted with all they saw while on the trip, as well as entertained by the splendid program offer-
ed.
The good people of St. Petersburg chartered the Steamer Favorite and gave the members a delightful ride up the Manatee River. Owing to the rain no one was able to get off and view the country around, lbut they were able to put in the more time regaling the inner man with the good lunch the St. Petersburg people sent along and served by the Ladies’ Im-
provement Society. The brew of the coffee was perfection, the salads were su-
perb, the sandwiches just right, and a plenty of everything for everybody.
The “next place of meeting” was an interesting topic and was frequently dis-
cussed between meetings, in the boat, and whenever a few gathered together. When the voting time came. however, Gaines-
ville won with a good majority and was announced as the next place for holding the twenty-ﬁrst annual meeting of the Florida State Horticultural Society. '

Address of Welcome on Behalf of the City.
By Hon. F. J. Northrop.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
)
I presume it is one of the chief pleasures of the executive of any city to welcome the various bodies of people that gather in the city in convention or otherwise,
and I assure you that it is an especial pleasure for me in this particular instance to welcome to our city this distinguished society; not alone for the honor you have conferred upon us by holding this con—
vention here, but for the beneﬁcial results we expect to derive from your presence among us, and your particular purpose here. I commend at all times any gather-
ing together in convention of any repre-
sentative body of people, because we all
‘ recognize the fact that it is the rubbing together of the minds and the study of our neighbors that brings advancement;
and advancement is certainly the order of the day.
We are all well aware of the fact that cultivation of the soil is the world’s great-
est and most valuable industry, and we are also aware that there is vast room for a higher education of our people in this industry, and we look forward to beneﬁcial results from these state con-
ventions. I feel sure that the beneﬁts we expect to derive from your gathering among us will be manifold, and for these reasons I extend to you the courtesies of our city, and assure you that we ap-
preciate the presence of yourselves, and the importance of your purpose. The keys of the city are yours, and I. trust that you will be able to remember with pleas-
ure your stay with us.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
ADDRESS OF WELCOME ON BEHALF OF PINELLAS ORANGE-
GROWERS’ ASSOCIATION.

By Mr. A. F. Bartlett.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I was just congratulating myself that I was to escape having to make this ad-
dress. The notice came to me a very short time ago that I would be expected to say a few words in place of the Presi-
dent of the Pinellas Orange Growers’
Association, who was not able to be here on account of a sad calamity to some of O his friends. I had tried to persuade the Secretary that it was his place and duty to do this, but while I was attending to some important business connected with the Society, he conspired with the presi-
dent and substituted me for himself. I have been at a loss to know how to get out of it. I supposed- I had succeeded until I was just called on, so you will

understand how unprepared I am for this momentous occasion.
I realize that we are before a body of representative people; people that I have learned to admire, and whose wis-
dom I have been trying to drink in for a great many years. .The splendid cour-
age'that has been manifested by the As-
sociation during its twenty years of exist-
ence (for this is its twentieth birthday we are gathered together to celebrate) is a remarkable thing. This organization has lived through all the disasters that have ever visited Florida since it has become a state of any importance—going back to the drought of 1890, the great freeze of 1894-95, the varieties of bugs and in-
sects that have afﬂicted us, and everything you can think of to discourage an organ-
ization devoted to this interest; but it is still in existence and doing business at the same old stand.
The people who have done this are the class of people we meet here. I.have lived in the \Vest, in the states where they do not know the meaning of the word “fail,” some of the states standing high in the catalogue of industry and wealth, and a short time ago I read a statement in some journal that the peo-
ple of South Dakota were making more money per capita than those of any other state in the Union. I was in that state at a time when contribution boxes were passed around in the city of Chicago to help the people of that state. I have known the troubles of other western states—Nebraska and others. They ap-
pealed to the nation to help them out at their time of sorest need, but I have never known Florida to appeal to the nation or any organization to help her out in the time of great disasters. I think this is a credit to'her and her people, and I am proud to claim a citizenship in the state. I am not recognized as a genuine
“cracker,” but I hope to live long enough to be known as one; to be known as be-
longing to their creed and their clan.
The people forming this organization are the people who have been leaders in thought and action; they have, perhaps,
represented the greatest industry in which Florida is engaged, and to them is due more than any other, perhaps, what we get out of the soil. They have done a splendid work. I mean by that, that the most important things we know about fruit culture, orange growing and truck growing in this state, have been learned principally through this organization.
This has been the leader, and has led the state. and as I see what things have been accomplished and see where we have been beneﬁted, the more I see what is still to be done on these lines, and the more I feel the need of the people for an asso-
ciation of this kind.
I took out a life membership, because I was afraid that I might possibly not live long enough if I didn’t take out one,
to be considered a member at all. I want to go down on the records as a life mem—
ber.
As I think of the splendid work this Society has done, the more I am inclined to believe that we will overcome the great-
er problems that are before us. It is a good thing for us to have these problems.
If we were always fortunate in our deals.
and sold our oranges and vegetables at a big price: if we had no trouble with the transportation companies, the white
ﬂy and other insects, we could come to-
gether and have a “Hoorah,” but no-
thing would come of it. It is in over-

coming diﬂiculties that we become strong and great, both as individuals and as a nation. We must always expect them and be ready to meet them. We have them now. We have just suffered one of the greatest droughts that ever visited the state of Florida, and we have suffered a great loss, but we are going right on just the same. \Ve propose to do more than we have done in the past, and to bring our land up to the highest point of production.
That brings up, perhaps, the problem of irrigation, not only in orange culture,
but in trucking. Those of us who have been through the West and know what irrigation has done for those states, be-
lieve that there is a great future for Flor-
ida. I think that we will be able to solve this great problem. We also have to consider the problem of getting our fruit and vegetables to market. These are some of the problems that I believe the Association can take up and can solve.
I think we can take them up and have a hearing. Let us see to it that our agri—
cultural schools and our experiment sta-
tions are given an opportunity to work along the right lines. Let us see that our Legislature makes an appropriation that shall enable us to make our work of ten-
fold more value than what we have al-
ready accomplished. Let us put it up to the state to see that our agricultural schools and our experiment stations are supplied with the proper materials and opportunities to make their work of the greatest value. Let these come in closer contact with the farmer; let farmers’ in-
stitutes be held everywhere, and be sup-
plied with the paraphernalia to go on with these experiments which will enable the farmer to compete with all his enemies of heat and cold, insects and drought,
These are some of the problems that come to the farmer or horticulturist, and I think this Association can, and should.
and will, help him to solve them.
Now, in the name of, find in behalf of the Pinellas Orange Growers’ Association and of the Board of Trade of the City of St. Petersburg, I extend to you all a most hearty welcome.
RESPONSE.

Dr. George Kerr, Pierson.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen.-
We come among you, not as strang-
ers, but as friends. Permit me to say that it was a happy moment in my existence when, at last year’s meeting,
I cast my ballot with the great major-
ity to hold this year’s annual meeting in this place. We have many valuable members in St. Petersburg and vicin-
ity; indeed, all over South Florida.
They are valuable because of the untir-
ing interest that is taken by them in the business of the Society, its increase of membership, its larger attendance at annual meetings, and also in the gen-
eral welfare.
These are strenuous times, when one is judged by what he can do and by

the “square deal.” I take it, that this is our platform. What we can best (10
for the good of all, and the “square deal” between man and man.
I am authorized to say on behalf of the president, ofﬁcers and members of this Society, that we accept your dec-
laration of fealty and appreciation of our efforts, with all their heartiness and fullness. They are a stimulant to a higher plane of usefulness and great-
er devotion to duty.
Horticulture as a business ranks second to none. It came forth in the morning when the sun ﬁrst kissed the footstool
0f the Creator as the waters receded,
and in splendor brought it into life.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our her-
itage. It is no gewgaw, or a second handed article. It comes as the free winds of heaven, unheralded, unbound-
ed, chaste. Thus, we lead the proces-
sion of all other callings.-
I say unto you who are ’not members,
come with us, and we will do you good.

President’s Annual Address.
By Prof. P.
Members of the Florida State Horticul-
tural Society; Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before presenting the address to the
20th meeting of the Florida State Hor-
ticultural Society, allow me to congrat-
ulate the people of St. Petersburg on the splendid success they have attain—
ed in building this beautiful city. It is only the periodic visitor to your city that notes the improvement and pr0g~
ress. Those who call for the ﬁrst time never knew it to be different, and those who are here always see the changes go on so gradually that it is rather a development than a metamorphosis. I wish also to congratulate the Pinellas Orange Growers’ Association on the frequent and instructive meetings they have held. This young Association will make its presence known and felt before the State Society adjourns.
Amid all of these congratulations,
we feel deep down in our hearts the absence of our late genial president,
whose invaluable advice has guided us...
Always ready as a peacemaker; fore-
most among the progressive; just en-
tering upon a wider and more useful life for his county and state. Personal-
ly, it is a loss of a kind friend and an able counsellor. To the Society it is an irreparable loss. In this hour,
when the shadow is over us, we cannot see the design. We can only bow our heads in meek submission, and meekly say, “Thy will be done.” I would urge H. Rolfs.
every member of the Society to read again his masterly address, which came to us as a parting advice. Let me quote one paragraph from this address, which sums up the whole thought in a rounded expression:
“I have felt strongly impelled at this meeting to press upon your attention these important matters. To give vent to the thought that has been growing in my mind for some years, that the most vital and far—reaching questions now calling for solution by Florida pro-
ducers were not cultural questions, but commercial; not planting, but market ing: not fertilizing, but transportation.
Let us think about these things. talk about these, study them, conquer then-
If this thought, talk and study. take not the form of action. then have we labored in vain.”
Those of the Florida Horticultural Society who are favored with informa-
tion on the commercial side of horti—
culture, especially with marketing and transportation, should come forward and discuss these problems, just as our chemists have come forward year by yea: and given us the best their labor-
atories and brains afforded. The bota-
nists, the entomologists, and the plant breeders, all have placed before us in-
formation that required years of toil and untold disappointments, until our reports are quoted and looked up to a~
standards. even in far-oﬂ' India and New

concise, and methodical study of this subject from the commercial point of view. Prof. Tenny will present to us a paper dealing with some scientiﬁc features connected with transportation.
Why can we not have an equally able pa-
per discussing this from a commercial point of view?
CHEMISTRY.
I have conﬁdence in the ability of this Society to study and master all problems connected with successful fruit growing. Almost from its birth,
has it taken up problems for discussion and study that would have been consid-
ered heretical by the Old School Horti-
culturists. The Society has certainly shOWn its adaptability to new conditions as they arose.
Chemistry, one of the oldest sciences,
was among the ﬁrst to be laid under tribute by the advanced horticulturist.
At one time it was thought that all causes for crop failure, excepting those arising from climatic conditions, could be discovered by an analysis of the soil.
Hence, we were taught that a chemical analysis of the soil would tell us exactly what elements were lacking, and what elements were present in too great abundance. The small amount of truth upon which these assertions were based gave sufﬁcient grounds for voluminous articles to be written in a most lucid language. Unfortunately, the most voluminous writers were deﬁcient in scientiﬁc training. and proﬁcient in lit-
erary work. These men were unable to understand the restricting language in which the scientists had stated their proposition. Consequently, they build-
ed up wonderful theories and hypoth-
eses, all of which had to fall because their
‘chemical major premise was only partially cor-
rect. Unfortunately for the true sci-
entist and the receptive reader, it is frequently impossible for the lay read-
er to distinguish between scientiﬁc fact and scientiﬁc fancy. The whole struc—
ture, the scientiﬁc as well as the fan-
ciful, fell into disrepute. This condi-
tion led to such terms as “Book Farm-
ers,” “Theoretical Farmers,” “News-
paper Farmers.”
“Truth crushed to earth shall rise again. The eternal years of God are hers.”
After clearing away the debris, the foundation truth stood there ﬁrm and immovable. \Ve have learned not to trust in the ﬂimsy paper structure that some still try to erect. The basic truths, founded in the science of chem-
istry. are so much a part of our knowl—
edge now that there is no horticulturist in my hearing but would rise in just indignation should any legislator intro-
duce a bill looking to the abolition of the ofﬁce of State Chemist. There are still many discourses written which are purported to be founded on facts from the science of chemistry. Usually. these discourses imperfectly veil their ad—
vertising nature. In addition to ad-
vertising essays, we have the pseudo-
an-d pseudo-horticultural es-
says constantly thrust upon us. These are often a serious menace to our prog-
ress. They usually contain a few grains of truth in a stack of chaff.
PHYSICS.
One of the most recent departures from the old school horticulture is the study of soil physics, or a study of the soil from the standpoint of the physi-
cist. At ﬁrst thought it would seem diﬁicult to form any connection be-

tween pure physics and horticulture;
but chemistry as a science concerns it-
self with the composition and materials that make up the soils, while physics concerns itself about the make up and conditions under which these various materials are found. The border lands of these two sciences overlap one an-
other, so that a ﬁeld may be approached from the realm of chemistry on the one hand, and from the realm of physics on the other hand, and ﬁnd savants from both kingdoms rightfully encamped on the same ground. Battles for the mas-
tery of these overlapping ﬁelds some-
times occur, resulting in loss of time,
and sometimes a loss of temper; all of which is a loss to horticulture and should not be tolerated. There is real-
ly no harm in exploring a ﬁeld from as many points of view as possible, and frequently a very great gain to all con-
cerned. The able address before this Society last year by Prof Blair, shows how little we actually know about what goes on in the soil from a physical point of view. We had all along felt that there was a considerable loss of fertil-
izer from. the soil. due to leaching; but had been told repeatedly by trust-wor-
thy witnesses that potash and phos—
phoric acid became ﬁxed in the soil. It is now demonstrated from a physicist’s point of view that a considerable amount of fertilizer is actually washed out and carried into the static water in the soil. from which it is impossible to reclaim any considerable portion.
SOIL PHYSIOLOGY.
The chemist has told us faithfully what he found in his crucible.- The physicist is likewise telling us how dif-
ferent natural and inert materials be-
have in the soil ; how the water moves; what effect different elements produce in the soil when applied; but all of this still leaves us in the dark as to what role different living subjects play in the economy of plant growth.
For the solution of these problems we shall have to look to the soil bac-
teriologist and botanist. I need here only to mention the rather recent work that has been done on the nitrifying organisms, or the organisms which en—
able leguminous plants to make use of the atmospheric nitrogen.
We have here three distinct sciences,
chemistry, physics, and botany, which are each laboring actively to subdue the same realm, the soil. These three,
however much they may discover,
will not complete the work for us.
What we shall need when these three have secured the vast store of scienti-
ﬁc information locked up in the soil, is the physiological botanist to tell us what effect a variation of these factors has on our cultivated crops. Of what use is it to us to raise an orange that turns even the stomach of an insect, or to raise a variety of celery that has such a thick epidermis that even a fun-
gus cannot pierce it?
FERTILIZERS.
There probably never has been a meeting of this Society during which the question of fertilizers was not dis-
cussed, and it is to be hoped that this Society will not let the question rest,
until all superstition and misconcep-
tions have been cleared away. This ideal state will not be reached however,
until we know more about our soil; un-
til we know more about the needs of our plants; and until we know our fer-
tilizers. What we believe as true of certain elements today, may tomorrow

be proven to be a fallacy; and our be-
liefs of tomorrow may likewise on the following day be shown to be incorrect.
Let me cite a single illustration. Dur-
ing the early history of our Society, we found earnest and eloquent advocates of the use of ground rock phosphates as a fertilizer for citrus trees. These ad-
vocates have either been converted to the use of soluble phosphates, or have been silenced. Ground rock is no longer being actively advocated by any one.
Now comes Prof. H. J. Patterson, Di-
rector of the Maryland Experiment Station. He used nine different chemi-
cal fertilizers as sources of phosphoric acid—all that are ordinarily found on the markets. Included in this list are ac-
id phosphate, dissolved bone black,
bone black, raw bone meal, and Florida soft phosphate. The plots were laid off in the regular form which is usual for such work, the same chemical being applied year after year since 1895 to each plot,
making eleven years of continuous use of the same chemical on each particular plot. Now comes the most startling part, his conclusions. Two of them are of special interest to us. The third of his conclusions is that,—“Insoluble phosphates produce a slightly higher total average yield than soluble phos-
phates, and at about one-half the cost.”
The sixth of his conclusions is that,—
“Florida soft phosphate produced the best yield of corn.” Let us not, how-
ever, conclude that the use of insoluble phosphates is the best for us. In these experiments annual plants alone were used, and the soil upon which the fer-
tilizer was applied was clayey, and for the most part contained considerable humus. The conditions therefore, are not exactly the same as ours; but these experiments do show us the necessity for careful scientiﬁc work, even on sub-
jects that we regard as closed questions.
\Vheeler and Adams of the Rhode Is-
land Experiment Station, working un-
der different conditions, ﬁnd that ground rock (or ﬂoats) is the best form of phosphates for squash and better than any of the soluble or treated phos—
phates for corn.
COMBATING DISEASES AND INSECTS.
The question of combating insects and of controlling diseases is as old as the fertilizer question, and both are old—
er than our Society. We have publish-
ed valuable contributions on both of these subjects annually. Whatever we have attempted has been carried to a full and creditable consummation. Every year we have advanced slowly but sure-
ly. Sometimes our speakers have been a little too far ahead of the average, but the foremost have usually been abreast with the leaders. One of the leaders has not had a spraying machine in his grove for years. Last year there was a large exodus from the camp of sprayers to the camp of those who use the natur-
al enemies for combating scale insects.
'We must look upon use of the spraying materials for controlling insects and fungus enemies as temporary expedi-
ents, which for the most part under our present knowledge are unavoidable. In certain cases it is absolutely necessary to spray in order that we may avert certain failure, but we are gradually learning how to keep our groves and vegetable ﬁelds from getting into such distressing conditions.
The natural method of combating scale insects is meeting with most ﬂat-
tering success, and can be economical-
ly applied. It is far cheaper to keep a

grove from becoming affected with die—
back than to cure the disease. Many diseases and insects cannot be treated in a similar way economically, because we have not yet learned enough about them. The cottony cushion s cale,
which at one time seriously threatened the sub-peninsula, has been reduced to a negligible quantity by introducing the Ved'alia cardinalis, an Australian lady-
bird. California spent thousands of dollars in attempting to subdue this pest by artiﬁcial means.
CONCLUSION.
It is our province as a Society to teach every member of this Association what to grow, and how to produce the best of everything. The old adage that,
“There’s plenty of room on top”, was never more true than it is in horticul-
ture today. The man who markets the best product never has to complain of poor prices. It takes brains to do this,
and brains will count whenever they are correctly applied. Sometime ago we had a call from a gentleman from Michi-
gan who controlled considerable capi-
tal, according to his representations.
He was in Florida with a view of in-
vesting and had visited every vegeta-
ble growing and fruit growing section,
and closed his visit to the state by call-
ing at the Experiment Station. \Ne discussed the various crops. Citrus growing, in his opinion, was not desir-
able, since it took a long time to get returns from the investment, and then he was also told that the whitefly at-
tacked the trees. Peach growing was also discussed, but that was given up because peach trees had to be fertilized.
One crop after another was passed in review. every one having some weak point. Celery growing he considered to be remunerative, but he had seen some ﬁelds destroyed by blight. Final-
ly he said what he wanted was to learn
' of some crop that would not be frozen out; that did not need to be fertilized;
that was free from insect attack and fungus in'fection. He was very conﬁ-
dent that this infoiination could be giv-
en him at the Experiment Station, and so came to get it. The Director told him that this was a very easy propo-
sition and advised the man to plant saw palmettoes. I do not want any vegetable or fruit that is not relished even by a bug, or one too tough to be attacked by fungus, or too hard to freeze. Give me the pineapple that has to be packed in excelsior to keep from being squashed in transit; give me the orange that has to be scraped with a wooden bladed knife to keep from in-
juring the peel; give me the cauliflower that has to be wrapped in tissue paper.
Horticulture is affected more or less by nearly every science, and by nearly every art. Every walk in life is affect-
ed by the horticulture of the country,
and in turn as we are able to take ad-
vantage of the best of everything, will we be able to prosper. During some periods, our greatest needs lie in the direction of better methods for controll-
ing insects. At other times, informa-
tion on diseases is needed most urgent-
ly. At one time we were in great need of information on fertilizers. It seems to me that what we are now needing most of all is information that will en-
