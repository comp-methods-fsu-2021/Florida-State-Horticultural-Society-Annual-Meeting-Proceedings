Proceedings of the Twenty-third 
Annual Meeting of the Florida 
State Horticultural Society 


For the Twenty-third time, The Flor¬ 
ida State Horticultural Society assembled in annual convention, at the Gem City of 
Orlando, with headquarters at the San 
Juan Hotel. 

Orlando has entertained the Horticul¬ 
tural Society on two other occasions and this time the good people showed themselves no less hospitable and endeav¬ 
ored to make the Horticulturalists feel thoroughly at home and gave them such entertainment as the program and time allotted would allow. The special fea¬ 
ture of the entertainment was the auto¬ 
mobile ride in and around Orlando through the country to Winter Park and 
Maitland. 

The drive on the hard surfaced road between magnificent oaks and alongside of large orange groves was a very enjoy¬ 
able one. 

The party surprised Mr. W. C. Tem¬ 
ple at his Alabama Grove, but he was equal to the occasion and had the pleasure of showing some of the leading 
Horticulturists in the country a growth on Trifoliate stock that was even a sur¬ 


prise to the nurserymen who furnished it. The visit to the Winter Park packing house, which is said to be the largest in the world was of special interest in view of the fact that some of the methods for handling and washing fruit were entirely new in Florida. 

The visit to Rollins college where the members were heartily received by Prof. 
Blackman and his good wife was among the bright spots of the day. After a long ride and a walk through the packing house the cooling refreshments handed out by the young ladies of the college were very acceptable and heartily enjoyed by all. 
Many of the members had heard of Rol¬ 
lins college, but never knew before of the extent of its grounds, its numerous beau¬ 
tiful buildings and splendid equipment. 
All the members joined in hearty thanks to the president, faculty and the students for the very enjoyable hour spent within the walls of the college grounds. 

The regular routine of the meeting was carried through without very much change from the program. One of the very important things that took place at 









16 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the meeting was the naming of the place where the American Pomological Society would hold its next meeting. It will be remembered that at the Daytona meeting a committee was appointed to invite the 
American Pomological Society to hold its next bi-ennial meeting in Florida. The committee was successful in presenting their invitation and it was left to the Hor¬ 
ticultural Society to state where the next meeting should be held. 

Jacksonville and Tampa both put in bids, but Tampa won out as she had three delegates on the floor and they made promises that could not be overlooked and the Society voted on Tampa, knowing that she has never failed to keep her word. The meeting will convene on Jan¬ 
uary 31, 1911. 

The next place of meeting for the 
Florida State Horticultural Society will 


be in Jacksonville, where it will hold its regular annual session. The Horticul¬ 
tural Society, however, is expected to participate in the Tampa meeting and to be on hand to see that the American Po¬ 
mological Society members are well taken care of and are shown what Florida can produce. 

It is hoped and believed that the meet¬ 
ing at Tampa will be the largest and best attended and most interesting of any meeting previously held by the American 
Pomological Society, but whether it is or not is going to depend in a great measure on how our Florida members turn out and help. 

All of the members when leaving Or¬ 
lando did so with grateful hearts to the good people there for the kind hospitali¬ 
ty and entertainment extended to them.

Address of Welcome. 


Gen. Wm. H. Jewell. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen , 

Members of the Horticultural Society 

of Florida and of the Nut Growers' 

Association of Georgia and Florida : 

Orlando is proud and glad to welcome you here. We open to you the gates of our city and the doors of our homes and of our hearts. We hope that your stay with us will be profitable and pleasant. 
We are sure it will be profitable, and we sincerely hope that it will be pleasant. 

We remember that you were with us some years ago when we were barely emerging from that great disaster that almost seemed to mean ruin to us, when the chief source of our income and pros¬ 
perity was swept away in a night, and we suffered great loss of property as tvell as of our prosperity and of many of our people who were forced to go else¬ 
where to seek a livelihood, but we pre¬ 
sent to you a new and transformed Or¬ 
lando and Orange county today; we pre¬ 
sent to you one of the most beautiful, 
pleasant and healthful cities in one of the most beautiful and health¬ 
ful states of this Union. We 

show you our improved streets 

almost throughout the whole extent of our city and our principal streets, as you have noted, paved with the best modern material now known, vitrified brick, with many miles of sidewalks that seem like 


walking upon the mosaic floors of bar¬ 
onial halls or princely palaces, with our residential streets lined with umbrage¬ 
ous oaks. We show you one of the fin¬ 
est school buildings in the State, only re¬ 
cently erected but now too small for our necessities. We show you the lots and fields, once vacant and barren, now filled with homes; comfortable, pleasant and many of them even handsome, and we hope to show you something o*f the im¬ 
proved country roads 'that we have built, 
and to take you to see our suburb, Win¬ 
ter Park, and that magnificent model packing house built by that noble-spirited gentleman, Mr. W. C. Temple, your vice president, and we hope to show you that splendid institution for educational pur¬ 
poses known as Rollins College. We hope to show you these things and many more, which will add to your pleasure and be profitable as well. 

We are proud and glad to have with us such a body of men and women as compose your organization; people who are devoting themselves largely to the promotion of the material interests of this great State. 

While the great disaster to which I re¬ 
ferred swept away our orange groves, 
we show you today that Orange county is raising more oranges than ever before; 
that it is the largest orange growing county in the State of Florida ; that it 



FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


19 


has more orange trees than any other county in the State; but that we do not depend today as we did of yore upon any one thing for our living and pros¬ 
perity, for we can show you some of the finest truck gardens you ever saw, not only in Sanford but in Orlando and Or¬ 
ange county. We hope and expect, by aid of the labors of your organization, to double and treble and vastly increase 


the product of those groves and of those gardens. 

Again we welcome you to Orlando, and 
I am sure, although Orlando is not a town of “gush,” although we do not boast nor claim that we have a boom, we make no great promises, but what we say, we mean, and what we do, we do with all our hearts, and in that spirit we welcome you to the city of Orlando. 








Response to Address of Welcome. 


W. C. Temple. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of 

Orlando : 

We have listened with pride and ap¬ 
preciation to 'the very eloquent remarks of the mayor of this beautiful city, and we thank you for the cordial welcome. 

The mayor said we had met at Orlando before. That is true; we heard that re¬ 
mark last year when we were selecting a meeting place for this year’s conven¬ 
tion. There were other cities anxious to have us come to them, and we were ac¬ 
cused of getting the Orlando habit. 

We are glad Orlando is not tired of having us nor that we are acquiring the 


Orlando habit. We feel when we come to Orlando that we meet the cordial spir¬ 
it and warm heart of the true southern welcome. Other cities make us welcome, 
to be sure, and do everything in their power to make our stay with them pleas¬ 
ant, but Orlando is different, somehow. 
The people here are so truly glad to have us; they seem “home-folks” like, and make us feel like “home-folks.” 

And, members of the Florida Horticul¬ 
tural Society, you must know that we are going to be entertained by the most cor¬ 
dial people of the most beautiful city of the gem county of the finest State of the most glorious nation under the sun. 



President’s Annual Address 


H. Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Upon this, the occasion of our third meeting to be held in Orlando, it may be interesting to take a general survey of our fruit plantings, their nature and ex¬ 
tent. That our present position in the world’s horticulture has been reached only after great efforts on the part of many workers, led on by hope, encour¬ 
aged by example and backed up by dogged determination, is apparent, even to the most casual observer, and from their work, and the heritage which is ours, we may learn some lessons of last¬ 
ing worth. 

When we pause to carefully consider the status of the fruit-growing indus¬ 
tries in this country, we cannot but be impressed both with their diversity and their magnitude. Owing to the extent of our territory north and south, east and west, the variations in altitude from sea- 
level to the tops of our highest moun¬ 
tains, our diverse soil-types, and climatic peculiarities, a larger number of differ¬ 
ent fruits can be and are grown on the mainland of the United States than are usually found within the confines of any other single country. 

Not only have our native fruits, in many important instances, been improved and brought into cultivation, but tribute 


has been laid upon every land which could add to the riches of our pomology. 

Grapes and apples from Europe, plums from Japan and Europe, pineapples from 
South America, figs from Smyrna, or¬ 
anges from the shores of the Mediterra¬ 
nean, China and Japan, mangoes from In¬ 
dia, avocadoes from Mexico and the West 
Indies, pears from France, England and the Orient, Kaki persimmons from 
China, Japan and Korea, the chestnut from Europe and Japan, the peach from 
China and elsewhere, bush fruits (rasp¬ 
berry, gooseberry and others) from Eu¬ 
rope, the banana from southern Asia, and many more from many, many different places. Every nook and corner of the earth from the land of the rising to the land of the midnight sun has given us of its fruits; the bleak, wind-swept steppes of Siberia and the steaming jungles of 
India have added to our lists. We have laid toll upon the island's beyond the seas and the oases of the desert. From bar¬ 
ren hillsides and fertile valleys, from dense forest and open prairie, from tiny island and vast continent have come these strangers to our shores to become a part of our national wealth. 

So nearly have we been able to meet the requirements of these immigrants that most of them have found a congenial home in some part of our land. In ad- 


22 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


dition to this, the larger and more im¬ 
portant fact that these importations of foreign varieties have had and are hav¬ 
ing a value far beyond this direct and immediate use, must not be overlooked. 
They have served and are serving as the basis for further improvements, and when blended with other strains by cross¬ 
ing, the resulting fruits have, in many cases, far surpassed in value the varieties imported. These new fruits are adapted to conditions of soil, climate and use into which the foreign varieties would not fit. 
Hence, we have at this time, varieties of direct foreign introduction, varieties of straight domestic origin and varieties combining the parental characteristics of the two. Sectional differences, peculiar¬ 
ities and adaptabilities have been worked out until we can say with reasonable cer¬ 
tainty what strains of fruits will succeed in given areas. The peach orchards of 
New York and other northern states are planted with trees of the Persian and northern Chinese races, while the Flor¬ 
ida peach grower now plants his ground with Peen-to and Honey types. The vineyardist of the Chautauqua grape belt will be found growing northern Ameri¬ 
can grapes, such as Concord, or Niagara, 
or Delaware. The grape grower of the eastern Carolinas plants Muscadines and the California grower gives his attention to the wine and raisin grapes of Europe. 
The nut grower of the Pacific slope plants 
English or Persian walnuts and al¬ 
monds, if in the cotton belt he plants pe¬ 
cans, and in the northern states, chest¬ 
nuts and shell-barks. The California fig growers have at length succeeded with the Smyrna fig; while the grower of the 
Gulf coast will probably have to content 


himself, as he does now, with figs of an entirely different class. The date palm has been introduced and has found a con¬ 
genial home in Arizona and southern Cal¬ 
ifornia, Pineapples have thus far suc¬ 
ceeded only in Florida. Japan plums have succeeded over a considerable area but probably reach their greatest perfection on the Pacific coast. There too, in Oregon and California, is the land of the prune. 
In the central northwestern states, the native American plum has supplied the standard sorts for planting, and the Rus¬ 
sian apple seedlings have opened up a new apple field. Orange culture has reached its greatest development in our own State, in California and is now com¬ 
ing into prominence around the Gulf coast country. Of the newer fruits, the mango and avocado have great possibil¬ 
ities and open up interesting fields for further development. And we might go on calling attention to the different kinds of fruit which now engage the attention of our horticulturists. Truly our pomol¬ 
ogy is diversified. 

But turning from this side of the question to another, let us note that no other land produces fruit in such abun¬ 
dance, and I dare say, that in no other country outside the tropics does it enter into the everyday sustenance of the people to such an extent. Our vineyards and orchards are planted over immense areas. 
Fruit trees are set out by hundreds and by thousands. Vast areas of plain and valley and mountain slope are given over to the culture of single fruits, and as our population increases, greater efforts must necessarily be put forth to supply the increasing demand, for our people are a fruit-consuming people. Our products 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


23 


are marketed by carloads and trainloads. 
Think of our out-put of 45 or 50 thou¬ 
sand carloads of citrus fruits from the 
Gulf and the Pacific, 'trainloads of peaches from the orchards of Georgia, 
Texas, Michigan and Ohio, of strawber¬ 
ries from the Atlantic seaboard, of ap¬ 
ples from Colorado, New York and Ore¬ 
gon, of grapes from California, of pecans from the south and walnuts from the west. Truly these many strangers from many lands, the offspring of world-old races have amply repaid the care and at¬ 
tention they have received at our hands. 

Millions are invested in this branch of culture, vast auxiliary industries have sprung up and are dependent upon the fruit crops of the country. Think of the immense amount of labor employed in healthful occupation, of the great reve¬ 
nues gained by transportation companies, 
of the large amounts of wood, iron and paper used in packing and preparation for market; and we gain some slight idea of what fruit growing means to the coun¬ 
try as a whole. 

In no other land is fruit so abundant, 
in no other is it so cheap. Here it is within reach of even the very poor. More and more our domestic output has sup¬ 
plied our needs, and in proportion to the amount consumed, our imports in many directions have fallen off materially. We have been able to build up an export trade of no mean proportions and our resources of soil and brain and brawn are by no means exhausted. There are greater de¬ 
velopments yet to come, and looking down the dim vistas of the future, who can say to what proportions the pomology of America may yet attain? 


How has all of this been attained? By what paths have we reached our present state? What forces have been at work, 
and who have been the workers ? It is not our purpose to attempt to answer these questions in detail, but I do desire to direct your attention to one particular individual, the amateur fruit grower. To him belongs a measure of honor, a meed of praise so full that had his work been performed in other avenues of life, his¬ 
tory would have told of his achievements, 
and monuments would have been raised to his memory,—but since his tasks have been performed in what we have mis¬ 
called the lowlier walks of life, there has been no poet to sing his praise. But, 
who is he? What is he? What has he done ? When some day the history of 
American fruit growing is written as I 
hope it may be, we shall learn more of him, and of what we owe to his efforts. 

If I were to define the amateur fruit grower, I could not do better than to paraphrase the words of Prof. Hale: “An amateur is a man who works in the field of horticulture because he cannot help it. 
Because he would rather do such work than anything else in the world. And, 
therefore, cares little for hampering tra¬ 
ditions or for difficulties of any kind.” 

The impelling force is sheer love of his work. No thought of largess is his, 
love of plants to him is his reward. 

To him we owe the major portion of our finest fruits. Interested in his chosen field, he has been ever quick to note varia¬ 
tions in the plants grown under his watchful eye. The superiority of one over another, or maybe over all others, 
has not passed unnoticed. When plants were brought from foreign lands, his was 


24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIET Y. 


the hand which received them and gave them kindly care, and when new fruits were brought to his notice, whether in our own country or in another, he has always been anxious to secure and test them. 

The tendency in our country is to limit our plantings to a comparatively small number of varieties, and this small num¬ 
ber is woefully small, when we compare it with the thousands of varieties which from the beginning have appeared in va¬ 
rious catalogues and lists. It is also small when we compare it with the number of varieties planted by the old world cultur- 
ist. Ait the present time, as in every oth¬ 
er period of our pomology, new varieties are being constantly introduced, and so well are these placed before the public with illustrated and descriptive matter, 
that many might be led to plant largely without sufficient knowledge of their mer¬ 
its. Moreover while one variety may be good in a certain given locality, its range of adaptability may be limited, and no one can say over what territory a variety will succeed, until it has actually been tested on the soil. Herein the amateur has performed an invaluable service. New things attract his attention, he purchases them, or secures them, plants and cares for them. After a number of years’ trial, 
under the vicissitudes of climate, of cold and heat, of rainfall and dry weather, he, 
more than any one else, is capable of passing upon the merits of the newer things. Not his, the attitude of the cold commercialist, whose only thought is of the gains he makes on his trees; and yet, 
the amateur oftAimes prevents this same commercialist from falling into errors 


which would be disastrous to the success¬ 
ful outcome of his business operations. 

Among our amateur growers, we may count not only our most worthy plant in¬ 
troducers and testers but also' our most noted plant breeders and improvers. The service which such men as Prince, Down¬ 
ing, Rogers, Bull, Budd and Stuart have rendered American horticulture in their several fields of activity cannot well be over estimated. Who> can count the val¬ 
ue of the work done by Sand ford, Ed¬ 
mund H. Hart, Phelps, Richards, Brown and Adams in the development of the fruit industries in this State? Their names will live long in the annals of 
Florida horticulture. 

It has, however, not been along these lines alone that they have rendered val¬ 
uable service. The fruit grower, to be successful, must wage war successfully against all the forces which oppose him. 
His is no one-sided study; and the ama¬ 
teur has played his part and played it well, in the control of plant diseases and insects. When new lines of fruit were introduced, their propagation, cultivation and general care require attention. These details have been mastered. Again when the fruits were ready to place upon the markets he has done his part in bringing them before the public. No phase of his work has been left untouched. He has given of himself and of his time without stint. All honor to the work he has done in the development of the enormous fruit industries of our country. Florida has had her full quota of amateur fruit-grow¬ 
ers, and their combined ability has not been surpassed by the combined ability of the fruit growers of any other region in our country. And today, the same

spirit is abroad in the State. May it long remain. With it, our fruit trees and plants are living vital objects to draw forth from their caretakers the best that is in them. Without it, our occupation has become dead and inert, it has lost its best, vital uplifting force for man and plant. Not only does man cultivate his fruit trees, but if he approaches his work in the right spirit and in the spirit with which the amateur fruit-grower has al¬ 


ways approached his work, his fruit trees cultivate him. Thus we live for the best: 
that is in our work, and in so living, win from it a reward far above the monetary gain it brings us. And when we fold our cloaks about us, to lie down to our re¬ 
pose, may it be with the feeling that we have lived not unto ourselves but for the betterment of an occupation that means so much to our State, and which has. 
meant so much to us.
