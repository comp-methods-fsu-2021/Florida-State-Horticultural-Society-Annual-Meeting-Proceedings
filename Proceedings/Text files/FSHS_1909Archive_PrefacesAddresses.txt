PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 

Twenty-Second Annual Meeting 

f 

OF THE 

Florida State Horticultural Society 


The Florida State Horticultural Society held its twenty-second annual meeting in the historic city of Daytona, Volusia county. Quite a number of parties gath¬ 
ered at Daytona the day before the open¬ 
ing of the meeting as they wanted to be sure of good accommodations and enjoy the beach at Seabreeze and take in some of the attractions of Daytona before the meeting began. 

The place of meeting was in the Ar¬ 
mory and all of the sessions were well at¬ 
tended. The evening sessions were es¬ 
pecially well attended by the citizens of 
Daytona. In fact, the number of citi¬ 
zens turning out to the meetings was probably as large if not larger than at any place where a meeting has been held for years. The program was carried through with but little variation and all the time was taken up. For the lack of sufficient time some of the papers were simply accepted and ordered printed with the balance of the proceedings. 


The good ladies of Daytona entertained the lady members of the society at the 
Palmetto Club and all pronounced it a most enjoyable affair. The whole mem¬ 
bership of the Horticultural Society was treated to a boat ride to New Smyrna and an automobile ride from New Smyr¬ 
na to Daytona. It was hard to say which was the most enjoyable, and to cap the climax of good things the people of Day¬ 
tona assisted by the New Smyrna citi¬ 
zens gave a clam chowder lunch at the 
Ocean House. This House is noted for its clam chowder and on this occasion it nobly held up its reputation and those present had nothing but words of praise to utter. The members all expressed themselves as having a most enjoyable time and will remember their short stay with the good people of Daytona and 
New Smyrna with a great deal of pleas¬ 
ure. 

When the time for the next place of meeting was brought up, Orlando, Pa-

latka, and Jacksonville were the only places offering invitations and Orlando won, so that the next annual association meeting will be held in Orlando. Two previous meetings have been held in Or¬ 
lando and they were most enjoyable af¬ 


fairs and the next meeting is looked for¬ 
ward to with a great deal of pleasure. 

All of the members present enjoyed the lectures and addresses given by the Gov¬ 
ernment attaches, and hope that they will be with us each succeeding year.

Address of Welcome. 


By Mayor E. W. Greene. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It must be gratifying to the members of The Florida State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety to see so many gathered in atten¬ 
dance at this the opening meeting of the 
Twenty-second Annual gathering of this 
Society. It shows a marked and grow¬ 
ing interest in Horticulture throughout the State. 

I do not intend to occupy much of your time in a lengthy address of welcome for I know your time can be better spent in listening to addresses from more able speakers bearing on the subject more directly connected with the work of this 


association, but I want, on behalf of the citizens of Daytona to extend to the vis¬ 
iting members and friends a cordial wel¬ 
come and perfect freedom of the city dur¬ 
ing these meetings and after seeing the beauty and advantages which this section can offer, some of you, may wish to cast in your lot with us. To such I would say our welcome extends indefinitely. I 
hope the committee who have been in¬ 
trusted with your comfort have faithfully performed their duty and that your stay in our midst may be one of pleasure as well as profit to us all. 

Again I repeat, you are welcome and the freedom of the city is yours. 


RESPONSE TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 


By H. Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It has fallen to my lot to reply in brief to the kind words of welcome extended to us by the Mayor on behalf of Daytona. 

Your Honor, in replying, I beg to say to you that we appreciate your cordial words and if your words did not amply assure us, there is abundant proof that we are indeed welcome. We were met and taken charge of by a committee of your 


representative citizens when we alighted from the train and made to feel that we were at home. When a few of us sat down to a belated dinner today, we were promptly informed that we were subject to a fine of increased rates, if we did not partake amply of the food before us. The idea of being fed by compulsion was en¬ 
tirely new. In fact, in the many and va- 
ried experiences which all of us have had 1 ,

the rule has always been to put a premium upon eating sparingly. It must be the 
Daytona way. And this afternoon, I 
made note of a pair of horticulturists tres¬ 
passing perhaps, upon the property of one of your citizens. They had, judging from their actions, found something interest¬ 
ing and made themselves at home. They were not molested. Now, your Honor, 

I beg of you, should any of this body be brought before you for trespassing, deal leniently with them, they are harmless. 

We have seen many things worthy of note in your city. It is a city marked, 
and out of the ordinary, a city built in the woods, a city where the touch of na¬ 
ture in all its beauty has been left un¬ 
spoiled. Your Honor, you have here a city unique, a city with well paved and shady streets, restful in its simple natur¬ 
alness, a city of which you may well feel proud. 

And you may feel assured, your 
Honor, that you will find this society not at all backward in accepting of your kind hospitality. This body stands for the progress of horticulture in this state, if it stands for anything. It is interesting to note the way along which the way of progress has led. The parent horticul¬ 
tural industry of this state—orange growing—had its origin in hammocks on the banks of rivers, lakes and streams. 
The first problem confronting the grower of those earlier days was that of propa¬ 
gation—the task of bringing those wild sour groves into profitable producers of sweet, edible fruit. Then came an enor¬ 
mous amount of work with varieties, ac¬ 
companied by much costly introduction 


work. The problem of fertilizers became prominent and looking over the older volumes of our proceedings, you will find lengthy dissertations on muck and other harmless substances. Scale insects and fungous diseases claimed attention and the strife between sprayers and non- 
sprayers. The cold came and with it there came into being numerous other horti¬ 
cultural industries. Latent possibilities were developed and as a result our horti¬ 
culture became more diversified. More recently irrigation has become a question of importance, for we have learned, 
whether it rains or not, we must have water. The problems connected with the marketing of our products are now being agitated and out of the discussion good will come. And in all these years no old question has been or can be laid down for no problem connected with the growing plant can ever be permanently settled. Difficulties have been met as they arose, mastered in part and relegated to a place of secondary importance as some new one claimed attention. The path has not been an easy one, but it has been cheerfully traveled upward. You can feel certain, your Honor, that an as¬ 
sociation, with a history such as this, will not be backward in accepting your hos¬ 
pitality, for the way has not always fallen 

in such pleasant places. 

And when we leave, we trust that it will be with a feeling on your part that you are glad we came and we shall, I 
speak for the society, carry away with us pleasant remembrances of our brief so¬ 
journ with you. 




Address of the President. 


By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson. 


Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In accordance with the requirements of precedent and duty it devolves upon me as your president on this occasion to de¬ 
liver an address. 

A year ago when you unexpectedly elected me to the office of president, I was reposing in a pool of ambitionless lethargy. 
I told you at that time that I was unfitted for the place both by inclination and equipment, and that I did not feel quali¬ 
fied to discharge its onerous duties, how¬ 
ever your call was unanimous and in ac¬ 
cepting the office I did it fully aware of its responsibilities and with a high appre¬ 
ciation of its honors. 

I am very much of an optimist, not be¬ 
cause optimism is pleasant or fashionable, 
but because it is a prerequisite to all suc¬ 
cess and achievement. Optimism and hope nerve the weary toiler’s arm and in¬ 
spire the sinking heart to renewed effort and ultimate victory. 

As Horticulturalists we are so beset with difficulties, disappointments and temporary failures that I confess it re¬ 
quires a large and vigorous supply of op¬ 
timism to keep us from falling into de¬ 
spair and despondency. 

There are those who look to the past for their models; whatever has the haze of antiquity has for them peculiar charms. 
They think and speak a great deal of 
“the good old times.” And, when they look forward, it is with forebodings of evil and prophecies of disaster. 


The world in general, is making pro¬ 
gress, and is better to-day than in any century of the past. As an illustration, 
permit me to refer to the “labor ques¬ 
tion,” now agitating this great country from center to circumference. There is much of fallacy in argument, and ignor¬ 
ance of fact, apparent in the discussions of this subject by leading agitators and demagogs in the various political parties of our land. It is asserted that the con¬ 
dition of the laborer is becoming worse from generation to generation; that the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. The falsity of these statements will appear from even a slight acquaintance with history. The circum¬ 
stances of the poor are vastly better now than they were during the Middle Ages, 
or at any other period of the world. The laborer of our time wears finer clothes, 
sits down to a more sumptuous table, 
sleeps in a better ventilated and regulat¬ 
ed house than the former king and noble enjoyed. A faithful picture of the rags, 
the filth, the wretchedness, the stolid in¬ 
difference to manly aspirations, the ig¬ 
noble contentment with their very poverty and ignorance in which multitudes of poor people were once brought up, or rather allowed to struggle down to the grave, would doubtless astound many a grumbler, who is fond of exaggerating his own hard lot in comparison with that of his ancestors. “Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days were 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ntr 

l*o 


better than these? for thou dost not in¬ 
quire wisely concerning this.” 

In the irrepressible and seemingly never ending conflict between capital and labor, 
we the independent producers always and invariably get the worst of it. 

In point of numbers, including all those who are not affiliated with either class, 
we are largely in the majority, yet by our supineness we see our rights ignored and ruthlessly trampled upon by both sides of these contending forces. 

We are crushed and ground between the upper and nether millstones of ag¬ 
gressive dictatorial labor and tyrannous, 
oppressive capital. It is not merely a 
Kilkenny cat affair in which the combat¬ 
ants injure only themselves, but it is a deplorable and disastrous wrangle that in¬ 
volves the entire public. 

The solution and termination of this vexatious problem and cruelly ruinous struggle can not be left to the demagog and walking delegate, but the injured and long suffering, unbiased people themselves will finally be compelled to rise up in their strength and put an equitable and fair finish to this cruelly pitiful combat. 
The question naturally arises how do these people who are relatively only a small part of our population get such a powerful influence: the answer is sim¬ 
ple, it is because both capital and labor have their strong combinations and per¬ 
fect organizations. We too must organ¬ 
ize and combine before we can ever hope to wield much influence. 

It may be said that this is not a horti- 
culturalist’s question, but it seems to me that as horticulturalists and members of the body politic we are vitally interested in all questions of political economy and 


social welfare. The horticultural and agricultural population of our country is the leaven that converts the whole mass of the populace into a beneficient and glo¬ 
rious nationality. 

I believe in Evolution and Develop¬ 
ment, though not altogether as expounded by Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall and others. 
The element of progress runs like a gold¬ 
en chain through all the Universe of God: 
and nowhere does it sparkle with more refulgency than in the physical and ma¬ 
terial world—a realm to which the whole school of speculative philosophers have not lifted their eyes. The pessimistic un¬ 
believer in men, natural law and natural selection, has seen only half the truth,, 
or rather he has not seen half the truth.. 
Like an insect, which must be examined microscopically, he has seen only the smallest objects. 

The epoch in which we live is essenti¬ 
ally and emphatically a utilitarian age. 
The study of abstract science and specu¬ 
lative philosophy as a part of man’s edu¬ 
cation have like many other kinds of men¬ 
tal gymnastics been relegated to the rear and the demands of modern requirements insist on that kind of science and philos¬ 
ophy which can be put to immediate prac¬ 
tical and beneficial uses. 

Throughout all the past ages natural selection has played an important part in the evolution and development of all those horticultural products requisite to the sustenance of human life. At first these variations and survivals of the best and most useful fruits, grains, etc., were the result of sectional environment and climatic influences but later as man in¬ 
creased in intelligence and experience, he took a hand in the matter and has so as- 



24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sisted nature that results most prodigous and startling have been attained. 

Man’s first efforts were along the lines of careful selection of the best seeds, un¬ 
scientific fertilization and indifferent cul¬ 
tivation, later, grafting, budding, cross- 
pollenization, etc., were practiced and at the present day some of the results of man’s experiments along these lines are so marvelous and rapid as to be quite in¬ 
credible. 

The modern horticulturalist has by a judicious selection of variations* otherwise known as “sports and freaks,’' given us the luscious peach as a development from the scanty, bitter husk and large seed of the wild almond; wheat and other valu¬ 
able grains by a selection of variations in wild grasses. 

The strawberry has by careful selection been developed from an insignificant bunch of leaves into one of our most de¬ 
licious fruits, and now we learn that among the latest things in this kind of evolution is the production of a large, lus¬ 
cious, edible cactus, as much ahead of the kind that the Mexicans have for genera¬ 
tions been harvesting for their markets as the present magnificent tomatoes of our gardens are superior to those thought to be unfit to eat if not poisonous only some fifty or sixty years ago. We might go on with examples of this character, 
but enough has been said to show that the possibilities of this kind of evolution are almost absolutely limitless. 

It sometimes seems that the forces of nature combine with man in a determined assault on our welfare. No sooner have we met and vanquished the ill effects of 
'cold, drouth, lack of fertility, insect and other pests than we are beset by human 


or rather inhuman enemies who seek to rob us of our well earned success, through fraudulent markets, swindling buyers, 
robber transportation companies, trusts and combines. 

There are evils so vast in their propor¬ 
tions and so fortified by position and wealth, that to assail them seems to the eye of sense to be madness and folly. 
These combinations belong to this class of evils. The longer one studies their nature and all permeating extent, the more conversant he becomes with their results, the more he is persuaded that no tongue, however eloquent, can describe, 
and no pen, however graphic, can portray a tithe of their evils. To exaggerate is impossible. As John Wesley said of sla¬ 
very, I would say of this: “It is the sum of all villainies.” 

The discussion of their oppression is hindered by the difficulty—in a sense, the hopelessness—of the undertaking. They are defiant and laugh our puny efforts to scorn. Their conquests and despotisms have continued over a period of lo these many years, and we almost despair. 

Let us remember, however, that while the storms of adversity, the fierce strug¬ 
gles for rights, the crushing of worthy ambitions, the bitterness of disappoint¬ 
ment, the gloom of despair, all affect the mental as well as the physical life; and that in some cases disaster is complete; 
nevertheless to the cheerful, optimistic mind there comes reaction, relief and final victory through determined, persis¬ 
tent and well directed work. 

In our successful efforts to extract from the soil its richest and best pro¬ 
ducts, we have through selfish, individual effort fenced ourselves in with a wall of

almost seclusive isolation, shutting out our neighbors and fellow workers. While we have been doing this all those others with whom we are compelled to deal, 
Aave combined among themselves and with each other for aggressive mutual benefit. The fertilizer industries, the transportation lines, the commission con¬ 
cerns and the buyers; all and each have their well organized systems of doing business without encountering ruinous competition, and are reaping golden har¬ 
vests of profit. With us lack of any and all organized methods of mutual co-oper¬ 
ation in making our requisite purchases of materials and commodities necessary to our operations, and in the ruinous, fool¬ 
ish competitive manner of marketing our crops, have led to a point where our la¬ 
bors are not only unremunerative but de¬ 
structive of all gains. We have met and vanquished the evil influences of earth and air and it now behooves us to buckle on our armor and meet these last foes. 
The result can not be uncertain, our forces are now gathering and when we make a united and concerted effort, wc must and shall come out victorious. 

u Let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate.” 

We are altogether to blame ourselves for the deplorable conditions now existent which bear down on us with such oppres¬ 
sive weight. If we would only give a little part of the time to the cultivation of mutual interests that we do to the cultivation of the soil we would soon get such results that our gains might be com¬ 
mensurate with our desires. 

Man is a gregarious creature and when¬ 
ever he attempts to flock by himself, he invariably makes a dismal failure. What 


we need and must have is mutual com¬ 
binations of our entire producing inter¬ 
ests, so that we can go unitedly into the markets and demand fair prices for pro¬ 
ducts and transportation. Our neighbors in California have in a most signal way succeeded in combining their mutual in¬ 
terests so that they are realizing splen¬ 
did returns for their products, and this too, without curtailing or interfering with individual rights. What they have done, 
we can do with such modifications of their system as may be requisite to our situation. 

Co-operative efforts have frequently failed, but usually this has come about through a too strong communistic ten¬ 
dency in the details. Co-operative move¬ 
ments and organizations where individual rights have been fundamental and re¬ 
spected have nearly always succeeded. 

Let us at once combine together in a final herculean effort to get redress and justice. If we do this intelligently we can not fail. 

Upon occasions like the present, active, 
conscientious thinkers and workers nat¬ 
urally fall into a line of thought and med¬ 
itation, having reference to the flight of time and opportunity; the dead past, the living present, the unborn future. The dead past with all its memories, whether prosperous or adverse, can give us only the unalterable lessons of example and experience; the living present we seize with avidity, in an eager strife to make it as a past an improvement upon that which may have preceded it; the unborn future we ardently hope may prove a vast improvement upon both the present and the past. It is probably a wise provision

of our mental and moral constitution, 
that— 

“Hope springs eternal in the human breast; 

Man never is, but always to be blessed.” 

Today, while standing upon the narrow niche of ever fleeing time we peer back into the sepulchral portals of the buried past; 
and while ardently wishing it had been better, we, as it were, simultaneously hope, work and pray that the womb of the future, with all its unborn progeny, 
may have something better in store for us. 

Results in life are largely, very large¬ 
ly, what we make them in the exercise of industry, wisdom and sagacity. Accident and chance as factor in results, are but flimsy excuses or pretexts to cloak our ignorance, stupidity and failures. 

In the preparation of this address mat¬ 
ters purely and essentially horticultural have not had that prominence which has usually been customary, but as an offset to this, those who are in charge of the several committees and the authors of the various papers will give us a feast of knowledge and detail along horticultural highways, and byways that will make up for the deficiency. 

If I have touched questions of public interest in certain directions it has been 


because I feel that these questions are live wires charged with dangers that menace our welfare and I trust that the voicing of my personal sentiments may not be misunderstood or misconstrued. 

In conclusion, let us all work earnestly and faithfully to make this gathering one long to be remembered as one fruit¬ 
ful in good things, beneficial alike to every member of the Society, and to the cause of Horticulture. Let us in our dis¬ 
cussions, give up freely the treasures of personal experience; let each bring forth his little or much, to strengthen his broth¬ 
er and give him will, force and self-re¬ 
liance in his daily struggles. 

Finally may each and everyone of us live to a ripe old age in harmony with the last words of the great Victor Hugo, 
“Winter is on my head and eternal spring is in my heart. The nearer I approach the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. For half a century I have been writing my thoughts in prose, verse, his¬ 
tory, philosophy, drama, romance, tradi¬ 
tion, satire, ode, song; I have tried all. 
But I feel I have not said the thousandth part of what is in me. My work is only a beginning. The thirst for infinity proves infinity.”
