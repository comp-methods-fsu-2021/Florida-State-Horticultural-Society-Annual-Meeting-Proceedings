Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth
Annual Meeting of the Florida
State Horticultural Society


The twenty-sixth annual meeting of the Florida State Horticultural Society convened in DeLand, April 29, and even during the early sessions of the conven¬
tion it was believed that we would have a record-breaking attendance, and this belief was fulfilled later on, when the register showed a larger number of members in attendance than at any pre¬
vious meeting of the Society.

The sessions of the Society were held in the comfortable and commodious op¬
era house, and the entertainment and re¬
ception committees of the various city organizations did everything in their power to contribute to the comfort and pleasure of the members of the Society,
and make them feel at home.

Numerous excursions to nearby points of interest, the famous DeLeon Springs,
the St. Johns River at Beresford, and other places were made, and hundreds of automobiles were placed at the disposal of the members of the Society for drives through the beautifully shaded streets of the ‘‘Athens of Florida.”

The President and faculty of the John


B. Stetson University entertained the
Society with a musical and dramatic en¬
tertainment in the spacious auditorium of the University. The Music Department of the institution and the Department of
Dramatic Art contributed largely to the pleasure of the guests.

At this annual meeting the usual num¬
ber of interesting papers were read, cov¬
ering topics of general interest, and these papers brought out in a greater degree than heretofore interesting and profitable discussions.

The compilers of this Report have en¬
deavored to preserve and reproduce a very large portion of these discussions,
realizing that many valuable points and a great deal of information is received by the general discussions of the papers,
we have been careful in the preparation of this section. In a large body it is very difficult to preserve and to record all of the discussions, and the compilers wish to explain to the members who may have taken part in the various discussions,
and whose remarks are not recorded in the book, that the omission is not on ac-








16


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


count of a lack of value of their remarks,
but simply, that it is not possible to record every detail of the discussions.

The Crop Pest Bill, which is of vital interest and importance to our horticul¬
turists, likewise received the careful con¬
sideration of the members, and the bill as submitted was approved and endorsed,
and action taken to present the views and wishes of the horticulturists of Florida to the members of the State Legislature and National Congress.

The addresses of welcome and the re¬
sponses were gems of rhetoric, and cor¬
dially expressed the hospitality on the one hand and grateful recognition on the oth¬
er.

The usual spirited contest over the place of the next annual meeting develop¬
ed during the last session of the meet¬


ings. There were three entries in the race: Arcadia, Gainesville, and Palatka,
each of them being fortified with cordial invitations from their municipal organi¬
zations, boards of trade, etc., and the claims of the respective places were ably presented by logical speakers. The ques¬
tion was decided by a majority vote, and
Palatka won the race by a safe majority.

The preparation of the Year Book for many years past has been the work of our late Secretary, Mr. E. O. Painter. His untimely death occurred before he had completed the work of compilation, and hence it was necessary for the work to be finished by others. We have done the best possible under the circumstances,
and crave the kind indulgence of our members for any omissions that may be noted.


Addresses of Welcome and Responses


ON BEHALF OF THE CITY BUSINESS MEN’S LEAGUE


Arthur E. Douglass


Mr. President, Members of the Horti¬
cultural Society, Ladies and Gentle¬
men :

It is indeed a privilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity of welcoming an organization that for twenty-six succes¬
sive years has continued its work and prospered in it all. Your Society is to be congratulated, not alone for the work of the past, but upon the present pros¬
pects and those of the future.

I remember some time since—if I were to tell you how long ago you would know how old I anr—I used to hear dis¬
paraging remarks with reference to those who had an interest in the things of the soil, and I am glad that the time has come when there is a full recognition of the relations between the business world and those who are closely allied to Na¬
ture and enjoy the privileges that they alone can enjoy. I suppose I am in a better position to judge of the privileges
Nature affords, having been born and bred on a small farm of two hundred acres, where I learned something of the opportunities there afforded, experienced something of the training and discipline which permitted me later to endure the


hard work demanded in an overburdened profession.

!l do believe there is not only a great work to be accomplished, but there will be a full recognition in the years to come of the great work that is being done by the people on the farms and among the groves. May that time hasten when the value of the work which you are doing may be more fully realized; when all may realize that there is nothing worth while if the work being done by you is eliminated.

I want to say in behalf of the Business
Man’s Organization of this little city that they recognize, in some measure, at least,
the value of the work that is being done by those about them, and I want to wel¬
come you to our business places and as¬
sure you when you come you will find a hearty welcome and warm handshake.
We will be pleased to make your ac¬
quaintance; we will be glad to let you know something about the things of this place, and we hope to make your stay something of a pleasure.

More than this, I wish to say that you will find in our town an opportunity to go to the rooms of the Woodmen of the
World in the Dreka building, and




18


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


the Ladies’ Club of this city will be glad to welcome you, especially the ladies among you, where you will find an op¬
portunity to rest, an opportunity to write letters and chat, and we hope you will avail yourselves of it.

I also wish to call attention to the fact that our reading room is open, and you will have an opportunity to sit there and read or attend to correspondence.


More than this, I want to say that the business men of DeLand give you the heartiest kind of welcome; not mere¬
ly as a matter of words, but as I have known them the last two and a half years, in a matter of deeds and actions.
Though I am a comparative stranger among them, I know you will go a long way before you will find a group of men more ready to give a hearty welcome than those of the city of DeLand.


RESPONSE BY L. B. SKINNER


I want to say that I myself have al¬
ready had the practical assurance of this hearty welcome of which Mr. Douglass speaks. I wanted to telephone very bad¬
ly a few minutes ago and rushed into a place and asked them if I could use their telephone. The man said, “Yes, every¬
thing we have is free this week.” (Laugh¬
ter.)

Speaking of little cities: If you want to see a real little city, you ought to come to Dunedin. It is a gem. We have some things in common with you. We have oaks, the most beautiful oaks. I
notice you pride yourselves upon your oaks, and you have reason to do so. The first thing I saw were your beautiful av¬
enues. In speaking of DeLand, my brother spoke of the avenues of oaks,
so you see your fame has spread abroad.
Dunedin is called the Little City of Oaks on the West Coast.

We of the West Coast enjoy coming to the East Coast. Last year we jour¬
neyed to Miami; the year before we went


to Orlando, to Jacksonville, to Gaines¬
ville, to Daytona; we have gone all over the State. I do not know where we will go next time. But one thing that strikes me, is the pleasure afforded by these lit¬
tle jouyneys over the State. I don’t know when I have enjoyed anything as much as Miami last year, and I know a great many others enjoyed it, too, be¬
cause more of you have come to DeLand than went to Miami. I know we would regret missing these meetings, not only for the meetings themselves, but meeting each other. We would not miss making the acquaintance of the business men of
DeLand—in a free way. (Laughter.) I
don’t know how they would be in a bus¬
iness proposition. The business men get a great deal out of the orange growers,
there is no mistake about that. I have noticed down our way that we work like everything, and then turn what we have over to the business men. We do all we can to make them happy. (Laughter).

This spirit of rivalry for the location

of the next place of meeting is a fine thing. Some of the discussions we have,
and some of the word battles we have,
are really interesting. It keeps us from getting too settled in our ways. It re¬
minds me of the Scotch couple who had lived together peacefully for their long married life. The husband was boasting that they had never had a quarrel and turned to his wife for her corroboration

“Yes,” she said, with a sigh, “it has been peaceful, but oor dull.”

If you want to see some heated discus¬
sions, I have no doubt we will have them this meeting, because I can see the pot boiling already. It is going to be ex¬
citing.

For a great many years this Society met, one year after another, without very much result. Perhaps I should not make


it that plain, but a number of people came to these meetings and dozed most peacefully through the reading 'of the papers, and went off home with no en¬
thusiasm and possibly not much gained knowledge. But the minute we got some discussions in, things began to happen.
I imagine at this meeting there will be discussions that will keep people awake.

When I first came to this country, I
met an old Florida “representative” who seemed to be badly worn out. I asked him what was the matter. He said he had hunted hogs for five days success¬
fully and never found a one. This So¬
ciety has met for twenty-six years, and I
leave you to judge results. This is the best looking crowd of orange growers,
or any kind of people, I ever saw at one of our meetings before.


ON BEHALF OF THE TOWN OF DELAND AND STETSON

UNIVERSITY


Dr. Lincoln Hulley


Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen :

On behalf of the Mayor of the city,
Mr. S. A. Wood, I extend to all of you a very cordial welcome to the city on this occasion. There is really no need for me to speak on behalf of the Mayor.
He has an idea, however, that on public occasions like this he should keep out of it. Last week he was elected the Presi¬
dent of the State Bankers’ Association,
and when led to the platform to make a speech accepting the honor, his remarks were so straight to the point and so lucid


that a banker sitting beside me said,
“That man is going to be a good presid¬
ing officer; he is clear and right to the point.” So there is no need in my speak¬
ing on behalf of the Mayor. But on his behalf, and on behalf of the City Council,
I extend to you a welcome.

But there is no need of speaking on behalf of the City Council. They also can speak for themselves, and on occa¬
sion they do it.

Then on behalf of the citizens of De-
Land I extend a welcome to vou. But

J




20


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


there is no need of speaking on behalf

of the citizens, for each and every one

will speak to you for themselves while

you are here. One of the merchants has
•*

already spoken as recounted by the speak¬
er just before, and he voices the feelings of the citizens, one and all.

Then on behalf of the Trustees of the
University, I desire to extend to you a welcome. Now, it is hardly necessary to speak in their behalf; a good many of them are members of your organiza¬
tion. For instance, there is H. B. Stev¬
ens. He is a member of the Board of
Trustees of the University and, I think,
an officer in your Society. Then there is Mr. Painter, your Secretary. You have come to the home of Mr. Painter.
He is always at home here. There is hardly a house, certainly none among the older citizens of this place, where he is not welcome. I tried to get him to take dinner with me tomorrow, but I guess
I am too late. It looks as though his slate is already filled.

Some of you are strangers in the city of DeLand. Let me assure you that you are welcome. In olden times, when ene¬
mies were numerous, they had to mass the people in a limited area and then throw a wall around the occupied area and set a watch against the intruders and invaders. There would be one or two or more gates through which entrance into the town or city could be made,
which could be closed and locked against their enemies. So when the people want¬
ed to show deference and confidence in a distinguished and loved guest, they would present to them the keys to the gates of the city. We, of course, can not do this


now, except figuratively speaking, But in the same spirit we present to you the keys of the city, and I extend to you a welcome on the part of the citizens and of the University. The students of the
University will speak for themselves to¬
rn 01 row evening, when you are to be their guests, and they are going to recite for you and sing for you and try to show you a good time generally.

So, on behalf of the Trustees of the
University, its faculty and its students,
as well as the Mayor, the Town Council and the citizens of DeLand, I extend to you a very cordial welcome.

Now, I am going to extend to you a welcome on the part of members of the Association who live opt over this county. All the growers throughout the county are part of us here at DeLand.
This is the county seat, and they come here for business in various ways, and in their behalf I wish to extend to you a generous and cordial welcome.

As I go about this beautiful State and visit the cities and towns in which you reside, I cannot help but marvel at the growing possibilities of Florida. This whole country is but comparatively re¬
cently discovered, and see what has been done in this hemisphere in the last four hundred years. And Florida has belong¬
ed to the United States only since 1819;
not a full century. We have not had possession of it a hundred years, and see what it has become. People believed at one time it did not belong to anything but alligators and razor-back hogs, but now the finest people all over these United
States come here to make their homes.

I am impressed with the variety of the

output of Florida. Last week, coming through the Hastings region, I looked out on either side of the car, before reaching Hastings, and after we left there, and saw the whole region being put under cultivation. I saw that 78,000
barrels of potatoes were grown in the
Hastings region this past year. What a tremendous crop!

If you go to Sanford, the Celery City
—what an output there is from there!
Then down around Fort Pierce; do you see the acreage given over to the culti¬
vation of the pineapple? Go a little fur¬
ther down and you see the tomato plants grown in the crevices of the coral rock.

Over in Webster they grow 'cucum¬
bers ; in Manatee you see lettuce; in
Plant City, strawberries; in Quincy, the specialty is tobacco; around Tampa, you find oranges; in other parts of the State you find sea island cotton, or Long Is¬
land cotton, I don’t know what it is.
(Laughter.) And every other section of the State has its specialty.

Now, my friends, on behalf of the growers whose welcome I am extending to you this evening, I want to say in this favored county of Volusia, we grow all these things. (Laughter and applause.)
Go out and ask John Alden, who courted
Priscilla; he can grow anything on his place.

RESPONSE BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS


Mr. Chairman , Ladies and Gentlemen :

“Early to bed, and early to rise,
Read your Bible, and advertise.”—
(Laughter and applause.)

Dr. Hulley, I thank you very much for the very hearty welcome you have ex¬
tended to the Horticultural Society. De-
Land, you know, is the Athens of Flori¬
da, and we are especially happy to get to this Athens. We have tried a great many times, but you know we could not quite make up our minds. We have tried it several times, and almost got here, but just missed it a little bit. Now, I can tell you how sorry we are we did not


come all the way. This time we did come all the way, and we are very glad of it.

We are glad to have discussions, and in the past have had all sorts of ques¬
tions excepting those touching upon poli¬
tics and mercantile ventures. The last time we shaved pretty close to it, because the President said we were discussing what he thought might be termed by some a mercantile venture, but I believe he was overruled. However, we got along all right.

As our friend Mr. Skinner said, we are to have some interesting discussions this




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


23


time, and I know for that reason we are glad to be in a peaceable community such as we find here at DeLand.

DeLand is justly proud of that great institution, Stetson University. I have visited it repeatedly, and always been welcomed. It is a model institution. I
hope none of our Society will leave De-
Land until they have at least visited many of its departments and various rooms there in the University. It will be well worth your while.

We find our welcome here to be es¬
pecially warm, and I hope it will not be


long until we make up our minds to come back to DeLand. It is a most pleasant place, and we can spend our time here profitably. Not only are we welcome on occasions like this; we are welcomed individually as well, and I want to thank you for extending to us the hearty welcome you have given us to¬
night.

Mr. Chairman, I believe I will say nothing further in this connection, but
I wish to thank the gentleman again for his hearty welcome to our Asso¬
ciation.


President’s Annual Address


H. Harold Hume


Members of the Florida State Horticul¬
tural Society , Ladies and Gentlemen :

Geography is an interesting study, a study of lands and seas and what grows thereon and therein, of tides and waves and winds, and sun and moon, of vege¬
tation zones and isothermal lines, of peo¬
ples, manners, customs, of commerce and its ways. But most of us passed our ge¬
ography examinations long ago, and promptly proceeded to forget most of it,
as is the way with children, young and old. Though we have all dreamed dreams of people and things remote, our ideas of how these are related to us, of how they do or may touch us intimately is still too frequently a hazy dream.

Now, with me tonight, I want you to go back to the desk in the little country school house, or to the box or shelf where the old and worn school books are carefully packed away. We will get out that well-thumbed, dog-eared school at¬
las, very carefully and very reverently,
that we may not disturb the dreams that still linger between its musty pages, and we'll open it where you and I first open¬
ed it perchance, at the map of the world.

Over on the western side of the West¬
ern Hemisphere we will begin our lesson,
and locate Seattle, Portland, San Fran¬
cisco, Los Angeles, then southward along


the coast of Mexico, but we shall not stop there, southward still and across the narrow neck of land called Panama.
Then northward along the eastern coast and again we pass by Mexico, for we shall not stop there. A pall overhangs the land, the pall of internal strife, so northward still and around the coast of our own land again and we note Galves¬
ton, Houston, Port Arthur, New Or¬
leans, Mobile, Pensacola, Tampa, Key
West, Jacksonville and Savannah. Along trip! Why have we made it? Have you not noticed that in all these coast cities and towns, that channels are being deep¬
ened, obstructions removed, basins en-
larged, docks increased in size and num¬
ber, terminal facilities improved, rail¬
roads constructed, and that there are ac¬
tivities of all sorts connected with the commerce of the sea? Money has been,
or will be, spent like the very water that washes their water fronts, millions upon millions of it. And again why?

The why is the Panama Canal. And this canal, our canal, though other ships will use it more than ours, is the cause of many movements in our present changing order of things. The eyes of the world are on it, the nations of the ut¬
termost parts are preparing to use it. The dream of America's discoverers is about



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


25


to come true, the westward passage to
China. The Hamburg American line is preparing for ten steamers per month through “Panama to the Orient,” The
Italian Government has heavily subsi¬
dized steamship lines for South American trade via Panama. Great Britain with her ships like unto the stars of Heaven is always ready. Japan, already almost in control of the Pacific Ocean commerce,
will have three steamer lines from Japan through Panama direct to New York.
All these and many more are preparing to take the utmost advantage of the new water way. The warfare of today, all about us, is the warfare of commerce.
Let us look up all these places in our old school atlas and also note besides the location of Australia and Hawaii, and
North Africa and Spain, France and It¬
aly, Bermuda and Mexico. Now take one general memory-fixing glance of the world today and the routes of trade and close the book.

This old world is much as it was when we studied it years ago, much as it was when it came into being as the result of gigantic forces under the guidance of a
Master Mind. It has been modified, it is true, by the never resting forces of nature, though these modifications are small as applied to the earth as a whole.
But in another way it is not the same world, for man has stepped in, the Amer¬
ican people, and with the digging of a huge ditch, the course of the sea trade of the whole world will be in a large measure altered, and for Florida, what?
We shall see in our harbors more strange flags, at our docks more strange ships,
and in our streets strange faces and


strange tongues. Commerce will flow into and through this State as never be¬
fore. In this commerce in greater or less quantities there will be new fruits from new sources and old ones from old sources, all delivered on new ocean high¬
ways direct at our doors. New seeds,
new plants, new shrubs and new trees will come. Besides and in addition to this, the reduction in tariff will bring in more fruits and more plants than ever before. If it does not, the bill will fail in its purpose.

The time is here when the fruit and vegetable growers and every individual who is interested directly or indirectly in the agricultural wealth of this State should wake up to the conditions by which we are confronted.

With the fruits and plants that come,
new insects will come for fruits and plants and insect pests travel together. It is a broad statement, but do you know that every serious insect that attacks our or¬
ange and grapefruit trees is a foreign in¬
sect, and a very large proportion of our most serious pests of vegetable and farm crops are also foreign insects. Do you consider the whitefly to be a serious pest? Or the purple scale, or the long-
scale, or the chaff scale, or the mealy bug? Or does the cotton farmer look upon the cotton stainer or the boll wee¬
vil as his friends? And do you think it an exaggeration that insect pests and plant diseases in this State levy annual toll on our crops in excess of one-third of their value? Or would it be nearer right to say in excess of forty per cent., or even fifty per cent. Whatever the amount it is enormous, it is a tax of millions of


26


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


dollars annually, all due to the attacks of insects and diseases, most of which are not natives, and which with proper care might have been kept out.

Do we want more? Have all the in¬
jurious ones been introduced and have they gained a foothold? By no means.
Let me say with all the emphasis I pos¬
sess, “There are insects in other lands,
which our conditions exactly suit, and which if introduced would in the enor¬
mous damage they are capable of doing,
make us forget the ravages of those we now have, serious though they may be.” •

Do we want the Mediterranean fruit-
fly, an insect now present in North Afri¬
ca, in Spain, in France, in Sicily, in
South Africa, Australia, the Azores,
Brazil, Hawaii, Bermuda and other parts of the world? An insect so general in its attacks that it infests egg plants, pep¬
pers, tomatoes, pumpkins, beans, or¬
anges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, kum-
quats, figs, peaches, plums, mangoes,
pineapples, loquats, avocados and guavas.
In fact, it is very nearly, if not quite,
true that it infests every fruit in which we are interested. In Spain, it is a safe rule to eat no fruit in the dark. Pick up a luscious peach or fig, beautiful outside,
inside a putrid mass of maggots. And one box of Sicily lemons landed in Tam-
pa or Key West might infest the whole
State. Yes, even one infested fruit of any kind. That you may know this is no visionary statement let it be pointed out that Bermuda was infested by fruit ship¬
ped from the Mediterranean to New
York. Owing to a storm the vessel was driven to the Bermuda Islands, where the cargo was unloaded. Every fruit


crop in Bermuda has been infested since,
and that was many years ago. Again this insect was introduced into Australia in oranges from Italy. It is regarded as one of the most serious j^ests in every country where it is established. Its con¬
trol is absolutely a hopeless undertaking,
and judging from the way in which it is distributed it is able to establish itself and to work untold harm not only in Florida,
but throughout the whole Southeastern
States.

Do we want the red scale of Spain?
An insect which we have not and which is able to live on so many broad leaved evergreens that its control in this State would be a matter of extreme difficulty.
In Spain orchards infested are in a most serious condition.

Would we like the Morelos orange fruit worm or Mexican orange maggot?
If we would there are plenty of them in
Mexico.

Do we want the Mango Weevil? It is in Hawaii and other countries, and it is quite capable of making the journey to
Florida if given the chance to come in.

Do we want the sugar cane borer or the Argentine ant? They are already established in Louisiana, and we can easily have them with us.

We probably got the San Jose scale from Japan. There are a few more in¬
sects there that are able to add greatly to our present insect troubles.

This enumeration of insect pests which may easily find their way into Florida might be greatly extended. Even in
California and other States there are some we do not want, but enough has been said to emphasize the danger to


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


27


which we are exposed under the new con¬
ditions of trade.

Nonsense, some one will say, these in¬
sects are so far away, these countries are so remote, it is not worth while troubling about these things. But do not forget that this old world is growing smaller and smaller every day. It took seventy days for Columbus to make his memora¬
ble voyage in 1492, but now you can walk down Bay street, in Jacksonville,

later stand by his tomb in the cathedral at Seville, Spain. No, no,
these places are not remote, and they are coming closer every day.

Why are these insects not here? The avenues of travel have been indirect and the traffic has acted as somewhat of a barrier, and Providence has been kind,
but at the same time enough have arrived through one channel or another to make us shudder at the thought of more.

But the time has come for us to act swiftly and forcefully. It will not do to sit idly by with folded hands and ac¬
cept what may come to us. “Providence helps only those who help themselves.’’
As a rule, insects are not eradicated after they are introduced, and it is easier to prevent their entrance than to attempt their eradication or pay their perennial toll. Get up and act.

Before the Legislature there is now


and nine days


pending the crop pest bill of this Society.
Have you any influence? Use it. It is your duty for the interest of the State.
Do not let this session of the Legislature adjourn without making this bill a law.
Our Legislators are in sympathy with us if we let them know our will.


DISCUSSION.

Mr. Griffing: We have just listened to the most interesting and instructing ad¬
dress of our President, and it is well worth the trip to DeLand just to have heard that alone. You will notice in this report he calls attention to these dangers which confront us, and he offers a sug¬
gestion that members of this Society act,
and appeal to our Legislature, and to our
Representatives in Congress. Therefore,
I deem it wise to make a motion that the
Secretary of the Society be instructed to appoint a committee of three to consider our President’s address and suggest res¬
olutions to be acted upon by the Society as they may think expedient. I offer this as a motion for the Society..

Motion seconded and carried, and the
Secretary appointed as the committee C.
M. Griffin, Jacksonville; G. M. Waker-
lin, Tavares; T. R. Robinson, Terra
Ceia.



Introduction of the Question Box


E. O. Painter, Secretary.


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

Sometimes the box has been too small to contain all the questions asked. So this time I prepared one capable of hold¬
ing all the questions.

'.Please bear in mind that any one who wishes to ask a question on an agricul¬
tural topic can do so. We know there are a good many farmers and horticultu¬
rists who are not able to get up and give their experiences before an audience. If any one wants to ask a question on the floor, he has that privilege, or if he has stage fright so bad he can’t talk at all before an audience, he can drop the writ¬
ten question in the box. The questions may be answered from the floor; if not,
an effort will be made to answer them in the proceedings. You are all welcome to patronize the box with whatever ques¬
tions may be of general interest.

Sometimes things happen that are not laid down in the program. It may be a little out of order, but I am now going to take a little privilege as Secretary.

I have been a member of this Society ever since it was organized; in fact, look¬
ing at the list, I find there are only two other charter members alive today—Mr.
Gaitskill and Mr. Hart—besides myself.

So far, I am the only representative here of that number.

Under ordinary circumstances I would


not have said anything, but we are com¬
ing here to my home town—the place where I came nearly tairty-seven years ago. As I look over this audience
I see many familiar faces; faces that I
used to know in knee dresses—why not in knee dresses? They used to run around in knee dresses before they got them longer.

Mr. Connor: No boys in that crowd?

*Mr. Painter: I have not finished yet.
Shall I say, the boys in knee skirts?
Some of the grown men I see here I have seen in knee skirts. The boys and girls of my early days I now see around here with gray hair; some of them are in my own head—the gray hairs, I mean.

(Laughter.)

I have always stood up for DeLand as one of the best places in the whole State of Florida: They say it is a poor crow that won’t croak for its own nest. I am glad to stand before you tonight and say (that in all (the twenty-five annual meetings of the Horticultural Society I
have never seen as fine and large and en¬
thusiastic gathering at the opening meet-
a s is here tonight. Therefore, my heart is proud of the Horticultural Socie¬
ty, and it is proud that I have had a part in making it as it is. When we go back twenty-five years—it doesn’t seem long to look back over that length of time,



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


29


but looking ahead it seems a long, long time.

If anyone had told me when I first came here that I would stand on this rostrum at this time, I would have thought that they wehe crazy, because when I first came here I concluded I
would stay just long enough to get away,
but the longer I stayed the better I liked it. After I stayed three years I left, and shook the dust off my feet, but it was


only three months before I came back and shook it on again.

I am glad to be here and welcome the
Horticultural Society to my home town,
and I want to say to the people of De-
Land that I am proud of you for the re¬
ception you have given us. As I said before, I want to repeat, I am proud of the Horticultural Society, and I am proud of DeLand and the people in it.
(Applause.)
