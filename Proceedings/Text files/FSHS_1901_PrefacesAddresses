OPENING ADDRESS.


The address of welcome by Mayor E.
E. Boyce, of St. Augustine, was a char¬
acteristic bit of sturdy and independent
American officialism, voicing the kindly and sincere hospitality which intelligent
American communities entertain toward the tillers of the soil. The welcome of
St. Augustine was aptly typified by the enormous palm boughs with which the hall had been ornamented, spreading far out overhead like the arches of a ca¬
thedral—decorous, stately, free from all the evanescent effects of perishable flowers—an old-time courtly hospitality well befitting the Ancient City. Mayor
Boyce said, among other things:

“To this old city, with all its historic associations we welcome you most cor¬


dially. We extend to you the warmest hospitalities of our homes and our hearthstones. We trust that while you are here you will feel that the perfect freedom of the city is open to you, and,
as the representative of the people of St.
Augustine, I extend to you, Mr. Presi¬
dent, and to you, gentlemen of the Hor¬
ticultural Society, the freedom and the hospitality of St. Augustine, trusting that you will avail yourselves of one and enjoy the other, that in years to come,
when you look back to the first meeting of the twentieth century, you will pro¬
nounce it the most pleasurable and prof¬
itable in the annals of the State Horti¬
cultural Society of Florida. ”


THE SOCIETY'S RESPONSE.


On behalf of the Society, Mr. C. T.
McCarty, with only a few minutes' prep¬
aration, speaking in place of another,
rose to a fine touch of eloquence. He said in part:

“It occurs to me that he must be dull indeed who, with the history of three and a half centuries surrounding him, were not able to rise to such an occasion as this. And what is represented by these three and a half centuries? Havoc and war have disappeared, and nature has


reached the zenith of power and grandeur.

“The United States of America, of which we are justly proud, has risen from a small settlement on the remote peninsula of Florida to one of the leading nations on earth. Ladies and gentlemen of St. Augustine, we feel that you are indeed fortunate in your homes, in your surroundings, having about you the place where the first city in America found its permanent home.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


I feel it on behalf of the Society my duty as well as my pleasure to say that we are keenly alive to the beauties that sur¬
round you; and in passing, I cannot fail to say a word for our stricken sister city, now in ashes. Among the great disastrous fires that have visited many,
we have been the unfortunate sufferer from one in our own State. Few can realize it. Many years ago I saw the ruins of the city of Chicago, one of the


greatest calamities in the history of the world. We to-day mourn the loss of the city which is perhaps second only in magnitude to that proportionately. We assure the people of Jacksonville that they have our deepest sympathy. We have eaten salt and broken bread with them; we have enjoyed most keenly on many occasions their hospitality. We expect to enjoy ourselves equally keenly in the city of St. Augustine.”


President's Annual Address.


GEORGE L. TABER.


Members of the Florida State Horticul¬
tural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen:

On a fateful Friday a little less than three weeks ago the wires carried throughout the length and breadth of the land the dire news that the city of
Jacksonville was in flames. The next day some of us drove for hours over fallen wires, cluttering brick and other unburnable debris, through smoking ruins of what had been the fairest resi¬
dence and most prosperous business portions of the Gate City to Florida.

The time for our Horticultural So¬
ciety meeting had been set for May 21
to 24. Hotel accommodations had been arranged ; transportation had been secured. We were to convene at the beautiful Board of Trade rooms in Jack¬
sonville. But now with her largest ho¬
tels vanished into thin air, her Board of
Trade building, opera house and other convention places but unsightly piles of


brick and mortar, what should we do;
what ought we to do?

A hasty conference of some of our of¬
ficers and members resulted in the decis¬
ion that the meeting should still be held in Jacksonville, provided it could be ac¬
complished in a way that would prove beneficial to Jacksonville but not other¬
wise. In times past we had been wel¬
comed there as guests. We had par¬
taken of the bread and salt of a city noted throughout the country for its generous hospitality. Fortune had been kind to some of us during the past year, and perhaps some of us, viewing the ruin wrought, would feel minded to contribute toward the necessities of those with whom fortune had dealt less kindly; we would at least leave in the city some of the dollars that trade and hotel bills imply, and we would recipro¬
cate, so far as in us lay, the kind expres¬
sions of encouragement, of hope and of

cheer that Jacksonville had extended to us during the dark days of our own ad¬
versity.

RECUPERATIVE POWERS UNDERRATED.

Acting upon this decision, Secretary
Powers sent out his first circular an¬
nouncing that, notwithstanding the fire,
the meeting would still be held in Jack¬
sonville. A few days later, however, a second canvass of the situation, in which your President consulted with Vice-
President George W. Wilson and Secre¬
tary Powers, of the Society, and the prominent railroad, city and Board of
Trade officials of Jacksonville, resulted in a reversal of our first decision. It be¬
came plain that we had underrated Jack¬
sonville’s wonderful recuperative pow¬
ers. Her burnt-out population, instead of leaving the city in swarms, remained to rebuild the fallen city and recoup their fallen fortunes. The city needed every available room for officing and housing her own inhabitants. The kindliest service we could render Jacksonville was to look for other quarters. We accepted
St. Augustine’s kind invitation, Secre¬
tary Powers sent out notices to that ef¬
fect, and we are here.

The thanks of the Society are due the railroads, which, with courtesy and promptness, made available for St. Au¬
gustine the reduced rates that had been granted for Jacksonville. Our thanks are also due the Board o,f Trade of Jack¬
sonville and its large-hearted, whole-
souled president, Capt. C. E. Garner, the worthy president of the Relief Associa¬
tion, who, when your President told him that we had decided to go to St. Au¬
gustine, said, “Brother Taber, please say to your Society and to the good people


of St. Augustine that in addition to the losses Jacksonville has sustained by fire,
she feels the loss of the Horticultural So¬
ciety meeting/’

In addition to St. Augustine's invita¬
tion, we received one from the city of
Orlando and one from the city of Tampa.
On behalf of the Society, thanks were conveyed to the mayors of both of these cities together with the information that,
under the circumstances, we thought better to come here.

Your President wishes to extend his personal thanks to the Executive Com¬
mittee for empowering him with their prerogative and indorsing, in advance,
his decision as to place of meeting, when red tape would have seriously impeded the prompt action that the exigencies of the case demanded.

SOCIETY A SUFFERER.

The fire which was so disastrous to
Jacksonville was far-reaching in its ef¬
fects, and our Society is one of the suf¬
ferers—to comparatively small extent, it is true, yet the loss is one we deplore.
All records of the Society and all annual reports on hand for the past years were destroyed. This makes it impossible to supply life members from now on with reports published prior to the fire. I am happy to say, however, that the library,
of which the Library Committee’s report will show we have a nucleus, was not burned. In this connection I wish, with¬
out discrimination against other contrib¬
utors, to call special attention to the gen¬
erosity of Mrs. Frances E. Manville, of
Orange City, who, in remembrance of her husband, our former Secretary, A. H.
Manville, kindly donated the complete collection of horticultural books whicht

he possessed at the time of his death.

While each and every one of us must deplore the calamity that made necessary a change in our meeting place, yet it seems to me peculiarly fitting that the
Florida State Horticultural Society,
which, more than any other, represents the peaceful, substantial progress of our
State, should hold a convention in this historic town, the oldest, not only in
Florida, but in the United States. It was here that, more than three and one-
third centuries ago, Menendez’s expedi¬
tion of conquest and control first found anchorage. It was from this port the
Don sallied forth to give battle to the
Frenchman; it was near this town the massacre of the French occurred that, in turn, brought forth from France the ex¬
pedition that wrought terrible retribu¬
tion on the Spaniard. In those days
Florida was primeval. The most val¬
ued art was the art of wan Fighting,
for occupation or defense, was for many years the most important business of the inhabitants of this city and of this State.
It had to be. Those were days when, if ever, might made right. But now see how changed! No need now for sen¬
tries to pace the ramparts of yonder an¬
cient fort and signal whether the fleet sailing up the bay is bringing relief to a beleaguered people, or flying colors that mean fight or be destroyed. No need now for moat or drawbridge. No need now for the portcullis at old Fort Marion to be kept in working order; the one at the Ponce de Leon has replaced it—and it is raised to all without fear of an ene¬
my. St. Augustine has no enemies, but hosts of friends, and among them all none more friendly that the horticultur¬
ist. It is in the practice of our art that the grounds surrounding her palatial


buildings have been embellished, and without this art her magnificent arch¬
itecture would lose half its significance.

THE SCOPE OF WORK.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, let us consider for a few moments the scope of work that lies before us at this meeting.
Our Society has to deal with the horti¬
culture of the second largest State east of the Mississippi river, embracing,
roughly speaking, fifty-nine thousand square miles. From Fernandina to the
Perdido we cover six degrees of longi¬
tude, and from St. Mary’s river to Cape
Sable about the same number of degrees of latitude. Figures, however, whether representing distances or areas, carry much more weight when reinforced by comparisons:

Let us suppose that aerial navigation
—which the present century will un¬
doubtedly see perfected—is already in successful operation. With one of these space-annihilating machines, let us start from the northwestern extremity of the
State of Florida and make a flying trip in a straight line to the southeastern ex¬
tremity of our mainland. An examina¬
tion of the meter will show that we have logged off five hundred and fifty miles.
Now, returning to our initial point of
Northwestern Florida, let us take a trip of equal distance in a northeasterly di¬
rection. This will take us across a large portion of the State of Alabama, the whole of the States of Georgia and
South Carolina, and land us in the mid¬
dle of the State of North Carolina, or,
with our course a little more to the northward, take us clear over the north¬
ern line of North Carolina into Virginia;
or, trending still more to the northward,


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


21


land us in West Virginia, after having covered portions of the States of Ala¬
bama, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennes¬
see and Virginia. Pursuing a still more northerly direction, we can land in
Northern Kentucky, almost up to Cin¬
cinnati, O. Flying north and northwest,
we can land one-third of the way up the
States of Indiana or Illinois, or the cen¬
ter of the State of Missouri; or, with just a few extra revoultions of our pro¬
peller, can land in Southeastern Kan¬
sas. In an almost westerly direction,
we would land near Austin, the capital of
Texas, or, trending a little more to the southwest, almost reach Corpus Christi.
Directly south or directly east we would not care to fly, or at least to light when our five hundred and fifty miles were completed. In the one direction we would land in deep water well down the
Gulf of Mexico, with nothing more tangible to grasp at than the Tropic of
Cancer, and in the other direction we would disappear from sight in the At¬
lantic, two hundred miles east of Fer-
nandina.

VAST DISTANCES.

Now, while some of us might find this flying to be a pleasant sensation, others of us might not, and as none of us are yet used to it, and our airship might not accommodate us all, let us take a map of the United States and a pair of com¬
passes, and drawing a circle with the northwestern point of Florida for its center and our southeastern mainland on its periphery, attain the same results.
This circle will not only corroborate the distances named, but also show us that there are fifteen States and one Territory
—one-third of all the States and Terri¬


tories in this country prior to the Spanish war—that are, either in whole or in part,
nearer to the State of Florida than the two extremities of our State are to each other. (As a matter of fact, there is one other State that comes within the dis¬
tance, but not within the circle; this is
Ohio, the southern extremity of which is nearer to Fernandina than our north¬
western extremity is to our southeast¬
ern.)

Now, if these figures and comparisons applied to a State situated farther north,
surrounded on all sides by other States,
the situation, while still admitting of plenty of work on our part, would be vastly simplified. In that case we would be one of a cluster of States having, hor-
ticulturally speaking, much in common.
We could consult horticultural papers and horticultural reports of States ad¬
joining us on the east or west or south,
and obtain valuable information from our neighbors working under similar conditions of soil and climate. But when we consider that the only two
States with which we come in contact are those that constitute our northern boundary, and that, leaving these, our
State immediately trends southward into salt water and warmer latitudes, our unique position and comparative isola¬
tion among the sisterhood of States be¬
comes doubly apparent; we realize more fully how much we are thrown upon our own horticultural resources. I am happy to say that these resources have never yet failed us—and are not likely to.

Returning again to our map and sur¬
veying the territory over which our northeastern flight took us, we will find that while yet in mid-air before the flight was half completed we w r ere passing over


22


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


the largest peach orchards in the world.
Investigation will show us that some of the varieties comprising those immense
Middle Georgia orchards are also adapt¬
ed to our initial point of Northwestern
Florida, but that coming east and south from there the adaptability of these va¬
rieties gradually diminishes until before we reach an imaginary line drawn across the State from Cedar Key to Jackson¬
ville their fruitfulness has become so im¬
paired as to make them utterly valueless for commercial planting. Now, this does not mean that south of this line we can¬
not grow peaches—for, on the contrary,
we can and do. It means simply that peaches for semi-tropical planting must be of tropical or semi-tropical origin.
Investigation will show us that the kinds most largely planted in peninsular Flor¬
ida, and which are now being shipped by the carload from sections that a few years ago did not know they could grow peaches, are to a very large extent va¬
rieties that have originated in Florida and belong to types introduced from the tropics.

FRUIT OF ALL KINDS.

In the northern portion of our State apples can be grown, although, it must be admitted, not with such degree of suc¬
cess as will warrant extensive planting.
In the southern half of the State we have an apple that is ten times as large and ten times as luscious, the cultivation of which has assumed large proportions and has proven immensely profitable; it is the pineapple.

In Northern Florida pears have been profitably grown, although in recent years badly affected by blight. In South¬
ern Florida a so-called pear is grown


which, while no relation to the Le Conte or other pears, holds out promising in¬
ducements and is probably no more sub¬
ject to attacks of blight than is the saurian whose name it has borrowed.

In Northern Florida the cultivation of the pecan nut is assuming large propor¬
tions, and very justly so. In extreme
South Florida we find that mammoth of all nuts, which produces both food and drink, the cocoanut, growing under as radically different conditions from those suited to the pecan as can well be con¬
ceived.

In sections of Northern Florida some varieties of the true Japan plum,
Prunus triflora, have fruited well, and crosses that have been and will be pro¬
duced between these and our native types promise much for a large portion of the State. In Southern Florida the
Eriobotrya, Japonica, or Loquat, also er¬
roneously called Japan plum, is of great value and worthy of being planted more extensively than at present. Several improved named varieties of these are already in existence that are very much larger and in every way superior to the common seedlings.

In Northern Florida we have the figs,
Japan persimmon and grapes to consider,
and many varieties of these are equally adapted well down the State; and again in South Florida, the pomelo, lemon,
lime, guava and mango, together with minor fruits of even more tropical char¬
acter, come in for our attention.

And now, last to mention, but per¬
haps first in importance, comes the orange, the fruit that, more than any other, has made us famous; the one with which the name of Florida is inseparably linked. Where shall we draw the line of demarkation between adaptability and


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


23


non-adaptability of this queen of fruits?
To be sure, during storm and stress of weather that recent years have brought us, she has been seeking protection near the Everglades; but does this mean that she has abandoned her old haunts for¬
ever? We think not. We believe that all that portion of Florida that has been graced with her presence in the past will be graced with it again; that in her trip southward she is simply extending her dominion and making it that much larger than ever before. Her votaries farther up the State do not relinquish their claim upon her simply because those farther down the State have filed theirs. Already, with less than three years elapsed since the hardest freeze ever known in Florida, there are com¬
puted to be one thousand boxes of her golden output in sight in one grove with¬
in ten miles of the Georgia line.

But it is not alone the fruits of Florida that demand attention at our hands; if so, we would be a pomological society rather than a horticultural one. Pomol¬
ogy treats of fruits and fruit trees; horti¬
culture embraces all of pomology and much more. Vegetables, shrubs and flowers, as well as fruits, come within the scope of a horticultural society. Our printed programme shows that all these are given a place.

Referring once more to our unique position on the map, I wish to call atten¬
tion to what I believe to be a means of adding largely to the horticultural wealth of the State, if we will go at it systematically, and that is the growing of new varieties with the material already at hand to serve as a basis. Take for in¬
stance peaches, to which I have before alluded, and plant a few pits year after year from the best, earliest and most


fruitful varieties grown in the locality in which each of us is situated. If each member of this society would do this for a few years in succession I believe va¬
rieties would be originated that would be to Florida what the far-famed Elber-
ta is to Georgia and states to the north¬
ward. It does not take much room to do this; the pits may be planted one or two feet in the rows and rows eight feet apart. After they have fruited dig up those that produce only mediocre or poor fruit, and let the others stand; not as the basis of a commercial orchard in themselves, but for further test as to possibility of varieties that may prove worthy of extensive propagation and planting. While budded varieties only should form the basis of a commercial orchard, yet the few trees to which our little plot will be ultimately thinned will be the very best varieties out of the lot of seedlings produced and, whether we have developed anything startling or not, can remain as a valuable adjunct to our home orchard.

I have especially mentioned peaches because they are easily grown, subject to wide variation from the seed and fruit while yet very young. There are thous¬
ands upon thousands of acres of land throughout both Northern and Peninsu¬
lar Florida that are perfectly adapted to peach culture. We already have good kinds; we might have better ones—let us originate them. Some of us have al¬
ready done something in this line, but it is needless to say that the efforts of a whole State will produce much greater results than the few could accomplish.

But it is not peaches alone that hold out inducements in the way of origina¬
tion of new varieties. There are many other fruits that can be experimented


24


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


with in the same way, and our horticul¬
tural resources materially developed from within the State. With the citrus fruits, where variation of seedlings is not as radical as with some others, the more scientific method of artificial pollination presents an inviting field which has al¬
ready been entered upon to a considera¬
ble extent, and crosses produced not only between varieties but species, that promise much for the future. This field is so large, however, and admits of such an almost endless combination in the assembling of desirable qualities of different varieties under one exterior covering that there is no danger of its ever being overdone.

And then in addition to the planting of fruit tree seeds, either naturally or ar¬
tificially pollinated, there are numerous shrubs and flowers which are subject to the same laws of variation and which of¬
fer a delightful field of experiment to those of us to whom the beautiful in na¬
ture appeals; and to whom of us does it not?

In mentioning the possibilities that lie before us in the way of further develop¬
ment, I trust that none of you will think that I am belittling the actualities that already exist. On the contrary no one of you recognizes more than I the gran¬
deur of our horticultural domain, and the grandeur of our well-established horti¬
cultural products. Let us continue to import into the State every tree or vege¬
table or seed or plant or cutting that holds forth promise of being an acqui¬
sition, but let us also remember that we have within our State limits, at our fingers’ ends, a mine of wealth in vari¬


eties yet unborn if we will but apply the wizard touch.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, I
wish to congratulate each member of the
Society on the fact that we are horticul¬
turists. The pursuit that we follow is one that is broadening, ennobling, uplift¬
ing. Of all the arts and sciences there is no other the followers of which are brought into such close relation with nature; and he who can feel his own pulse responds to nature’s mighty heart-
throb is a king, regardless of whether he live in palace or hovel. He can, as can all of us if we are true horticulturists, ap¬
preciate the sublimity of sentiment ex¬
pressed by William Cullen Bryant in
“A Forest Hymn

“My heart is awed within me as I think
Of the great miracle that still goes on,

In silence, round me—the perpetual work

Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed
For ever. Written on thy works I read
The lesson of thy own eternity.

Lo! all grow old and die—but see again
How on the faltering footsteps of decay
Youth presses—ever gay and beautiful youth,

In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees

Wave not less proudly that their ances¬
tors

Moulder beneath them. Oh, there is not lost

One of earth’s charms; upon her bosom yet,

After the flight of untold centuries,

The freshness of her far beginning lies,
And yet shall lie.”
