PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 

Twenty-Second Annual Meeting 

f 

OF THE 

Florida State Horticultural Society 


The Florida State Horticultural Society held its twenty-second annual meeting in the historic city of Daytona, Volusia county. Quite a number of parties gath¬ 
ered at Daytona the day before the open¬ 
ing of the meeting as they wanted to be sure of good accommodations and enjoy the beach at Seabreeze and take in some of the attractions of Daytona before the meeting began. 

The place of meeting was in the Ar¬ 
mory and all of the sessions were well at¬ 
tended. The evening sessions were es¬ 
pecially well attended by the citizens of 
Daytona. In fact, the number of citi¬ 
zens turning out to the meetings was probably as large if not larger than at any place where a meeting has been held for years. The program was carried through with but little variation and all the time was taken up. For the lack of sufficient time some of the papers were simply accepted and ordered printed with the balance of the proceedings. 


The good ladies of Daytona entertained the lady members of the society at the 
Palmetto Club and all pronounced it a most enjoyable affair. The whole mem¬ 
bership of the Horticultural Society was treated to a boat ride to New Smyrna and an automobile ride from New Smyr¬ 
na to Daytona. It was hard to say which was the most enjoyable, and to cap the climax of good things the people of Day¬ 
tona assisted by the New Smyrna citi¬ 
zens gave a clam chowder lunch at the 
Ocean House. This House is noted for its clam chowder and on this occasion it nobly held up its reputation and those present had nothing but words of praise to utter. The members all expressed themselves as having a most enjoyable time and will remember their short stay with the good people of Daytona and 
New Smyrna with a great deal of pleas¬ 
ure. 

When the time for the next place of meeting was brought up, Orlando, Pa-

latka, and Jacksonville were the only places offering invitations and Orlando won, so that the next annual association meeting will be held in Orlando. Two previous meetings have been held in Or¬ 
lando and they were most enjoyable af¬ 


fairs and the next meeting is looked for¬ 
ward to with a great deal of pleasure. 

All of the members present enjoyed the lectures and addresses given by the Gov¬ 
ernment attaches, and hope that they will be with us each succeeding year.

Address of Welcome. 


By Mayor E. W. Greene. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It must be gratifying to the members of The Florida State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety to see so many gathered in atten¬ 
dance at this the opening meeting of the 
Twenty-second Annual gathering of this 
Society. It shows a marked and grow¬ 
ing interest in Horticulture throughout the State. 

I do not intend to occupy much of your time in a lengthy address of welcome for I know your time can be better spent in listening to addresses from more able speakers bearing on the subject more directly connected with the work of this 


association, but I want, on behalf of the citizens of Daytona to extend to the vis¬ 
iting members and friends a cordial wel¬ 
come and perfect freedom of the city dur¬ 
ing these meetings and after seeing the beauty and advantages which this section can offer, some of you, may wish to cast in your lot with us. To such I would say our welcome extends indefinitely. I 
hope the committee who have been in¬ 
trusted with your comfort have faithfully performed their duty and that your stay in our midst may be one of pleasure as well as profit to us all. 

Again I repeat, you are welcome and the freedom of the city is yours. 


RESPONSE TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 


By H. Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It has fallen to my lot to reply in brief to the kind words of welcome extended to us by the Mayor on behalf of Daytona. 

Your Honor, in replying, I beg to say to you that we appreciate your cordial words and if your words did not amply assure us, there is abundant proof that we are indeed welcome. We were met and taken charge of by a committee of your 


representative citizens when we alighted from the train and made to feel that we were at home. When a few of us sat down to a belated dinner today, we were promptly informed that we were subject to a fine of increased rates, if we did not partake amply of the food before us. The idea of being fed by compulsion was en¬ 
tirely new. In fact, in the many and va- 
ried experiences which all of us have had 1 ,

the rule has always been to put a premium upon eating sparingly. It must be the 
Daytona way. And this afternoon, I 
made note of a pair of horticulturists tres¬ 
passing perhaps, upon the property of one of your citizens. They had, judging from their actions, found something interest¬ 
ing and made themselves at home. They were not molested. Now, your Honor, 

I beg of you, should any of this body be brought before you for trespassing, deal leniently with them, they are harmless. 

We have seen many things worthy of note in your city. It is a city marked, 
and out of the ordinary, a city built in the woods, a city where the touch of na¬ 
ture in all its beauty has been left un¬ 
spoiled. Your Honor, you have here a city unique, a city with well paved and shady streets, restful in its simple natur¬ 
alness, a city of which you may well feel proud. 

And you may feel assured, your 
Honor, that you will find this society not at all backward in accepting of your kind hospitality. This body stands for the progress of horticulture in this state, if it stands for anything. It is interesting to note the way along which the way of progress has led. The parent horticul¬ 
tural industry of this state—orange growing—had its origin in hammocks on the banks of rivers, lakes and streams. 
The first problem confronting the grower of those earlier days was that of propa¬ 
gation—the task of bringing those wild sour groves into profitable producers of sweet, edible fruit. Then came an enor¬ 
mous amount of work with varieties, ac¬ 
companied by much costly introduction 


work. The problem of fertilizers became prominent and looking over the older volumes of our proceedings, you will find lengthy dissertations on muck and other harmless substances. Scale insects and fungous diseases claimed attention and the strife between sprayers and non- 
sprayers. The cold came and with it there came into being numerous other horti¬ 
cultural industries. Latent possibilities were developed and as a result our horti¬ 
culture became more diversified. More recently irrigation has become a question of importance, for we have learned, 
whether it rains or not, we must have water. The problems connected with the marketing of our products are now being agitated and out of the discussion good will come. And in all these years no old question has been or can be laid down for no problem connected with the growing plant can ever be permanently settled. Difficulties have been met as they arose, mastered in part and relegated to a place of secondary importance as some new one claimed attention. The path has not been an easy one, but it has been cheerfully traveled upward. You can feel certain, your Honor, that an as¬ 
sociation, with a history such as this, will not be backward in accepting your hos¬ 
pitality, for the way has not always fallen 

in such pleasant places. 

And when we leave, we trust that it will be with a feeling on your part that you are glad we came and we shall, I 
speak for the society, carry away with us pleasant remembrances of our brief so¬ 
journ with you. 




Address of the President. 


By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson. 


Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In accordance with the requirements of precedent and duty it devolves upon me as your president on this occasion to de¬ 
liver an address. 

A year ago when you unexpectedly elected me to the office of president, I was reposing in a pool of ambitionless lethargy. 
I told you at that time that I was unfitted for the place both by inclination and equipment, and that I did not feel quali¬ 
fied to discharge its onerous duties, how¬ 
ever your call was unanimous and in ac¬ 
cepting the office I did it fully aware of its responsibilities and with a high appre¬ 
ciation of its honors. 

I am very much of an optimist, not be¬ 
cause optimism is pleasant or fashionable, 
but because it is a prerequisite to all suc¬ 
cess and achievement. Optimism and hope nerve the weary toiler’s arm and in¬ 
spire the sinking heart to renewed effort and ultimate victory. 

As Horticulturalists we are so beset with difficulties, disappointments and temporary failures that I confess it re¬ 
quires a large and vigorous supply of op¬ 
timism to keep us from falling into de¬ 
spair and despondency. 

There are those who look to the past for their models; whatever has the haze of antiquity has for them peculiar charms. 
They think and speak a great deal of 
“the good old times.” And, when they look forward, it is with forebodings of evil and prophecies of disaster. 


The world in general, is making pro¬ 
gress, and is better to-day than in any century of the past. As an illustration, 
permit me to refer to the “labor ques¬ 
tion,” now agitating this great country from center to circumference. There is much of fallacy in argument, and ignor¬ 
ance of fact, apparent in the discussions of this subject by leading agitators and demagogs in the various political parties of our land. It is asserted that the con¬ 
dition of the laborer is becoming worse from generation to generation; that the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. The falsity of these statements will appear from even a slight acquaintance with history. The circum¬ 
stances of the poor are vastly better now than they were during the Middle Ages, 
or at any other period of the world. The laborer of our time wears finer clothes, 
sits down to a more sumptuous table, 
sleeps in a better ventilated and regulat¬ 
ed house than the former king and noble enjoyed. A faithful picture of the rags, 
the filth, the wretchedness, the stolid in¬ 
difference to manly aspirations, the ig¬ 
noble contentment with their very poverty and ignorance in which multitudes of poor people were once brought up, or rather allowed to struggle down to the grave, would doubtless astound many a grumbler, who is fond of exaggerating his own hard lot in comparison with that of his ancestors. “Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days were 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ntr 

l*o 


better than these? for thou dost not in¬ 
quire wisely concerning this.” 

In the irrepressible and seemingly never ending conflict between capital and labor, 
we the independent producers always and invariably get the worst of it. 

In point of numbers, including all those who are not affiliated with either class, 
we are largely in the majority, yet by our supineness we see our rights ignored and ruthlessly trampled upon by both sides of these contending forces. 

We are crushed and ground between the upper and nether millstones of ag¬ 
gressive dictatorial labor and tyrannous, 
oppressive capital. It is not merely a 
Kilkenny cat affair in which the combat¬ 
ants injure only themselves, but it is a deplorable and disastrous wrangle that in¬ 
volves the entire public. 

The solution and termination of this vexatious problem and cruelly ruinous struggle can not be left to the demagog and walking delegate, but the injured and long suffering, unbiased people themselves will finally be compelled to rise up in their strength and put an equitable and fair finish to this cruelly pitiful combat. 
The question naturally arises how do these people who are relatively only a small part of our population get such a powerful influence: the answer is sim¬ 
ple, it is because both capital and labor have their strong combinations and per¬ 
fect organizations. We too must organ¬ 
ize and combine before we can ever hope to wield much influence. 

It may be said that this is not a horti- 
culturalist’s question, but it seems to me that as horticulturalists and members of the body politic we are vitally interested in all questions of political economy and 


social welfare. The horticultural and agricultural population of our country is the leaven that converts the whole mass of the populace into a beneficient and glo¬ 
rious nationality. 

I believe in Evolution and Develop¬ 
ment, though not altogether as expounded by Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall and others. 
The element of progress runs like a gold¬ 
en chain through all the Universe of God: 
and nowhere does it sparkle with more refulgency than in the physical and ma¬ 
terial world—a realm to which the whole school of speculative philosophers have not lifted their eyes. The pessimistic un¬ 
believer in men, natural law and natural selection, has seen only half the truth,, 
or rather he has not seen half the truth.. 
Like an insect, which must be examined microscopically, he has seen only the smallest objects. 

The epoch in which we live is essenti¬ 
ally and emphatically a utilitarian age. 
The study of abstract science and specu¬ 
lative philosophy as a part of man’s edu¬ 
cation have like many other kinds of men¬ 
tal gymnastics been relegated to the rear and the demands of modern requirements insist on that kind of science and philos¬ 
ophy which can be put to immediate prac¬ 
tical and beneficial uses. 

Throughout all the past ages natural selection has played an important part in the evolution and development of all those horticultural products requisite to the sustenance of human life. At first these variations and survivals of the best and most useful fruits, grains, etc., were the result of sectional environment and climatic influences but later as man in¬ 
creased in intelligence and experience, he took a hand in the matter and has so as- 



24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sisted nature that results most prodigous and startling have been attained. 

Man’s first efforts were along the lines of careful selection of the best seeds, un¬ 
scientific fertilization and indifferent cul¬ 
tivation, later, grafting, budding, cross- 
pollenization, etc., were practiced and at the present day some of the results of man’s experiments along these lines are so marvelous and rapid as to be quite in¬ 
credible. 

The modern horticulturalist has by a judicious selection of variations* otherwise known as “sports and freaks,’' given us the luscious peach as a development from the scanty, bitter husk and large seed of the wild almond; wheat and other valu¬ 
able grains by a selection of variations in wild grasses. 

The strawberry has by careful selection been developed from an insignificant bunch of leaves into one of our most de¬ 
licious fruits, and now we learn that among the latest things in this kind of evolution is the production of a large, lus¬ 
cious, edible cactus, as much ahead of the kind that the Mexicans have for genera¬ 
tions been harvesting for their markets as the present magnificent tomatoes of our gardens are superior to those thought to be unfit to eat if not poisonous only some fifty or sixty years ago. We might go on with examples of this character, 
but enough has been said to show that the possibilities of this kind of evolution are almost absolutely limitless. 

It sometimes seems that the forces of nature combine with man in a determined assault on our welfare. No sooner have we met and vanquished the ill effects of 
'cold, drouth, lack of fertility, insect and other pests than we are beset by human 


or rather inhuman enemies who seek to rob us of our well earned success, through fraudulent markets, swindling buyers, 
robber transportation companies, trusts and combines. 

There are evils so vast in their propor¬ 
tions and so fortified by position and wealth, that to assail them seems to the eye of sense to be madness and folly. 
These combinations belong to this class of evils. The longer one studies their nature and all permeating extent, the more conversant he becomes with their results, the more he is persuaded that no tongue, however eloquent, can describe, 
and no pen, however graphic, can portray a tithe of their evils. To exaggerate is impossible. As John Wesley said of sla¬ 
very, I would say of this: “It is the sum of all villainies.” 

The discussion of their oppression is hindered by the difficulty—in a sense, the hopelessness—of the undertaking. They are defiant and laugh our puny efforts to scorn. Their conquests and despotisms have continued over a period of lo these many years, and we almost despair. 

Let us remember, however, that while the storms of adversity, the fierce strug¬ 
gles for rights, the crushing of worthy ambitions, the bitterness of disappoint¬ 
ment, the gloom of despair, all affect the mental as well as the physical life; and that in some cases disaster is complete; 
nevertheless to the cheerful, optimistic mind there comes reaction, relief and final victory through determined, persis¬ 
tent and well directed work. 

In our successful efforts to extract from the soil its richest and best pro¬ 
ducts, we have through selfish, individual effort fenced ourselves in with a wall of

almost seclusive isolation, shutting out our neighbors and fellow workers. While we have been doing this all those others with whom we are compelled to deal, 
Aave combined among themselves and with each other for aggressive mutual benefit. The fertilizer industries, the transportation lines, the commission con¬ 
cerns and the buyers; all and each have their well organized systems of doing business without encountering ruinous competition, and are reaping golden har¬ 
vests of profit. With us lack of any and all organized methods of mutual co-oper¬ 
ation in making our requisite purchases of materials and commodities necessary to our operations, and in the ruinous, fool¬ 
ish competitive manner of marketing our crops, have led to a point where our la¬ 
bors are not only unremunerative but de¬ 
structive of all gains. We have met and vanquished the evil influences of earth and air and it now behooves us to buckle on our armor and meet these last foes. 
The result can not be uncertain, our forces are now gathering and when we make a united and concerted effort, wc must and shall come out victorious. 

u Let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate.” 

We are altogether to blame ourselves for the deplorable conditions now existent which bear down on us with such oppres¬ 
sive weight. If we would only give a little part of the time to the cultivation of mutual interests that we do to the cultivation of the soil we would soon get such results that our gains might be com¬ 
mensurate with our desires. 

Man is a gregarious creature and when¬ 
ever he attempts to flock by himself, he invariably makes a dismal failure. What 


we need and must have is mutual com¬ 
binations of our entire producing inter¬ 
ests, so that we can go unitedly into the markets and demand fair prices for pro¬ 
ducts and transportation. Our neighbors in California have in a most signal way succeeded in combining their mutual in¬ 
terests so that they are realizing splen¬ 
did returns for their products, and this too, without curtailing or interfering with individual rights. What they have done, 
we can do with such modifications of their system as may be requisite to our situation. 

Co-operative efforts have frequently failed, but usually this has come about through a too strong communistic ten¬ 
dency in the details. Co-operative move¬ 
ments and organizations where individual rights have been fundamental and re¬ 
spected have nearly always succeeded. 

Let us at once combine together in a final herculean effort to get redress and justice. If we do this intelligently we can not fail. 

Upon occasions like the present, active, 
conscientious thinkers and workers nat¬ 
urally fall into a line of thought and med¬ 
itation, having reference to the flight of time and opportunity; the dead past, the living present, the unborn future. The dead past with all its memories, whether prosperous or adverse, can give us only the unalterable lessons of example and experience; the living present we seize with avidity, in an eager strife to make it as a past an improvement upon that which may have preceded it; the unborn future we ardently hope may prove a vast improvement upon both the present and the past. It is probably a wise provision

of our mental and moral constitution, 
that— 

“Hope springs eternal in the human breast; 

Man never is, but always to be blessed.” 

Today, while standing upon the narrow niche of ever fleeing time we peer back into the sepulchral portals of the buried past; 
and while ardently wishing it had been better, we, as it were, simultaneously hope, work and pray that the womb of the future, with all its unborn progeny, 
may have something better in store for us. 

Results in life are largely, very large¬ 
ly, what we make them in the exercise of industry, wisdom and sagacity. Accident and chance as factor in results, are but flimsy excuses or pretexts to cloak our ignorance, stupidity and failures. 

In the preparation of this address mat¬ 
ters purely and essentially horticultural have not had that prominence which has usually been customary, but as an offset to this, those who are in charge of the several committees and the authors of the various papers will give us a feast of knowledge and detail along horticultural highways, and byways that will make up for the deficiency. 

If I have touched questions of public interest in certain directions it has been 


because I feel that these questions are live wires charged with dangers that menace our welfare and I trust that the voicing of my personal sentiments may not be misunderstood or misconstrued. 

In conclusion, let us all work earnestly and faithfully to make this gathering one long to be remembered as one fruit¬ 
ful in good things, beneficial alike to every member of the Society, and to the cause of Horticulture. Let us in our dis¬ 
cussions, give up freely the treasures of personal experience; let each bring forth his little or much, to strengthen his broth¬ 
er and give him will, force and self-re¬ 
liance in his daily struggles. 

Finally may each and everyone of us live to a ripe old age in harmony with the last words of the great Victor Hugo, 
“Winter is on my head and eternal spring is in my heart. The nearer I approach the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. For half a century I have been writing my thoughts in prose, verse, his¬ 
tory, philosophy, drama, romance, tradi¬ 
tion, satire, ode, song; I have tried all. 
But I feel I have not said the thousandth part of what is in me. My work is only a beginning. The thirst for infinity proves infinity.” 


What the Experiment Station is Doing for the 

Fruit and Vegetable Grower. 


By P. H. Rolfs. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I wish to give a somewhat general talk, 
similar to the one I delivered to the So¬ 
ciety at the Tampa meeting. All know more or less about the experiment station; 
yet I suppose those of us who are at the experiment station think we know less about it than many people in the State ap¬ 
pear to know about it. That is quite in keeping with the general order of things; 
the nearer one gets to the real thing, the less he finds he knows about it. I be¬ 
lieve our worthy secretary said, a couple of years ago, that at one time he knew all about fertilizers, but now he found that he was just beyond the beginning point. In fact, his knowledge had in¬ 
creased until he was in the position of knowing just how little he did know. 

We have published from the experi¬ 
ment station 98 bulletins, 117 press bul¬ 
letins, and 20 annual reports. Of the bul¬ 
letins it will be found that over 50 per cent, deal directly or indirectly with hor¬ 
ticultural subjects. During the past fiscal year the experiment station has distrib¬ 
uted over 73,000 copies of bulletins, press bulletins and reports. In addition to this a very large amount of time is de¬ 
voted to answering special inquiries made by various people in the State. 


FERTILIZER EXPERIMENTS. 

In the matter of making field experi¬ 
ments it is a recognized impossibility to grow all crops of the State at the central station, consequently the workers must proceed to the fields where these crops are grown. And to make these experi¬ 
ments of general value it is necessary to carry them on under conditions which exist in the field. 

PINEAPPLES. 

We have conducted for the past eight years experiments in fertilizing certain plots continuously with certain definitely known fertilizers. As the result of this work four bulletins and one separate from the annual report have been published. 
We have now ready for publication an¬ 
other bulletin on the chemical analyses of the fruits grown on the various plots. 
This work we believe has been carried on as long as it will be profitable under our present scheme of fertilization. 

CITRUS. 

About a year ago Professor Blair took up the question of arranging for carrying on a co-operative experiment in citrus fertilization. This is being done in co¬ 
operation with Mr. G. M. Wakelin, of 



28 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Lanepark, Fla. We have 480 trees that have been planted 1 out and fertilization has begun. It is intended to carry this work forward for at least 10 years. While the funds of the experiment station would not permit the experiment to be enlarged to the extent of making it complete in every detail, it is thought that the present experiment will cover some of the essen¬ 
tial points upon which we need a great deal more information. A sufficient num¬ 
ber of trees (10) have been set out to each plot; so we feel that the results ob¬ 
tained from each plot will be fairly indic¬ 
ative of what will occur on an 'entire field. The standard formula, or one that is most commonly used by the citrus growers, has been taken as a basis. In some of the plots the ammonia contents are increased and in others decreased. 
In others the potash contents are increased and in others decreased. In others the phosphoric acid contents are increased and in others decreased. In still other plots the sources of ammonia are changed, 
while in others the sources of potash and phosphoric acid are changed. So that while we have not made all the possible combinations, we still have made enough variations to enable us to understand something definite about the results when they occur. 

Accurate data regarding the rainfall and also in regard to the temperature of the soil and of the atmosphere will be kept. Chemical analyses will be made of the soil before beginning the work, and repeatedly during the progress of the ex¬ 
periment. Chemical analyses will also be made of the foliage, the twigs, and the roots of the trees, as well as of the fruit when it shall have matured. 


DISEASE INVESTIGATIONS. 

The investiation of diseases in fruit and vegetable crops has always been an im¬ 
portant piece of work; and in this con¬ 
nection we have been able to save to the 
State many thousands of dollars annually. 
While the ideal condition would be an orchard or field that is entirely free from diseases, we cannot hope to attain to that state of perfection immediately. As a matter of fact, we have to understand the diseases rather perfectly before we are able to prevent their occurrence. 
When a tree or plant has become thor¬ 
oughly diseased, no amount of theorizing as to how it should be treated to be kept well is of any value to us. We need to know the remedy and how to have it applied. 

PEACH TWIG BLIGHT. 

This disease has been causing consid¬ 
erable difficulty for some years past in the peach orchard. It is now being taken up as a special study by one of our assistants in the experiment station. 

CITRUS DISEASES. 

The citrus crop is the biggest money crop that we raise in the State, and like¬ 
wise there is probably no other crop that is so severely beset by diseases of various kinds. 

This work of remedial measures against such organisms as are the cause of diseases in citrus trees has been taken up by Professor Fawcett, who will speak to you later in regard to the diseases of citrus. 

In addition to the diseases of citrus that are caused by micro-organisms, cer- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


29 


tain diseases are caused by unfavorable soil or fertilizer conditions. In short, 
they are the results of improper physio¬ 
logical surroundings. This line of re¬ 
search has been lately taken up by Pro¬ 
fessor Floyd, who will later tell you about gum disease, melanose, dieback, etc. 

WHITEFLY STUDIES. 

In combating our enemies we have two methods of proceeding; first, by artificial means; and, second, by en¬ 
listing in our (service the natural ene¬ 
mies or some other natural condition. In combating scale insects, many of us have conducted an uneven warfare by using insecticides and spraying machinery at a very considerable cost. Later it was dis¬ 
covered that we could enlist the fungi which are natural enemies of the scale in¬ 
sect, and so do this work at much less cost to ourselves. 

It will be remembered that Dr. Webber about twelve years ago reported to the 
Horticultural Society that he had discov¬ 
ered a fungus which grew parasiticallv upon the whitefly. This was a very great surprise to all of us and was eager¬ 
ly received. In connection with this work however, a great many difficulties arose which prevented a sufficiently rapid dis¬ 
semination of the fungi to annihilate the whitefly. Dr. Berger has reported to you from year to year his success in devising means for increasing the efficiency of the fungi and making it it easier to distribute them. We now know at least seven spe¬ 
cies of fungi that are parasitic upon the whitefly, and the indications are that there are still undiscovered species that will work for us if we will but give them the proper opportunity. 


Over 1,200 acres of citrus groves have been treated with whitefly fungi and vis¬ 
ited by members of the experiment sta¬ 
tion staff. In addition to this we have received letters from owners of several times as many acres stating that they are using this method. The whitefly fungi are being used in the following locations: 

Winter Park, Boardman, Titusville, 
McIntosh, St. Petersburg, Candler, Au- 
burndale, Orlando, Bartow, East Palatka, 
Plymouth, Palmetto, Ybor City, Fort 
Myers, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Alva, 
Buckingham, Bradentown, Manatee, De- 
Land, and Dunedin. 

CO-OPERATIVE EXPERIMENTS. 

These experiments are carried forward jointly with the citrus or vegetable grow¬ 
ers. As a general rule, the Experiment 
Station bears the expense of its agent, 
and a part of the expenses of making the experiment; the citrus or vegetable grow¬ 
er bearing the expense of maintaining the field and a part of the expense incident to carrying on the experiment. 

Co-operative citrus experiments are be¬ 
ing carried on at Lanepark. These are expected to' be continued for a period of ten years. Pineapple fertilizer experi¬ 
ments have been carried on at Jensen for a period of eight years. Citrus disease in¬ 
vestigations are being carried on at Bay- 
view. Celery fertilizer experiments have been carried on at Sanford, and celery disease experiments at Orlando and 
Bradentown. 

Co-operative whitefly experiments are in progress at Gainesville, St. Petersburg, 
Leesburg, DeLand and New Smyrna. 

The advantages to the Experiment Sta¬ 
tion can readily be seen from the fact that 


30 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the groves or fields are certain to be un¬ 
der the normal circumstances, with the exception of the conditions of the experi¬ 
ment. In other words the grove in case of disease experiments will receive the normal and usual cultivation and fertiliz¬ 
ation just as though the experiments were not being carried on. We are certain, 
therefore, that if any difference occurs on the experiment plot, it due entirely to> the test that is being made. The advantages to the grower are that he comes immedi¬ 
ately in contact with the most advanced in¬ 
formation that results from the experi¬ 
ments. We find in every case that where these co-operative experiments have been conducted there is established at once a 
Horticultural Society composed of at least one in the audience and a speaker who discusses all sorts of questions in connection with the work in hand. 

farmers' institutes. 

This work is not properly experiment station work, but from the nature of the case our experiment station workers are well prepared to discuss most of the prob¬ 
lems connected with agricultural and hor¬ 
ticultural work. It is quite probable that this is the reason why the Institutes con¬ 
tinue to call so frequently for workers from the experiment station. During the biennium from July i, 1907, to the pres¬ 
ent time, 91 sessions of Farmers’ In¬ 
stitutes have been held. The total atten¬ 
dance on these institutes is 9,301, making the average attendance a little more than 
100. In this connection I might be allowed 


to state that the institutes are being called for more frequently in northern and wes¬ 
tern Florida, than in eastern, central and southern Florida. As both our time and funds are limited, we have been unable to hold all the institutes requested. Under the circumstances, we are not able to work up institutes in sections where they are not called for. 

CONCLUSION. 

Those of the Horticultural society who have been earnestly interested in the ex¬ 
periments made by the experiment sta¬ 
tion will have discovered that our most important work and our most lasting work is such as has required a consider¬ 
able time for perfecting. We might say in a general way that the surface and easy problems have to a large extent been worked out, and have passed from the ex¬ 
perimental stage to the demonstration stage. From time to time as we secure valuable results in our experimental work, publications are issued setting forth our discoveries. We have two lines of publications. First, the regular bulletin which discusses certain problems and gives the information in a full and con¬ 
cise way. These are distributed to the people of the State. The press bulletins are short essays discussing certain phases of problems and announcing discoveries in our research work. These press bul¬ 
letins, as their name indicates, are sent to all the newspapers of the State with the request that they publish them. 


Handling of Citrus Groves. 


By B. H. Chilton. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

This to me covers a large field; for I 
am aware that with so many different conditions that have to be met with in the different qualities of soils, and modes of working, and before this body of wide experienced and practical growers, I 
hardly know where I ought to commence. 

First—I believe in thorough cultiva¬ 
tion on all common sandy soils; and com¬ 
mence fertilizing and cultivating as early in February as we can with safety. While many of us no doubt feel that there is some danger yet of a late cold striking us. But if your acreage be small, or run up in the hundreds, you have to take your chances, for there is nothing gained by waiting; for about this time generally, 
nature herself begins to assert itself and the orange tree is among the first to re¬ 
spond. 

With fertilizing we make two appli¬ 
cations a year: February and June or 
July, giving at each application io to 15 
pounds of the standard brands, Gem mix¬ 
ture or special fruit and vine, according to the conditions and needs. This is on eight to ten-year-old bearing trees. With the younger trees planted in grove shape to allow from two up to six pounds to the tree. I believe in blood, bone and potash, governing the amount according to the condition and size of the tree, and 


for building up your soil. With our June and July application of fertiliser it differs but little, if the season is favorable; only we use if possible the high grade of spe¬ 
cial mixture of the highest per cent, in potash, on our bearing grove. 

On our hammock grove we use less in ammonia and a higher per cent, in potash. 
Where the vegetation makes a heavy growth we find also that the die back mix¬ 
ture gives good results. For in our heavy timbered grove or marl hammock land, 
there is a tendency in a moist season, for the trees to show more or less die back signs. 

CULTIVATING OR CULTIVATION. 

On all old groves and sandy soil, we use nothing but the Planet Junior and 
Rolling Cutaway and Acme Harrow, and the hoe around the trees. This is kept up until the first of August; and in a dry season, if possible, I would recommend that the Acme Harrow be brought into ac¬ 
tive service, and all grove be gone over once a week. After July we let the beg¬ 
gar weed and crab grass take possession, 
which will give your trees a heavy mulch and shade the ground until the first of 
November. Then we begin again for winter protection. Using the Morgan 
Spading Harrow, which can be used both ways, and will cut up the growth which has already begun to die down, and mix-

ing it with the soil. And this also makes a fire protection. For with us we use the open pine fire for frost protection, in every check in our bearing groves. With our young groves we make fire in our mar¬ 
gins, and bank high all young stock. And in cultivation in our hammock grove, 
nearly all the work is done with the hoe and scythe. Hoeing large circles around the trees and mowing the margin, this is done three times a year. 


PRUNING. 

I believe in the use of the knife wiith good judgment. And that along the line with Professor Harold Hume, gave uls in his able lecture two years ago at St. Pet¬ 
ersburg. Cut close and clean and using a dressing on all large cuts, of either graft¬ 
ing wax, or oil, lamp black and white lead. And keeping the center of your tree clean of all dead limbs and water sprouts, unless you want to bring out a new limb or leader to fill out the vacancy. 


By Jas. E. Kilgore. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

After thinking this subject over I have decided that it is a very large and diffi¬ 
cult one for me. Any method I advance will depend, for its success or failure, on the soil and the season where the test is made. A method that would give good results in a wet year may fail in a dry, 
without proper irrigation, and the dif¬ 
ferent conditions in warm and cold win¬ 
ters also interfere with our plans. 

The soil problem is also very compli¬ 
cated where we have citrus groves on ev¬ 
ery description of land from rich, damp hammock to spruce scrub. Many small groves extend over so wide a range of soil that one side will not do well with a treatment adapted to the other side. Un¬ 
der such conditions there is no best meth¬ 
od ; every grower must have a flexible system to suit himself and his groves. 
However, I think that I gain more use¬ 
ful information at our meetings than I 
do all the year alone in my grove, and I 


regret that I can give so little in return. 

In setting out citrus trees, I prefer mid¬ 
winter for moist land but for high, thirsty soil the summer rains often make up for the other conditions, so I take that time for setting out. When the trees begin to grow I watch the tops until they are five or six feet high and if two or more buds show equal strength I take off all but one or nip the buds. This prevents a crooked tree and causes little loss of fol¬ 
iage. I prune out water sprouts and dead branches and take off the lower branches as they Come to the ground. 

In general fertilizing I use a mixture containing little nitrogen and give all the trees a good share. If they look well they need it to keep them so and if they look badly it ’will help them. Then I go over the grove with my nitrogen 'and give such trees as need fit, a dose according to their needs. If a tree is pale, with small leaves, 
or has a heavy crop a good lot is used 1 , if it has large green leaves and few fruit little or none is needed. This is not a

task for an ordinary laborer but it gives good results in keeping a grove uniform in condition. For my bearing trees I use from twenty to fifty pounds of land plast¬ 
er per tree and suppose that it does some good. I use also about twenty pounds of 
Kanit on the same supposition, where the drainage is good. But if I depended on sulphate of ammonia for my nitrogen, es¬ 
pecially in early spring when I apply most of it, I would not use the Kanit on account of the well known fact that a chlorin and a sulphate of ammonia do not act well to¬ 
gether; 

I had a great deal of trouble with my outside rows of trees. The groove is. partly surrounded by heavy timber that I did not care to destroy. I put all kind's of ferti¬ 
lizer on the outside rows and a great deal of it, but the woods looked much better than the orange treees and the application of lime was all that seemed to help the orange trees. Then I decided to dig a good deep ditch between the wood's and the grove. Now the outside trees look best and one dollar’s worth of ditching did more than ten dollars worth of ferti¬ 
lizer could have done for them. The ditches are also very useful in case of a flood. I am convinced that one wet, sobby season can do a grove more lasting injury than a dozen droughts. Also when high land does get too wet it seems h> suffer more than low land. If we can keep our ground front staying too wet and “sob¬ 
bing” off the deep feeding roots the drought will have much less effect. So a good, deep ditch even on high land may largely relieve the need for irrigation. I 
use also a lot of muck and' lime but as their action is more directly on the soil 


than as a fertilizer I will mention them under cultivation. 

Cultivation or, in a general way, the handling of the soil is the real problem in handling a citrus grove and one of which 
I know little and confess a great amount of ignorance. But for the sake of discus¬ 
sion I will beg your leniency. When I first became interested in this problem the clean culture method seemed to be gener¬ 
ally practiced. We cultivated all the year and hauled in mulch to keep up the hum¬ 
us. This seemed alright especially on very dry land where nothing would grow any¬ 
way and the weather was too warm for much summer work. But the trees seemed to show age badly and dieback and disease were too common. Then we began to let the grass grow a little after the summer rain had wet the ground thoroughly, and we could cultivate the fertilizer into the wet soil, so that the trees‘would get it be¬ 
fore the sun evaporated it. When the grass died in the fall or was used for hay we commenced over. The grass took the place of some of the mulch hauling and it seemed to do' better. About six years ago my summer fertilizer did not arrive on time, we had early rains, and as I had some beggar weed and a lot of grass the ground was covered with tender stuff. 
When the fertilizer did come I had to put it on and cultivate it in to save it. It was very easy to see the result and I decided not to try that way again. As I could not see how the sun would destroy my citrus fertilizer I next put it on before the rains began, then let the grove take care of itself till late fall, when it was a mass of tang¬ 
led and dead vegetation except where I 
had cut hay. This method seemed to me

nearly perfect and I got good results and by moving a few times there was little trouble. 

But I tried further to find just when the cultivation should cease. First I left a square of sixteen trees as soon as the bloom had 1 opened, and cultivated all oth¬ 
er trees until the first summer rain. Then the soil got dry and I cultivated a few rows again before the heavy rains. The spring drought was not severe enough to kill the weeds and grass in the test plot so it was two or three feet deep in fairly rank growth through the worst weather, but the trees looked as well as the cultivated ones and when the rains commenced they put on a much better growth* and were ahead of those cultivated. The rows culti¬ 
vated last were the last to show new growth and made the least growth and the differences were almost as appar¬ 
ent and in the same order the following season. I next turned loose a large plot about the first of April. We had a good shower which gave the weeds and grass good start and they got about eight inches high when the weather got so bad that they commenced to wither and expose the soil to the sun. Then they dried up until I thought they were all dead and the temptation to cultivate was very strong but I considered the mischief done so I let it go. I did not at that time nor have I since noticed any bad results from the neglect, but there was no appar¬ 
ent advantage except a saving of labor. So 
I have about decided that the best time to lay by is when the bloom opens if there is sufficient moisture; if not then we must cultivate until the first rains of summer. 
But on fairly moist land if a good deep growth can be secured by the first of May 


it will keep the ground cool and grow right through the drought when a small or scattering growth would die and be of no use at all. The only use of this growth in a drought is to keep the ground cool and in good condition, for I think that there is little doubt that the growth takes less moisture than would be lost by the direct heat of the sun on the soil. With irriga¬ 
tion, we can lay by when we choose and I 
would wish to get a cover before the hot weather any way. 

Four years ago about twenty-five trees in the lower corner of my grove, where the soil is rather moist and rich, showed die- 
back. I had little hope for them and have done nothing more to them except to cut down the weeds and young bushes. This season the trees in that plot are the health¬ 
iest I have and had the best crop and the best fruit on the place. So it is quite easy to consider this more perfect, except that the dead trash on the ground all winter is too tempting to fire, but closer mowing with some clean middles Would help that. 
I have thought that it would increase the danger from cold but I am not now sure of that when the more uniform condition of sap is considered. I believe that irriga¬ 
tion will be necessary to adapt this culti¬ 
vatorless cultivation to high land but irri¬ 
gation is needed anyway and this sort of cultivation will simplify irrigation and in¬ 
crease its benefits, for the final results of ir¬ 
rigation on the bare, hot sand has seemed doubtful to me. If I were dealing with a fruit like the peach which has reached per¬ 
fection through strenuous urging, or a short lifed vegetable, the result of intense culture and forcing, I would seach for more artificial means in improving them. 
While the citrus tree shows great ability

to stand forcing- and other well intended abuses, I think that it is not wholly domes¬ 
ticated and prefers some of its natural forest conditions, a sweet, moist, rich soil on which the sun cannot shine and where its delicate root system, will not be disturb¬ 
ed. To bring the soil to such a state plenty of muck, leaves or trash will be needed and a good application of ground shell or raw ground limestone will be necessary. A number of observations on shell and marl land, besides liming tests, 
make me sure on that point. And if the re¬ 
quirements of this system are filled its adoption will be almost a necessity. The reverse is also somewhat true of it. 

Why do we cultivate so much in our too active sandy citrus soils? I would not use a fertilizer on my grove that would be injured by the sunshine or would not wash into the soil with a few showers. If cultivation really saves much moisture un¬ 
der our grove conditions it is of little con¬ 
sequence under modern irrigation or on low land. If to keep the crust broken, so far as I know the sort of crust we break only forms under cultural conditions, and if we keep the top crust broken one will form just below the cultivator limit that we cannot break without injury to the roots. This also indi¬ 
cates that the soil mulch as we use it is not perfect as a mellowing agent. I think also that the apparently good results from cultivation are deceptive and may finally become destructive, especially when the soil is worked when wet or green stuff is worked into it. And the warmer the weather the greater the resulting injury will be in any case. The action of culti¬ 
vation on our active sand is as a powerful 


stimulant to the tree when it is done, 
afterwards, the reaction. 

Many of us have seen groves that for some reason were thrown out. If these trees were properly fertilized, irri¬ 
gated, mulched, and pruned with the grass mowed to return to the soil instead of clean grazing the quantity of fruit might increase to commercial proportions with¬ 
out destroying the quality. At least, we should not be complaining of bad results from fertilizing, etc., when bad cultural conditions were the cause. If any one should be favorably impressed with this idea I can only ask them to go slowly with it as I did. . But on rich, moist land the commercial possibilities of this system are especially good and it might adapt such land to citrus culture where it now fails. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mir. Mead—I have been trying some experiments in fertilizing trees lately. I 
came to the conclusion that the effect of fertilizer does not last very long, so a year ago I tried the experiment of ferti¬ 
lizing much more often than I had ever done before, giving a less quantity. Now, 
the ordinary method is to give from twen¬ 
ty to forty pounds of fertilizer to a tree all at once and several months apart. I exper¬ 
imented by giving a tree ten pounds every month. Tlie yield the very first year, al¬ 
though I began the experiment in Jan¬ 
uary, increased from an average of six, to eighteen boxes of oranges. This year the tree has grown splendidly and has set what seems to be a moderate crop of fruit, 
but it may turn out to be much better than it now seems. I used a complete orange tree fertilizer (Mape’s) the “fruit and

vine” variety for all except one applica¬ 
tion. I tried the same experiment years ago with five pounds a month on a plot of six trees, and the results were very satis¬ 
factory. The fertilizer was paid for sev¬ 
eral times over. I used a brand that con¬ 
tains 12 per cent, potash, 2 per cent, to 
3 per cent, ammonia and 8 per cent, phos¬ 
phoric acid. It is one of the standard brands for fruiting trees. 

Mr. Temple—May I ask the gentleman if he made any change in his method dur¬ 
ing the dormant period of the tree? Do I 
understand that he fertilized every month, 
the same quantity, right through the year? I would also like to- know if he found this had any effect on the tree ; that is whether it bloomed earlier in the spring, or later than trees treated as they are ordinarily. 

Mr. Mead—I gave ten pound's each calendar month. As to earliness the differ¬ 
ence is so slight as not to- merit attention. 
Possibly it did open up a little earlier but 
I think that was due to the tree being* in more vigorous health, but the difference was but a few days. Some of the trees that I did not fertilize at all last year bloomed more heavily, and some of them bloomed earlier in isolated cases. How¬ 
ever, this tree has certainly -set a good crop. 

Mr. Penny—May I ask the gentleman how the fruit on the trees ripened up; did it ripen up earlier or later, and also how was the texture of the fruit, coarse or fine, 
and -was the skin smooth or rough ? 

Mr. Mead—There was not very much difference between the trees; they all rip¬ 
ened about the same time. The fruit is not of the very best quality but as the other 


trees were similar I took it to be due to 
Other conditions than the fertilizer. I could not see any difference in the texture of the fruit. When I was fertilizing the plot of six trees the fruit was exceedingly good and smooth. I was fertilizing then with five pounds a month. I could not see that the fertilizing had 1 very much to do with the quality of the fruit. The tree was af¬ 
fected with the whitefly more or less but that did not seem to make any particular difference. 

Mr. Penny—How about the ripening? 

Mr. Mead—It ripened a little later than usual this year, but by December it was all right and shipped a little later than the middle of December. 

Dr. Richardson—Then you mean to say that you think the only difference was the increased bearing. I have heard it said that an experiment was tried in which a tree was given 300 pounds of fertilizer during the year, but after 125 pounds was given they could not see any difference in the bearing capacity or condition of the tree; that it did not seem capable of assim¬ 
ilating more than 125 pounds. 

Mr. Penny—I would like to ask Mr. 
Kilgore what kind of nitrogen he uses. 

I understand that he used nitrogen inde¬ 
pendent of his other fertilizer. 

Mir. Kilgore—I use almost any sort of 

nitrogen I can get, dependent on the sea¬ 
son. In the spring I keep my grove just as rich in nitrogen ais I dare. I get it eas¬ 
ily from the legumes, rich muck beds, etc. 
In the early spring I generally use nitrate ‘ 
of soda or nitrate potash. Later in the season I would prefer organic nit¬ 
rogen from the soil but I can only do that by allowing the weeds and grass to grow.

Mr. Penny—Then you consider nitrate M,r. Kilgore—I do, most decidedly. I

Packing and Shipping Citrus Fruits. 


MODERN METHODS OF PACKING ORANGES. 


By Lloyd S. Tenny, Pomologist. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

More than ever before in fruit grow¬ 
ing, the quality of the product as it ar¬ 
rives on the market is of first importance. 
No matter how fine the fruit may be in the orchard or packing house if it reaches the market in a decayed or poor condi¬ 
tion, the grower ultimately loses money. 
The methods of growing the fruit are of prime importance for unless it is well grown, of fine quality on the tree, free from disease and insect pests, there is no hopes of it ever being in first-class condi¬ 
tion when it reaches the market. But it is not sufficient to have the fruit in per¬ 
fect condition as it hangs on the trees ready for the harvest. The processes of harvesting and packing are almost equally important with the methods of growing for unless these methods are correct, the handling of the fruit in packing may be the means directly or indirectly of much loss from decay in transit or on the mar¬ 
ket. The work of the department of ag¬ 
riculture in California and Florida on better methods of packing oranges is suf¬ 
ficiently well known for me not to dwell long on these results. The paper which was read at the last meeting of this so¬ 
ciety at Gainesville gives the data in full 


to that time. Suffice to say that the ex¬ 
periments all lead to the belief that the methods of picking and packing the or¬ 
anges very clearly indicate what the car¬ 
rying quality will be. 

The aim of our work in Florida dur¬ 
ing the past season has been rather more practical than experimental. We have selected certain picking gangs and pack¬ 
ing houses where we have had virtually full control of the different processes to determine if careful methods can be adopted on a commercial scale and to learn how the cost of the different pro¬ 
cesses under these conditions compare with the rougher methods. Chief, too, in our work, was a desire to know how the fruit handled in this improved way car¬ 
ried to market. 

♦ 

This work is not completed as yet, and 
I shall reserve until some future time the very encouraging results which we ob¬ 
tained. We want you to know, however, 
that it has been possible to train a pick¬ 
ing gang to do good work. It has been possible to eliminate much, if not all of the rough handling in the packing-house and best of all we found that fruit picked and packed under our own supervision had splendid carrying quality and held

for two weeks after reaching the market with surprisingly little decay. 

I should like to spend more time on this subject to-night but we want to take a long trip and study some modern meth¬ 
ods and modern machines used in pack¬ 
ing oranges. The pictures which you will see will not all represent ideas which you as orange growers of Florida can incor¬ 
porate into your business, but where this is true, you may find some suggestions which under changed conditions will be of service to you. 

(Following Prof. Tenny illustrated the different packing houses in California with stereopticon views which were very interesting and we regret we cannot show the pictures here.—Secretary.) 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Tenny—A statement made this afternoon was slightly misleading. At this time of the year you would see noth¬ 
ing but clean culture but lately there has been a tremendous tendency to allow the grove to become covered, and uncultivated the greater part of the year. 

Just now, at the beginning of your rainy season it is just finishing the rainy season in California. The land should all be cultivated at the present time. There is thorough cultivation with irrigation possibly once a month during the entire summer period while there is no rain whatever. It would not be surprising if they did not have a drop of rain for the next three or four months. They irri¬ 
gate very heavily when necessary and as soon as it is possible to harrow they do so and keep this ground for about 


six or eight weeks, thoroughly pulverized. 
This is continued until usually about Sep¬ 
tember; possibly October. The rains are beginning then but only slightly, and be¬ 
fore the rains really start in they get the ground in proper shape and put on a cover crop, mostly the velvet bean and other things of that kind. They come up and grow rather rapidly during October, No¬ 
vember and December. Then it depends largely on the personality of the grower, 
but usually before the ist of February the ground is plowed and from that time it is clean cultivated. 

The wet season with them happens to be in the winter time; in your case it is the summer time. They plow rather deeply and cultivate deeply; six or eight inches. 

Mr. Kilgore—-How deep is their soil? 
Very deep? 

Mr. Tenny—Very deep; 200 or 300 
feet. It is made from the wash from the mountains, then hard pan and sub-soil in places that are hard. 

I agree thoroughly with what Mr. 
Hart stated this afternoon. From his standpoint and from the standpoint of a few packers in Florida the methods that are pursued in California look rather rough. They handle an immense amount of business, however, and it is impossible to give it the same time and attention that a small packer can give his fruit, if he will. And their orange will stand more than the Florida orange will. But as an average, I think Mr Hart will agree with me, their methods are more careful than the average methods in use in Flori¬ 
da. Of course, Mr. Hart’s methods as well as a very few others in Florida, are more careful than many in California.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


When we first started out in Califor¬ 
nia, in many places we found the fruit was elevated and allowed to run down by gravity through the various machines. 
This made a tremendous amount of rough handling. The first thought that presented itself to Mr. Powell and my¬ 
self was that this probably had some¬ 
thing to do with the decay. We took up the dropping experiments and got very excellent results. When we came to Flo¬ 
rida, for the moment I did not begin work on dropping oranges. I began to look for clipper cuts and found comparative¬ 
ly few, and long stems, but there were few of those. At the close of the first year we began dropping experiments and the 


results were startling. Sometimes we had as high as 70 per cent decay where oranges were dropped 18 inches, while oranges not dropped showed only 3 or 4 
per cent decay at the end of two weeks. 

We find there is a great deal of dif¬ 
ference shown in the effects of dropping on oranges. Some oranges will st? id a considerable amount of dropping while others are much more susceptible. 
It may be due to the fertilizer, climatic conditions; I don’t know just what it is. 
They may have a thin skin or a thick skin, but it is a fact that some will go to pieces almost immediately, while others will not show the effects for a much longer time. 


By E. H. Mote. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In discussing this subject, I wish to re¬ 
fer to some of the problems that must be solved before we begin to pack the citrus fruits, I once heard a clergyman, 'who was debating the subject: “How to Read the Bible,” begin his oration by saying: 
“You must first have a Bible to read.” He 
■had bibles to sell. We are fruit growers 
—and I wish to emphasize the fact that we must first grow the right kind of fruit, 
before successful packing is possible. 

In our discussion of this question at the last meeting of this society, Mr. W. S. 
Hart began an excellent paper on this sub¬ 
ject by saying: “We must begin by 

proper cultivation, fertilizing, etc.” 

I would place the beginning further back than that. I would begin with the 
•selection of the proper locality, and the 


preparation of die soil, before a tree is planted, or cultivation and fertilizing be¬ 
gins. The question of drainage, manage¬ 
ment of subsoil, to insure the necessary circulation of air among the root system of the tree during the growing season is the surest foundation for successful culti¬ 
vation that will insure the production of a class of fruit that will have all the excel¬ 
lent qualities of pulp and rind necessary to successful packing of fruit that will carry well, and command a price at destin¬ 
ation. 

I recall a personal experience, some years ago, when I bought the fruit in two groves, aggregating some eleven thou¬ 
sand boxes, which broke down and began rotting before I could get it out of the packing house. One evening I left the cov¬ 
er off of fifty boxes, and found, next 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


41 


morning, an average of ten to the box that were already showing signs of immediate decay. To all outward appearance, the fruit was perfect—but there was a radical defect in production that made it impossi¬ 
ble to get it to market in good shape—even by the most painstaking care in handling. 

I also call to mind that a few years ago 
—in the neighborhood where my own grove is located, that the fruit “creased” 
so badly that a large percent was lost. The fruit now produced in both the localities referred to, has been improved by proper fertilizing, drainage and cultivation, so that no difficulty is experienced in putting it into market. Of course when a grove is already planted and in bearing, these precautions cannot be taken in advance; 
but, even then, much Can be done to re¬ 
move the evil, by looking well to the cause; and, as far as possible, remedy the natural defects in the soil; so as to bring the fruit into the packing house in a pos¬ 
sible condition to be benefited by good packing. In this connection I wish to call your attention, to the fact that there is a promising outlook for the successful culti¬ 
vation of the lemon in Florida. We have all the congenial environments for this valuable citrus fruit, that can be found in any country now producing the lemon commercially. 

My own experiments in its growth— 
while not sufficiently extensive to make a hard-and-fast opinion expedient; yet, I 
have produced some samples of this fruit that are, to say the least, very encourag¬ 
ing. It will be remembered that in Cali¬ 
fornia the early efforts to cultivate the lemon promised to be a total failure—not because the natural conditions zverc zmnt- 


ing, but simply because the growers there did not know how. 

The present value of the lemon groves, 
now in that State, shows conclusively that it pays to learn how; to so combine the natural advantages which we have in abundance with the habits, of this fruit, 
in order to> make its cultivation here very profitable. I believe it will be as easy for us to succeed with the lemon in the near future, as it has been to succeed with the grapefruit in the recent past. It may, 
perhaps, be properly said that the keynote to successful packing and shipping may simply be in “knowing how.” We cer¬ 
tainly have much yet to learn as well as considerable to unlearn. We are fast learn¬ 
ing the fundamental principles of culti¬ 
vation, and are making rapid strides in producing the quality of fruit that can be successfully put into profitable mar¬ 
kets ; and, it only remains for us to learn the detail of the most perfect method in harvesting and packing. Just in this con¬ 
nection I wish to say that want of proper sanitation in harvesting, is a matter that we are too apt to overlook—especially when we consider the class of labor we are compelled to employ. 

Who has not seen the evidence of this in the eggplant, exposed for sale in our own home markets; where the print of ev¬ 
ery finger that touched the fruit in hand¬ 
ling, was marked by a decayed spot, due to the perspiration of the ungloved hand of the employes, in harvesting, for 'home use. Is it not possible that the same cause contributes to the breaking down of the citrus fruits in transit? Some of our thin rind fruit may be as susceptible to injury from this cause, as the smooth rind of the eggplant. 









42 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


One of the principal evils of our present system of packing and shipping is the want of uniformity. This is evidenced in every department of our industry. 

It is just as important that we should have a uniform system, as it is necessary for the railroads to have a uni¬ 
form gage for their tracks. Who does not remember the embarrass¬ 
ment and inconvenience that grew out of the “broad gage,” “standard gage” and 
“narrow gage” of former rival railroads. 
There must be—above all—a uniform standard of shipping boxes, applicable alike to every State in the union produc¬ 
ing the citrus friuts. 

The size of the California box is ii i-2xi i 1-2x26, slats 26 inches by 3 
while the size of the box in general use in 
Florida is 12x12x26 1-2, making a differ¬ 
ence of 12 per cent, in favor of the Cali¬ 
fornia box. This is a discrimination against Florida fruit, and the general pub¬ 
lic are not educated to note the difference. 

To them, a box of oranges, is a box of oranges—without a thought of the fact that one contains more than another. 
There seems now to be a willingness on the part of our Congress to establish a uniform package for many of the fruits entering into interstate commerce. The influence of every member of this as¬ 
sociation should be exerted to the utmost, 
to have the packages for marketing the citrus fruits included in this legislation; 
and every section engaged in the business should be compelled to use a package of the same cubical contents—or if any sec¬ 
tion persists in using a package below the standard, they should be marked, “short” 
when used in interstate commerce. 

There should be uniformity in the hand¬ 


ling and marketing of fruit, which in¬ 
volves central packing houses in different well defined, sections. 

These separate, district, packing houses should at least be under a single advisory head; so as to maintain, as far as possible, 
uniformity and co-operation in grading for each district. 

Perhaps these may be considered Uto¬ 
pian conditions in the present chaotic con¬ 
ditions of the fruit industry of Florida; 
but, my experience of one year in Cali¬ 
fornia, fully convinced me that it is im¬ 
perative—that substantially the same sys¬ 
tem*—as used in California—must, sooner or later, be introduced here. 

I venture to predict, in advance of the report of the committee lately returned from that State, that their recommenda¬ 
tions will be along this line. 

Along the line of shipping early fruit 
I wish to point out the great harm to our industry by unscrupulous buyers and growers shipping our late varieties under the brand and name of our earliest va¬ 
rieties. This is a palpable fraud and should, if possible, be regulated by the police powers of the State—making it a misdemeanor for any one to ship the im¬ 
mature and unripe late varieties under the name of the earliest varieties. It is a fact, well known to all growers, that we have early oranges that will go on the market in a fairly ripe and palatable con¬ 
dition as early as October, but it is unfair to the consumer, as well as very detri¬ 
mental to the grower, to* have the imma¬ 
ture, unripe, and sour fruit, of the latest varieties, hastily colored by artificial means, and offered to the Thanksgiving trade as an average sample of Florida oranges. Of course no* reputable grow-

er will do so himself, but do not many of our growers who sell their fruit on the trees, know that this will be done ? 

In the present condition of orange growing it is, perhaps, unavoidable that we should have oranges of several degress of excellence—good, bad and indifferent. 
The uniform influence of this society ought to be earnestly directed to educate the northern jobber to discriminate be¬ 
tween the varieties; and the degree of maturity at the different seasons; so that equal quality from any section of the 
State will command uniform prices. Per¬ 
haps, in time, this may be, to some extent, 
regulated by the shippers being compelled to ship the lowest grades of fruit in bulk, 
as the continued advance of box material will soon make it much cheaper to- pre¬ 
pare cars for bulk shipment than to pack them in costlier boxes. 

In my opinion the shipping of our fruit can be much facilitated, and more advan¬ 
tageously distributed, by selling F. O. B. 
Fruit will then move only on demand, 


and the section that can most quickly and 
Cheaply supply the desired quality; will, 
most likely, get the order. Consignment to unknown markets ought to be discour¬ 
aged ; as fruit so consigned, always comes in direct competition with purchased fruit; to the injury of bona fide buyers. 
It is quite certain that the great majority of responsible solicitors wou.ld prefer to become F. O. B. buyers, if selling were more general, and the grades made per¬ 
fectly reliable. In time all the best grades would be sold at the packing house, and only the inferior grades—from poor handling—‘would go forward on consign¬ 
ment. 

In conclusion, I want to urge the im¬ 
portance of neatness and scrupulous sani¬ 
tation in every department. Clean hands, 
clean picking boxes; bright, well seasoned packing boxes—clean, sanitary cars for carrying the fruit to market—for it is a commercial fact, that if you please the eye you touch the pocket book. 

“So mote it be.” 


By S. C. Warner. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

At the last meeting of this society we had reports from your committee on the subject before us that were extremely valuable and I can add but little to their suggestions. Permit me, however, to quote from a recent article by one who is an authority: 

“Harvesting—This is one of the most absorbing subjects of the day and de¬ 
mands the most thorough and careful in¬ 
vestigation and thought, followed by the 


most energetic action upon the part of every one engaged in the fruit industry. 
Our careless handling is costing the state thousands, yea, hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. I make the assertion that fully 90 per cent of the Florida fruit that arrives in market in bad order is at¬ 
tributed to careless clipping and careless handling. 

“All of us flatter ourselves that we are taking extra pains and doing better than our neighbors and if our fruit does not

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


reach its destination sound the fault lies with the transportation companies and not with us; when, if the truth were known fully one-fourth of our oranges wtere either punctured by the clippers, scratched by the fingernails or bruised by dropping, 
jamming against ladders, pouring into field boxes, the rough treatment by team¬ 
sters and emptying and piling into hop¬ 
pers and falling from the sizers into the bins.” This from Dr. Inman. 

It is an inconsistency not easily ex¬ 
plained why we expend so much labor and money in the production of a crop which receives such meagre attention in its preparation for market as do our cit¬ 
rus fruits. 

We have, no doubt, sometimes ques¬ 
tioned the inherent quality of our oranges to “stand up” but are not the causes of de¬ 
cay—at least in great measure—our own lack of careful, intelligent, systematic work. 

Weather conditions, when fruit is pick¬ 
ed, must be right. This, I regard as one of the important factors in successful ship¬ 
ping. Oranges should not be picked when the fruit hanging on the trees shows de¬ 
cay to any considerable extent, even when split or thorned. It is apt to be very in¬ 
convenient to lay off the hands at such a time but if the work is persisted in the results are pretty sure to be very unsatis¬ 
factory. Simple wetness, as from dew, is not important but if the degree of humid¬ 
ity is such that the decay of the fruit on the trees is very noticeable, decay of the packed fruit, even where care is otherwise used, is apt to result. 

The Somer-Hart clippers I like better than any dthers that I have used. They cut a clean, short stem and with ordinary 


care, clipper-cutting and scratching is avoided. 

As a receptacle for the picked fruit the sack should be avoided. The basket or can, with a perfectly smooth surface inside is very much safer, avoiding the pressure of the body of the workman, 
thorning and bruising. 

The grove box should be carefully made, every edge which can come into contact with the fruit being rounded and sandpapered. Its capacity should not much exceed three pecks, and the top slat being two inches below the top of the end, which we make in panel. The willow splint baskets, used by grocers, 
make a very desirable field crate, afford¬ 
ing excellent ventilation and being light to handle. 

In delivering the fruit to the washer or brushing machine it should not be piled more than two deep in the hopper—better only one layer. In emptying the field crate a canvas cover should be drawn over the top, one edge being fastened to the bottom of the hopper, and the fruit can then be poured out without bumping and bruising. 

Cleaning fruit adds to its attractive¬ 
ness and quite possibly to its keeping quality, if done with proper care. There must be no abrasion of the skin nor rup¬ 
turing of the cells from pressure. This, 
of course, would be fatal. 

Sorting is one of the most important packing house operations and should have the greatest care. Cull fruit should never pass the sorter. It would be extremely desirable if the different grades could be so standardized that it would not be a matter of mere whim or individual opin¬ 
ion as to what constitutes a “fancv” 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


45 


‘ ‘choice bright” and so on. This will, 
perhaps be one of the benefits of the new marketing system which I devoutly hope will materialize. 

As the fruit comes into the packing¬ 
house, after it has been cleaned and sort¬ 
ed, it is desirable to have room for stor¬ 
age before sizing. If boxes are used they should be so made and used as to give the best possible ventilation to their con¬ 
tents. Rack bins are, however, better. In them the fruit receives unobstructed ex¬ 
posure to the air, the pores are more quickly closed and possible scratches have a better opportunity of drying and healing over. A few hours of this treat¬ 
ment should place the fruit in good condi¬ 
tion for packing. 

One of our most successful growers dispenses with packing-house curing en¬ 
tirely by letting the fruit remain out in the grove, after picking, for about twen¬ 
ty-four hours before hauling to the pack¬ 
ing-house. If the results of a method are a measure of its sucess, this is certainly a good one. 

With the excellent machines now in use there should be no trouble in sizing prop¬ 
erly. I use the latest Maull production and find it quite satisfactory for oranges, 
grapefruit and tangerines. 

Whether the “bulge” or flat pack be adopted the box should contain all the oranges possible without bruising. There is scant excuse for a slack packed box. 

I use a press, also made by Maull. 
Some sort of press, I deem very important as the jar to the fruit in nailing down the cover should be avoided. 

Whether white or manilla paper be used or whether there be trimming is, perhaps, 
not very important but it is pretty sure to 


be a matter of satisfaction and profit to make the package as attractive as possible. 
It should be a matter of pride with us, 
as it is with the California packers. 

Stenciling and stamping should be neat and in good taste and it is well to use some distinctive motto or brand, un¬ 
less we want our work for our own suf¬ 
ficient reasons, to be anonymous. 

Let me add a few “don’ts.” 

Don’t pick your fruit when you notice split fruit decaying rapidly on the trees. 

Don’t use a grove crate holding more than three pecks. 

Don’t permit a long or pointed stem on your fruit. 

Don’t fill your grove crate so that the highest orange will touch the bottom of the crate above when stacked. 

Don’t pick into a sack. 

Don’t pour your fruit so that it will fall more than one inch unless it strikes a cushion. 

Don’t permit a sharp point or edge in crate or bin where it can come into con¬ 
tact with the fruit. 

Don’t permit long fingernails to be worn by pickers or packing-house men. 

Don’t permit jolting when the fruit is being hauled. 

With regard to artificial means of pre¬ 
venting decay, fumigation in the car has not been found to give good results. In some cases a spray or bath of ammoniacal solution of copper carbonate or bisulphate of soda has been efficient. 

There is one point that we cannot too much emphasize, the value of reputation; 
not only our individual reputation but the reputation of the Florida fruit generally. 
You are aware how sensitive the market is, how quickly there is depression when 



46 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


fruit is arriving in bad order, how quick¬ 
ly buyers turn to some other source of supply. 

We are all, to a considerable extent, de¬ 
pendent on each other for the popularity of our fruit, and in this connection there is one question I would ask you to con¬ 
sider : Whether the reputation of Florida citrus fruits has not suffered from the practice of selling on the tree, leaving the picking and packing as well as marketing to parties who have an interest only in the selling of that particular crop and not in the reputation of the fruit in a general way and which is dependent on careful 


selection as to maturity and proper hand¬ 
ling generally. Is not the manner in which much of our fruit is handled by buyers seriously detrimental to us? Having no further interest than getting results from that one crop, depending on the incident of good weather to delay decay which will ultimately result from careless handling, 
perhaps deferring it till the fruit has gone into the hands of the retailer, who suffers in consequence and then makes us suffer later. 

Is it not a fact that this practice has a very far reaching effect on the reputa¬ 
tion and popularity of our citrus fruits? 


Efforts to Secure Better Shipping Facilities 

and Rates. 


By B. J. C. Chase. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

It is recognized that we have entered upon an era of economy all over the world. The factor of shipping facilities and freight rates is important in the cost of an article to the consumer. The less value there is in an article the greater the importance of the element of freight cost. We do not undertake to say that the rates in general are too high or too low. All we ask is a square deal and equitable rates compared with other sec¬ 
tions. Rates that are given to other sim¬ 
ilarly situated localities producing com¬ 
modities that are marketed in competition with ours. This is a very complex question and we do not undertake to pass judgment on whether general freight rates are too low or too high. We merely say that when rates are established, Flor¬ 
ida and Florida products are entitled to equitable consideration. 

The Florida Fruit and Vegetable 
Shippers’ Protective Association was or¬ 
ganized in Jacksonville, Fla., January 30, 
1907, by Florida growers and shippers upon a call issued by the Gainesville Melon 
Growers’ Association to co-operate in the establishment of carload rates and car¬ 
load minimums on Florida vegetables to eastern markets. The purpose of the or¬ 
ganization was afterwards changed to se¬ 


cure more equitable rates of transporta¬ 
tion to all markets on all Florida fruits and vegetables, material and supplies per¬ 
taining thereto and to otherwise protect the interests of the fruit and vegetable growers and shippers of the State of 
Florida. 

Investigation developed the fact that 
Florida fruits and vegetables were called upon to meet constantly increasing com¬ 
petition from like commodities from 
Cuba, Jamaica and Porto Rico, Califor¬ 
nia, Mississippi and other states market¬ 
ing competitive products at the same time. 
Upon comparing rates it was found that these like commodities grown elsewhere were favored with lower freight rates whether based upon the package or upon the hundred weight and whether trans¬ 
ported by water, by rail and water, or by all-rail. 

At the time of the formation of this association Florida rates had been in ef¬ 
fect between twenty and thirty years and little or no effort had been made during that time to better conditions. While carload rates and carload minimums were in effect to western markets no carload rates or carload minimums (except on 

cantaloupes) were in effect to eastern markets. In spite of the alleged water competition, rates were and still are high- 



48 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


er in proportion to the haul to the east than to the western markets. For in¬ 
stance : 

It costs 53j4c to ship a crate of toma¬ 
toes from Palmetto, Fla., to Chicago, 
Ill., a distance of 1,384 miles, while the transportation charges on a crate from 
Palmetto, Fla., to Boston, Mass., are 69c covering a distance of 1,449 m il e s, al¬ 
though Boston is supposed to receive the benefit of competitive rates by water. 

Crystal Springs, Miss., can ship a crate of tomatoes to Chicago (a distance of 763 miles) for 26c and to Boston 
(a distance of 1,773 m il es ) for 39/4 c or 
2914 c per crate less than from Palmetto, 
Fla., although the Crystal Springs crate travels 323 miles more than the crate from Palmetto to Boston. 

Like discrimination was found to exist against practically all Florida fruits and vegetables when compared with freight charges on the same products grown else¬ 
where and going into the same markets. 

Comparative statements were submitted to the Traffic Departments of the Florida transportation companies showing freight rates 011 Florida perishable products, and similar products grown elsewhere, to the principal markets of the country and ef¬ 
forts were made to arrive at an amicable adjustment of the differences in order to put Florida fruits and vegetables on an equal footing in the markets of the coun¬ 
try. 

It is to be regretted that those in con¬ 
trol of the Florida transportation com¬ 
panies failed to meet the growers and shippers in a spirit of fairness or to show the slightest desire to encourage and pro¬ 
mote Florida fruit and vegetable indus¬ 
tries. As a last resort, the association 


was compelled to file a complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the case was heard in Washington, D. C., 
continued and completed in Jacksonville, 
Fla. Under the decisions and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission 
Florida growers have made the following substantial gains in freight rates: 

ORANGFT, GRAPEFRUIT AND PINEAPPLES. 

On all-rail shipments to Atlantic sea- 
coast and interior eastern markets, in a territory bounded on the west by Pitts- 
burg and Buffalo and east including the 
New England States, the carriers are re¬ 
quested to establish carload rates with a minimum of 300 boxes or crates and rates have been reduced from 4C2C as high as fifteen (15) cents per box and 


per crate as follows: 

Baltimore, reduced from.47 y 2 c to 43c 

Philadelphia, reduced from. 48y 2 c to 44c 

New York, reduced from. 50y>c to 46c 

Boston, reduced from.59c to 51c 

Buffalo, reduced from.60.8c to 53c 

Pittsburg, reduced from.60.4c to 52c 

Providence, reduced from.59c to 51c 


VEGETABLES. 

The reduction by the commission on shipments of vegetables via rail and water to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York and Boston is five cents (5c) per crate of fifty pounds, which is a reduction from the old rates of fifteen to twenty-five per cent. On cabbage and potatoes via rail and water the rates have been reduced as follows: 

Cabbage— To Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York reduced from 54c to 44c and to Boston from 63c to 52c per barrel or barrel crate of 120 pounds. 

Potatoes— To Baltimore, Philadel¬ 
phia and New York reduced from 60c 10 
50c and to Boston from 70c to 60c per

49 


barrel or per barrel crate of 185 pounds. 
The all-rail rate to Boston was reduced from 53c to 49c per crate of 50 pounds, 
and from $1.06 to 98c per barrel. 

Strawberries —The minimum load¬ 
ing of two hundred crates at the rate of 
$1.80 per crate from Starke and Lawtey to New York was reduced to a minimum of one hundred and seventy-five crates. 

The above rates have been in effect during the past shipping season and will be instrumental in saving hundreds of thousands of dollars to Florida growers. 

During the past season, we estimate that 4,429 cars of oranges and grapefruit passed through the Potomac yards to mar¬ 
kets supplied through that gateway upon which there was a saving of over $100,- 
000. 

We have every reason to believe that a great saving will be made to the pine¬ 
apple growers on all-rail shipments into the same territory although the volume of the pineapple shipments will not ag¬ 
gregate as many carloads as the orange shipments. Even if no further concessions are had these reductions mean much to the Florida growers. 

I11 addition to the reductions in rates this association has also been instrumental in securing consideration from the trans¬ 
portation companies in the matter of di¬ 
verting cars in transit and protecting through carload rates in order to avoid over supplying one market and leaving other markets comparatively bare. 

Transportation companies have also withdrawn altogether, and modified, 
other objectionable clauses that inter¬ 
fered with the proper distribution of 
Florida products. 

At the suggestion of this association, 


the Florida East Coast Railway has in¬ 
serted in its tariff a clause providing for the shipment of mixed carloads of fruits and vegetables making the carload rate on each commodity apply and we feel rea¬ 
sonably assured that other transportation companies operating in Florida will fol¬ 
low the lead of this road. This will en¬ 
able Florida growers and shippers to place mixed cars of Florida products in the small markets of the country that are not in a position to handle to advant¬ 
age a straight car of the different com¬ 
modities. 

In its report the commission stated that “all-rail rates on vegetables were too high.” It suggested that the Florida rad- 
roads put into effect to Atlantic sea coasts and interior eastern markets an all-rail minimum carload and all-rail rates from 
Florida base points approximately as fol¬ 
lows : 

33c per crate of 50 lbs. to Baltimore . . .now 40c 

34c per crate of 50 lbs. to Philadelphia .now 41c 

36c per crate of 50 lbs. to New York . . .now 43c 

42c per crate of 50 lbs. to Boston .now 49c 

with corresponding rates to interior points. 

The Interstate Commerce Commission also stated that “in their opinion rates on oranges to the west from Florida ought to be less perhaps to the Ohio River points and ought to be less from Ohio 
River points to destination, and ought not to be higher on the average than rates from California.” In event the carriers do not put reduced rates into effect the 
Commission’s attention may be called to the matter later on.” 

As the transportation companies have failed to act upon the suggestions of the 
Commission, the Association has filed an amended complaint covering vegetable rates and minimums under ventilation and

refrigeration to eastern markets, and rates on oranges, pineapples and vege¬ 
tables into markets north of the Ohio and west of the Mississippi Rivers. 

Please understand that we are not ask¬ 
ing for lower rates on Florida products compared with rates from other sections but only want to be permitted to go into the markets of the country on an equal, 
or the same, basis as competitive products produced elsewhere. We have confidence in the merits of Florida products winning out with a fair profit to the producer, pro¬ 
vided they are not badly handicapped and discriminated against in the way of freight and refrigeration charges. 

At the present time the Florida, pine- 
apple growers are treated to an object lesson in preferred attention and expedit¬ 
ed service given to Cuban pineapples at a time when Florida pineapples and Cu¬ 
ban pineapples are moving into the mar¬ 
kets of the country in open competition. 

Is it fair that a product produced with 
American labor should have to pay a higher freight rate over the same rails and on a shorter haul to reach the Amer¬ 
ican markets than a product produced by cheap foreign labor? The rate on Cuban pineapples (in crates) from Havana to 
Chicago, via Knights Key, is 66 * 4 c per crate with a minimum of 250 crates per car while the rate on a crate of Florida pineapples from Miami, Fla., to Chicago, 
with a minimum carload of 300 crates, is 
92.6c per crate or a greater charge of 
26 cents per crate, or $78 a car more on 
Florida pineapples for a shorter haul by nearly 250 miles than on Cuban pineap¬ 
ples. The same railroads are giving the 
Cuban pineapples special attention and running special trains through to Chi¬ 


cago on a schedule of 2^ days whereas it takes a car of Florida pineapples, mov¬ 
ing over the same route, from Miami to 
Chicago anywhere from five (5) to eight 
(8) days. When you take into consider¬ 
ation the fact that Cuban pineapples cost less to produce and less to ship than Flor¬ 
ida pineapples the outlook is not encour¬ 
aging for the Florida growers. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that the Florida grower feels that he :s not getting a square deal. 

While this association was not formed to handle the tariff on Florida products, 
it was called upon to do so. Members of the association appeared before the Ways and Means Committee and filed briefs on 
Florida fruits and vegetables. The pres¬ 
ent duty of one cent (ic) a pound on citrus fruits will undoubtedly be con¬ 
firmed in the pending tariff bill* but it looks doubtful if the pineapple growers would receive the protection they are entitled to. Strong pressure has been brought to bear from the importers and canners of Cuban pineapples and it does not look hopeful for Florida pineapple growers, who are asking for a duty of y 2 z per pound on Cuban pineapples. 

In closing, let me request closer co¬ 
operation amongst the Florida growers in questions pertaining to the general good of all interests. It is not fair that the bur¬ 
den be borne by a few and not shared by all. In California the growers au¬ 
thorize the marketing organizations to de¬ 
duct a fraction of a cent per package from all products shipped as individual contri¬ 
butions toward a general fund to be used in securing equitable freight rates, proper tariff and correcting abuses and bettering conditions. 


Irrigation. 


By A. H. Bourlay. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I have been appointed to give an ad¬ 
dress on irrigation. My experience in this line is limited to the overhead system on vegetables. This is a more expensive system; to install than some others, and has not the advantage of drainage as well as irrigation which the subirrigation sys¬ 
tem has. I believe the subirrigation is by far the most preferable where it is prac¬ 
tical. 

Our land being a clay with only a few inches of top soil, we cannot lay tiling deep enough to allow cultivation, and when laid in the clay the water will not spread out through the soil, a few feet on each side only being dampened. 

We tried flooding but soon found where there was much fall our ground was washed and in small dips and hollows too much water collected and the crops were damaged more than by drought, 
where other spots did not get enough. 

Overhead or sprinklers would also have to be used where the subsoil of clay or marl is too deep down to hold the water and cause it to spread. 

With us no artesian water can be had and where clear water from the lakes is not available wells have to be sunk. I say clear because if the supply contains seeds or floating particles one has to use strain¬ 
ers, and strainers in the pipes cut down 


pressure and if strained at source of sup¬ 
ply, I find the strainers are continually clogged as the current draws everything towards them. With wells this trouble does not occur. We get water at a depth of 90 feet and upward but several wells have been sunk over 200 feet and no wat¬ 
er obtained, so it is as well to- be sure of water before doing anything. The amount of lift and location of supply being im¬ 
portant factors in the amount of power needed to get pressure. When buying an engine it is economy to get one larger than you think you will need; an engine not run to its full capacity will last longer and give better satisfaction, and allow for ex¬ 
tensions. With plenty of power so as to get 30 to 40 pounds to the square inch and nozzles two and one-half to three feet apart on the laterals, every forty-eight feet apart thorough wetting can be given in a few hours and followed, in a few days by a working, is better than frequent light wetting for vegetables. Sometimes one soaking is enough to make a crop, 
whereas without it there would have been a failure. 

The lay of the plant depends largely on the shape of the ground to be irrigated; 
one wants to have the rows or beds run with the fall of the land and the laterals should run the same way that it is the most desirable to run the rows or beds. 



52 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


We use live oak posts eight feet long* 
which place our lateral lines six feet overhead. The main can be overhead or laid underground with i 1-2 or 2-inch uprights to connect with laterals. It is possible to use the same lateral lines on both sides of the main by having the miain running through the center of the field. 
One of my neighbors has done this; it only taking himself and one man two days to move and set up two acres, thereby ir¬ 
rigating four acres with little more ex¬ 
pense than two. We use centrifugal pumps, as they give a steady pressure, but 
I know that others give good satisfaction. 


We find it best to water late in the aft¬ 
ernoon and at night, the water has time to soak in and there is no danger of scalding. 
It is thought that lake or pond water is preferable to well water, but I have not found this to be the case, there being no difference only with well water there is not the danger of the nozzles being stopped up by vegetable matter, etc. 

The cost per acre for pipe, posts, noz¬ 
zles, etc., is about $75; to this must be added cost of engine, water supply and main, which is governed by the number of acres. The larger the plant the less the cost per acre. 


By W. F. Holmes. 


Mr. President t Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The subject of irrigation in Florida presents a most interesting study. The different varieties of soil, the location and the source of supply form, the principal parts of this study. I shall only be able to touch upon this subject from an expe¬ 
rience with the flowing wells and a sys¬ 
tem that while in use in some districts, 
does not employ the same means of con¬ 
struction. Practical and (cheap has it proven to be. The expense of irrigation with any system, is no small matter and we are all interested in learning* of a cheaper way. 

A comparatively small area in Florida furnishes flowing wells. 

Quoting from Bulletin No. 1 of the 
Florida Geological Survey: 

There are two principal artesian areas : 
the East Coast area and the Southern 
Gulf Coast area. Flowing wells on the 


East Coast have been obtained as far south as Palm Beach, although the water in the well at this last locality was too salty for use. Flowing wells at or near the sea level have been obtained along the Pin¬ 
ellas Peninsula. 

The conditions which exist in central 
Florida are not favorable for obtaining flowing wells. The crest of the anticline lies not far from the center of the penin¬ 
sula. The dip from the crest is most rap¬ 
id to the east. Under these conditions pressure sufficient to cause a flow along the side of the anticline would result from the presence of an overlying relatively im¬ 
pervious stratum acting as a confining agent and preventing the escape of the water. 

The springs of Florida are famous for their volume of flow as well as for the clearness and beauty of their water and the beautiful scenery about them,. Many of these springs are used as health re-

sorts. The United States Geological Sur¬ 
vey volume on Mineral Resources reports the sale of mineral waters in Florida for 
1907 as 43,430 gallons, valued at $12,378. 

So much for supply. Now for the ap¬ 
plication. 

The system known as the Sanford sys¬ 
tem of subirrigation is the one in use here in Daytona and the one of which I wish to speak. The well or source of supply is turned into a main running across the field and at intervals of 25 feet the main is tapped by a head box furnishing an outlet for the water into a lateral laid with two or three-inch clay or cement tile. This lateral leading to the op¬ 
posite side of the field to a drain ditch, 
at which point stop boxes are set and by plugging the tile in the stop box the land could be very quickly wet enough for any purpose. During a wet season the water is turned off and the laterals open, which acts as drainage equally as well as for ir¬ 
rigation. If this does not furnish a per¬ 
fect system of irrigation I have never seen one. The land should be nearly level, if it is not the rows of tile 25 feet apart should be put in parallel with the slope so that the lower end should be only a few inches to the 100 vards lower than when the water is turned in. The water supply being at the highest point and by gravity running through the entire system and discharging into the drainage ditch at the lowest. The supply of water can be reg¬ 
ulated so as to irrigate the entire field at one time or confined to a single row of the tile or as many as desired. This makes it possible to grow in the same field a variety of crops, though some may re¬ 
quire a very wet soil and other the oppo¬ 
site. 


Where the field is only part level, one part being lighter and dryer soil a set of boxes may be placed between the ditch and the main at the line of demarkation, 
thus furnishing a supply to the level place without injury to the land and wetter part. 

We found it of advantage to run deep furrows in planting to come between and in the center of the 25 feet rows of tiling, 
making the field into beds, this in case of heavy rains provided another means of draining off the water. The advantage of being able to use the system to water a seed bed very wet and another bed com¬ 
paratively dry, can be appreciated at a glance and 1 the two dangers to farming, 
too much or too little water, are under en¬ 
tire control. 

We cannot say what the value of this system would be when applicable to other seeds and in other localities where water is scarce and expensive. 

One authority claim|s in addition to points named above that the tile drain carry warmth and air, or rather warm air to the roots of growing crops, and won¬ 
derfully quicken their growth, and that more than this, that the same crop has been grown on the same ground for a dozen years and with splendid results. 

Now a few words about the construc¬ 
tion and material used': Here in Daytona we have mostly cement. Plow and dig out your ditches. We have a machine placed in the ditch into' which we feed our mixture, and the tile is laid in one contin¬ 
uous piece across the field, slightly cover¬ 
ed as you gO' to hold it in place before the tiling hardens. Say 3 or 4 days when the ditch can be covered—before covering openings can be sawed into the tile, say 


r>4 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


every 3 feet, or as often as needed. If the mixture is just right, no openings need be made, as I have seen an opening made of both cement and day tile and watched one fill up as rapidly as the other when the water was turned on. 
With a supply of water, and the cement 


expense provided for, this system can be put iu at a less expense over clay tile of about 1-3 or about $100.00 per acre, every¬ 
thing hired. And with a man furnishing his own labor the cost can be reduced to figures much less scary than the average cost of irrigation. 


By H. B. Stevens. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When the subject of irrigation is men¬ 
tioned, to our mind at once comes the pic¬ 
ture of a large irrigation ditch, and ground, being flooded with water as we see accounts of its being done in the 
West; where their soil is firm and will permit of water flowing over without soaking in too fast. With a sigh we say to ourselves, but that is not for Florida. 

Yes, even that is possible in some parts of Florida. Other parts have sub-irriga¬ 
tion by means of tiling laid under ground, 
through which the water is turned. 

To most orange growers, the question is, can we have irrigation at all, when we cannot use ditches as is done in the West? 
If we turned to the dictionary we will find that the first definitions given for the word Irrigate, is “to water, to wet, to moisten, to bedew,” and surely we can do something along this line. Then the ques¬ 
tion at once comes, will this kind of irri¬ 
gating amount to enough to make it pay ? 

At times, yes, if applied properly and well followed up. When it is dry enough in Florida to> make watering necessary, 
and we begin to water, we must keep it up until sufficient rain falls to wet the ground deeper than we have been doing with our 


watering, otherwise the water we have been putting on will only serve to draw the fibre roots to the surface, to get the mois¬ 
ture. We stop watering, and not suffi¬ 
cient rain coming, these roots die, and our trees are worse off than if we had not be¬ 
gun the watering, but if the watering is well followed up, the benefit will show in the trees and crop. 

If trees are to be planted, then the irri¬ 
gating plant is very useful in pushing them along, and may be the saving of a good interest on its cost, in lessening the number of trees to be replaced the next year, so making a saving, in time, and cost of trees. 

If spraying is to be done the irrigating plant is a great help. 

If the whitefly is to be fought with fun¬ 
gus* the irrigating' plant can help to has¬ 
ten its growth by being used to moisten the leaves. 

The cost of piping a grove and keeping up a steam plant, deter many a grower from putting in one. To such as do not have to go too deep for water, I would recommend a plan that would lessen the cost. 

Instead of piping the entire grove, have a number of wells, at proper distances, 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

and have the power and pump- mounted, 
either on a tram car, or on wheels, so it can be mo-ved from; well to well. Pump from each well, and from the pump lay a line of iron pipe coupled together with brass hose couplings, so that it can be coupled and uncoupled quickly without the use of anything but a hose spanner. To the end section, attach one length ot good 
'hose to- enable the water to be turned in any direction ; in this manner a grove can be very rapidly watered and at but little cost. 

The writer once fitted up an outfit of this kind that pumped from five wells and one pond, and watered a 125 acre grove; 
the entire cost of the outfit, did not ex¬ 
ceed $1,500 and did the work as well as another plant that was put in to water a 
200 acre grove and costover $12,000. 

To sum up, irrigation is not an absolute necessity in Florida as it is in some states, 
but can be made to serve a very good pur¬ 
pose if properly used'. 


Washington, D. C, May 8, 1909. 
Mr. E. 0 . Painter, 

Sec. State Horticultural Society, 
Jacksonville, Florida. 

My Dear Sir: 

A trip this month to the Southwestern 
States and Territories will prevent me from accepting your kind invitation to be present at the annual meeting of the Flor¬ 
ida Horticultural Society to be held at 
Daytona May 18 to 21. Our office will be represented by Mir. Milo B. Williams, 
who is in charge of irrigation in the hum¬ 
id regions and I trust he will be able to- 
convince your members of the necessity of a helpful co-operation between the 


fruit growers of Florida and the irriga¬ 
tion branch of this Department. 

Compared with the arid region the cit¬ 
rus districts of Florida have an abundant annual rainfall but since 'much of this is waste in run off during heavy down¬ 
pours, the amount which the roots of trees- 
can obtain is frequently below rather than above what is required. Then, too, long periods occur when little rain falls. The 
Weather Bureau records show that at Or¬ 
lando from November 1, 1906, to March 
31, 1907, a period of five months, the rainfall was only a trifle more than half an inch. The quantity of water required by the citrus orchards of Riverside, Cali¬ 
fornia, including both irrigation and rain water, averages about 3 inches a month. 
For the past nine years at Tampa, Flor¬ 
ida, the average rainfall during October and November has been only 1 1-2 inches per month and for more than half the year it is considerably below three inches per month. 

The preliminary investigations made by Mr. Williams in your State during the past winter have convinced him of the need of installing irrigation plants to sup¬ 
plement the natural rainfall and as an in¬ 
surance against crop failures during dry periods. The lakes, rivers and artesian basins of the Peninsula furnish abundant water supplies at low cost and the onlv questions that are deserving of careful consideration are the installation of the right kind of a pumping plant that will perform efficient service, the adoption of the hest distribution system when both economy and efficiency are the main fac¬ 
tors, and the application of water in such a way and by the use of such implements, 
as will best serve the objects sought.

This Office has been studying such questions in the West for the past ten years and if any of the experience thus gained or the data collected' will prove of 


service to your industry, we shall endeav¬ 
or to place both at your disposal. 

Respectfully yours,

By Prof. Milo B. Williams. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

In the advancements that are being made in the science of agriculture at the present day, the farmer is realizing more and more the value of being able to under¬ 
stand and control the factors entering into plant growth. 

Among the most important factors en¬ 
tering into plant growth is that of mois¬ 
ture, and therefore throughout the agri¬ 
cultural districts of the world a study is being made of moisture, its supply, and the demands of vegetation for moisture. 

Nature transports moisture from place to place on the earth’s surface, but her transportation service and supply is more or less imperfect to meet the demands of the up-to-date farmer. These imperfec¬ 
tions of nature can be perfected to a great extent by the application of one of the engineering sciences, drainage or irriga¬ 
tion, drainage where there is an excess of moisture for agricultural purposes and irrigation where there is a deficiency of moisture for agricultural purposes. 

During the past six months I have had an opportunity of studying the conditions in the state of Florida with regard to ir¬ 
rigation and I have prepared in this study a few charts in an attempt to picture the rain fall representative to Florida, so that 
I may see with you the imperfections of 


your moisture supply as given to you by nature. 

REFERENCE TO CHARTS. 

In referring to the charts the follow¬ 
ing points were brought out. 

Chart No. i : Showing the average rainfall per month froffi 1900 to 1908 
inclusive at Orlando, Florida. That the average rainfall for the mpnths of Novem¬ 
ber, December, January, February and 
April fell below three inches; that the av¬ 
erage rainfall for the months of March and October was less than four inches, 
making a period of seven months that the average of precipitation is light. That the extremes of the average monthly rainfall are from 1.14 inches in Novem¬ 
ber to 8.77 inches in June, bringing out the unevenness in distribution of the rain¬ 
fall throughout the years, as an average. 

Chart No. 2: Comparing the average monthly rainfall at Milan, Italy. The ob¬ 
ject in preparing this chart was to place before the people a picture of the precipi¬ 
tation in the district that has irrigated for a century so that the eye can draw a com¬ 
parison of conditions existing where ir¬ 
rigation has proven to be of value and the conditions existing in Florida. The most prominent difference in the comparison of 
Florida conditions with those of Milan, 
Italy is the unevenness of the distribution throughout the year in Florida, Milan showing a minimum of 2 1-2 inches of

57 


rainfall in any one month and a maxi¬ 
mum of 5 3-4 inches. 

Chart No. 3: Shewing the distribution of the rainfall in the year of 1908 as the best monthly distribution in any one year 
-since 1900. These guagings were taken at 
New Smyrna, Florida. The minimum pre¬ 
cipitation in any one month was .32 of an inch; the maximum was 21.49 inches with a total rainfall of 63.80 inches for the year. 

Chart No. 4: Showing the largest dry spell since 1900, coming in the twelve months between August 1, 1906 and Au¬ 
gust 1, 1907. Guagings were taken at Or¬ 
lando, Florida, September, October, Nov¬ 
ember and December, 1906, January, Feb¬ 
ruary, March, April and May, 1907, went below three inches of rainfall per month. 
In November and December, 1906, and in 
January, February and March, 1907, the total rainfall was only .53 of an inch in these five months. During this period Riv¬ 
erside, California, was using three inches of water per month to mature and set her orange crop. During this extreme dry period fruit was damaged and in some places almost a failure in Florida. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Temple—You state that in Cali¬ 
fornia they supplied three inches by irriga¬ 
tion. Did they put on three inches dur¬ 
ing July, August, etc., or did they vary the quantity applied to suit the season? 
The good Lord has varied the rain in 
Florida to suit the seasons and 1 it is during the dormant period with us that the dry spell comes while in the growing season there is plenty of rain, usually. What I 


mean to say is, did they supply the same amount of water or did they vary it to suit the requirements of the trees? 

Mr. Williams—They do. You may know better than I how their orange crop comes off with yours. Their trees are dormant nearly at the same time yours are. The point I wish to bring out is that during your dry period here they are sup¬ 
plying three inches of water per month to their trees. The condition of your trees runs somewhat parallel to those of 
Riverside. 

Mr. Member—Is it necessary for them to have three inches every month ? 

Mr. Williams—No, but it is necessary to have three inches of rainfall here when they are supplying the same amount there. 

Prof. Rolfs—Our trees are dormant a little later than their trees I think. It is not necessary for us to have three inches every month. It is more necessary that we have more than three inches this month and 1 every month when it is needed. 

Mr. Williams—We have not had time to study the conditions of citrus trees here, so we use the California irrigation as a basis. 

Dr.* Richardson—I think it is a good idea to explain to the Society the differ¬ 
ence in the seasons in California and here. 
Their rainfall comes in the winter, while with us the rain comes in the summer, and the dormant season usually comes in the winter. They get their rain during their dormant season while we get ours during the growing season in the summer. Con¬ 
sequently the conditions are radically dif¬ 
ferent. 

Mr. Bunch—Is three inches all that is necessary during any month ? 

Mr. Williams—'Approximately three 






58 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


inches of water per month is the amount that the records show the Riverside peo¬ 
ple use. Whether they are using too lit¬ 
tle or too much is for the horticulturalists to decide. 

Mr. Bunch—Those who study irriga¬ 
tion come to a proper understanding and knowledge and know just how much a tree should have for certain climatic and atmospheric conditions. Of course a per¬ 
son has to have a certain discretion about the amount of water to give to a tree and he must learn to judge accordingly wheth¬ 
er it has enough water or not. A young tree especially may be killed by using too much water and literally drowning it out, 
I have seen some persons who were so anxious to make the trees grow th&t they simply kept the trees soaked and the re¬ 
sults were far from satisfactory. 

Mr. Williams—The truthfulness of your observation has been brought out in arid districts very forcibly. As a matter of fact we always consider that after a cer¬ 
tain area has been opened up by irrigation that a drainage system will necessarily follow. One of the greatest faults of the farmer in the West is that if he can get the water he will over irrigate and under cultivate. 

In the question of rainfall, as to wheth¬ 
er or not irrigation is needed the total 

annual rainfall runs from fortv to sixtv 

✓ •* 

inches, but the bulk of this may come in just a very few months, leaving the bal¬ 
ance of the year void of moisture to sup¬ 
ply maximum plant growth. This period of deficiency of moisture often comes in and extends over the time of the year when it is of most vital importance that the orchardist have an abundance of moisture to insure a crop of good fruit. 


The way in which the rain comes and the character of the soil upon which it falls enter into conserving of the mois¬ 
ture. Florida receives most of her rain¬ 
fall in torrential storms, making the run¬ 
off heavy and beating down the surface of the ground. 

The sandy soil in the greater portion of the State is an aid to moisture recep¬ 
tion, but unless properly cultivated will prove a hindrance to the best of moisture retention. 

The natural resources for irrigation in 
Florida are very encouraging. Lakes, riv¬ 
ers, surface wells, artesian wells and seep¬ 
age and drainage waters furnish water supplies fairly well throughout the State. 
These supplies may be brought to the sur¬ 
face by pumping plants, flowing wells or gravity systems and then distributed to the orchards through piping, flumes or ditches. 

The methods of application must vary 
.with the varying conditions from furrows and checks to sprays. Sub-irrigation is not used extensively for orchards. 

Prof. Rolf—Is sub-irrigation not prac¬ 
tical ? 

Mr. Williams—It has been tried in 
California fora number of years. The greatest trouble is that the roots get into the pipes. However, their soil does not respond to lateral percolation as some of your soil will. 

In my short investigations in Florida I 
have noted many difficulties where at¬ 
tempts in irrigation have been made. The feature that strikes me most strongly is the great expense per acre the Florida. 
orchardist has gone to in distributing systems for applying water to his trees. 
It is probable that the Floridian is paying

ten times as much per acre for his irriga¬ 
tion as the orchardist in the West. This is due to several interesting causes. The 
State of Florida has a soil that will not support water in ditches as Western soils will. Neither will it respond to the cheap¬ 
er methods of irrigation in all cases be¬ 
cause of its natural character. 

I have found in many places that poor¬ 
ly designed systems have been placed and sad engineering mistakes made, compell¬ 
ing the farmer to pay for more expensive material than was necessary to obtain the results he wished. 

The work the United States Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture wishes to do in your 
State is to make a fair comparison of the methods we find being used in Florida with the methods we find being used in the West and adapt the cheaper methods as far as possible, and modify the expen¬ 
sive methods when practicable. 

New implements for laying out and building ditches and cheaper water con¬ 
duits must be worked out, and laborers taught how to run water. It has been a great disappointment to many people who have made trips through the West and seen water running peacefully and smooth¬ 
ly over the surface to find that they are un¬ 
able to control water and get an even dis¬ 
tribution when trying the same methods in Florida. 

We feel that by co-operative work with your State Experimental Station and with individual farmers we can help you solve the irrigation problem! in Florida in a more economical way. As time goes on we will have more definite data to give you and hope to meet you with some pleasing results in the future. 

Mr. Member—What do vou think 

j 


of the overhead system as used in this 
State ? 

Mr. Williams—The system of over¬ 
head irrigation for citrus trees seems to us to be impracticable, although we are not prepared to condemn any system now being used in your state. It certainly seems as though there would be oppor¬ 
tunity for heavy evaporation losses and that there are better ways of irrigating than by throwing the water into the air and letting it come down in a large area on trees and earth. 

Mr. Van Dormer—How about irrigat¬ 
ing vegetables ? 

M,r. Williams—I think the people who are familiar with the growing of vege¬ 
tables in your State can tell you many ad¬ 
vantages in spray irrigation for vegeta¬ 
bles. However, I believe there is room for comparison with cheaper methods in many vegetable fields and 1 that more economical and simpler methods of appli¬ 
cation will be used after the comparison. 

Mr. Van Dormer—In our sandy soil there seems to be a hindrance to the ap¬ 
plication of water by letting it run on the surface. It will run into the soil so fast that it makes very little headway in the trench and one end of the trench will be soaking and the water not yet to the other end. 

Mr. Williams—Where the conditions are of that nature and it becomes abso¬ 
lutely impossible to supply water on the surface then you must resort to more ex¬ 
pensive methods. 

Prof. Rolfs—How far were you able to run water in the ditches that you made in the preliminary experiments? 

Mr. Williams—In our experiments we have not been able to obtain the head of

water nor the body of water that we de¬ 
sired, but we ran water in furrows 600 
feet in length, getting a fairly good distri¬ 
bution where the furrows were laid out on a proper grade. I think, however, it is not advisable to run more than 400 feet unless ideal lay of the land would en¬ 
courage longer distances. 

Mr. Member—How much water 

were you running into the furrows? 

Mr. Williams—We were running about 15,000 gallons per hour and apply¬ 
ing it in three furrows. 

Mr. Gillett—-What is the nature of that soil, and is the ground fairly level or quite hilly ? 

Mr. Williams—The soil is representa¬ 
tive of that large area around Orlando. 
Just how would you classifv it. Prof. 
Rolfs? 

Prof. Rolfs—First-class pine land. 
Rather close. 

Mr. Gillett—It seems to me that in view of the three years drought which we have just passed through, this matter of irrigation is one of the most important matters which will be brought before this 
Association, and one which should be dis¬ 
cussed very thoroughly. It is of interest to every man who is growing citrus fruits as there is no doubt that every grower in the State has suffered more or less every year, but especially in the past two or three years because of lack of moisture. 

I have had considerable experience with irrigation and have tried to do what 
Prof. Williams says he is doing. I, how¬ 
ever, failed when I tried to run water in ditches on high pine land, and I do not agree with him that this method will be eventually adopted, as I am strongly in favor of a sprinkling system. When we 


tried to run water in ditches before the stream got far enough away from its source to> do any good it disappeared en¬ 
tirely, and where we put water enough in the ditch to carry it any great distance the force of the stream tore the ground all to pieces and it was simply impossible to maintain a ditch in our loose sand. 

I have seen a good deal of irrigation in 
California but it is impossible to compare their conditions with ours. As Dr. Rich¬ 
ardson has said, their rainy season comes in the winter while ours comes in the summer. Their soil is heavy and the water will percolate through it so that with two or three ditches between the rows they can thoroughly soak their land, 
which in our loose sand is an utter im¬ 
possibility. 

I have a brother in California who had charge for many years of a large grove, 
and I have visited him on several occa¬ 
sions and watched their irrigation meth¬ 
ods. During the growing season they water frequently, but along in October and November they take off the water and do not apply any more as they wish to keep their trees dormant, and the win¬ 
ter rains furnish all the moisture neces¬ 
sary. Their climate being much colder than ours the rain fall does not seem to affect the trees during the winter, and no matter how much it rains they con¬ 
tinue dormant. Just the reverse of this obtains in Florida, as if we have plenty of rain and a week or ten days of hot weather, the conditions for growth—heat and moisture, will start our trees into a growth which is easily caught by the cold. 

Judging from the methods I have seen employed in California and Arizona, and

the experiments I have personally made in Florida, I am convinced that the only possible way to irrigate our groves, at least those located on high pine land, is by overhead distribution. It is, of course, at the start quite expensive, but I have tried it with hose and I know of many others who have done likewise and with very few exceptions it has been a failure. In the first place, hose are ex¬ 
pensive, and our experience was that they went to pieces in one or two years. It took a large number of men to operate this system, and it was my experience that just at the time we wanted to irri¬ 
gate we were very busy with other work and we would look at the sky and make up our minds that it was going to rain in a few days, saying to ourselves if it did not we would irrigate. Perhaps it might rain a little shower which did no good, 
and thinking that perhaps the drought had broken we would continue putting it off until when we finally decided we had to do it the ground had become so dry it took an immense amount of water to do any good. 

In our part of the State around Winter 
Haven, where my grove and nursery are located, it has been so dry for the past three years that on many occasions it would seem that the trees would burn had you touched a match to the leaves. I have often expected to see the whole crop of leaves drop off and while this did not take place and while the trees managed to pull through, there is no question but what they sustained a terrible shock from want of moisture, and while in this weak¬ 
ened condition insects and disease of all kinds are much more apt to prey upon the trees. 


I am figuring on putting in a system of irrigation in a new nursery I am starting, 
and I am adopting a plan which I think will be thoroughly effective. The trouble with most people when they start to irri¬ 
gate is that they want lots of water but expect to get it through small pipes, and invariably the pipes are altogether too small. I have seen as high as ten inch op¬ 
enings on a i 1-4 inch pipe, and of course this was an utter failure. 

The idea of irrigation it seems to me is to get water and plenty of it, and un¬ 
less you do this it is money thrown away. 
My plan for irrigating a ten acre tract is to run a 6-inch main through the center. 
My trees will 24 fee apart. I will run a 2 1-2 inch lateral every 48 feet and this will take care of a row of trees on each side of it necessitating but one lateral be¬ 
tween every other two rows. I will put a cross in this lateral opposite the trees in each of these two rows and run a 3-4 inch pipe from the lateral to within one foot of the tree, which will allow room for the growth and expansion of the trunk. I 
will then run a pipe over the top of the tree, putting thereon some first-class spray nozzle. This pipe will be six or seven feet high and I will wire it to a good, solid stake until the tree gets large enough so that it can be fastened to the limbs. As the tree grows this pipe will be extended, 
always keeping it well above the top of the tree. 

There will be a valve on each of these laterals close to the main. As many lat¬ 
erals will be opened as the pump can sup¬ 
ply with water, and as fast as the section covered by the opened nozzles is thor¬ 
oughly wet down these laterals will be closed and others opened. My engineer 


62 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tells me that I can easily distribute one to one and a half inches on five acres of land in twelve hours, and I will expect to do this at night when there will be practical¬ 
ly no evaporation, and when the water on the leaves of the trees will not be liable to scald them from the heat of the sun. 

While the first cost of this plant will be considered exceedingly heavy it must be taken into consideration that it is all op¬ 
erated by one man—it is practically auto¬ 
matic. As long as the engine is kept sup¬ 
plied with gasoline and the valves on the laterals are kept open the water is bound to flow. 

I have seen groves irrigated with a hy¬ 
drant in the center of each square but this is objectionable because the pipes are al¬ 
ways in the way and are frequently run over or broken off in cultivation, and are badly in the way if you wish to mow the grove. 

There is still another advantage in this overhead system. As you all know, we are bothered more or less during dry spells with the red spider. Just as soon as the rains come, however, this pest dis¬ 
appears. Now, with the overhead sys¬ 
tem you wet the trees thoroughly and at the same time wet the entire ground and it has the same fatal effect on the spider as though you had the rain. 

My experience is that it is much bet¬ 
ter to wet the entire ground rather than a little space around the trees, because the roots which are outside of this little belt you cover must necessarily suffer. 

There was a grove at Lake Weir, 
where I formerly lived, irrigated with a hydrant in the center of each square. The trees were purchased from a relative and this small grove was the same age and 


size as another one when the irrigation plant was put in. Inside of three years the irrigated grove was 'bearing from 15 
to 18 boxes per tree while the other grove never bore over five, and the irrigated trees were three times as large as the oth¬ 
ers, and although standing in ordinary pine land the foliage was as dense and as daik green in color as I have ever seen ill the richest hammock. 

Now, it strikes me that this was a pre¬ 
fect system except, as I have before stat¬ 
ed, the hydrants are very much in the way, and it seems to me it is much bet¬ 
ter to have the pipe directly over the tree where it is entirely out of the way, and where the water while wetting the ground thoroughly at the same time washes the leaves, cleaning them from the dust which accumulates from cultivation, and also getting rid of the red spider. 

Mr. Henderson—I want to suggest another advantage of overhead spraying. 
Besides keeping out the red spider it will be of great benefit to our friendly fungi. 
We are beginning to depend a great deal in Florida on the fungi for San Jose 
Scale, whitefly, etc., and the overhead spraying is one of the best things to in¬ 
crease the fungi. Sometimes we have a long dry spell and the whitefly gets ahead of us. If we had the overhead system of spraying we could supply the moisture which is necessary for their best develop¬ 
ment. 

Mr. Temple—May I ask what this plan is going to cost per acre for pipes, power station, etc. ? 

Mr. Gillett—I have two or three firms figuring on it now and have made a few figures myself, but as in many other cases 
I find the “doctors disagree.” One man

tells me I can only run one line of my laterals at a time unless I shut off the supply so that I only get a fine mist. Oth¬ 
ers claim I can run three or four laterals very satisfactorily. 

The cost of a plant of this kind de¬ 
pends very largely on conditions. In the first place, the distance from water must be considered. My land is located about 
300 feet from a large lake. I am going to use a 6 inch main and a 50 horse power gasoline engine with the best pump I can get for the purpose. There are 40 acres in this tract. I am starting on ten acres and the best figures I have had make the cost in the neighborhood of $5,000.00. 
The other 30 acres, however, will cost very much less as the engine and pump with the expensive mains have already been paid for, and I think the cost for the other 30 acres will not exceed the cost of the first five. Roughly speaking, I expect it will cost about $10,000.00 to irrigate the whole tract. When it is done, how¬ 
ever, I will be in absolute control of grow¬ 
ing conditions. It has happened this year in my nursery work that we had so little rain it is almost impossible to make buds live. The trees would start from some light shower which we had, but before the bud would take the drought would prevail again and most of them would die. With the system I have outlined I 
can fertilize my ground, cultivate it thoroughly, and every night give it an inch of rain, and within a week it will be getting the benefit of the fertilizer, as I 
can irrigate the ten acres in two nights at a cost of one man’s time and not over 
$5.00 worth of gasoline, and I can well afford to wet it down thoroughly every fifteen days; and you all know that with 


a good rain every two weeks our trees could not possibly suffer. 

Another great advantage which I 
would accomplish would be this: Hav¬ 
ing absolute control of the moisture I 
believe I can keep the fruit from splitting in the fall of the year It frequently hap¬ 
pens that after the rainy season comes to an end we have a dry spell lasting four to six weeks, followed by excessively heavy rains. The trees have become very thirs¬ 
ty and take up this excess of moisture greedily with the result that within three or four days a great many oranges split and fall to the ground'. Now, if the trees had been given a moderate amount of wa¬ 
ter during this dry spell they would not have been in this thirsty condition, and my opinion is that they would only have taken a normal amount of moisture which would not result in loss of fruit. 

For these and many other reasons I fa¬ 
vor overhead distribution if done thor¬ 
oughly, and while the first cost is great, 
when you consider that it will last prac¬ 
tically forever and cost very little to op¬ 
erate I believe it is economy to irrigate in this way. 

Mr. Temple—You speak of giving an inch of water in a very little time ; an hour or so. Do you contemplate giving that inch of water all over your ten acres at one time ? 

Mr. Gillett—Not at all. The main from whidli the laterals start, as I have before stated* runs through the center of the ten acres dividing it into two five acre tracts. There will be thirteen lines of pipe on each five acre tract. My engineer tells me I can distribute 350 gallons of water every minute from one of these lines, and that this will give over an inch 



64

of water on the land. He says I could open four or five lines but would lose my pressure and could not get more water. 
I will be entirely satisfied, however, If I 
can deliver an inch per hour, as in thirteen hours I could cover each of the thirteen lines, and by beginning about five or six in the evening I could finish by seven in the morning, and I would have thoroughly wet down five acres of land, 
and the next night I would repeat the op¬ 
eration. 

Mr. Temple—What is the size of the the uprights ? 

Mr. Gillett—One engineer said an inch pipe was absolutely necessary, while another told me that 1-2 inch pipe would do the work. I made an experiment myself using a 3-4 inch hose on my line. I then tried the same spray with a 1-2 inch hose and could see no difference in the amount furnished, although I had no way of cor¬ 
rectly measuring it. We all understand of course, that with a long stretch of 1-2 
inch pipe the friction would be tremendous and a great deal of force or pressure would be exhausted in that way. Several com¬ 
petent authorities who have figured on the matter say that a 3-4 inch pipe will be ample. Before putting in the system I 
wish to make a series of experiments and these should demonstrate conclusively the size of pipe needed. My personal opinion is that it is just as well to water the 26 
trees on one line thoroughly in an hour as it would be to put a fine mist over 100 
trees and run it four or five hours. 

Prof. Williams—What kind of pipe are you going to use ? 

Mr. Gillett—This matter of pipe is something on Which I would like to have some information. The dealers as a rule, 


tell you to buy galvanize.! pipe, telling you that it is cheaper in the end. At the present time pipe is cheaper than it has been for many years, as it is at least 22 
per cent, below the ordinary price. 

In a former irrigation plant I had some pipe that was under the ground eleven years. It was steel pipe, and before lay¬ 
ing it I painted it carefully with hot coal tar and when it was taken up at the end of eleven years it was apparently just as sound as when it was put down. If any¬ 
one else has had experience along* these lines I would like to hear from you. 

Mr. Dade—I think you will find that the cast iron will not rust in the ground. 

Mr. Temple—For your information on this pipe question I will say that I was in¬ 
terested in a series of experiments costing a great deal of money, and these ex¬ 
periments showed that for underground work where steel will last as one, wrought iron will last as three, and cast iron will last as five. Wrought iron is practically an impossibility today; you may buy it and pay for it, but you will get steel just the same. 

As to galvanized pipe lasting longer than the plain pipe, I have some galvaniz¬ 
ed on my place that has been down for ten years and is perfectly sound, while I 
have some, made extra heavy, that in five years was entirely gone. I have seen some black pipe painted with hot coal tar and care taken in its preparation and laying that will out last any galvanized pipe that can be put in. I have seen the black cast iron pipe painted and laid that for certain¬ 
ly nearly thirty years was in nearly as good condition as when put down. The wrought iron blackened pipe will last a long time, but not nearly so long as the 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


65 


cast iron pipe. Cast iron you may say lasts two or three times as long as the wrought iron. Lasting qualities are main¬ 
ly a question of putting it in place and proper care taken for its preservation. I 
have seen some common, cheap, spirally- 
welded pipe that was blackened and that must have been down fifteen or eighteen years, and there would be little patches here and there perfectly good while other portions had ceased even to be rust and had been absorbed by the ground. 

As to the size it is not a paying proposi¬ 
tion if you get less than three mch cast iron pipe. 

Mr. Stevens—I had an experience in laying steel pipe in 1890. We had to lav seven inch mains with three inch laterals. 

I stood up the pipe, sealing one end and filled it full of hot coal tar so that it touched every part of the interior, and then drained and laid away to cool. It coated that pipe so thoroughly that when the pipes were taken up ten years later they were sold for practically new pipe. 
The person who bought them made no complaint about paying a good price for them. I paid no attention to the outside whatever; only the inside. 

Mr. Temple—If you use the lake wat¬ 
er, of course that is high in tannic acid. 

Mr. Waite—All your lake waters cor¬ 
rode worse than the artesian waters, 

Mr. Temple—I have had no experience with the artesian waters, but I know the lake waters are very hard on pipes. 

Prof. Williams—What make of nozzle and what pressure do you have in your mains, Mr. Gillett? 

Mr. Gillett—I cto not know exactly what pressure my engineer is figuring on. 

My recollection is that he would have to 


maintain a pressure of 60 to 70 pounds. 
They had two or three nozzles there but 
I have not decided which I will use. 
The one I fancied most I do not know the name of. Never saw one just like it be¬ 
fore. 

Prof. Williams—Was it the Fish Tail? 

Mr. Gillett—Yes, I think it might be as it looks like that. 

Prof. Williams—In measuring the quantity of water that will come from the individual sprinklers, we find there is a great range in them and we are going to have some very interesting experiments. 
We will have that information out in the next four or five months. We measure the pressure at the sprinkler and measure the quantity of water that goes through at that pressure, and then measure the even¬ 
ness of the distribution under it. 

Mr. Penny—How much above the ground will you run your pipe? 

Mr. Gillett—That will depend upon how fast I can make the tree grow. 

Mr. Penny—How will you support this pipe ? 

Mr. Gillett—The first pipe I put in I 
will support with a strong stake driven down by the side of it and wire the pipe to it. Then as the trees throw out their branches I will fasten it to the tree. 

Mr. Temple—I like this plan as I think it is just as essential to put water on the leaves as it is on the ground. 

Prof. Williams—How far apart are your trees, Mr. Gillett? 

Mr. Gillett—They are 24 feet apart in squares ? 

Mir. Temple—It has been suggested that I ask Prof. Rolfs if it is not possible, 
in accordance with Mr. Gillett’s idea that he would wash the red spider off, that by 


5 











66

putting on strong power it would also wash off the honey dew of the whitefly. 

Prof. Rolfs—Yes, I think it would be washed off, but if you get a spray of this kind and get your trees in a thoroughly healthy condition it is going to be very hard on the whitefly. That nice, cool condition with lots of humidity in the atmosphere is very bad on his health. 

Dr. Richardson—Poor fellow ! 

Mr. Gillett—On behalf of the Society, 
then, I wish to ask the whitefly’s pardon. 

Mr. Meade—Has Mir. Gillett ever used this irrigation to protect from cold at night ? 

Mr. Gillett—No, sir The Bourlin Bros, 
at Citra had a big irrigation system on their place, using a large fire hose with a fire hose nozzle to distribute the water, 
and they had such power behind this stream that they could wash a tree out of the ground with it. When their trees were threatened in ’94 they experimented by spraying them. The result was that they had a beautiful crop of icicles. If I were going to use the water, however, in case of cold I should not care to have it above the trees but would prefer to have it near¬ 
er the ground. However, I wish to say in this connection that at Winter Haven we never have any cold. 

Mr. Harrington—I am a little familiar wjith the locality where Mir. Gillett is about to start his plant, and heard the dis¬ 
cussion about an inch of water on the ground being too much. I want to say that at one time we had a fall of five inches in one hour and fifteen minutes; ten min¬ 
utes afterwards there was practically no water in sight. 

Mr. Mead—I had an acre of young trees covered in and nozzles that threw 


water in a circle 40 feet in diameter. I 
found I could keep the temperature up to 
48 or 50 degrees when it was below freez¬ 
ing outside when it was covered up tight. 
However, the draw bars gave away at one corner where the cold could come in and the result was a crop of ice the next morn¬ 
ing. I took a photograph of this and the next week took another showing not a leaf or fruit in the enclosure. I think I am the only man who made anything out of that freeze, for I sent photographs up to an editor and he sent me a check for them 1 . 

Mr. Hart—I would like to inquire as to the effect of artesian water on the soil; 
whether it is injurious or not. At Day¬ 
tona they have been using artesian water for thirty years. I know about fifteen 

or twenty years ago Mr. -gave up 

the use of it and quite a number of others along the coast gave up the use and are using fresh water. It is long enough now for them to get results and I would be glad to hear from you. 

Miss White—I would say that artesian water is mighty good for crops. My fath¬ 
er had a good deal of experience along the East Coast and when we went to 
Hastings he said “Let’s take this little patch of ground and drive artesian wells and when we plant our Irish potatoes in 
December the first time it comes off cold, 
we will turn on the water and save our potatoes. Well, the cold wave came and we turned on the water and covered the field entirely with water. We kept it on for two days. The results were that there was a nice crop of potatoes in the adjoin¬ 
ing field. 

Dr. Van Dormer. I have had no prac¬ 
tical experience with artesian water here. 
Artesian water is usually hard water; 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that means it has in solution quite a quan¬ 
tity of mineral matter such as lime, so¬ 
dium and other salts. However, there is one great danger which I can anticipate in this sulphurated water. The sulphur in the water might become sulphuric acid and have a tendency to sour the land if continuously used. However, this can be found out only by experience. Another thing in connection with artesian water that may be mentioned in comparison with water that comes from lakes and creeks. The surface water contains quite a good amount of ammonia salts or nitro¬ 
gen ; not enough to do any harm to the person who drinks it, but enough to be appreciated by the plants. These are not contained in the artesian water which is practically free from nitrates or nitrites. 

Mr. Gillett—We do not have arte¬ 
sian water, but presume a good many people here in this section do. I had some of the water to drink last night and would like to know if the flavor of the fruit is influenced at all by the flavor of the water. 

Mr. Christiancy—I think My. Gillett’s method, as I have tried it, is a failure. Mr. 
Allen, when he started irrigating three of his groves, tried running the water through furrows after the Califor¬ 
nia method and failed with it, and then he piped it. He put clown a three inch main and put down five artesian wells to supply the water and then put a standpipe in ev¬ 
ery center; the trees were some 20 by 20 
and some 25 by 25. He never had any success. 

I think it would be a good idea to let the artesian water run to waste and I 
would have a subirrigated grove. In one of those three groves I have never been 


c“ 

able to neutralize the soil by the use of any amount of ashes or fertilizer, and I 
suspect it is the sulphuric acid. I took up the pipes and we started in last spring and replaced the system intended to use hose. 
The pipe that had been used was wrought iron pipe and buried about eighteen inches and' showed no rust on the outside and on the inside a coating which the plumber said was caused by artesian water. The pipes that were about nine inches of the surface were rusted from the outside but not from the inside. The inside had the same coating caused by the artesian water. 

Mr. Mead—Speaking of the two wat¬ 
ers ; I would be in favor of the pond wat¬ 
er because you get more or less organic matter in it. 

Mr. Waite—I would like to ask the gentleman who spoke of the continuous pipe what proportion of cement and sand he used in making that pipe where it was used as a drain or sub-irrigation. 

Mr. Williams—To make pipe that is entirely water proof so that the water will not seep through, I use three parts of sand to one of cement. 

Dr. Richardson—Will that porous pipe permit roots to obstruct it ? 

Mr. Williams—<No sir. 

Mr. Waite—How far apart should those pipes be in clay soil and sandy soil ? 

Mr. Williams—In different soils, of course it would vary. The usual practice here is to put them about twenty-five feet apart. In soil very sandy and porous it would be far better to put them not to ex¬ 
ceed fifteen feet apart. 

Dr. Berger—I would like to have one question settled. The statement was made that the leaves of the tree absorb moisture. Now, will someone who real- 







68 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ly knows, answer this if they can. I 
am of the opinion that the leaves them¬ 
selves do not absorb moisture. 

Mr. Gillett—I think I made that state¬ 
ment. Of course, you know I am a lay¬ 
man and do not pretend to scientific knowledge. Let’s hear from the profes¬ 
sor. 

Dr. Richardson—I take it from the gentlemen who made the remark that the water as applied to the foliage washed off the dust and dirt and permitted the leaves to have healthy action. It simply put the leaves in condition so that they could discharge their proper functions. 

Mr. Temple—I cannot give you the book, page or paragraph where the re¬ 
mark was made that the overhead spray would feed the tree so much water, but 
I turned to Mr. Stevens and said that the scientists agree that the leaves of the tree do not absorb any moisture; that the)? 
simply breathe for the tree. I am sure authorities on the subject raise no ques¬ 
tion about this. 

Mr. Member—Well, it seems to me that if the leaves do not absorb moisture that it would be better to supply the water through laterals. It takes power 


to put water up fifteen feet in the air. It certainly would be cheaper. 

Mr. Gibbs—The practical effect of put¬ 
ting water up in the tree is just as good and as great a benefit to the tree whether the leaves absorb the moisture or whether it protects the leaves and enables it to hold its tree moisture from evaporation. 
The benefit is just the same in either case, so what’s the odds? 

Dr. Berger—I would like to briefly sum up some advantages in applying the water to the leaves. In the first place, it washes the tree; that has been admitted to be one advantage. It will, no doubt, 
wash off some of the soot in case white fly is present. It will, no doubt, also destroy the red spider. It will retard the development of fungus diseases, of scale insects and whitefly. So we have four advantages in applying the water to the leaves. 

Mr. Gillett—I am the one who made the statement that the trees absorb water through the leaves, and am free to ad¬ 
mit that I am ignorant on the subject. At the same time, I still contend that clean¬ 
ing the leaves off must be of great ad¬ 
vantage to the tree. I know I had much rather take a bath all over than to dip only my feet in the water.

DERANGEMENT OF THE ENZYMES OF PLANTS. 


By E. S. Hubbard. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When blood coagulates, a self generat¬ 
ed ferment separates it into two parts: 

First, a clot called fibrin caused mainly by the breaking down or sticking together of the coruscles with fibrinogenagers or para globulin, corpuscle products, and second, a watery portion called serum which contains the tissue nutrients elab¬ 
orated by the red corpuscles, the alexins or anti-toxins of the white corpuscles, 
and if venous blood, also the waste pro¬ 
ducts of the tissues that have been neu¬ 
tralized by the white corpuscles and are finally split up and excreted as tauric and uric acids from the liver and kidneys and carbonic acid gases from the lungs. 

This simple looking, natural reaction is a type o<f the composition of the vital fluids of all organic cellular life, the se¬ 
rum of blood corresponding to the enzy¬ 
mes of plants. Now fellow members, I 
approach the subject of this short paper with great diffidence. 

The question of nutrition is vast and specialized, with much conflicting evi¬ 
dence caused by the rapid advance of ex¬ 
perimental knowledge and the various conclusions drawn by different observers from similar experiments. I have only a 


superficial and incomplete unprofessional acquaintance with this work. Many con¬ 
clusions must be drawn from the analogy of animal and bacterial research and the subject, now in its infancy, bears about the same relation to plant feeding with fertilizers that the empirical practice of materia medica did to diseases before the establishing of the germ theory. 

However, as many members have doubt¬ 
less given little attention to the ques¬ 
tion, I trust the elementary generaliza¬ 
tions I present will be of interest to the 
Society. 

Pasteur, the noted French chemist, es¬ 
tablished his reputation and blazed the way for further similar work by investi¬ 
gating yeasts for the German brewers. 
The brewers had been troubled with bad tasting, bitter beer, poorly fermented beer and yeast that would not give uniform re¬ 
sults. So they finally called in the chem¬ 
ist with his culture tubes and microscope. 

Pasteur practically had to begin at the beginning. First, he had to find out why sprouted 1 malt would ferment and un¬ 
sprouted barley would not. These studies showed that in sprouting the life germs of the barley generated and excreted a ni¬ 
trogenous fluid, a ferment or enzyme that is called diastase. He next found this en-

zyme changed the soluble starch stored up in the kernel to a fluid form as mal¬ 
tose, a kind of glucose or grape sugar. 

In normal growth the fluid solution of maltose is formed into a sprout, the sprout into a plant, while the plant ful¬ 
fils its destiny by perfecting seed, and this fixing of the fluid sugars in the sap into woody tissue and starchy grain is per¬ 
formed by another enzyme with an oppo¬ 
site function called invertase. There are a great number of yeasts or saocha- 
romyces, so-called because they thrive best in sugar or starch solutions. 

Pasteur studied about a dozen and front some of them got the bad results the brewers complained of. He finally iso¬ 
lated and made pure cultures of two which are called high and low yeasts on account of the temperatures at which they thrive 'best. The low temperature yeast be¬ 
ing easiest to keep pure. The yeast cells during their multiplication and growth split up the sugars into carbondioxide gas and alcohol by excreting ferments that are of a similar nature to the enzy¬ 
mes of plants or diastase of malt but with different functions. Every variety of plants seems to have its own peculiar en¬ 
zymes. See report of J. Wolff. *(E. S. 
R. Vol. XIX, page 808.) 

From a summary of recent experiments on the phenomena of liquefacation and coagulation of starch the conclusion was reached that the principal factors which come into play are the physical state of starch and the reaction of the salts which accompany it. Experiments are reported on the action of malt diastase at 65 de¬ 
grees C. on starch of different sorts. The

lowest amount of starch inverted. 25.4 
per cent, was noted with rice and the high¬ 
est value 99 per cent., with white Cuzco corn. 

“In these experiments 25 cc. of 10 per cent, malt extract were used with 3 grains of the raw starch. The microscopic ex¬ 
amination of the various samples shows nothing abnormal morphologically. Thus we see that the physical properties of raw starch may be very different, even for varieties of the same species. This more or less great resistance of raw starches toward diastase does not therefore suffice to class the species in such and such* 
category since they may vary with the climate, but it permits us to ex¬ 
plain how in the aerial organs of the same plants, starch may be found in greatly different physical states/’ This would go to show that the healthy enzymes might be found in the top of a foot rot orange tree, while at the place of gumming near the ground the enzymes have lost their power and cannot change the sweet gum¬ 
my sap into stored up starch or woody tis¬ 
sue but allow it to accumulate and burst the bark as gum. To show the complexity of this subject I quote from a report of 
“Fermentation Investigations”—(E. S. 
R. XV. Jan. ’04) L. Matruchot and Mal¬ 
lard. “In addition to the fermentation pro¬ 
duced by yeast and similar organisms the authors following investigations by Pat¬ 
ens Le Chartier and Bellamy show that there is a fermentation which takes place in fleshy fruits, tubes, etc., that is inde¬ 
pendent of yeasts or other foreign organ¬ 
isms. The methods of the experiment are described in detail—fruits of pumpkins and apples, onion bulbs, beet roots, etc., 
being kept under aseptic conditions for a

considerable time and the alcoholic fer¬ 
mentation and carbondioxide evolution determined. In this connection I wish to call attention to the probable reason of sulphate of ammonia being a healthful stimulus to the enzymes of oranges that sweeten the fruit by quoting frbm “the chemical nature of diastase.” T. B. Os¬ 
borne, (E. S. R. No. 3,1895. page 182.) 

The method used for preparing the en¬ 
zyme which differs from the one usually employed was to “first separate the pro- 
teids from the carbohydrates and other soluble substances by saturating the ex¬ 
tract with ammonium sulphate, thereby precipitating the ferment and proteid's to¬ 
gether ; next to remove this proteid exist¬ 
ing as globulin by dialysis; and then if possible to separate the albumin and pro- 
teids by fractional precipitation with al¬ 
cohol. In following this method a meas¬ 
ured quantity of malt extract was saturat¬ 
ed with ammonium sulphate, the precipi¬ 
tated proteid matter was filtered out, dis¬ 
solved in water and the clean filtered solu¬ 
tion made up to value of the original ex¬ 
tract. This solution was found to have the same diastatic power as before precipita¬ 
tion, thus showing that ammonium sul¬ 
phate had not injured the diastase.” 

I would further call attention to a fact 
I have often mentioned by quoting an ex¬ 
tract from a report of work by G. Lieb- 
sc'her, (E. S. R., Vol. 7, No. 8,1896, page 
665,) “as regards the contents of phos¬ 
phoric acid it appears that the solubility is of more significance than the total amount present. With a high content of of sesquioxides a soil will show great need of phosphatic fertilizers, although it al¬ 
ready contains a high per cent, of phos¬ 
phoric acid.” 


As a citrate solution is generally used in analyses to determine the percentage of reverted phosphoric acid it would seem orange trees ought to have greater pow¬ 
ers of assimilation of phosphoric acid than other plants. 

Experiments by P. Kassovich (E. S. 
R. XVI, No. 2,1048, July, ’05,) show that the amount of carbon dioxide set free 'by the roots was about twenty times greater than would have been required to render soluble all the phosphoric acid as¬ 
similated by the plants if it were supplied in an insoluble form. Still further, A. 
Quartarali (E. S. R. XVII, No. 5,449, 
Jan. ’06, shows “That the organic acids which usually occur in plants first render insoluble phosphates soluble and then convert them into di-hydrogen phos¬ 
phates. Any free phosphoric acid which may be produced is converted in the plants into a di-hydrogen salt. This is explained by the lower acidity of organic acids as compared with phosphoric acid and by their greater affinity as compared with acid phosphates. 

D. N. Prianishni kov (E. S. R. XVI, 
No. 6,538) shows “that ammonium salts, 
especially ammonium sulphate, exert an important influence in rendering the phos¬ 
phoric acid of mineral phosphates avail¬ 
able to higher plants, while sodium nitrate exerts no such influence. For this reason ammonium sulphate is designated “Physi¬ 
ologically acid” and sodium nitrate “phy¬ 
siologically alkaline. A series of sand and water cultures with barley, oats, buck¬ 
wheat, flax, peas and vetches to determine the status of ammonium! nitrate with reference to acidity or alkalinity as thus, 
defined is reported. The results show that this salt is intermediate in its action be-

tween 'ammonium sulphate and sodium nitrate and indicates that it may, under certain conditions, be physiologically acid. 
It was shown to increase the assimilability of the phosphoric acid of insoluble phos¬ 
phates even in sterile cultures where nitri¬ 
fication did not occur. 

O. Schreiner and H. S. Reed (E. S. R. 
XIX, No. 9,822) show evidence that roots possess well defined oxidizing pow¬ 
ers due principally to enzymes. Certain substances used as fertilizers promote the activity of roots, and root oxidation is more active in fertile than unproductive soils. 

O. Schreiner and M. X. Sullivan (E. 
S. R., same page) found that “water in which seed has germinated and seedlings had grown apparently contained toxic properties which interfered with the growth of a second crop in the same solu¬ 
tion. F. Fletcher (same page, E. S. R.) 
made investigations showing the excre¬ 
tions of toxic substances of an alkaloidal nature by plant roots. Phosphoric acid when assimilated by plants is mainly in the form of di-hydrogen phosphate incor¬ 
porated in the protoplasm of the living plant cells. I have often called attention to the fact of a suspicion that iron solutions from iron impregnat¬ 
ed soils which the plants must transpire in making growths evidently have a depressing effect on the plant protoplasm equivalent to phosphate rever¬ 
sion thereby deranging the enzymes that make growth and delaying or even stop¬ 
ping the maturing of the plants. 

Most organic poisons are classed as al¬ 
kaloids and generally speaking alkaloids are albumens or proteids split up into low¬ 


er molecular forms and given stability by association with alkaline salts. 

The most familiar alkaloids are those used in medicine—quinine, morphine, 
strychnine, atropine, etc., which are de¬ 
posited as useless or waste nitrogenous substances in the bark or tissue of certain plants. 

In most plants after the protoplasm cells are exhausted from excreting enzymes the broken down or split up remains dis¬ 
appear probably as root excretions. The process is shown in a study of maize and dates by H. S. Reed (E. S. R. XVI, No. 
5,443,05.) “It was found that in the rest¬ 
ing condition the secreting cells of both maize and dates are crowded with rela¬ 
tively small proteid granules, as secretion begins these granules gradually disap¬ 
pear. In maize the disappearance coin¬ 
cides closely with the consumption of the endosperm. In the date however, the gran¬ 
ules disappear long before the endosperm is dissolved. 

The chromatin of the nuclei is small in amount at the beginning of secretion and increases as germination progresses. 
The nucleolus diminishes with the pro¬ 
gressing of germination. These changes are more noticeable in the case of maize than in the date. There is no evidence that solid matter is excreted from the nucleus. 
At the end of secretory activity the proto¬ 
plasm of the secreting cells breaks down and the products of disintegration disap¬ 
pear from sight.” L. Lutz (E. S. R. 
XVII, No. 2,348, Dec. ’05,) believes it is practically demonstrated that many or¬ 
ganic nitrogenous substances are directly assimilated by plants, and the common be¬ 
lief that ammoniacal fermentation takes place first followed by nitric fermentation 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 




is not in accord with what actually occurs in the plant. 

The confirmation of this long suspected fact in the use of organic fertilizers would show there is a possibility of plants ab¬ 
sorbing so great a quantity of the poison¬ 
ous alkaloids of quickly decaying animal or other organic fertilizer's as to' derange the enzyme-producing functions and healthy growth of plants for it is a fact that the alkaloid's or toxins may produce a destructive breaking down of plant pro¬ 
toplasm that is as rapid in its way as the transformation by diastase of starch into glucose. As an analogy witness the study of the effects of the tetanus or lockjaw bacillus toxin by N. Tiberti (E. S. R. 
XVII, No. 8,804, April, 06.) In the author’s experiments it was found that in guinea pigs and rabbits the ischiatic nerve may absorb the tetanus toxin and trans¬ 
port it to the nerve centers when the tox¬ 
in is applied to the cut end of the nerve. 
When the tetanus toxin is injected into the muscle it spreads about and comes in contact with the nerve fibres by which it is absorbed. If tetanus anti-toxin is inject¬ 
ed into a nerve trunk and toxin injected later into the corresponding muscles, the anti-toxin will prevent the toxin from reaching the central nervous system. 

In this disease the germs, in the early stages at least, remain in the wound and the symptoms are caused by the digestive and waste poisons they produce in mul¬ 
tiplication and growth. The anti-toxins that are secured from the blood of animals that have been vaccinated or have recov¬ 
ered from infectious diseases do not act directly on the organism of other ani¬ 
mals or in a chemical sense, but their chief action is a partial neutralization of 


toxins. It has been shown that a mixture of a toxin and anti-toxin is not strictly neutral, and portions of both toxin and anti-toxin remain uncombined, while the remainder of the toxin and anti-toxin combines and becomes neutralized in varying degrees. 

When it comes to applying the princi¬ 
ples of the discoveries in the treatment of animal germ diseases tO' the diseases of plants we are all at sea for lack of suffi¬ 
cient investigation. That plants are at¬ 
tacked and suffer in a similar way to ani¬ 
mals from poison and diseases is a matter of common observation. When a soldier bug sucks a fast growing orange or other plant shoot and it quickly wilts we feel sure it has had the effects of a snake bite on an animal and is damaged by a similar alkaloid poison. I know common salt will defoliate an orange tree and that a hand¬ 
ful of arsenic or London purple will kill it. 
L. Montemartini (E. S. R. XVII, No. 
10,891. ’06.) Studying the physiology of diseased plants due to fungi and mites de¬ 
duced the hypothesis that the parasites may secrete some poisonous substances that stimulate the plant chiefly by increas¬ 
ed respiration during the early stages be¬ 
fore the depressing effects appear. 

The soft rot bacteria of vegetables ex¬ 
crete enzymes that break down the plant tissues in advance of the entrance of the germs and the same has been shown of fungi. 

S. A. Makrzhetski, (E. S. R. XVII. 
No. 10,959,) conducted a number of ex¬ 
periments in which he introduced arsenic, 
copper, sulphate, eosin and other poison¬ 
ous solutions into trees for the purpose of destroying parasites, but did not obtain any very satisfactory results. He then re-

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


placed' the poisonous salts by nutritive ones and obtained interesting results in improving the 'condition of the trees. He had best results from dry fertilizer salts in holes 1-2 inch diameter, 1 inch deep covered with land plaster. The dry salts diffused through the trees in different wavs not only along vertical lines but some times in spirals. 

I. J. Sheviryev, (E. S. R. XVI, Decem¬ 
ber, ’04. 383) reports 10 years experi¬ 
ments in artificial nutrition of diseased trees, protecting from insects without kill¬ 
ing the trees. According to the author the investigations are based on the following facts: After the spring movement of the sap when the pressure inside the vessels is greater than that of the atmosphere, 
there follows in summer and fall a pe¬ 
riod of negative pressure. If the vessels at this time are brought into' communica¬ 
tion with the liquid, the latter enters and fills them under the pressure of the out¬ 
side air. For the successful introduction of liquids into the vessels of the tree it was found necessary to prevent the en¬ 
trance of air. The author attributes the failure of many experiments in impreg¬ 
nating live trees with solutions to the dis¬ 
regarding of this fact. In order to ex¬ 
clude the air the vessels are opened under a layer of liquid. For this purpose, if the trees do not exceed 31-2 inches in diam¬ 
eter their trunks are surrounded by a feeding funnel of aluminum fastened to the tree by means of cement. 

For larger trees only portions of fun¬ 
nels are fastened to the trunk. After the funnel is fixed in place the solution is poured in and a cut made below the level of the liquid through the thickness of the bark and part of the sap wood. The liquid 


at once begins to be sucked in and to' dif¬ 
fuse above and below the cut, a mariotte vessel provides for the automatic replen¬ 
ishing of the liquid as it is absorbed. The absorption of the liquid continues at the initial velocity for some time after which it slackens, being influenced by climate, 
season of the year and state of the weath¬ 
er. The absorption takes place more rap¬ 
idly in dry air at high temperatures and in strong sunlight. 

The absorption continues for about 5 
days, and the immediate cause of its ces¬ 
sation seems to be the choking up of the vessels through which the liquid enters the tree. This is shown by the vigorous renewal of absorption through new cuts made in the tree. 

In an experiment on an oak tree 7 
inches in diameter, 11.37 gallons of liquid was absorbed by the tree in 53 hours. 

Experiments with a number of solu¬ 
tions colored with eosin or methyl blue, 
showed that liquids diffuse both upward and downward, and also' horizontally. The diffusion in a horizontal direction seems to be along the rays, as the heartwood does not become colored. The colored liquid has been traced to the smallest branches and also to the leaves, and in the experiment with grapevines into the berries themselves. The diffusion into the roots does not seem as uniform as through the sapwood of the trunk. 

The author has not made much progress in finding substances which may be introduced in sufficient quantity to be destructive to parasites without being in¬ 
jurious to the plant but expects interest¬ 
ing results from experiments with certain barium compounds with which he is ex¬ 
perimenting. I give the report of these ex-

periments in detail as possibly opening- a profitable field for investigation in rela¬ 
tion to diseases of oranges and other trees. 

Tetanus for instance, among germ diseases has been successfully treated by injections of solutions of carbolic acid and glycerine as well as with anti-toxin. Now if the absorption process described by 
Sheviryev will work on orange trees will it not be possible to' discover and directly administer antidotes or even anti-toxins for such diseases as limb blight, 
die back, foot rot and wither tip ? As I 
understand the preliminary work of isola¬ 
ting and studying the enzymes of orange trees is only fairly started at our State 
Experiment Station under the provision of the Adams act for original investiga¬ 
tions we cannot look for immediate re¬ 
sults in devising remedies but it seems to me the time is coming when the diseases of trees will be as well understood as those of animals and when remedies will be directly introduced into the plant sap cir¬ 
culation. 

i 

In conclusion I will say that W. Welch- 


ard (E. S. R. XVII. No. 5,486) reports that from the flesh of guinea pigs dead from fatigue he was able to extract a body which injected into guinea pigs and other animals caused all the symptoms of fatigue. This body was isolated and found to be very unstable in character and the author considers it a true toxin. When injected into the circulation of horses an anti-toxin was produced which in vitro or in animals counteracted the toxins. As shown by a number of experiments the anti-toxin can be taken by man without harmful results. 

In connection with the report of the experiments the author discusses the char¬ 
acteristic symptoms of fatigue, its effects on the body temperature, the produc¬ 
tion of the anti-toxin in the body and re¬ 
lated questions. Further, I can only say 
I have made these dry subjects as untech- 
nical as possible and hope they will give an idea of the trend of future investiga¬ 
tions, but if anybody has that tired feel¬ 
ing I am sorry to say I have not yet se¬ 
cured and am unable to administer the anti-toxin for fatigue. 


SOME DISEASES OF CITRUS TREES. 


By H. S. Fawcett. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

You may picture to yourself an ideal orange grove; one in which the trees are perfectly healthy; one provided with all the conditions favorable to growth and the production of the maximum amount of fruit consistent with this growth; one 


in which there is nothing to induce disease of any kind. This would require just the right amount of plant-food, of moisture, 
of regulated temperature and of light; 
a suitable substance in which a tree could fasten itself by a root system; and free¬ 
dom from all attacks of injurious insects 




76 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


and parasitic organisms. But this is only a mental picture, for, as everyone knows, 
these conditions are never fully realized in any orange grove. A tree is continual¬ 
ly being subjected to conditions tending to directly injure it, or to slowly sap its vitality. It is subjected to improper amounts and kinds of plant-food; too much or too little moisture; too great or too sudden changes of temperature, such as frosts or burning heat; wind storms; 
improper kinds of soil; and also to a host of visible or invisible enemies that prey upon it from the outside. Many of these conditions are to a large extent under the control of the grower. With proper care and due expenditure, the plant-food and the moisture may be largely controlled; 
but the changes of temperature, the wind storms, and the nature of the soil, are mostly beyond the limits of man’s power to change. Parasitic enemies, as far as they are understood, are also largely un¬ 
der control of the grower; but there are many whose habits are not yet sufficiently known for us to get them under intelli¬ 
gent control. 

When, because of unfavorable condi¬ 
tions or attacks of parasites, a tree or any part of it ceases to function properly and begins to weaken, we say it is diseased. 
If we leave out of account the insect troubles, the diseases of citrus trees may be divided into two classes. (i) The physiological diseases due mainly to mal¬ 
nutrition, and (2) the diseases due to par¬ 
asitic organisms. In the first class, or those presumably due to mal-nutrition, 
are dieback, melanose, yellow spotting and frenching. In the second class, or those due to, or probably due to parasitic organisms are withertip, scaly bark, scab, 


gumming and blight. It is of this latter class that this paper will treat. The causes of some of the diseases here de¬ 
scribed have not yet been proved, but since their symptoms and mode of action are similar to those undoubtedly due to fungi or bacteria, they are included here. 

Most of the parasitic fungi that cause diseases in trees are invisible forms, or at least their seed-like bodies or spores are too small to be detected with the unaided eye. Just as the higher plants have dif¬ 
ferent ways of distributing their seeds, 
so these lower plants, the invisible fungi, 
have different means by which their spores are scattered. The seeds of the thistle and dandelion are carried by the wind to great distances; the seeds of the oxalis are shot out violently from the pods; the seeds of the mistletoe are car¬ 
ried by birds, and those of the burs by other animals. If we had microscopical eyes we would find that with these little fungus plants there are also various.meth¬ 
ods of spore distribution. Some spores are light and powdery, are blown off and float like dust in the air; others are moist and waxy and stick to the bodies of in¬ 
sects, the feet of birds, and the like. 

One kind of spore has hygroscopic movements, by which it moves on drying and being moistened again. Some are even shot out into the air as invisible dust particles. 

Most of the kinds of fungi, of which there are nearly 80,000 species described, 
are entirely harmless to a citrus tree, and many are even useful in keeping insects in check; but there are a few evilly inclin¬ 
ed individuals that make a great deal of trouble for the orange growers. It is only within comparatively recent times 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


77 


that the nature of these low fungi was known. Much advance has been made in their study and in finding means of controlling them, but there is yet much that is not understood. The advance in this line is slow, because of the extreme smallness of many of these minute forms, 
and the difficulty of keeping track of any one individual in its infection of a tree. 
When a new disease occurs, one may pos¬ 
sibly find a dozen different microscopic fungi growing upon or into a diseased area. It is necessary to isolate these fungi in the laboratory, and then to prove by inocula¬ 
tion experiments which kind, if any, is the cause of the disease, or whether the fungi are simply present as the result of an injury from some other source. The primary cause of a disease once being known, it is a simpler problem to discover a means of prevention or cure for it. 
One discovery of this kind may prove of vast value to a whole country, yet it can never be known beforehand how much time it will require to make the discovery. 

SCALY BARK. 

A disease that is confined almost en¬ 
tirely to one section of the State and has attracted considerable attention there, is that known as Scaly Bark. It is sometimes called by the growers “11180 or “nail- 
head rust.” This disease should arouse in¬ 
terest, not only in the section in which it is prevalent, but in other sections as well, 
because of the danger of its being intro¬ 
duced into new regions. The advantage to the grower of being able to recognize at a glance a new disease at its earliest start is great. For there are times when by the destruction of a single tree in the corner 


of a grove, or of one tree near a house or barn, into which a disease has been car¬ 
ried, an entire grove might easily be saved from being diseased. From, our study of this disease there is every reason to be¬ 
lieve that Scaly Bark is infectious, and that it may spread easily from tree to tree or from one grove to another. A history and description of this disease were given by the writer in the Proceedings of this 
Society for 1908, page 101. It has also been more recently described, with its remedies, in Bulletin 98 of the Florida 
Experiment Station. It has been estimated that the yearly loss of fruit from this dis¬ 
ease in one citrus-growing section of the 
State is near 20,000 to 30,000 boxes of oranges, and this is in addition to the con¬ 
stant weakening of the trees. The loss of crop in this region is anywhere from noth¬ 
ing up to 25 per cent, in good years, and in unfavorable years it may be as high as 
75 per cent, in badly diseased groves. 

Description— Scalv bark is primarily a bark and {rind disease of the sweet orange. The wood is only affected sec¬ 
ondarily, by poisoning due to the wither- 
tip fungus. The bark of the trunk and of branches of all sizes may be affected; but the greatest injury is done to the younger branches and twigs up to> about one-half inch in diameter, and to the fruit. 

On the branches and twigs there de¬ 
velop more or less circular or oval spots one-sixth to one inch across, rusty in col¬ 
or, and with well-defined margins. The bark becomes brittle, begins to crack, and forms small flakes or scales. These spots are at first scattered but may increase in number to such an extent as to became joined together. The branch is Tardy killed in the first year. During the second 





78 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


year, additional spots form between the old ones, and this may go on for several years until the branch is finally girdled 1 at some point and killed. 

This formation of rough scaly bark is also seen on the trunks of the badly diseased trees. As time goes on, the trunks present an extremely rough and shaggy appearance. Pieces of bark one- 
half inch or more in size are pushed up, 
sometimes over areas of several inches in diameter, or a continuous surface of rup¬ 
tured bark is formed. New bark arises under the old, and only rarely do dead areas on the trunk result from this dis¬ 
ease. The exudation of gum is a usual accompaniment. 

On the rind of the fruit the spots de¬ 
velop somewhat similarly to those of the small branches. The disease affects only the outer portion of the rind. The spots start either as rings, like those on the small branches, or as round yellowish areas. These usually begin to appear on the fruit in July and August. As the fruit approaches maturity, and while it is still green, the rings become sunken and brown, because of the entrance of the withertip fungus, while their central por¬ 
tions remain green. The fruit then col¬ 
ors rapidly, the portion inside the ring sometimes remaining green for a short time. The center is finally broken down by the withertip fungus, and the whole spot becomes brown. Some spots are formed which are not ringed. Fruits spotted by scaly bark color prematurely, 
and drop before the picking season. Oc¬ 
casionally gummy exudations occur at the spots on the fruit. 

Cause —A careful study has been made 


to determine just what the cause is. It is now believed that the trouble is due to a minute microscopic fungus that makes its way through the bark from the out¬ 
side and grows just under the outer cells. 
The disease is quite slow in its develop¬ 
ment. It develops so gradually into its destructive form that the grower is scarce¬ 
ly aware of its importance until it has been present for several years. 

Remedy —-Experiments for the control of the disease have been systematically carried on at Bayview for the past two years. The nature of the disease and its slow development upon the limbs and trunks, make the effect of any line of treatment slow in showing itself. As the development of the disease to its destruc¬ 
tive form is slow, so the recovery of the tree after the source of infection is cut off requires a long time. We cannot ex¬ 
pect to see the beneficial effect of any treatment on the branches in much less time than eight to ten months. Twenty experiment plots, each receiving different treatment, were laid out. These have been continuously under observation, and from the basis for the remedies which are here suggested. 

Top Working —Grapefruit, manda¬ 
rins and tangerines appear to be nearly immune to scaly bark, even when sur¬ 
rounded by badly affected sweet orange trees. Diseased trees may, therefore, be topworked to one of these varieties. At first sight this would seem to- be too se¬ 
vere a remedy; but, as a matter of fact, it can be carried out without serious loss at any one time. This can be done by treat¬ 
ing only alternate rows. In this way the untreated trees will be found to produce a much larger crop, and this will in a

measure compensate for the loss of crop on the top-worked trees. 

Top-working has already been prac¬ 
ticed by some growers. As a further pre¬ 
caution, the trunks and branches may be treated with carbolineum as suggested be¬ 
low. When these top-worked trees be¬ 
gin to produce a fair crop, the untouched trees may be treated in the same way. 

Heading Back— During the dormant period, preferably in December or Janu¬ 
ary, cut out the top, leaving only the trunk and the stubs of the larger branch¬ 
es. Then paint the entire bark and the cut surfaces with one part of carbolineum to one part of water. In our treatment of this disease in this way, which began in February, the bark assumed a dark- 
red color. In a few weeks, as the grow¬ 
ing season came on, the tree put out new shoots, and by the end of summer had grown a vigorous, healthy top. By that time the old scabs had disappeared, and the bark had become smooth and free from flakes. The carbolineum, far from injuring the tree, appeared to stimulate it to increased vigor. Unless the entire grove is treated in this way the young growth should be protected by spraying with one per cent, solution of carbolineum in May or June, when the wood will have hardened. 

Bordeaux Mixture— The use of Bor¬ 
deaux mixture has been attended with beneficial results in diminishing the num¬ 
ber of spotted fruits, but with bad re¬ 
sults in allowing the increase of scale in¬ 
sects. A thorough test was made as to the effects of this spraying mixture at different times of the year, and with dif¬ 
ferent numbers of sprayings throughout the year. The most marked result has 


been the diminished number of spotted oranges on the sprayed plots, as com¬ 
pared with the unsprayed plots. This test was repeated the second year on the same plots and in the same way as at first. 
During the first year some effect was no¬ 
ticed, especially on those plots where the spraying had begun in the early summer, 
but the results were not pronounced. Dur¬ 
ing the second year a great diminution of spotted fruit was seen in nearly all of the sprayed trees. The amount of fruit however, was considerably diminished on the plots sprayed at or near the blooming season. Our experiments indicate that one thorough spraying at any time be¬ 
tween November and February is almost as efficient in diminishing the amount of spotted fruit in the following crop, as three or four sprayings during any other part of the year. It is also attended with a smaller increase in scale insects. 

Extreme caution must be taken in us¬ 
ing Bordeaux mixture for orange trees, 
since it kills the fungi that are useful in keeping scale insects in check. If Bor¬ 
deaux mixture is applied, it should be fol¬ 
lowed by a good insecticide, or twigs from unsprayed trees bearing the proper fungi should be hung in the tops of the sprayed trees a week or two after the treatment. 

WITHERTIP. 

Withertip is a disease which is very de¬ 
structive at times, especially when an or¬ 
ange tree is subjected to unfavorable conditions. The primary cause of this disease was carefuly studied and worked out by Prof. P. H. Rolfs several years ago while holding the position of plant path¬ 
ologist at the sub-tropical laboratory at 


80 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


r 


Miami. He proved by experimental meth¬ 
ods that by spraying the spores of a cer¬ 
tain fungus upon the young orange and lemon trees in the greenhouse he could cause the disease known as Withertip. It was demonstrated in this way that the disease was caused directly by the fungus known as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. 
It was further shown that other effects were due to the same cause, such as blos¬ 
som-blight, leaf-spot, tear-staining of fruit, lemon spot, and other troubles. Dr. 
Ernst A. Bessey, in carrying this work further, demonstrated that the same fun¬ 
gus which causes withertip of orange *n its various manifestations, also causes blossom-blight, leaf-spot and fruit-rot of mangoes and avocadoes, and leaf-spot and fruit-rots of various other plants. 

Withertip has so many different ap¬ 
pearances and symptoms according to what part of the tree is affected and at what stage of development it is found, 
that it is almost impossible to give a de¬ 
scription of it by which it can be identi¬ 
fied at all times. The fungus causing withertip appears to be an ever-present one, and the disease breaks out in its de¬ 
structive form as the result either of the action of virulent strains of the fungus, 
or from unfavorable conditions that ren¬ 
der the tree less resistant to the growth of the fungus into its tissues, or from both causes. Withertip often accompanies or follows other troubles. It is almost in¬ 
variably found as a secondary agent in trees suffering from scaly bark. It ap¬ 
pears that the scaly bark disease was pres¬ 
ent for years, and only developed in its present destructive form after the ad¬ 
vent of the Withertip in the State. Prof. 
B. F. Floyd has observed that it nearly 


always follows the yellow spotting of citrus leaves. The resistance which a strong healthy tree presents to this fungus is probably lessened materially through the influence of yellow spotting and the fungus can then enter the weakened tis¬ 
sue. There are certain effects of fertil¬ 
izers that appear to increase the liability to this disease. Prof. Floyd in his experi¬ 
ments with the physiological effects of certain kinds and amounts of fertilizers on young trees, found that by increasing the amount of nitrate of soda till a poi¬ 
soning effect on the wood tissue resulted, 
a condition was produced suitable to the rapid development of Withertip. In cases where amounts of phosphoric acid or potash were used sufficient to poison trees to the same degree, the Withertip was not observed to develop to the same extent. 

What usually puzzles the grower is that often there are individual trees, and even individual limbs of the same tree, 
that are severely attacked; while other trees of the grove and other limbs of the diseased tree remain uninjured. This difference in the action of the fungus to¬ 
ward different limbs of the same tree is probably due to a difference in the vitality of the individual limbs. Any cause ren¬ 
dering a branch somewhat weak, such as a previous heavy load of fruit, or the ad¬ 
verse conditions mentioned above, would most probably render that branch sus¬ 
ceptible to an attack of the fungus. The same would doubtless be true in regard to the susceptibility or immunity to the disease of the different trees in a grove. 
Cases occur, however, that seem to be accounted for only by considering trees as individuals, each slightly different

from the other. One tree, apparently just as healthy as another, is for some cause not yet understood, less resistant to this particular disease, and is therefore attacked; while the tree next to it may remain uninjured. 

Treatment —The treatment for this disease must vary according to the phase of the disease present. Blossom blight and dropping of young fruit may largely be prevented with Bordeaux mixture properly applied. In case of blossom blight one must spray directly into the bloom. The accepted belief is that Bor¬ 
deaux mixture will knock off the fruit if sprayed into the bloom, but in case of blossom blight one will do more good than harm by using it. Though it may knock off some fruit it will save more than it will injure. When the disease has gotten thoroughly into the tissues and is begin¬ 
ning to kill back the branches and to poison the wood tissue, more drastic measures must be employed. Prof. 
Rolfs’ experiments showed that the dis¬ 
ease could be best controlled at this stage by pruning out. This should be done by cutting out, not only the dead branches, 
but also the diseased weak branches for some distance back of the apparently af¬ 
fected wood. The poisoning effect of this fungus may extend to a considerable distance beyond the place where the fun¬ 
gus may be found, and it is advisable to get rid as far as possible of the poisoned wood. 

This treatment should be accompanied by a process of building up the trees to make them resistant to the further at¬ 
tacks of the fungus. Spotting of the fruit in the fall may also be prevent¬ 
ed by spraying. If it be near the season of 


the ripening of the fruit it is advisable to use the ammoniacal solution of copper carbonate. In using fungicides on or¬ 
ange trees one must bear in mind that one is also killing the fungi that keep down the scale insects. One must be ready to follow with an insecticide, or hang pieces of bark containing the scale fungi in the tops of the sprayed trees. 
These should be put in several weeks aft¬ 
er spraying has been done. 

foot-rot. 

Nearly every citrus district in the world has been troubled by the foot-rot. It is one of the oldest diseases of citrus trees. 
In Europe its history extends back as far as 1845. In Florida, according to Prof, 
Hume, it was first noticed about 1879. 
The disease is well described, and effec¬ 
tive methods of cure are given by Prof. 
P. H. Rolfs in Press Bulletin 96 of the 
Florida Experiment Station, as follows: 

“The first symptom of the disease that is noticed is the oozing of gum from wounds occurring near the ground. Later on, the gumming ceases and the bark dries, the portion that has become diseased breaking off. These foot-rot wounds, after they begin to heal, are so characteristic, that when once seen thev are rarely mistaken. The extent to which the wounds spread depends on a variety of circumstances. Sometimes they are very small, being not more than a frac¬ 
tion of an inch in diameter and more or less circular in outline; while at other times they may extend nearly or quite around the tree at the ground. In such cases the wound is of an irregular shape. 

“Remedy —Since we have known that the disease is infectious and understood 


6 





82

the conditions which favor its spread, a remedy 'can be much more successfully applied. The following brief rules, if followed carefully and conscientiously, 
will eliminate the disease from a grove, 
and in many cases save trees that other¬ 
wise would be lost. 

“i. Remove the soil from about the crown and the crown roots, at least as 

far back as any disease occurs. 

A very small, even an invisible amount, of virus is capable of starting the disease in a new place; consequently, any tools or implements used about a foot-rot tree should be thoroughly disinfected before being used on a healthy one. 

2. After the soil has been removed from the crown, cut out the diseased 

parts.The bark should be cut away 

as far as the disease occurs, which can be easily told by a yellowish or dark dis¬ 
coloration of the inner bark. As the dis¬ 
ease rarely penetrates into the wood, it will be sufficient to remove the bark. 

3. After the diseased part has all been cut out, apply an antiseptic wash. One of the most readily obtainable, and also one of the best, is crude carbolic acid— 
using one part of the acid to one part of water. .,. . . .When the disease makes its appearance early in the year, it may be necessary to repeat this operation a sec¬ 
ond time, or even more frequently. 

4. After the above remedy has been applied, .and no mew cases of foot-rot have been discovered for a period of two or three months, the following wash may be applied to the trunks of the trees and to such larger roots as are exposed: 
three parts of slaked lime, mixed with one part of flowers of sulphur. The ingre¬ 
dients may be easily mixed by passing 


them through a sieve, or by working them on the floor, very much as fertiliz¬ 
ers are mixed. After they are evenly mixed, place the powder in a tub or barrel, and add enough water to bring 

it to a consistency of paint.The 

trunks of the trees and all of the exposed roots should be given a thorough coating of this material. In groves where foot- 
rot is just starting and where the wounds are all very small, this wash alone will frequently be found sufficient. In groves where foot-rot occurs on a considerable percentage of the trees, it will be best to apply the wash to the trunks and larger roots of all the trees—those that are not affected as well as the diseased ones.” 

GUMMING. 

A disease known as gumming of cit¬ 
rus trees is becoming a serious trouble in many localities of the Stace. It has brok¬ 
en out in some groves to an alarming ex¬ 
tent. 

Description— The gumming areas are usually at considerable distances from the ground on the trunk and larger limbs. This point of difference distin¬ 
guishes the diseases from the foot-rot. 
The bark cracks, and gum oozes out in large quantities. When the bark just adjoining the affected area is cut off, it is seen to be yellowish inside, and the bark tissue has a sour odor as if fermen¬ 
tation had set in. The diseased areas as they enlarge may reach one-half to three- 
quarters of the way around a large limb. 
In some cases the limb or trunk is girdled. 
Where the case is not too severe, new bark tissue is formed underneath the old, 
and the surface of the diseased area be¬ 
comes characterized by ridges, warts and 







FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


83 


resinous looking deposits from the hard¬ 
ening of the gummy exudations. The new bark may sometimes heal over; but fre¬ 
quently it dies after a while, and the wood usually decays inward, often de¬ 
stroying the tree. 

The cause of the gumming disease is not known. The writer is taking up a study of this trouble, with the view of discovering the cause, if possible, and finding a good remedy. Dr. Ernst Bes- 
sey, in his report for 1907, says: “In some cases it seems to be due possibly to the unfavorable effect of the stock on the scion, for it is far more abundant in those trees where the scion is larger than the stock.” In California a disease called 
“Qummosis,” which causes a gumming of citrus trees, has been thought to be a physiological trouble. 

Remedy— Gumming has been success¬ 
fully checked in some cases by scraping the diseased areas, and painting over the wounds with some disinfectant. Carbo- 
lineum, one part to one part of water, 
may be used. Prof. R. E. Smith of the 
California Experiment Station, recom¬ 
mends the following remedy for the 
Gummosis found in that State: Peel off the bark without scraping the wood un¬ 
derneath, and cover the wound with a kind of grafting wax prepared by melt¬ 
ing four pounds of resin, one pound of beeswax and one pound of raw linseed oil. This is put on with a brush while warm and liquid. 

BLIGHT. 

This is one of the most dreaded, and probably most destructive diseases of citrus trees in Florida. How many thou¬ 
sands of dollars are annually lost by 


blight, it is difficult to estimate. I11 1895 
Profs. Swingle and Webber estimated the loss from this disease at from one hun¬ 
dred to two hundred thousand dollars an¬ 
nually, and it is probably more than that now. Blight is one of those diseases that is extremely hard to diagnose. Even aft¬ 
er years of experience a grower will tell you that he cannot tell at once when a tree is struck by blight. It often comes on so gradually, without any definitely marked symptoms, that one can only be sure of a tree having the blight after the disease has progressed for some time. 
The disease was first fully described by 
Profs. Swingle and Webber in 1895. It usually appears on trees that have pre¬ 
viously seemed healthy and in good bear¬ 
ing condition. It often takes the largest and best trees in a grove. The first in¬ 
dication is usually a wilting of the foli¬ 
age, as if the trees were suffering from lack of moisture. Most often this occurs in early spring, and at first appears most pronounced on dry, hot days, but later this wilting is seen to persist even through the wet or damp weather. The whole top may show the disease at once, but often a single limb will first show signs of wilting. As the disease progresses and the rainy season comes on, numerous water sprouts are put out from the trunk and large limbs. These look healthy at first, but finally sicken and die. 

Much technical study and many exper¬ 
iments have been devoted to this disease in order to discover the cause and to find a remedy. Profs. Swingle and Webber did a large amount of work upon it. Their work was brought to a sudden end by the freezes of 1894-95. Since then, Prof. 
Rolfs, while at the sub-tropical laboratory 




84 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


at Miami continued the study of this mysterious trouble, but its cause has not yet been determined. Between $30,000 
and $40,000 has been expended upon it, 
and while much information as to the development and nature of the disease has been collected, most of this has been of a negative character as far as prac¬ 
tically useful results are concerned. There is need for a more thorough investigation of this trouble carried on regularly and systematically for a number of years. 
The investigation of a disease of this na¬ 
ture presents unusually great difficulties. 
The fact that it apparently takes at least seven years for a tree to develop symp¬ 
toms of the disease, and that blight oc¬ 
curs usually in large bearing trees, makes the investigation difficult. The amount of time needed for working out this prob¬ 
lem and the difficulties in the way, make the field a rather uninviting one for the scientist. A sufficient amount of money and a sufficient number of years for the working out of such a problem are things that it is almost impossible to secure un¬ 
der present conditions. We are expected to show results at once. What politician is willing to trust a scientist to work ten years before calling upon him to show them? Yet this time would probably be needed to attain definite results with citrus blight. 

In some respects the disease resembles peach yellows, and everyone who has fol¬ 
lowed the investigation of that disease knows that a great amount of money has been expended and years of study have been given to this trouble, but as yet there is no remedy discovered except the complete destruction of diseased trees. 
This too, is the only remedy yet known 


for blight, also called “wilt/’ of orange trees. The only treatment is to dig up and destroy the trees as soon as they show clearly that they are affected with blight. 
It is dangerous to dally with this disease; 
for while one is trying to cure one tree, 
the disease is likely to spread to others adjoining. 

BUCKSKIN. 

Grapefruit often develops a peculiar thickened and roughened appearance of the rind which is known by growers as buckskin or sharkskin. The rind be¬ 
comes abnormally thick and presents a scurfy rough appearance well character¬ 
ized by the word buckskin. This trouble was quite serious in (some places ilast season. It renders the fruit very infer¬ 
ior, and in many cases almost worthless. 
This trouble is probably due to some sur¬ 
face-growing fungus that works upon the outer cells and irritates the rind in such a way as to cause abnormal thickening. 
The real cause of the trouble is, how¬ 
ever, yet to be determined definitely. The trouble has not been sufficiently studied for us to be able to give any remedy based on experiments. The fact that the trouble appears to be due to a surface¬ 
growing fungus would indicate that Bor¬ 
deaux mixture would be an efficient pre¬ 
ventive. A few years ago a series of spraying experiments for the control of this disease was made by Prof. Rolfs in an orange grove where buckskin fruit had been abundant the year before. After the spraying had been done it was found that the buckskin did not appear that year even on the unsprayed plots, so that it was impossible to get any information from the experiment. This disease ap-

pears to be one of those minor troubles that come and go. Some years it is quite bad, while other years it is scarcely at all noticeable. We are now making a study of this disease. 

scab. 

Scab is a disease which is ordinarily of rather minor importance, but which may at times break out upon young leaves and fruits of lemons, grapefruit and satsumas, in a very destructive way. 
It is sometimes known as “sour scab,” 
because it is so invariably found upon sour oranges and lemons. It is probably found on sour oranges in almost every citrus-growing district in the State. 

The earliest infections are on young leaves about one-tenth full size, as mi¬ 
nute, light-brown or cork-colored points. 
Soon the spots become depressed on one side of the leaf and raised on the other. 
Older spots become dark brown and sometimes pinkish in color. The sep¬ 
arate spots coalesce as they enlarge, form¬ 
ing irregular corky scabs. The leaves are contorted, twisted and warped. The fruit, when affected, presents a warty appearance. 

The disease is caused by a minute fun¬ 
gus (Cladosporium citri) that grows into the tissue of the leaves. The spores of this fungus are so small that it would take about 8,000 side by side to measure one inch. Pure growths of the scab fun¬ 
gus were obtained in a nutrient jelly by sowing some of these minute spores, and a study was made of the fungus as it grew on this jelly. When the fungus had grown sufficiently to produce a good crop of spores, these were sprayed on to small sour orange trees that were in the green¬ 


house and were free from scab. In a few days the characteristic scab spots ap¬ 
peared, proving that this fungus was the real cause of scab, and that the infection came from the growth of the spores that had been put upon the surface of the leaves. 

Treatment —Sometimes the disease breaks out early in the year, on quite young leaves and fruits, and in a very severe form. The only known preven¬ 
tive of its spread is Bordeaux mixture applied early in the year. The same care should be used in applying the Bordeaux as when spraying to cure withertip, or its application will be followed by an in¬ 
crease of scale insects. 

SMOKY FUNGUS. 

The smoky appearance of the orange caused by the smoky fungus (Leptothy- 
rium pomi?) is not to be confused with the blackening due to the sooty mold which accompanies the whitefly. The smoky fungus may occur when the white- 
fly is absent. It causes no noticeable in¬ 
jury to the fruit itself. It does, however, 
mask the bright color of the fruit by a layer of dark-colored, mycelial threads, 
which spread over the surface of the rind. It may be rubbed off with the fin¬ 
gers, and so is attributed by some growers to the accumulation of dust from the air. 
It is most apt to occur in moist groves, 
late in the fall, and on oranges that have remained on the tree after they are ripe. 
The selling quality of the fruit is natur¬ 
ally somewhat impaired by the presence of this fungus. 

Remedies —>(i.) The smokiness may be readily removed from the fruit by putting it through a washer like those 


86 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


used for freeing fruit from the sooty mold fungus. (2.) In the course of our investigations on the scaly bark disease it was noticed incidentally that Bordeaux mixture was effective in preventing the appearance of the smoky fungus, if ap¬ 
plied at the proper time of the year. One spraying, about the first of October, kept off the smoky fungus and did not cause sufficient increase in scale insects to injure the appearance of the fruit. Two or three sprayings, however, during the summer, caused such an increase in the number of scale insects as to materially injure the fruit, leaves and small branch¬ 
es. This increase in scale insects was due to the Bordeaux mixture having killed the fungi that were parasitic upon them, thus giving them immunity from their fungus enemies. When spraying ro prevent attacks of smoky fungus it may be suggested that the solution should be applied, as far as possible, only to the x ruit. The spray should be kept away from the larger limbs and the trunk, 
where the beneficial fungi are usually lo¬ 
cated in considerable .abundance. A weak mixture, consisting of three pounds of quicklime and three pounds of copper sulphate to 50 gallons of water may be used. 

CONCLUSION. 

After all has been said in regard to diseases and their treatment, it remains true, as is well known, that a grove prop¬ 
erly cared for is not half as liable to disease as one that is neglected or mis¬ 
treated. Just as good sanitation and more healthful surroundings have been found to cut down the death-rate in a community of people, and prevent to a 


great extent, the spread of contagious disease; so the proper treatment of a grove will have a similar effect on the health of the community of citrus trees. 

The year after a vigorous grove of trees has borne an unusually large crop of fruit, is the time when the trees are quite apt to become diseased. At sucn ^ 
time a grove should receive unusual care because of the strain that was put upon it the previous year. Some diseases at¬ 
tack even the most vigorous trees in a grove; but the rule is, that weakness from any cause predisposes a tree to the attack of parasitic fungi or bacteria. The old saying, “An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure,” could be re-stated by the citrus grower as. “An ounce of brains, scattered through an orange grove is worth more than a pound of Milestone put on as Bordeaux mix¬ 
ture.” Yet there are times when the pound of bluestone may be necessary to correct conditions over which the ounce of brains has had no control. 

Prof, fawcett (In reply to ques¬ 
tions)— 

It is very important to remember, 
that scaly, bark was with us for forty years, as near as we can find out from the old growers, but did not cause much trouble until the withertip made its ap¬ 
pearance. 

I think you all recognize the fact that a tree that is well cared for is more resis¬ 
tant than a tree carelessly cared for. 

The first year we used .Bordeaux Mix¬ 
ture the scale came up by the thousands, 
but the second year we put on limbs bear¬ 
ing the scale fungi about four or five days after the spraying was done. During the second year very few scale insects

developed and it was remarkable to see how free from scale the groves kept. 

We used the red-headed, the white- 
headed and the black-headed fungi. I 
have used all three. The diminution of scale may have been due to some other cause; it may have been the lady birds, 
but it appeared to be the use of the fungi, 

I think that some of the people in the 
State are calling the gum disease scaly bark. The true scaly bark is found very little, if at all, outside of Hillsborough 
County. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Temple—You say it takes seven years for this disease blight to develop in the tree after the seed is sown. Then you say it is contagious. When does the contagion take place; before it is shown in the tree from which the disease is taken, 
or afterwards? Suppose I have a tree 
I suspect of having blight. If I immediate¬ 
ly destroy that tree, root, branch and all, 
are the trees already infected or does the infection not take place until there is a further state of development of the dis¬ 
ease in the tree I have destroyed. 

Prof. Fawcett—I don’t know. Pos¬ 
sibly I have mis-stated that a little. Pos¬ 
sibly it is that the tree must be seven years old before it can take this disease. 
What do you think, Prof. Swingle? 

Prof. Swingle—I don’t know, either. 
As far as means of contagion are con¬ 
cerned, it has been suspected that the 


tree may have been infected through the flower. 

Now, before we adjourn I wish to say just one word about the blight. Next to the whitefly I don’t think anything is more generally feared in this state than the blight, for the reason that it does not spare an orange grower. He may be ever so careful about his method of fer¬ 
tilizing and treatment of the trees but still the blight comes, and it is most dis¬ 
couraging to find symptoms of this seem¬ 
ingly incurable disease. I wish merely to point out the fact that you have in this 
State a man who is eminently capable of treating just this disease. Now, you know how the government demands re¬ 
sults almost immediately after they have appropriated money for a certain pur¬ 
pose. Some sort of result must be shown in a specific time. It is entirely out of the question to get results on the blight in a short time. It simply can’t be done. 
I do believe, however, that the way is open. In case it is not found possible for a committee of this state to obtain the money from the department, I would suggest the possibility of utilizing the 
Adams fund. This is granted by the government for scientific research. They are not supposed to show immediate re¬ 
sults for the Adams fund. This is a sum of money exempt from the pressing de¬ 
mands for results. 

You understand I am speaking in a private capacity but have reason to be¬ 
lieve if a syndicate could raise as much as 
$2,000 or $3,000 per annum it would be possible to secure a grant from the Adams fund enough to get a man like Prof. Faw¬ 
cett, and he would have the liberty to work this problem out in his own good, 



88

thorough time. Of course, you must re¬ 
member that a man doing this work must be paid a good salary and it means the expenditure of a large sum of money and 
I would suggest that if the orange grow¬ 
ers can secure from the state legislature 


or underwrite it themselves, it would be possible to draw upon the Adams fund for a considerable amount, and I am sure both the federal and state authorities will co-operate with them. 


YELLOW SPOTTING OF CITRUS LEAVES. 


By B. F. Floyd. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

A greasy yellow spotting of citrus leaves has been reported to the experi¬ 
ment station from numerous localities in the citrus-growing belt of the State. In some cases, it apparently caused much damage. An investigation of this trouble was started in the laboratory of plant physiology in January, 1908. A close study has been made of the distribution and prevalence of this disease in Florida, 
and of its gross effect upon the affected trees. Its effect upon the leaf has been studied in the laboratory. Numerous at¬ 
tempts have been made to isolate organ¬ 
isms that might be the cause of the mal¬ 
ady. 

Very little is known of the history of this disease. It has been known for sev¬ 
eral years, but there are no reports of its presence previous to the freeze of 1894- 
95. There is no evidence that the disease originated in any particular part of the 
State. It may almost entirely disappear in localities where it has been present for many years, and appear again after 


an interval. This is perhaps due to vary¬ 
ing climatic conditions. 

From the evidence which has been col¬ 
lected, this disease belongs to the same class as Frenching, Melanose, Dieback, 
and Blight; all of which are due either to unfavorable soil conditions, improper treatment, or to as yet unknown causes. 

DISTRIBUTION. 

The Yellow Spotting of citrus leaves is met with in the State from the East Coast to the West Coast. It has been reported from Lake City in the North and from as far South as Miami. 

Its prevalence varies considerably in different groves in the same locality. In some groves or parts of groves, there may be only a few leaves affected on any tree, mostly in the upper portion of the tree. There may be many trees in be¬ 
tween the diseased ones, upon which no spotted leaves can be found. Other groves close by may have nearly eveiy tree affected, and on many trees a healthy leaf may be hard to find. 

In November, 1908, a careful survey

of the groves in one locality was con¬ 
ducted to see if the disease was limited to any particular soil or method of treat¬ 
ment. The disease was found to be pres¬ 
ent upon all soils in that section. The soils were mostly hammock or high pine land. The disease was equally present in groves that had received clean culture, 
in those that had no cultivation, and in those that had been more or less culti¬ 
vated. The disease was equally preva¬ 
lent in a shedded grove and in one that was not shedded, the two being located side by side. 

In the shedded grove, where sections of the roof had been removed, so as to expose to direct sunlight portions of trees that were previously shedded, the spotting was found to be more plentiful. 

Very few trees under three to four years of age were diseased. In the ma¬ 
jority of cases, the disease was most pre¬ 
valent upon trees that had recently borne a heavy crop of fruit. This would sug¬ 
gest a relation of the disease to the weak¬ 
ened condition of these trees. 

The spotting was found to be worst in the upper branches of the trees. When present on the lower branches it is usually thinly scattered. It often happens that a particular branch or twig may have the majority of its leaves affected, whereas the leaves of neighboring branches are perfectly healthy. This is particularly noticeable in trees that are only slightly diseased. Since these branches seem equally strong, there is presumptive evi¬ 
dence that the origin of the disease is within the plant, or in the soil. 

The disease is not confined to any par¬ 
ticular variety of citrus. It is most evi¬ 
dent on the grape fruit, on account of 


the larger size and deeper color of its leaves; and it is least evident upon the tangerine, on account of the smallness of the leaves. The disease is equally harm¬ 
ful to all the varieties of citrus which may be affected by it. 

SYMPTOMS. 

The symptoms of the Yellow Spotting of citrus are confined to the leaves. A 
spotting of the fruit resembling the spot¬ 
ting on the leaves, has been noticed in only one case. 

There are many variations in the gross appearance of the spots, thus making it difficult to give an exact description of them. These variations are evidently due to the different reactions of the leaf-tissue to the disease stimulus. The typical spots on the leaves are yellowish to golden-col¬ 
ored areas, a fraction of an inch or more in diameter. They usually occur be¬ 
tween the main veins and extend through the substance of the leaf. The areas dif¬ 
fer in appearance on the upper and un¬ 
der surfaces. On the upper surface, the yellowish or golden color is more notice¬ 
able ; the central portion of the area is often darker in color than the margin. 
It often presents a shiny, dark-brown ap¬ 
pearance. The discolored area is not raised above the surrounding surface of the leaf. The surface of the spot on the lower side of the leaf is often rough and projecting. It usually has a dull, greasy look, and a yellowish-brown or olive-green color. The surface in old spots may be¬ 
come dark colored and melanose-like. 

A cross-section of a healthy orange leaf when studied under the microscope, 
shows the leaf to be made up of layers of cells, Fig. i. The upper surface of 




90

the leaf consists of one layer of cells, 
known as epidermal cells. Just beneath the epidermis lie two layers of cells that are much longer than broad, and are ar¬ 
ranged as so many columns standing side by side, giving the appearance of a pal¬ 
isade. These cells are known as the palisade cells. Beneath these there are several layers of loosely arranged cells. 
These form arches and columns, leaving considerable air-spaces in between them. 
These cells constitute the spongy tissue of

the leaf. Beneath the spongy tissue is the lower surface of the leaf, which con¬ 
sists of one layer of epidermal cells, with openings for air, etc. 

Cross-sections of the yellow spots, 
when studied under the microscope, show the cells of the spongy tissue to be so swollen that the air-spaces between the cells are completely filled, Fig. 2. This swelling also causes a pushing out of the lower epidermis making the spot project. 
A brownish gum-like substance occurs at intervals between the cells. This is a secretion from the cells. In Fig. 2 this substance is shown in the shaded portion. 
A brownish deposit also fills the upper epidermal cells. It is this that gives the dark color to the center of the spot on the upper surface of the leaf. 

Corky tissue also develops, particularly in late stages of the spotting. It is the formation of this cork that gives the areas their melanose-like appearance. The corky tissue usually develops only on the lower surface of the leaf. It arises by division of the epidermal cells, Fig. 1. 
The corky tissue may also develop on the upper epidermis, taking its origin by di¬ 
vision of the upper epidermal cells. 


OTHER CASES OF YELLOWING OF CITRUS 

LEAVES. 

There are several different yellow ap¬ 
pearances on citrus leaves that may be confused with the yellow spotting. The yellow spotting differs in gross appear¬ 
ance from these by its dull greasy look and slight projection on the under sur¬ 
face, Fig. 2. 

The most common yellowing with which the yellow spotting may be con-

fused is that produced by the presence of insects such as the purple scale (Mytilas- 
pis citricola), on the lower surface of the leaf. In this case, there is only a loss of green color, and usually the insect or its remains may be found on the lower sur¬ 
face of the leaf. Again, unless the tree

is severely infested with the scale, the af¬ 
fected leaves are confined to the lower branches. 

There is often a yellowing of the leaves on trees badly diseased with die- 
back, which much resembles the yellow spotting, on the upper surface of the leaf; 
but these yellowed leaves lack the greasy projecting appearance on the lower sur¬ 
face that is characteristic of the yellow spotting. The yellow spotting has been found to occur upon trees diseased with dieback, but the yellow spotted areas are readily distinguishable from the yellow¬ 
ing due to dieback. 

When trees are being starved, espe¬ 
cially with regard to ammonia, there is a yellowing of the leaves. But this should not be confused with yellow spotting, 
since this yellowing is merely a loss of green color, and does not occur in round¬ 
ed areas. 

A yellowing of the leaves similar to that produced by starvation, is caused by the withertip fungus (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides). It is almost impossible to give a description from which a branch diseased with the withertip fungus may be recognized. Besides the yellowing of the leaves which is caused by a poison se¬ 
creted by the fungus, the bark of the branch will usually have a dry, dark, iron- 
gray or steel-gray appearance. The whole branch will appear decidedly unhealthy. 
The withertip fungus also attacks the leaves, producing rounded areas of an ashy-gray appearance, covered with mi¬ 
nute black specks. These specks are the portions of the fungus that bear the spores by which the disease is spread. This is the spotting described by Prof. Hume in

his book “Citrus Fruits and Their Cul¬ 
ture/’ 

EFFECTS UPON THE PLANT. 

Healthy leaves are the digestive or¬ 
gans of the plant. They manufacture the plant-foods, starch and sugar, from wat¬ 
er brought up from the soil, and from carbon dioxide obtained directly from the air. When the working surface of the leaf is greatly reduced by any cause, 
there is a reduction in the quantity of food manufactured. By the swelling of the cells in the spongy tissue, the air¬ 
spaces between the cells become closed up. This interferes with the entrance of air into the interior of the leaf. The de¬ 
velopment of corky tissue also excludes the air from the leaves at these points. 
This reduces the supply of carbon diox¬ 
ide from which the starch is manufac¬ 
tured. 

The leaves are also the breathing or¬ 
gans of the plant. The energy with which the plant works is supplied by this respiration. The reduction of the air- 
supply thus weakens the plant by cutting down its supply of energy. 

If only a few leaves on a tree are affect¬ 
ed, the normal processes of the plant are not interfered with. But when the ma¬ 
jority of the leaves are diseased, the life- 
processes will be enfeebled, and a per¬ 
ceptible weakening of the tree will result. 
Herein lies the chief harm the disease does to the tree. This reduction of the vitality of the tree allows the withertip fungus to gain entrance. 

The withertip fungus is peculiar in that when the tree is of its normal strength, this fungus is unable to gain en¬ 
trance into the wood. But immediately 


the vitality of the tree is reduced at any point, particularly in the region of the young tissue, this fungus bores its way into the plant. Once within it secretes a poison that further weakens the tissue, 
and allows the fungus to proceed farther inwards. When the fungus reaches a point in the tree where its vitality is equalled by that of the tree, it is unable to proceed farther. At this point, the branch will form a callus which may be seen as a ring. 

Though in many places the yellow spot¬ 
ting has been seen associated with die- 
back, yet there is no proof that there is any relation between the two. 

Very often the disease is accompanied or followed by melanose. This is partic¬ 
ularly so if the trees have not been strengthened by proper care and fertiliz¬ 
ers. 

The leaves on trees that are badly spotted are usually undersized. This stunted growth is probably due to the starting of the disease before the leaves were fully developed. 

CAUSE. 

In searching for a cause for a disease one must distinguish between those fac¬ 
tors that influence it, and those that cause it. For example, certain forms of fer¬ 
tilizers or certain methods of treatment of the trees may be an aid to the disease in its spread. Yiet these are not the causal factors. 

As yet no cause has been found for this disease. There is some evidence from field observations that it is transmissible, 
but attempts to transmit it by inoculation have given negative results.

TREATMENT. 

Not knowing the cause a specific rem¬ 
edy cannot be recommended. But inas¬ 
much as the chief harm appears to be due to the withertip fungus that follows the 


spotting, the recommendation for dis¬ 
eased groves is to strengthen and build up the trees by cultural methods, so that this weakening may be counteracted; and the withertip fungus thus shut out. 


WHITEFLY RESOLUTIONS. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Prof. Hume—If this is considered by you a suitable time at which to do so, 
I should like to introduce a set of reso¬ 
lutions directed to the Secretary of Ag¬ 
riculture, in the interest of whitefly control. Many efforts are being set forth at this time, looking to the control of this menace to our citrus industry, 
and good work is being done in work¬ 
ing out methods by our Experiment 
Station workers and by the Bureau of 
Entomology experts. Much has been added to our knowledge of control both by fungous enemies and by fumigation and these methods properly handled will go a long way toward abating the nuisance. 

But the fungous enemies do not hold control without interruption. Fumiga¬ 
tion in some sections is not practicable and besides there are localities where re-investation would be impossible to guard against. 

Now, in this connection, I believe there is another method of control which deserves careful investigation. 
The native home of the whitefly is said to be in China, and there is no reason to doubt but that it is there, held in check by natural enemies, the most im¬ 


portant of which are doubtless insects. 
These we should have and since the na¬ 
tive home is known, the task of secur¬ 
ing the insect foes should not be a dif¬ 
ficult one. What is needed is the serv¬ 
ice of one or two expert men acquaint¬ 
ed with insects, and having a knowl¬ 
edge of the whitefly. The introduction of efficient insect enemies would be of immense importance not only to our state but to California and all other citrus districts of the country as well. 

Therefore be it resolved that we ap¬ 
preciate the work which is now being done looking to the control of the whitefly in this state, by the Bureau of 
Entomology, and the Florida Experi¬ 
ment Station. We express our approv¬ 
al of these lines of investigation which have already resulted in much good to the citrus industry both in this state and elsewhere in the United States where Citrus fruits are grown. 

Resolved that in furthering this con¬ 
trol work we believe the native home of the whitefly should be thoroughly in¬ 
spected to secure the natural enemies of the insect. 

Resolved that we earnestly petition the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
Bureau of Entomology or other divi- 




94 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sions of the Department of Agriculture to send to the native home of the white- 
fly investigators and explorers to se¬ 
cure the natural enemies, insect and fungous, of the whitefly and introduce them into this country to further assist in reducing its numbers and the damage which it does. 

Mr. Temple—I think in my own case and most of the other growers who have that foe to deal with, we find that he is the most active “bird” we know anything about. The people in charge of the va¬ 
rious stations with their fungus, Dr. Mor¬ 
rill with his fumigation, other people with their various sprays that I have tried in the most thorough and systematic manner possible; all have some way to combat this pest, and while they are all good to a certain extent, yet they offer only tempo¬ 
rary relief. Fumigation I know by ex¬ 
perience is good, because I fumigated one of my groves and it killed everything that way in there, but in thirty days the grove was infested again with the whitefly. The methods now employed might be used to advantage if the whitefly was only a local nuisance but there isn’t much use in go¬ 
ing to all the trouble and expense to fumigate and spray when the first wind that blows will bring in a fresh swarm from an adjoining grove. My home place is on a lake and when the flies are on the wing and the wind happens to be in the north, they come across in swarms like blind mosquitoes. As they are not the re¬ 
sult of spontaneous generation, they must come from somewhere. They have a hab¬ 
itat somewhere; Prof. Hume says 
China; if that is true we should dislike 
China more for her whitefly peril than her Yellow Peril. We must get at some 


method of controlling permanently this menace, some whitefly evil that will sub¬ 
ject it before it subjects us, and I think the people who suffer from! it feel as strongly as I do. Now, you people who haven’t the whitefly, don’t feel slighted; 
you’ll get it. You are just as much in¬ 
terested in this, because you are going to find out why we feel so strongly. 

Mr. Hart-—I also wish to second these resolutions most heartily. It is work along the lines I think will be most ef¬ 
fective. Mr. Temple has expressed my sentiments in regard to it exactly. I be¬ 
lieve to obtain permanent relief we will have to depend on the natural enemies. 
It is not only on our groves but all about us on other places. If the department will make an effort and it is successful, in a short time I am satisfied it will cause the whitefly to drop back as a minor trouble. 
I am sure the department will assist us in this matter if we go at it in the right way, and I will be willing to contribute liberally to send a horticultural explorer finomi this state. I heartily second the resolution. 

Mr. Temple—I will be glad to be a sec¬ 
ond member of Mr. Hart's syndicate to under-write it. 

Mr. Parker—I also wish to heartily second this motion. I have several times made a statement to different parties that 
I thought the time was at hand to locate the home of the whitefly and its natural enemies, and I think the time is now. 
Fumigation, sprays and fungi are all do¬ 
ing good work. Fumigation and spraying are artificial means and fungi are the natural means, but we need all the help we can get. 

I understand our worthy President is

going abroad and expects to spend some time in the eastern countries. I am sure he will be interested in hunting up or finding whiteflies there, and probably sending them 1 to us after he is sure they are all good and dead, for comparison. 
He must be sure they are dead, though, 
for we want nothing imported but “good” 
whiteflies. 

Prof. Swingle—I am glad this matter has been brought up because I believe no one subject is of more general interest. 
I do not think it is generally understood the numerous difficulties that stand in the way of fumigation in this State. The mere mechanical means of handling tents is a serious matter. Then there are peo¬ 
ple who' do not and will not fumigate and we know the whitefly can migrate rapidly to considerable distances aided by a fa¬ 
voring wind. 

If it is found impossible, as it often is to secure government aid, because the ap¬ 
propriations are made two years in ad¬ 
vance, I would suggest co-operation with the orange growers of Texas and Califor¬ 
nia because it is a great menace in both of these States, and I am sure the grow¬ 
ers there will be glad to assist you. 

Mr. Painter—Would it not help us to obtain an agent from the government by our offering to contribute towards that expense, showing that we are willing to do our part towards accomplishing the end we seek? If it will, I want to be one of the number to help. 

Pfrof. Swingle—I do not think the matter has ever been adequately present¬ 
ed. It is not realized that fumigation is not a, complete remedy. They should have the matter presented to them by someone who is thoroughly familiar with 


conditions and has the whole situation at his finger’s ends. 

Mr. Hart—If we could get help by sending a delegation to Washington to bring the matter before committees there, 
it would be given much more attention than anything we could write out and send them in the form of a resolution. I 
think action in that line would be good. 

Mr. Painter—If the people will offer to pay half or more of the expenses of such an agent, the Department would take to it quicker than if we send a re¬ 
quest to them to send an agent. 

Dr. Richardson—It sometimes hap¬ 
pens that we think we experience religion early in life, but we find that we do not really get down to an enjoyment of its full beauties until we get pretty near the end. I think we have got down now to the most vital matter yet presented to this 
Society. I think the Department at Wash¬ 
ington should take this matter up; inde¬ 
pendent action may do us some good. 
There is always a danger, you know, of the introduction of enemies to bring something worse than the pest; therefore it should be a thoroughly competent man who would not do that thing. You re¬ 
member the story about the two Germans who wanted to go out on a coon hunt and borrowed a neighbor’s dog. Finally the dog treed something and Max said 
“Hans, hadn’t I better go up the tree and shake him down?” So he went up the tree and almost immediately a most tre¬ 
mendous racket commenced. Hans yelled 
“Max, do you vant me to come oop and help you hold him:?”’ “No, Hans,” said 
Max, “but come up and help me turn him loose.” He had got hold of a wild cat instead of a coon. Now, in our busi- 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


96 

ness, we don’t want to* get hold of any wild cat that we can’t turn loose. There is considerable danger of it. I know of one man who tried a harmless (?) remedy in his fly infested grove, and it has nearly destroyed his grove. Now, we want to- 
send some man who is willing to take this matter up thoroughly and do* it in an intelligent manner. No doubt you appre¬ 
ciate that fact 

Now, so far as your President going abroad, he is going merely as a superfic¬ 
ial observer. I will not have time or abili¬ 
ty to take up this subject, but of course 
I will observe carefully and do what 
I can for you. 

I think this resolution is one of the most important things that has been be¬ 


fore us and I hope it will be adopted. 

Motion made, seconded and carried that the Committee sent to the American 
Bornological Society, namely, Messrs. 
Tabor, Hume and Painter, visit the De¬ 
partment and submit this resolution in writing. 

Prof. Swingle—I wish to make a mo¬ 
tion that our retiring president be ap¬ 
pointed an official representative of this 
Society on his trip and that any courtesy extended to him will be appreciated by the Society. I have had experience, and 
I think something official will aid him in getting access to gardens, both private and public and get him facilities that a strictly private citizen might not be able to secure. Motion seconded and carried. 


Report From Committee Visiting California. 


By W. S. Hart. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I am a little afraid that our members present may be disappointed in the val¬ 
ue of my report of the visit to California, 
for the reason that I did not know until this morning that a report was expected. 
If the convention had been held a week or ten days later so that more of the members of that committee could have been present, then we might have had a very important and valuable report, I am sure. Since my return I have not really had time to give a thought to the matter much less to get our experiences and im¬ 
pressions up in a systematic form. If 1 
miss any points, just fire the questions at me and I will do my best to answer them. 

In the beginning let me say that this party started out, not for a pleasure expe¬ 
dition, but for business. It is true that we had every courtesy shown us, every comfort that modern convenience could supply in the way of Pullman cars, din¬ 
ers, observation car and a club car; three cars being devoted to our exclusive use, 
and on the way back there was as much of this as we needed, though part of our party was left on the way. We stopped at the Grand Canyon on our way out and the 
Pullmans were kept there for us. As we went to Los Angeles the next day and while still in the desert a committee came out to meet us from San Bernardino, 


bringing flowers and fruits and in that party were fruit growers, bankers and others who could answer intelligently al¬ 
most any question we might ask of,them. 

When we got to Los Angeles, the 
Chamber of Commerce gave us the Direc¬ 
tors’ room in which to hold our meet¬ 
ings, which was most excellent for that purpose. The California Fruit Ex¬ 
change invited us to be present at their business meetings so that we might see the inside workings of their system and they showed us their books and gave us every opportunity possible to study the marketing system of Cali¬ 
fornia which is, no doubt, the best in this country. If their method of handling fruit can be adapted to our state so as to meet the needs and require¬ 
ments of at least a large portion of the shippers, as I am sure it can be, it will mean a saving of hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. 

Leaving our baggage at Los Angeles, 
Messrs. Powell and Burton conducted our party to Garina, Azuso, Pomona, San 
Dirnas, Riverside, Redlands, San Ber¬ 
nardino and other places and for two days we were taken through die groves, 
through the packing houses and through the most beautiful spots of one of the most beautiful countries in the world. 
We were given every opportunity of 


7 



98 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


studying their system of packing and handling fruit. At Riverside we were taken to the top of cpiite a high moun¬ 
tain, standing alone in the valley, where we could look down upon twenty-five to thirty thousand acres of thrifty orang'e groves with the San Bernardino range of snow-clad mountains to shelter them, 
and form) a noble background for this beautiful picture. 

Leaving Los Angeles, we continued on to San Francisco, then to Chicago where we were taken all over the city in an automobile, through the wholesale fruit districts, etc., then home. 

I hardly know where to commence; 
there is so much material I can only give you a little smattering. 

The president suggests that I give you an idea of the size of the groves, trees, 
etc. I will say that the trees, many of them, are not large; perhaps they may average something like ours, but I was taken through one grove, Mr. Powell's grove, at Azusa, where the record returns for California were -made. In one crop they made $5,000 off two acres. These trees were large and being budded at Va¬ 
lencia late, the fruit comes to market in the summer and fall and meets m> compe- 
tion. Further north, in Tulare County, 
large areas are being planted and a great many young groves are coming on. They tell me they are planting very heavily around that point. I am, told that the fruit raised is of a much finer quality, be¬ 
ing more like a Florida orange. I saw some of them at San Francisco, that were really very good fruit. 

Some of the California handling and packing system can be adopted and ap¬ 
plied by the large growers here in this 


state, but I want to tell you that the Cali¬ 
fornia orange will stand treatment that would put a Florida orang'e out of busi¬ 
ness. Take for instance, just the mere method of putting on the covers. They fill their boxes full of oranges level to the top, then they put on another layer. It is then put under the press and the cover brought down and nailed. Suppose we tried that with our fruit. The person who did so would be soaking wet in five min¬ 
utes from the juice flying from the or¬ 
anges. Yet Mr. Powell who has done so much to improve the methods in Cali¬ 
fornia, told me that the top layer did not show decay as much as the middle. 

A great many of the packers and ship¬ 
pers think they are handling fruit very carefully and they are taking a great deal of pains to do so, but there are those in Florida who can discount them in the handling and grading of oranges. They really don’t know what really careful handling and packing is. Perhaps they do not need to, however, as their fruit will stand much rougher handling than ours. They have been held up to us as models and justly so in many ways and they have many methods that we might follow to our advantage, but they may also learn much from, a careful study of 
Florida methods and practices. 

Some of the packing houses are operat¬ 
ed by the independents, and some, the greater number, of course, are under the fruit exchange management. There are a great many different methods, but in a general way they resemble each other. 
In some, the fruit is first washed or brushed and then it goes on to the belts that carry it along to be graded. After grading it goes into the long sizers, thir-

ty-tvvo feet long, most of them. In some of the houses they use an electric sizer where the oranges are carried along on a belt until a certain size will trip a certain finger which causes it to be kicked off the belt into the packing bins. The fruit of 
California is all sized by the smallest diameter. Our fruit needs to be sized by the largest. Therefore, we have to have a different system, of sizing than they have there. They have a box-making and nailing machine that will nail from 1,200 
to 2,400 boxes a day. The machine turns them off very rapidly. One man to at¬ 
tend the machine can turn out 1,200 com¬ 
plete boxes or more; two men about 
2,400 boxes a day. Their boxes are made with two pieces on each side and this ma¬ 
chine turns them off complete. They use a fancy label that they paste on the head of the box, as you probably all know. 
Quite a number of packers of the state told me that they wish that they had nev¬ 
er been adopted, but still they look very pretty and they have a very great variety of designs. 

Instead of grading by number, they grade by brand and have a different brand' for each quality as put up. There is one packing house at Riverside that now stamps a little tag right onto the orange. When you unwrap the orange, 
there is a little elephant that stays right with the orange until it is eaten. The orange never loses its identity. Pre-cool¬ 
ing before shipping is being carefully tested there with very satisfactory results. 
The marketing system was explained at our last meeting. I will not attempt to give you that now, because I think most of you have had it through what Dr. In¬ 
man has said. 


Question—How far apart are the trees planted in the old groves and the new ones, and about what is the average crop ' J 

Mr. Hart—Well, the trees are planted at various distances as in this state and I 
think they will average about the same distance apart as on our hammock lands. 
I don’t think many of them are as far apart as in some groves on the pine land here. Those very large trees I spoke of covered only two acres and were much larger than any others I saw. I don’t know what their yield was in boxes but four, five and six boxes to the tree seems, 
to be about the average judging from what we could learn there. 

Ouestion—Tell us about the cleaning system: 

Mr. Hart—Most of the oranges are washed or brushed, although some are not. Where the fruit is clean and they can avoid it, many neither wash or brush it, 
while in other groves, all the fruit is washed. Some of it is run through a so¬ 
lution of permanganate of potash to kill all germs, but Mr. Powell told me that no chemical could be used that would kill the spores of blue mould. 

Dr. Richardson—Is that used in such strength as to color the orange any? It is one of the active discolorants of water and possibly it may color the fruit. 

Mr. Hart—No, I don’t think you can discover any effect of that kind on the orange. 

Dr. Richardson—It is used for the pur¬ 
pose of destroying germs, possibly. It is one of the best germicides known. 

Mr. Gillette—How does the quality of their Tardiff orange compare with ours? 

Mr. Hart—It is a thicker skinned 1 
fruit, and a darker red, but is not as 



100

heavy a fruit and I think will average smaller. 

Mr. Dade—Do they have rusty 

oranges there ? 

Mr. Hart—No, I don’t think they have the rust mite there. I talked with the horticultural commissioner about it and they thought they had, but the specimens they showed me did not show the effect of the rust mite. I think it must be something else. They have had a little touch of the whitefly but are confident that they have wiped it out. The commis¬ 
sioner told me he would give me $5.00 to find a whitefly. They exterminated it with fumigation; that is, they cover the trees with tents and treat them with gas. 
In California, that is a very much more 
(simple matter than in Florida. Where there is irrigation they can raise almost anything—orange trees, pepper trees, 
eucalyptus and roses galore; oh, such roses!—flowers of all kinds, but just out¬ 
side the line of irrigation there is noth¬ 
ing but sage brush or scrub; no timber at all, while in this country we have plants and trees that are host plants for the fly, 
scattered all over everywhere. Now if they can clean up a grove out there, the whitefly does not come in from outside. 
It is true orange groves there are all in one great body generally, but if they gas their trees and do it universally—(and they have laws there which make it com¬ 
pulsory—I don't see why they cannot just about exterminate him. With us it is en¬ 
tirely different and a far more difficult proposition. We have got a state full of china berry trees and all other kind of trees that harbor the whitefly about as well as the orange trees and when we fum¬ 
igate or spray to kill the ones that are in 


the grove, the ones from the outside sit around and wait until we have finished and then come right in and live with us. 

Their worst enemy seemis to be the black scale, which is confined largely to the coast. The purple scale, which with us is a minor trouble, seems to trouble them a great deal. They have a gum dis¬ 
ease among them. The gum will ooze from the limb or the trunk. They tell me the disease commences from the in¬ 
side of the trunk and in a little while the limib or trunk is dead. They have no treatment that they claim to be a posi¬ 
tive cure but several things are recom¬ 
mended for it. It very much resembles the foot rot on our trees only that it ap¬ 
pears higher up in the tree. The best remedy they have found is to dig out the dirt and expose the roots. Some ap¬ 
ply one or another application to it, but 1 
think that the most satisfactory remedy that they use is to just dig under the trees and expose the roots. 

Question—I would like to hear about the labor they have in picking and pack¬ 
ing fruit. How does it compare in intelli¬ 
gence and availability with ours and what do they have to pay for it. 

M,r. Hart—They use white help most¬ 
ly. The greater portion of their fruit is packed by white men and women. In some packing-houses they use the Chinese and I think they are found quite satis¬ 
factory help, too. They seem faithful and a number of growers to whom I 
talked seemed to think them very good help. There are not many Japanese em¬ 
ployed and as a rule they are not liked as well as the Chinese. 

Question—Did you see any paraffining process ? 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


101 


Mr. Hart—I did not. They have another trouble that looked to me very much like 'blight but when I asked about this tree or that tree that was suffering from it, they told me it was caused by gophers. Mr. Chase, who is one of the largest growers in California, told me it cost him $1,000.00 a year to fight goph¬ 
ers. 

Question—Why is it necessary to put the extra layer of oranges on top as you spoke of a few minutes ago? 

Mr. Hart—It is to make a full box. 
They claim that unless they pack very full the fruit gets into the market loose. 
In going through the fruit districts in 
Chicago 1 , I noticed the fruit coming from 
California showed full boxes. 

Mr.-Did they nail down 

the head at the center ? 

Mr. Hart—No, only at the two end's. 

Mr.-Mr. Chase has been 

introducing a bulge pack similar to the 
California pack. His man at Sanford started it first at Sanford. You know the pack I mean, do you not? 

Mr. Tabor—Did vou find out what 

j 

stock those trees were budded on, the ones that showed the gum disease more prevalent ? 

Mr. Hart—I do not think that the stock, so far as I could tell makes much difference because the disease is up above the bud or in the limb, so that so far as 
I could learn the stock made very little difference. 

Mr. Stevens—Have they a choice of stock ? 

Mr. Hart—They are getting seeds of sour oranges from this country and pre¬ 
fer the sour stock 

Mr. Tabor—Is it true in Florida and in 


Cuba that trees budded on lemon stock show gum disease much more than sour? 

Mr. Hart—I am not an authority on that. I have not had enough to do with the rough lemon stock to know of my own knowledge, but I have had exper¬ 
ience enough to make me dislike it, and I 
do not think I shall ever put any more in my grove. 

Mr. Quinby is present, and undoubt¬ 
edly he can answer a lot of questions that 
I cannot, and I think you had better ask him to talk a little. 

Mr. Gaitskill—Just a moment. Tell us before you go what they have out there in the line you have been talking about that is better than what we have that could be adopted here. 

Mr. Hart—I think the belt system of carrying the fruit along for grading will be adopted by a good many of the larger growers. It would not do where extreme care is taken, because the fruit is going along pretty rapidly, and if they miss a 
No. 2 or 3, it goes into- the No. i fruit. 

I do not think their nailing machine would answer for our boxes, because we strap ours while they only nail a little piece across each end of the cover, which is done when the cover is put on. They have a little device for holding the paper wrappers which they all use. It simply holds the paper in the tray when you are packing and keeps it from blowing about. 
They also use a “nail stripper” that is a help. There are small devices like that, 
some of which I have adopted and some 
I cannot. I am not the one to pass on the general packing-house outfit for the larger growers of the State, being only a small grower and requiring a totally different arrangement.

Mr. Gaitskill— I have found your sug¬ 
gestions good and anything that is good for you will be good for me. 

Mr. Hart—There is an orange clipper that they use in California, and here is a new one just gotten out which I will leave on the desk for you to examine. 

Mr. Quinby—I went with the Califor¬ 
nia party and gathered in a good deal of information while out there, and a lot of it would be interesting and doubtless in¬ 
structive to this audience. My voice is not at its best, but possibly it will improve the carrying quality of the Florida orange. 

I am connected with the firm of Chase 
& Co., of Jacksonville, who' market con¬ 
siderable of the Florida oranges and oth¬ 
er perishable products. We examined pret¬ 
ty thoroughly into' their marketing system while in California; in fact we went into the intricacies of it and there has been a time set on the ist of June at Tampa to bring in reports. 

When we arrived at Los Angeles, Dr. 
Inman called a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce, and we undertook to syste¬ 
matize the work for which we had gone there. The subject matter was divided in¬ 
to headings, such as packing* houses and their appliances, selling, government in¬ 
vestigations, and a number of various heads that we wanted to know about, and committees were appointed to take up specially the matter on which they were to be prepared to make reports to the meeting at Tampa on the ist of June. I 
was on one or two of these committees, 
and while I took copious notes I have not looked over them at all since I came back, 
and I don’t know that I can say anything in addition to what Mr. Hart has said, 


except to answer such questions as you may ask to the best of my ability. I would not undertake to go into 1 full and com¬ 
plete relation of what we saw and heard and learned while in California. 

It seems to have been the expectation of this meeting to have more or less re¬ 
ports from the committee who went to 
California in a formal way. It was sug¬ 
gested to me that if we passed a resolu¬ 
tion to incorporate into the report of the 
Society the reports and results of the meeting 'Which is to be held in Tampa next month, then it would be in print for the members of this Association and they would have the benefit of it in this way. 

I do not know your regular custom, but think it would be a good idea to pass a resolution now that the Secretary shall incorporate into the official report of the 
Florida State Horticultural Society the report that is made in Tampa on the ist. 
of June, and then you will have that re¬ 
port in full. 

Mr. Temple—Do you know how much their oranges cost them per box on the trees out there as a general thing ? 

Mr. Quinby—No, I do not know ; that is, interest on investment, working, fer¬ 
tilizing, etc. I should say it is just about the same as in Florida for the reason that they cultivate a great deal more and they spend a great deal more money on irriga¬ 
tion than we do- here, but they are almost free from having to' use fertilizer. That is almost unknown in California. Their oranges are grown on what I have known as clay soil. It has more or less of crush¬ 
ed granite and that keeps it loose. They do not let anything grow on it except the orange trees themselves, and cultivate all the year round. 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


103 


- Mr. Temple—Do you know what they receive as a general thing for their oranges on the trees ? 

Mr. Quinby—They get about 90 cents, 
or $1.00 a box on the trees. This is clear of the packing-house charge ana' the mar¬ 
keting expense. 

Mr.--What variety do 

they grow principally out there? 

Mr. Quinby—We saw very few or¬ 
anges except the Washington Navels. 
There are a good many Valencias, but I 
think about 80 per cent, of the output of California is Washington Navels. Now what they are putting out in Tulare 
County, which is about 300 miles north of Los Angeles, I don’t know. They are planting very heavily there, however. 

Mr.-How does the price of 

box material compare with ours ? 

Mr. Quinby—It is cheaper than ours. 
They buy it by the wholesale. They have their own mills. They have cut loose from a lumber trust out there and have backed up certain independent mills that were about to go broke, and in that way have kept the mills running and have been able thereby to take about all the output of these mills. Their package is not as good material as ours; it would not do with us for shipments in less than carload lots. 
The bottoms and sides are slats, and the ends are solid. 

Mr.--—Is there much set¬ 

ting out of new varieties? 

Mr. Quinby—In Southern California proper, that is, those valleys lying around 
Los Angeles, there is a fair amount of setting out, probably just as much as in 
Florida today. In Tulare County there are a great many new groves being set out. I am not prepared to tell you wheth¬ 


er they are planting in the new groves a larger number of Valencias than the 
Washington Navels or not. 

As to the production of oranges, unless there are disasters to the groves, or crop disasters in the next six or seven years, 
the output of oranges will be almost over¬ 


whelming. We were told that there were 
20,000 acres of new grove property com¬ 
ing on in Tulare County alone. They are putting out groves in Arizona and Tex¬ 
as, and the increase in the Florida out¬ 
put in the next seven or eight years will be enormous. This fact is rather signifi¬ 
cant if you stop to 1 think about it. Of course we don’t know what disaster may happen to reduce that output. 

Mr. Christiancy—I understand 'the water supply is playing out on a number of large dams in Southern California. I 


spent 15 or 18 years in California, and know of two larg*e dams that went dry at one time, and they were a couple of years in getting water. 

Mr. Quinby—We did not look into the water supply. We know that the water is sold, and in some sections the water con¬ 
tracts are appurtenant to the lands. 

Mr.-Tell us the methods 

they use for getting their fruit into the market ? 

Mr. Quinby—That is a wide cpiestion,. 
and the meat in the cocoanut. To handle a Washington Navel orange, considering the geographic position that California occupies in relation to its consuming markets, I don’t know of any set of men who could improve on their system un¬ 
less they were all Solomons. Their system is something that has evolved itself. It is not the work of any one man or set of men. It is the result of experiments and 











104 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the natural evolvement to fit the condi¬ 
tions of California. The method is this; 
last year the exact figures that the Cali¬ 
fornia Exchange handled in oranges was 
5,440,000 and some odd boxes that rep¬ 
resented 56 per cent, of the total Califor¬ 
nia output as near as they could get com¬ 
plete record, and that would throw the crop between 9,000,000 and 10,000,- 
000 boxes. The estimate for this year is for a crop of 12,000,000 
boxes of or angles and they ' es¬ 
timate that the Exchange will market 55 
to 60 per cent. The officials of the Ex¬ 
change do not claim that their control will reach beyond 60 per cent., and Mr. 
Story, who is President of the Exchange, 
told me it was not wise for them to un¬ 
dertake to market more than this. He said that in order to make a success of this thing there must be competitive sell¬ 
ing, not competitive underselling, but competition to return a better price to the grower all the time. Competitive under- 
■selling, which means a cutting of prices, 
must be stopped. California has arrived at such a point that they are in condition to stop under quoting, and the Exchange desires to market no more than 60 per cent, of the crop, so that conditions may remain as they are today. Now the 40 to 
45 per cent, of fruit that is sold by the independents is marketed both by salaried associations and also agencies working by per box contract, and in some in¬ 
stances are affiliated with the Exchange; 
and most of it is marketed on f. o. b. or in transit basis or else a spot cash basis. 
This means that if a buyer is putting his money into the fruit, that fruit is go¬ 
ing where there is a demand. Under the system of cash buying and f. o. b. and in 


transit buying, that much of the goods takes care of itself, because it is going where there is a demand. Now the 60 
per cent, is the balance of the product, 
and it is up to the California Fruit 
Growers’ Exchange to take it and develop it into a paying proposition. Their num¬ 
ber of f. o. b. and in transit sales are al¬ 
most minimum. They have abandoned the f. o. b. and in transit sales almost entirely. They have the markets of this country extremely well guaged and they can sit in their offices and tell you just how many each market should take, and how .it will make the market waver if you give them any more, and how it will make the price come up if you give them a little less. 

Suppose the fruit goes to' Kansas City and the miarket is a little off. The buying trade is told the price is so-and-so. They look at the fruit and take it or reject it. 
If it is refused the man in charge of the selling end in Kansas City wires in to Los 
Angeles that the trade will not take it at the price he offered it to them. Then they may tell him to sell so many cars at the price he is offered and divert the other cars. Possibly they may divert the whole lot. They carry their goods all over the country, and the Washington Navel will stand it. There is no additional cost for freight. In other words, after the cars once get to Denver it costs no more to send a car to Boston than to Kansas City. 
In that way they distribute vast amounts of oranges, and at this present time it is a fact that they have every known market just about crowded without having to make /concessions on the price. They have studied this marketing question for years from every possible standpoint. It

is a wonderful thing to sit in their office out in Los Angeles and see how they know the exact condition of every mar¬ 
ket, how they can put their finger on ev¬ 
ery car that is between California and the 
Atlantic Ocean, guage almost to a car¬ 
load what this market will take withouv the price being lowered, and taking away a little here where there is too much, to hurry it across several states perhaps, 
where there is not cpiite enough. 

The Board of Directors are representa¬ 
tive business men from every orange growing section in California. 

Now, those people out there know that the quantity of oranges going into the markets is getting to be enormous. They know that in the next six or seven years the present output will be greatly increas¬ 
ed'; therefore their far-sightedness is such that they are already beginning to> work on the consumer. They have commenced newspaper and magazine advertising that will bring the matter right before plain 
John Smith and his wife, so that it will create a desire in them to have oranges on their tables. They took the State of 
Iowa and put aside $—*-for ad¬ 

vertising. They don’t work on the job¬ 
bing trade nor on the retailer. They went right to work on the consumer, and are making him desire it, and they have in¬ 
creased the consumption in the State of 
Iowa about 50 per cent, the first year. 
They have appropriated money out of the common fund to increase the consumption in that way. These people are right up- 
to-date—in this instance you might say they are ahead of time, and they know what judicious advertising does. 

It is going to take lots of time and long-continued efforts to bring order out 


of the chaos into which the Florida or¬ 
ange growers have fallen; perhaps it is not so much chaotic as lethargic. We have needed an awakening for some time; last winter’s prices showed how much. It is going to mean spending money; it is go¬ 
ing to mean co-operation, but for every cent that is spent I believe you will get a dollar in return. Above all things it means co-operation, one and all. 

Out theie they do business by encour- 
aging the small buyer just as much as anv other; they give him just as good price’s on a one-car lot as on several; they give him just as much advantage of market conditions and just as good grades and brands for the money as they give the twenty or fifty car man, because the small buyer is always ready to do busi¬ 
ness for a little less than the big one. 
Now about selling direct to the consumer, 
I have heard Mr. Chase talk about this.' 
1 think there is but one way to do this, 
and that is to go into the store business in every city. That would mean a good deal, 
and I don’t think we are prepared to' fol¬ 
low. The thing is to try to introduce the genei al use of the fruit into the small communities. Because a small dealer is poor is no reason why we should try to keep him poor. 

The independents use the auction to some extent. This is the final court of reckoning for all the California product. 
They may have peddled it across the country and finally wound up there. They never sell privately in any market, that is, the Exchange does not where there is an auction. In those markets where there is a fruit auction they do not sell outside. 



106 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Mr. Christiancy—Can you tell us how long it has been in this systematized con' 
dition ? 

Mr. Quinby—In 1892 they were just as disorganized as we are today and for ten years they had a terrible time and a terrible struggle. I11 1903 they began what was known as the Fruit Agency, a joint office of the Independents and the 
Southern California Fruit Exchange as it was then called 1 . This Agency ran from the 1 st of April, 1903, until the 31st of 
Aug'ust, 1904, and was a consolidation of all agencies into one selling office. There was only one office from which you could buy fruit. The fruit carried badly that year. They abandoned the Agency and now let the Independents compete with the Exchange, so that the grower has two strings to his bow, and a good many take advantage of it. Until after the season of 
1902-3 under the regime of the Southern 
California Fruit Exchange, was a hard time for California growers. There were individual interests fighting the Ex¬ 
change, marketing interests fighting it that were tied up with car lines, and cor¬ 
porations fighting it. From 1892 to 1903 
they were not making much of a success of it because they were fighting each oth¬ 
er. They fought so hard that they agreed to stop fighting. Now with the California 
Fruit Growers’ Exchange handling 55 to 
60 per cent, and the Independents the bal¬ 
ance, they have things in pretty good working shape, and it would be well for us to follow it as nearly as we can, adapt¬ 
ing it of course, to suit our different con¬ 
ditions. 

Mr. Christiancy—I have been told that on all fruit that goes out of Riverside the 


grower is paid the same price per box; 
that is, every man gets the same per box for his fruit whether he sent 39 or 3,900 
boxes. 


Mr. Quinby—That is true in Californ¬ 
ia except those growers who put up their own fruit. The grower does not know anything about the price per box. His fruit is weighed in at the packing-house and of course, he knows how much his fruit weighs. Then it practically loses its identity. It is graded and then it goes on the sizer belt. His fruit is entered upon the books of the association by its weight and the distribution of returns is made according to weight. He does not know how many boxes lie has, and it would take a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out what his fruit has brought him per box. 
His fruit loses its identity and individual¬ 
ity entirely after it is weighed. 


Mr. Christiancy—The officials of the 
Exchange then could spend a half million dollars of the money and the growers would not know it. 


M,r. Quinby—I must say that I don’t think there is any grafting going on in the Exchange. One or two' are said to have been made millionaires in the past, 
but I don’t think there is any of that now. 
I think they are holding back 10 cents, a box now to create a fund for advertising purposes and other things possibly. Their fruit is sold on the box basis and the returns come on that basis to the local as¬ 
sociations. There it is split up into pounds. The records on the books are generally in pounds and so are the credit to the individual growers. The distribu¬ 
tion is made in that way.

DISCUSSION. 

Ml. Penny—I make a motion that the 
California committee be requested to furnish a report to our Secretary so that it may be published in the proceed' 
ings of the Society. 

Dr. Richardson—You have heard the motion, which is to the effect that the Sec¬ 
retary of the Society be instructed to ask the Orange Growers’ Society for copy of the report of the California Committee with the idea of copying it, or such por¬ 
tions of it as the Secretary and Executive 
Committee may deem wise, in our print¬ 
ed journal. I presume that is the way you wish the motion put, Mr. Penny? 

Motion seconded and passed. 

Mr. Hart—I want to bring up the mat¬ 
ter of this trip to California before we go on to the next topic. On this trip, the greatest benefit I received was contact with the men who made up the party. 
They are men who are successful in the line of work they followed. Now, I want to urge upon the members of this Asso¬ 
ciation the importance of their going to 
Tampa to attend that meeting* there. It seems to me that the psychic moment for organization has arrived. Of course organization will not make returns of $2 
or $3 a box for poorly packed and poorly grown oranges, yet where fruit is prop¬ 
erly handled the grower will get better returns for his money invested, his work and trouble in growing the fruit and will not feel that orange growing is so much a venture but more of a legitimate busi¬ 
ness. I hope that every orange grower, 
in fact, everyone interested 1 in Florida and her future prosperity will attend the meeting and help in the work, and I think 


it will be a mistake if the orange growers especially, do not do so. 

Dr. Richardson—I most heartily agree with Mr. Hart. I feel strongly every word said in my address last night. I feel that the time is upon us now when we should demand and get our rights. This paper that has been read is of vast importance. 
It shows us what a small body of mien, 
comparatively speaking, have been able to do with the railroad situation, and this small body of men have prevailed upon the State Commerce Commission to save us a great many thousand dollars. If we all combined, what might we not ac¬ 
complish ? Our savings would mount up into the millions in a short time. 

This Orange Growers’ Association is, as 
I understand it, still in an embryonic state. 
There was a meeting called in Tampa some two or three months ago for the purpose of organization. The organiza¬ 
tion was not completed at that time. We decided that a committee should go to 
California and spy out the land and come back and report on the 1st of June to another meeting at which all orange growers and all men interested in horti¬ 
cultural and agricultural matters could come and be welcome. We hope you will all come; as a citizen of Tampa I invite you and as a member of this Society and as its President I urge upon you to come to that meeting. It did me good to go to the preliminary meeting. Mr. Hart says it did him good to be associated with men of their calibre, and I am sure 
Mr. Hart will permit me to say that it did them srood p e associated with Mr. 
Hart. No thanks are necessary sir, I am sure there are no growers in the State

who could not learn many things from you. 

You must wake up to the importance of organization. We have to do 1 it some time, and why not now ? Why wait another year and get returns that will barely pay the running expenses ; per¬ 
haps not that. These men in California are reaping a rich harvest as a result of their organization. We must take some decided action if we expect to get any¬ 
thing in the way of returns. 

I feel that it is incumbent upon the 
Chair to reinforce Mr. Hart’s and Mr. 
Quinby’s remarks. Get your local papers, 
if you can, to call attention to it and let it be the beginning of organization that will give Florida her rights which she has been denied so long. Who is to' blame for it? Who is responsible for the condi¬ 
tions that are existing today, where we, 
who grow the best oranges on earth, can hardly make the expenses necessary to 


grow them? You have m> one but your¬ 
self to blame. In your strenuous opposi¬ 
tion to each other you have forgotten that it is only in union that there is strength. 
Fighting each other, you are like the Kil¬ 
kenny cats; in joining forces you may assume proportions that will win you the victory over all opposition. Don’t let this matter fill you with enthusiasm for the time being, and then be forgotten. Join forces with the most influential men, the brainiest men, the most successful men and help them to make this thing a suc¬ 
cess. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose. 

Dr. Richardson—I have been testing these clippers. I don’t know what Mr. 
Hart intended to do for the people of 
California in bringing these as samples but have been testing them on some rose stems here on the desk. The clippers from 
California do not cut rose stems every time, while Mr. Hart’s clipper cuts them every time. 



Tropical Fruits. 


By E. N. Reasoner. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

From the latitude of Florida one would judge that sub-tropical plants would be the limit in tenderness that the inhabi¬ 
tants would try to grow; but its penin¬ 
sular position with large bodies of water surrounding the southern half of the 
State tempt us into growing entirely tropical plants, which from time to time are frozen back by the Northers sweeping down on us from “up country.” 

If Uncle Sam in his reconstruction of the map instead of considering a ship canal across the State would kindly look into the matter of building us a mountain range across the northern part of the peninsula we of South Florida would consider it much more to the point. With that protection we could grow nearly any¬ 
thing, even as it is we are able to raise a great many things of value; fruit trees, 
economic and ornamental plants, trees, 
vines, etc., of the more vigorous and hardy members of the Tropics. 

The most valuable have come to us from India, Mexico and the West Indies, 
and in fruit trees and plants the follow¬ 
ing find a congenial home along the coast and in the protected Lake regions of 
South Florida, where they are seldom in¬ 
jured by cold; the pineapple, the mango, 
the banana, the guava, the avocado, the sapodilla, the sugar apple, the custard ap¬ 


ple and a few less valuable, all being well known and grown on a commercial scale. 

The cultivation of each of these is being extended and the best varieties for 
Florida conditions are being tried and tested thoroughly. Much assistance has been given along this line by the Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture, especially through the efforts of the subtropical laboratory at Miami, where hybridizing pineapples and other work is progressing favorably. 
However the greater knowledge as to culture and shipment of these fruits has been worked out by individual growers so that now there is a substantial base to work from in selection of suitable loca¬ 
tion, soil, fertilizing, cultivation, frost protection, packing and shipping the fruit. 

The pineapple so far stands out pre¬ 
eminently as our most valuable tropical fruit and the plan of selling fruit through the association of growers is admirable. 
Pineapples are mostly grown in open air and the principal variety is the Red Span¬ 
ish. In localities where frost is more like¬ 
ly to occur, sheds have been erected over small areas and the more delicate va¬ 
rieties, notably the Smooth Cayenne, 
grown successfully. By cheapening the existing express and freight rates a great impetus would surely be given this in¬ 
dustry and the finer varieties could then 



110

be profitably marketed in large supply, 
the demand being almost unlimited. 

The mango requiring from three to five years to come into bearing has been grown in a limited way for years, but since the introduction of choice East In¬ 
dian varieties its cultivation has grown wonderfully and one kind has been fruit¬ 
ed sufficiently to create great enthusiasm among both growers and market men in the North. The fruit from seedling trees is very stringy and too' strong of turpentine scent and flavor for strangers to like, yet has been shipped sparingly for years being salable only in our southern coast cities, while the finer kinds grown from grafted trees find instant sale in all markets at excellent prices. The fruit of the best East Indian sorts is free from fibre, and is of a tender lusciousness only comparable to a perfect, dead-ripe, free¬ 
stone peach. If one intends growing a mango at all, by all means set a grafted tree as it requires no more care than a seedling and produces fruit far superior to any seedling two years from the graft. 
The Mulgoba is the oldest East Indian variety in the State, but we now have about forty other kinds, being the cream of East Indian varieties. A number of these were introduced by myself begin¬ 
ning in 1887 from seed of selected fruit grown at Saharanpur, Northwest Prov¬ 
ince of India where the finest mangoes in the world are produced. The cold weath¬ 
er of the next few years killed out these trees and then I began importing grafted trees from the same locality which are now well established; several have fruit¬ 
ed, all of excellent quality. One or two other enthusiasts have also imported grafted varieties and the Department of 


Agriculture has added considerably to the number, all of which are flourishing. 
The fruit of the mango must be shipped by express to ensure delivery in perfect condition, and may thus be sent to all parts of the country. I have personally sent mangoes to California, Colorado, 
Illinois, Ontario, New York and Wash¬ 
ington City in perfect order. Here again, as in shipping all our more deli¬ 
cate produce, comes in the matter of cost of handling by express, and it seems a great business may be developed in Flo¬ 
rida by the proper co-operation of grow¬ 
er and express companies. It may be that with installation of a Parcel Post service by the Postoffice Department such relief will be given the express com¬ 
panies that they can give adequate atten¬ 
tion to shipments of fruit at a lower rate than now exists. The people of Florida should feel especially interested in a 
Parcel Post service, but so far they have made little effort as compared with Pa¬ 
cific Coast people, to hasten forward this much to be desired institution. The pro¬ 
duction of mangoes can be profitably done in the open air all along the coasts of 
South Florida and in the interior of the 
State with slight protection, such as af¬ 
forded by cheap sheds or wind breaks supplemented by occasional firing. 

Bananas are very susceptible to dam¬ 
age by frost, but the more hardy kinds can be grown largely even where the leaves are frozen off every winter, the stalk being seldom injured and throwing up growth again quickly. The most val¬ 
uable sort for general growth are the 
Hart’s Choice, or Lady Finger, a very hardy and vigorous kind with delicious fruit. We have the Orinoco', or Horse

Banana, a kind of plantain, valuable for cooking, which is as hardy as the Hart’s 
Choice. The fruit of all bananas sells well in our local markets, but has not been grown to such an extent that shipping 8 
long distance has been found necessary. 
The Cavendish, or Dwarf, is more largely grown in extreme South Florida and is a valuable sort for the more protected coast regions, standing more severe winds than taller growers; its fruit resembles the Martinique variety so largely import¬ 
ed. There are but few others so far tried that seem to be valuable for Florida con¬ 
ditions, but testing is going forward. Ba¬ 
nanas may be grown in a large commer¬ 
cial way on proper soil in South Florida and the industry only awaits capital for further development. 

Guavas grow so readily in all parts of 
South Florida that they seem indigenous. 
The fruit varies in quality, but all are good to those who have acquired the taste, 
for cooking and for eating out of hand. 
The habit of the bush in bearing abund¬ 
antly for weeks, only eighteen months after being frozen to the ground, makes it extremely valuable for us. Orchards of the more acid sorts are being grown now for jelly making, an industry cap¬ 
able of great expansion. Selection of the best sorts should be encouraged, and every house lot should contain a number of bushes for home use. Cuttings of the guava may be rooted readily; use large wood, making cuttings a foot long in Au¬ 
gust preferably. In this manner the finer sorts may be raised. The Guinea guava seems to be the most free from seeds of any sort yet introduced, and is a thick meated, sweet fruit of good size. The 
Cattley and the Chinese are really semi- 


tropical sorts capable of standing consid¬ 
erable frost. They are fine evergreens and may be grown in hedges, being use¬ 
ful and ornamental. As a hedge plant the Cattley guava is superior to most sub¬ 
jects so far used in South Florida as it is free from insect pests; as a fruit its acid¬ 
ity causes it to be generally liked even by 
Northerners, but jelly made from it is not so fine as from the tropical forms. 

The Avocado has leaped into popular favor during the past few years and its fruit is the most valuable of any grown in Florida at present. The tree is a na¬ 
tive of Mexico and the West Indies, and stands a little more cold than the Mango, 
byit seedlings require from six to fifteen years’ time to produce their first crop and so their planting has been neglecteu. 
Large old trees are now producing won¬ 
derful returns all over South Florida and as the trees may be readily budded to fine varieties of known quality, ripening from early summer to January, a great impetus has been given its cultivation along our coasts. The budded trees bear in from two' to four years from the bud, 
and hence a planter may soon realize from his investment. The culture of the 
Avocado is bound to be one of our lead¬ 
ing industries very soon. 

Among the uncommon fruits that have proved to be a success in South Florida and which may be grown very easily are the following:—Kai-apple, (Aberia Caf- 
fra) of South Africa, and its relative (A. 
Gardneri) from Ceylon; both bearing when young and as with the guavas sprouting up when frosted down and bearing within a year. The Sapodilla 
(Achras Sapota), Cashew-apple (Ana- 
cardium occidentale), Custard-apple

(Anona reticulata), Sugar-apple (Anona squamosa), Papaw (Carica papaya), 
Amatungula (Carissa arduina), White 
Sapota (Casimiroa edulis), Shakewood tree (Cecropia palmata), O'taheite goose¬ 
berry (Cica disticha), Sea Grape (Coc- 
coloba uvifera), Rose-apple (Eugenia jambos), Surinam cherry (Eugenia Mi- 
cbeli), Mammee-apple (Mammea 
Americana), Ginep, or Spanish Lime 
(Melicocca bijuga), Ceriman (Monstera deliciosa), Granadilla (Passiflora of sorts), Otaheite apple (Spondias dulcis), 
Hog-plum (Spondias purpurea), Tama¬ 


rind (Tamarindus Indica), Limeberry 
(Tripbasia trifoliata) etc., all of whicn may be grown with more or less profit in 
South Florida. 

An abundance of fruit in our diet is a necessity and owners of land no matter how small its area, should devote a little time and attention to this important mat¬ 
ter ; it would pay in both good health and money. Only lack of energy prevents any landowner in South Florida from enjoying a great variety of luscious fruits every day in the year.

A good many years ago someone stretched a line across our state and called it the frost line. We did not know its exact location but it was supposed to be somewhere about the 28th degree. 
South of this line we could and did, grow all kinds of tropical fruits galore. We had guava trees, good big ones that one could climb about in and while the sum¬ 
mer was guava season there was scarcely a day in the year that we couldn’t have a guava pie a foot thick if we wanted it. We didn’t have to plant guavas, they just came up spontaneously in fence corners and along the road and during the summer the razor backs waxed fat; it the fruit did not fall fast enough an old sow would get up on her hind legs and grabbing one of the lower limbs with her teeth shake vigorously, ^generally with gratifying results to the accompanying family. We had alligator pear trees 40 
feet high that produced big thick-meated fruits that sometimes reached two pounds 


in weight, have heard them drop at night with a mushy kind of thud which meant the breakfast salad was already prepared with the addition of a little salt. 

We had other tropical fruits too. Man¬ 
goes, Tamarinds Rose and Sugar Ap¬ 
ples, and others of less note but we ap¬ 
preciated them all and were foolish enough to think we would always have them or most anything else we wanted but one night in December, 1895, some¬ 
thing happened to the frost line, possibly a stray mule got tangled up in it, at all events it was broken as many of us re¬ 
member and regret, and for fourteen years we have been trying to pick up the loose ends and run in a splice, so far meeting with no success. 

The guava is very persistent and may be killed to the ground year after year and still keep coming and if fortunate to escape one winter it will produce a few fruit the following summer, but our once big trees are now but stunted bushes that

once in three or four years give us a lim¬ 
ited supply of fruit. All the other fruits are gone although for years we nursed and coddled them. 

I am speaking now of our own place which is situated on the Pinealas Penin¬ 
sula. There are some favored spots in this modern Garden of Eden that are pro¬ 
tected by a body of salt water between them and the break in the frost line, but these are much in the minority. 

Of course I am speaking of natural 


conditions, what may be accomplished with a little protection is wonderful, and if we make up our minds that we want all the good things our soil will produce we can have them just the same. After all 

it only means that we have to give up a warm bed and: turn out for one or two nights and burn up a little wood. Per¬ 
haps we will get the frost line mended sometime and get back to conditions as they were twenty years ago. 


TROPICAL FRUITS—HOW AND WHERE GROWN. 


By E. V. Blackman. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When I received 'notice it'hat I (had been appointed to write and read a pa¬ 
per before the State Horticultural Soci¬ 
ety on Tropical Fruits, I felt that the task was too great and that there are many members of the Society who are more conversant with this branch of hor¬ 
ticulture and have had many years more experience along these lines than I. This 
I felt was especially true in the case of 
M,r. Reasoner, the honored chairman of this committee. A few days since I receiv¬ 
ed a letter from Mr. Reasoner, asking that I prepare such a paper, I concluded to make an effort along the line and do the -best I could. 

In a paper which necessarily must have for its first essential briefness, it would be impossible to treat the almost number¬ 
less kind of tropical fruits, their value, 


commercially, and the methods of culti¬ 
vation, hence we shall speak of only a few of the most desirable sorts. 

First, let it be understood that w’e shall treat the growing of these desirable fruits in portions of the State where frosts and winter blizzards do 1 not come with sufficient force to destroy the trees. 
A large majority of the purely tropical fruit trees, are very susceptible to kill¬ 
ing frosts, indeed many of them are so tender that a frost that would seriously kill tomato vines would damage the trees to a greater or less degree, yet there are some that have great vitality and when cut down by cold, sprout from the roots and soon come into bearing again. In sec¬ 
tions where this condition is likely to oc¬ 
cur, I would not advise planting tropical fruit trees commercially; but if I lived in a part of Florida where these frosts occur

only at periods covering several years, 
there are varieties or kinds of tropical fruit trees which I would plant for family use, taking every precaution in case of cold to protect them. The four kinds I 
especially call attention to is the Avocado, 
Mango, and Paw-paw and Bananas, four of the most valuable fruits known to hor¬ 
ticulturists, not only for the family table, 
but commercially, the commercial orchard 1 
being of the greatest moment. 

WHERE GROWN. 

Dade County and the Florida Keys, 
so far as I know are the only places wnere these fruits are grown commercially, in the State. In this I may be mistaken as I 
am not familiar with the country on the southwestern coast of Florida and the adaptability of either soils or climate for the production of these fruits on a com¬ 
mercial scale. If I am wrong it is an er¬ 
ror of ignorance, not willfulness. 

THE AVOCADO. 

( P.gratiasima .) 

Thirteen years ago when I came to 
Dade County, the Avocado was found growing luxuriantly around the homes of the early settlers in the rocky lands and in the sand lands in the northern por¬ 
tion of the county. The fruit was then unknown in the northern markets but was highly esteemed by the native popu¬ 
lation for food. We have heard it said that many of the natives made their breakfast entirely upon the Avocado, accompanied with a small piece of bread and a cup of coffee. It is claimed that it contains a larger amount of nourishment, than any other fruit known. As people came in from the North, they soon became as fond 


of the Avocado as the natives and each settler proceeded to plant a few seeds, to produce fruit for home use. Trial ship¬ 
ments were made to northern cities, es¬ 
pecially to those which had a large Latin¬ 
speaking population and it was soon found that there was a good demand' for the fruit and each year the demand has increased. The great difficulty found in marketing the Avocado, was, that the trees were all seedlings and while the great majority of fruit was good and could be classed as better, best, (none poor) there were no two 'trees which grew exactly the same kind of fruit, in size, color and value for eating purposes. 
The more advanced horticulturists rec¬ 
ognized the fact, that in a great measure the seedling Avocado was like the seed¬ 
ling orange or apple and efforts were be¬ 
gun to produce “known varieties.’’ An¬ 
other difficulty the pioneer had to en¬ 
counter was that the maturing season did not cover sufficient time to make growing the Avacado, a commercial success. Mr. 
George B. Cellon, of Miami, who owns the only purely tropical nursery in the 
State, has the honor of discovering and propagating in large quantities, an Avo¬ 
cado known as the “Trapp.” The original tree was found on the Trapp place at 
Cocoanut Grove. The distinctive value of the Trapp, is that it ripens late in the season. This year a few specimens were exhibited at the Dade County Fair in 
March. This makes the Trapp the most valuable Avocado grown and the only variety that has been known to hold its fruit so late in the season. The prices re¬ 
ceived for the Trapp from December to the last of February are almost prohibi¬ 
tive to persons of ordinary means. To

illustrate, Mr. Cellon has in his nursery rows a large number of young trees that are holding some fruit every season. For the past two or three seasons, he has had sale for all his fruit at home, at from 50 
to 75 cents and sometimes reaching $1.00 
each, the parties driving to his place two and one-half males from the city for them. This was the price unpacked and unwrapped at his door. Mr. S. B. Bliss, 
who owns the largest 'budded Avocado grove in the world, sold his Trapps this season at from $12.00 to $17.00 per crate of four dozen f. o. b. and did-not have nearly enough to supply the demand. Mr. 
W. E. March, who was among the first to plant the Trapp disposes of his fruit to 
Hicks & Son, New York, for which lie re¬ 
ceives fabulous prices with a constant cry for more Avocados. Dr. Wetzel, of Co- 
coanut Grove, informed Mr. March that he received instructions to bill his Trapps out at one dollar each. Among the other 
{valuable varieties grown here are the 
Pollock, which was originated by Mr. S. 
H. Pollock, of this city. Many of this variety weigh two and one-half pounds and some specimens have weighed three pounds. The fruit matures from July to 
October. The Rico, originated by Capt. 
C. J. Rose, Cocoanut Grove, season from 
August to November. The Blackman, or¬ 
iginated by the writer. Samples of this fruit were sent to the Agricultural Depart¬ 
ment, Washington, D. C., and after a thorough test were pronounced the best 
Avocado ever tested by the department and was named after the originator. 
Season from November to December. 

SOILS. 

The Avocado will thrive well on any 


well drained soil, whether it be sand or rock. Those who are anticipating planting 
Avocados should remember this and not plant on low, wet ground. In the vicinity of Miami, the commercial orchards are planted on the rocky lands. 

FERTILIZING. 

The Avocado is a gross feeder and will utilize almost any kind of fertilizer manu¬ 
factured, cotton seed meal or stable ma¬ 
nure. On the rocky lands which are lack¬ 
ing in humus, perhaps well rotted stable manure is preferable, but this cannot be procured in quantities sufficient for growing a commercial orchard. The na¬ 
tive people never used a fertilizer of any kind for their Avocado trees but experi¬ 
ments have demonstrated that a tree well fed and cultivated produces more and bet¬ 
ter fruit and of uniform size. We would emphasize the fact that the Avocado< tree revels in high fertilization and as before noted, does not seem particular as to the kind of fertilizer used or what it is com¬ 
posed of. Generally speaking, in the rocky soils of Dade County, cotton seed meal is not considered a safe fertilizer, 
but the Avocado thrives on it when used in quantities. 

MANGOES, 

(Mm 1 gifera In die a,) 

Mango trees were among the first fruit trees planted in this tropical section. The first settlers came from Cuba, Nassau and other islands bringing with them seed which they planted in profusion around their new possessions. It was found that the mango made a more rap¬ 
id growth, came into bearing earlier than on the islands, and that the fruit was 





116 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


of better quality. Nearly or quite all of the original trees were produced from the wild jungle seedlings and were known as the turpentine mango. They were of va¬ 
rious sizes, colors and shapes, the large flat seed encased with a mass of fiber, 
making the eating process a most dis¬ 
agreeable one, yet the jungle mango is a most delicious and palatable fruit. The writer has never yet tasted a poor mango and when the proper method of prepar¬ 
ing the jungle mango for table use is fol¬ 
lowed, it is highly prized. For fear we may forget, we will give the method used' in preparation for the table in our home. 
Peel the fruit, and then with a sharp, 
thin knife slice the mango very thin, 
sprinkle with sugar and place in the re¬ 
frigerator for two hours before serving. 
Great luscious Crawford peaches sink in¬ 
to significance beside a dish of mangoes prepared in this manner. The new comers to this southern section soon become as fond of the mango as the natives. Ship¬ 
ments 'began in a small way to the north¬ 
ern markets; but it was found that the fibrous conditions of the fruit was a great detriment to it and that unless a variety could be produced without fiber, 
the mango would never become a pop¬ 
ular market fruit. The Agricultural De¬ 
partment at Washington, has taken a great -interest in securing this kind of fruit, without the fiber, and all mango countries have been scoured and rescour¬ 
ed to secure choice market varieties with¬ 
out fiber. In this the Agents of the De¬ 
partment have been highly successful. 
Among the choice varieties imported which have been fruited are the Bennett, 
which was introduced in 1902, from In¬ 
dia, the Gordon, from Trinidad, West In¬ 


dia, the Mulgoba introduced in 1889, the 
Sundasha, a later importation. The latter has been fruited in the United States 
Tropical gardens at Miami. All of these varieties have proven to be most excel¬ 
lent fruit, and practically fiberless. 
Among the native varieties is the Perrine, 
originated by Mr. James F. Roberts, of 
Perrine, Florida. There are a number of others which have been originated in this section, which have proven to bear fruit of exceptionally good quality. The orig¬ 
inal Miulgoba tree was sent to Mangonia, 
from which tree the greater portion of trees which are now bearing have been budded. 

SOIL AND CULTIVATION. 

The mango is a most hardy tree and flourishes on any well drained soils. At 
Mangonia, Palm Beach and other points in Palm Beach County the soil is light and sandy and whenever weather condi¬ 
tions are right the trees flourish and bear immense quantities of fruit and of splendid quality. In Dade County, where the soil as a whole is very rocky, the mango makes a phenomenal growth and is a heavy bearer. Budded trees are ex¬ 
pensive and the average farmers who are planting the budded varieties, are anxious to get the best possible results, giving the young trees extra good attention and fertilizer. Here is where a great mistake is made and it is safe to' say that the greater portion of budded trees that have been lost by the planters have been lost by over fertilization. Experience is teach¬ 
ing the fact that budded mango trees for the first few years develop more rapidly when they are seemingly neglected. When thoroughly rooted a mango enjoys high

117 


fertilization as well as any tree that we have planted. Hard wood ashes have proven with us the best fertilizer for the young buds and this applied only in lim¬ 
ited quantities. 

THE MANGO AND AVOCADO. 

These are the coming fruits for sec¬ 
tions where they can be safely grown. 
We do not advise planting these fruits in portions of the State, where frosts are liable to come; but in all portions where the weather conditions are right, a com¬ 
mercial orchard of these fruits will pro¬ 
duce more cash to the acre, than any known fruit. It is not to be expected that in years to come, Mangoes and Avo- 
cadoes will bring the fabulous prices that are maintained now, but the fact is there are such limited areas of Florida, where these fruits can be safely grown, that the demand will always be greater than the supply and 1 consequently high prices will be the rule. 

THE TROPICAL PAW-PAW. 

(Carle a Papaya.) 

This at present is one of the least known fruits that is grown in this south¬ 
ern section and when its value as a fruit is understood, will make an unlimited de¬ 
mand for it, both as a table fruit and for medicinal purposes. 

The paw-paw is really a melon that grows on a tree,' with the fruit attached to the body. One of the greatest difficul¬ 
ties in growing the paw-paw is that there is no way of distinguishing the male from the female tree, until it begins to bloom. Apparently there are many more male than female seeds in the fruit. I 
have been growing the paw-paw for the 


past several years and have had one or two male trees bear small fruits of good flavor. The trees fruit in about eighteen months after planting and continue to bear for several years, ripening one fruit at a time. 

, The paw-paw will grow on any soil that is well drained. Last year the writer lost two large trees by an overflow of salt water. Other trees standing by were not damaged, but have been fruiting through¬ 
out the entire season. 

This fruit has only to be known in the northern states, when the demand for it will be greater than the supply. 

THE SAPADILLO. 

t (A Sap at a.) 

The Sapadillo is another of the tropi¬ 
cal fruits which in years to come will be¬ 
come popular in the markets of the 
North. So far there has been no attempt to improve the varieties and all trees ‘are grown from the seed. It adapts itself to any kind of soil and is a free bearer. The skin is of russet color, some kinds having a tinge of re 1 on one cheek. This is another fruk for which one must edu¬ 
cate the taste before it becomes really en¬ 
joyable, but when once the taste is ac¬ 
quired there Is a continual desire for more sapadillos. It is a good shipper, 
standing long journeys well. 

THE BANANA. 

{Musa.) 

In this Southern portion of the State, 
the banana is being grown to a consider¬ 
able extent commercially. For many years the people living on the Florida Keys have been growing this fruit quite largely for market purposes, their only market 



118 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


being Key West, where the fruit brought remunerative prices. Since Miami has be¬ 
come a city of commercial importance, 
the growers have found a splendid 1 mar¬ 
ket for the output here. The soils on the 
Keys are, as a rule, very rocky. Indeed so much so that they are not cultivated as a whole. The rock formation is what is known as the “pot hole formation,” the plants being set in the holes or cavities where there is some soil. 

Since the extension of the Florida 
East Coast Railway to Miami and South, 
banana growing is assuming greater pro¬ 
portions and many have, and are planting for commercial purposes. One planter in the Homestead country has less than an acre planted from which he has sold this season four hundred bunches at one dol¬ 
lar per bunch. 

SOILS WHERE GROWN. 

Perhaps there is no other tree or plant which will flourish on all sorts of soils, 
from the richest mulck to the most ordi¬ 
nary pine lands, as the banana. Seeming¬ 
ly it rejoices in a rich, black alluvial soil, 
yet at the same time on the poorest sand lands, by the aid of fertilizers and water it seems to flourish equally as well. The dwarf or smaller varieties thrive better on the sand lands than the larger and coarser kind's. It is believed from the experiments thus far made, that banana growing in the near future will become a 


most important factor in this Southern clime. Cotton seed meal or almost any kind of well balanced fertilizers are uti¬ 
lized readily by these plants. 

OTHER TROPICAL FRUITS. 

There are a large numiber of other kinds of tropical fruits which have been and are being grown in this Southern territory which so far have not proven of commercial value; but many of them should be planted for the fruit for home use and for decorative plants. Among these are the Kai-apple, (Aberia Caffra,) 
Carissa, (Carissa pappaya,) Star-apple, 
(C. Cainito,) Cocoa-Plum, (C. Niger,) 
Sour Sop, (A. Muricata,) Rose Apple, 
(E. Jambos,) Sea Grape, (C. uvifera) 
Barbados Cherry, (M. glabra) Maumee 
Sapota, (L. Mammasoa,) Ceriman of 
Trinidad (M. deliciosa.) This is but a small list of the real tropical fruits which may be grown in the portions of the State where frosts do not occur. Nearly all of the above list are being grown in the vi¬ 
cinity of Miami and several of the most rare kinds of these fruits were exhibited at the Dade County Fair which was held in March last. While many of these fruits will never be of commercial value, they are very palatable and should be grown. 

The pineapple, guava and other fruits are not mentioned in this paper as they are being grown extensively in many por¬ 
tions of the State. 


Economic Value of Birds to Farmers and Fruit 

Growers. 


By Prof. Wm. F. Blackman. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

There are four chief reasons why the lives of our birds ought to be protected. 

The first of these reasons is urged by the poets and the preachers—the birds are beautiful to look at and lovely in song, 
and hence should be cherished; the second reason is urged by the sportsmen—game birds must be protected in order that they may be reasonably abundant during the shooting season. The third reason is urged by the tourist and those whom he supports and enriches—birds along our seashores, lakes and river courses, espe¬ 
cially such as are tropical or semi-tropical in plumage and habit, give a charm to the 
Florida landscape which is unique; as a valuable asset to the hotel keeper, to the railway and steamboat company and to all those whose livelihood is derived in con¬ 
siderable measure from our winter vis¬ 
itors we should not permit the process of extermination of our plumage birds whicn has already gone to so deplorable a length to continue. 

These three reasons for the protection of our Florida birds, are good, all of them. But there is a fourth reason, to which attention is perhaps less often called, but which is no less cogent than the others. I refer to the economic value 


of our birds to the farmer and fruit¬ 
grower. It is to this matter that I wish to call your attention for a few minutes this evening. 

There are three ways in which birds perform services of incalculable import¬ 
ance to the tillers of the soil. In the first place, they help to keep down nox¬ 
ious weeds; in the second place, they de¬ 
stroy injurious insects; and in the third place, they devour rabbits, mice and other rodents, which infest and injure the fields and the orchards. 

i. Take the matter of noxious weeds first. How many plows, harrows, hoes,, 
rakes, darkeys, mules and dollars are ded¬ 
icated to the doleful business of killing weeds? How we sweat and groan over the task, which forever renews itself^ 
year after year! How do these weeds; 
tempt to profanity? How do they test our faith in the divine order of the world? 
Why, we ask, did a good God create “pus- 
ley” and sandspurs? Meantime, millions of feathered field-hands are working tire¬ 
lessly from dawn to dark every day to 
“down” these weeds in the gardens; in the plowed fields, in the pasture lands and ranges, in the woods, everywhere, 
they are at work with keen eye and swift wing and sharp bill and voracious appe-

tite, destroying the seeds which other¬ 
wise would cover the earth and quintuple the farmer's toil—and the mule’s. 

Take the quail, the bobwhite, for exam¬ 
ple. Dr. S. F. Judd of the biological sur¬ 
vey reports having examined the stom¬ 
achs of thirteen quail, and that these contained 5,584 weed seeds; he also re¬ 
ports that on another occasion 801 stom¬ 
achs of these birds were examined, gath¬ 
ered from twenty-one different states, it being found that slightly more than one- 
half their contents was composed of seeds, chiefly of weeds, some sixty differ¬ 
ent species being represented. It was found that not less than 1,500 such seeds had been devoured at a single meal, and that some stomachs contained as many as 
3,000 or 5,000 seeds. A thousand crab- 
grass seeds were found in the stomach of a single quail, and 10,000 pigweed seeds in that of another. Dr. Judd computes that the bob whites in Virginia consume not less than 573 tons of weed seeds in a single winter. 

The mourning dove is also a valuable assistant to the farmer in this regard. 
An examination of hundreds of stomachs showed that from 60 to 70 per cent of the food of this graceful and grieving bird is composed of the seeds of weeds; “in a single stomach were found 7,500 seeds of the yellow wood sorrel, in another 6,400 
seeds of barn grass or foxtail." The lin¬ 
net, which is accused, and not without reason, of eating and injuring fruit, 
nevertheless was found to have 80 per cent of its stomach contents composed of the seeds of weeds, most of them nox¬ 
ious. The food of the red winged black¬ 
bird is chiefly the seeds of weeds, as is that of the sparrows, of which there are 


some forty varieties. Mr. F. E. L. Beal of the Biological Survey, once computed that a single species of sparrow, the tree sparrow, in a single state, Iowa, consumed 
1,750,000 pounds, or 875 tons, of weed seeds in a single season. 

Now, how many field hands, working with the hoe at $1.5° P er day, would be required to exterminate the miserable harvest of 875 tons of weed seeds in the state of Iowa if any considerable portion of these had sprouted and grown? And how much, then, do the farmers of Iowa, 
owe the tree sparrows of that state for a single season’s service? And if they can¬ 
not, and need not, pay this debt in coin, 
what measure of gratitude and of protec¬ 
tion do they owe these feathered friends, 
of this and other varieties. 

2. A still more important service to our farmers is rendered by the birds through the destruction by them of in¬ 
jurious insects. 

I hold in my hand a letter from Dr. 
T. S. Palmer of the bureau of biological survey at Washington, regarding the re¬ 
port which is now being prepared for the 
National Conservation Commission, and which is soon to be published, on the in¬ 
jury done our agricultural interests by in¬ 
sects. Dr. Palmer states that Dr. L. O. 
Howard, chief of the Bureau of Ento¬ 
mology, estimates “the total annual loss of all kinds caused by insects, including injury to crops, garden truck, forests, do¬ 
mesticated animals and health,” at the stupendous figure of $1,200,000,000. An annual loss on account of insect depreda¬ 
tions of above $13 for every man, woman and child in our population; a loss each year exceeding by more than 25 per cent the total public debt of the United

121 


States, or the joint capital of all our na¬ 
tional banks; a loss greater than the en¬ 
tire annual expenditure of the federal government, including the cost of the army, the navy, pensions and interest on the public debt; a loss equal to the value of all the merchandise imported annual¬ 
ly into the country, and nearly seven times the total receipts of the postoffice de¬ 
partment, or the salaries of all the teach¬ 
ers in our public schools—this is the al¬ 
most incredible estimate of our annual loss through beetles, bugs and their kind, 
which the Washington savants ask us to accept. 

Whether the estimate is exact or not, 
we have only to remind ourselves of the havoc wrought by the boll-weevil in the cotton fields of the south and the Hes¬ 
sian fly in the wheat fields of the north, 
by the scale and whitefly in our orange groves, and the curculio, the cankerworm, 
the codling moth, and the tent caterpillar in the orchards of other sections, and by the Colorado potato bug everywhere be¬ 
tween the oceans ; of the prairies devastat¬ 
ed from time to time by hordes of grass¬ 
hoppers ; of the forests infested with cat¬ 
erpillars and borers; of the cattle infect¬ 
ed with Texas fever by ticks; of the men and women infected with various grave diseases by mosquitoes and house flies, 
and of how many hot days and dear dol¬ 
lars we have all spent in warring against these pests—we have only to remind our¬ 
selves of these things in order to gain some sense of the burden imposed upon us by these hosts of hostile insects. 

How shall they be kept in check? How shall this drain on our resources be di¬ 
minished? We resort to insecticides— 
sprays, poisonous fumes, what not—and 


these afford some relief. Meantime, 
there is fighting for us, day and night, 
if we stop to 1 think of it, a countless and patriotic army of birds, swift and skill¬ 
ful and untiring, and amazingly hungry. 
Among these are some forty varieties of woodpeckers; how marvelously acute the ear which hears the movement of the grub buried within the tree and accurately locates it, how astonishing the muscular power which drives the sharp bill into the wood again and again, with almost un¬ 
believable rapidity and precision of stroke; how wonderfully fashioned as a spear the barbed tongue which pulls the borer from his hiding place! Examine the stomach of a woodpecker, and you will find ants, grubs, caterpillars and scale insects in great numbers, most of them the farmer’s foes; 5,000 ants have been found in the stomach of a single “flicker.” 
How wonderful the chemistry by which the cardinal turns “adult beetles, grass¬ 
hoppers, crickets, flies, ants and their larvae” and rose bugs into brilliant feath¬ 
er and ecstatic song. Mr. E. IT. Forbush, 
ornithologist of the Massachusetts State 
Board of Agriculture, has recently report¬ 
ed some experiments with a number of chicadees which frequented an old apple orchard in that state. In the stomachs of four birds there were counted more than 
1,000 eggs of the canker worm; and in addition to this it was estimated that each chicadee devoured daily during the early spring, on an average, thirty female cank¬ 
er worm moths, each containing in her body more than 5,000 eggs, so that each bird destroyed more than 140,000 unlaid eggs, besides those already deposited, dur¬ 
ing the twenty-five days in which the cankerworms were creeping up the tree

trunks. Was there ever another such omelet ? 

The Biological Survey examined the stomachs of 420 kingbirds and reported insects, mostly noxious, as constituting 
90 per cent of their contents. In the case of the phoebe, the percentage was even larger, and included klick beetles, May beetles and weevils, wasps, flies, bugs and spiders. The stomach of a cuckoo was found to contain 250 tent caterpillars and another 217 heads of the fall web worm; 
the stomachs of 155 cuckoos contained 
2,771 caterpillars, largely of the hairy va¬ 
rieties, which most birds refuse. The blue jay, that burly, self assertive, squal¬ 
ling, pugnacious and rapacious, though handsome rascal, who sometimes no doubt destroys the eggs of other birds, has been shown to be the devourer of large quan¬ 
tities of harmful insects; even the thieving and omnivorous crow, whom nobody seems to love, eats beetles, grasshoppers, 
cutworms, and other caterpillars, chiefly noxious, in great numbers. More than one-half the food of the meadow lark is composed of beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, 
caterpillars and a considerable portion of the remaining part of noxious weed seeds. 
All the several species of swallows, the scurrying cavalry of this beneficial army, 
live chiefly on winged insects, of which they devour immeasurable quantities. 
More than 60 per cent, of the stomach contents in the case of the brown thrasher, 
more than 70 per cent in the case of the blue bird and more than 90 per cent in the case of the house wren have been found to consist of insects. More than fifty species of birds are known to prey on the boll weevil, that implacable scourge of our Southland. 

And so the merry and tuneful warriors 


wage battle against the invading army of bugs all day and every day, especially during the breeding season, in the upper air, among the branches of the trees and up and down their trunks, in the field, in the swamp, and by the roadside. Nor does this battle cease as most battles do, 
with the coming on of darkness, for then the night hawk, or bullbat, takes up the assault—Tie most voracious perhaps of all the insect eating birds. Its stomach is enormous, aldermanic, and it is seldom empty. Mr. Beal, of the Biological Sur¬ 
vey reports the results of an examination of the stomachs of 100 bullbats; in one of these some 1,800 ants were found, in another the remains of thirty-four May beetles, and in another Colorado potato bugs, squash bugs and leaf hoppers. One stomach contained portions of seventeen different species of insects. Myriads of mosquitoes, among them the fever-carry¬ 
ing kind, are destroyed nightly by this winged and grunting board of health. Yet there are farmers who look on smiling while uninstructed boys amuse themselves by shooting bullbats in the twilight. 

To be sure, certain species of birds, 
like the cherry bird, the blue jay, the crow, the rice bird, the red winged black bird, the crow black bird, the linnet, the sap sucker, the robin and the cat bird are accused of eating and perforating fruit and stealing grain, and no doubt justly so; 
probably some birds help to spread scale insects from tree to tree, but I am con¬ 
vinced that all of these, taking the matter 
“by and large,” are far more beneficial than harmful and deserve our thanks and protection. Is not the laborer “worthy of his hire?’ 

3. A third service to the farmer is ren-

dered by such predaceous birds as feed on mice, rabbits and other injurious ro¬ 
dents. In some countries, as in Austra¬ 
lia, these rodents inflict almost incalcul¬ 
able damage upon agriculture, and every¬ 
where they are harmful to the nursery, 
the orchard and the field. It is to the keen eye, the swift, strong wing and the sharp and cruel beak of hawk and owl that we must chiefly look for protection against these gnawing nuisances. There are in the United States above seventy species of these birds, and they all have excellent appetites. Now and then no doubt they snatch a chicken from the barn yard; no doubt they destroy numbers of our smaller and useful birds; but we know that their chief food is not these. Here is one report among many, made by the experts: “In the stomachs of forty-five rough-legged hawks (Archibuteo lago- 
pus sancti-johannis), taken in several dif¬ 
ferent states, were found 128 harmful rodents, one weasel, one schew and sev¬ 
enty insects. The rodents (besides nine¬ 
teen which could not be determined spe¬ 
cifically from the remains) consisted of one gopher (salamander), two rabbits, 
four house mice, four white-footed mice, 
and ninety-eight meadow mice. No traces of birds or poultry were found in any of the forty-five stomachs.’* I once saw a shrike drive his beak into the skull of a sparrow; this was a single instance, but how many hundreds of noxious animals and insects have we all seen impaled on orange thorns by these bloody butchers of vermin? Yet I still recall vividly the sense of noble achievement I felt, as a boy, when I succeeded in kiliing a hawk or an owl; I ought to have been spanked, 
but there have been state legislatures fool¬ 
ish enough to offer bounties for the de¬ 


struction of these good friends of the farmer. 

This, then, is the service which the birds render to us farmers and fruit growers—they are incessantly at work decimating the army of noxious weeds, 
insects and vermin, which is ever swarm¬ 
ing across our fields—creeping, jumping, 
burrowing, flying—and which except for the protection afforded by the birds would devour all our substance. 

It is computed by some experts that the number of these friendly birds, tak¬ 
ing the whole country together, has been diminished in recent years by some 50 
per cent.; be this as it may, I think that all observers will agree that they are not so numerous as they formerly were, or as they ought to be. 

I appeal to you on behalf of our feath¬ 
ered friends. Seven things you can do to protect those we have and to increase their number—you can refrain from shooting or trapping them, or allowing them to be shot or trapped on your prem¬ 
ises ; you can provide for them safe breed¬ 
ing places and an occasional lunch about your door; you can prevent your boys and others from destroying or robbing their nests; you can see that the children are properly instructed in home and school concerning this matter; you can assist in preventing the passage of unwise game and bird laws, and in securing the passage of such as are good and wholesome; you can help provide for the appointment of a suitable number of suitable persons as wardens, state and county, and, lastly, 
you can encourage the Florida Audubon 
Society, of which it is my privilege to be a vice president, in its crusade for bird protection, by becoming members or by contributing to its treasury.

TRANSLOCATION OF PLANT FOOD CONSTITUENTS IN THE 
PLANT AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN DEVELOPING AND 

MAINTAINING. GROWTH. 


By J. S. Carroll. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Once upon a time, it is related that a priest was called upon by his parishioners to pray over their lands and bless them in order that they might yield abundant harvests. As he passed' from place to place pronouncing his benedictions upon the soil he came upon a very unpromising field. Surveying these barren acres with great despair, he exclaimed: “Ah! breth¬ 
ren, no use to pray here; this land needs manure.” 

From the writings of the earliest inves¬ 
tigators we find that it was the custom of man to assist nature in yielding abun¬ 
dant harvests by applying to the soil va¬ 
rious substances called manure. Little did he know or understand at that time the fundamental principles underlying their use, for little work of any consequence had been undertaken to pry into nature’s secrets or to attempt to interpret her im¬ 
mutable laws. As the years moved on¬ 
ward man became more interested in the processes of nature and many learned in¬ 
vestigators devoted years to the study of 


plant growth, the composition of plants, 
their food and sources of food supply, 
thereby laying the foundation and paving the way for our present knowledge of chemistry in its relation to agriculture. 

While the beginning of true scientific agricultural chemistry may be dated from important discoveries during the latter part of the 18th century by such scientists as Priestly, Scheele, Lavoissier, Caven¬ 
dish and Black, yet it is interesting to pause a little while to note a few theories advanced by some of the early writers as to plant growth. 

It was believed by the alchemists that manure acted in some mysterious way— 
that “spirits” left the decaying* manure and entered the plants producing a more vigorous growth. The worthless character of leached manure was attributed to the fact that the “spirits” had departed from such manure. From this source we have handed down to us such expressions as 
“spirits of hartshorn,” “spirits of nitre,’ 
and many others, showing the ideas then entertained as to the composition of mat¬ 
ter.

Early in the 17th century van Helmont undertook to solve the problem of plant growth and proved to his satisfaction that all the products of plant growth were de¬ 
rived from water. 

Some fifty years later Digby (1660) 
attributed the growth of plants to a kind of “Balsam” which the air contained. 

A theory advanced later by Jethro Tull was to the effect that the food of plants consisted of soil particles and that these soil particles must be rendered very min¬ 
ute before they could be absorbed by the rootlets. This theory is of interest since the importance of good tillage is empha¬ 
sized in crop production. 

The first contribution of importance to the subject of plant nutrition was made by a Swiss naturalist, Bonnet, during the 
18th century. He found that air is the true source of carbon which forms so large a part of the plant substance. 

The first work written in the English language on Agricultural Chemistry was in 1795 by a Scottish Nobleman, the Earl of Dundonald. His teachings were that plants ‘are composed of grass with a small proportion of calcareous matter.” 

DeSaussure in 1804 gave to the world the most important contribution to science up to this time. He was the first to call attention to the mineral or ash constitu¬ 
ents of plants and maintained that these ash ingredients were essential, for with¬ 
out them plant life was impossible. 

* 

In the early part of the last century 
Sir Humphry Davy published a series of lectures on Agricultural Chemistry which added to the knowledge of the composi¬ 
tion and functions of the soil. 

Boussingault in 1838 was the first chemist to carry out elaborate experi¬ 


ments to determine the question whether plants could assimilate the free nitrogen of the air. 

It was not until 1840 when Liebig pub¬ 
lished his celebrated work “Organic 
Chemistry in Its Application to Agricul¬ 
ture and Physiology” that the new science of Agriculture was inaugurated. In his preface he states that “perfect agriculture is the true foundation of all trade and in¬ 
dustry, but a rational system of agricul¬ 
ture cannot be formed without the appli¬ 
cation of scientific principles, for such a system must be based on an exact ac¬ 
quaintance with the means of nutrition of vegetables and with the influence of soils and actions of manures upon them. 
This knowledge we must seek from chem¬ 
istry which teaches the mode of investi¬ 
gating the composition and of studying the character of the different substances from which plants derive nourishment.” 

Chemistry tells us that the materials of which all matter is composed consist of some seventy distinct elementary forms of matter known as chemical elements. 
It is by means of chemical analysis that we are able to determine the elementary composition of the earth and its life. 

Less than one hundred years ago it was learned that plants are built up from ma¬ 
terials from the air and soil, water being one of them. The number and kind of elements that have been found to be ab¬ 
solutely essential to the growth of plants are ten—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitro¬ 
gen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, sulphur and iron. These are called plant food elements and all healthy plants must contain them, and' in the ab¬ 
sence of one of them, the plant cannot make a normal growth. 



126 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Plants derive their food from the air and the soil. The air supplies direct chiefly the element carbon, although it is the original source of hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Hydrogen and oxygen are supplied mainly through the soil in the form of water. 

About 95 per cent, of the total dry matter of plants comes from the air; the remaining 5 per cent, is in the incombus¬ 
tible or ash constituents which are sup¬ 
plied exclusively by the soil. These ash constituents are indispensable for without them the carbon of the air, the hydrogen and oxygen of the water and the nitro¬ 
gen of the soil and air could not enter in¬ 
to plant life. 

The plant takes its food througii the leaves and roots which are called the or¬ 
gans of nutrition. 

The chlorophyll or green coloring mat¬ 
ter in the leaf-cell plays an important part for it is in these leaf-cells that the carbonic acid of the air is decomposed through the influence of light and heat, 
the carbon being retained while the oxy¬ 
gen is given off. This process is called assimilation and takes place during the daytime, while at night the food made during the day is changed, whereby it can be transferred in solution wherever it is needed. Iron as well as daylight is nec¬ 
essary in the formation of chlorophyll. 
The carbon absorbed by the plant and the hydrogen and oxygen taken up by the roots in the form of water meet in the leaves of the plant and are formed into starch, sugar, fat, etc., and the same ele¬ 
ments together with nitrogen and a little sulphur form the albuminoids. 

The manner in which the roots take up food 1 is very different from that of the 


leaves, for the surface membranes of the roots are not full of holes and solid mat¬ 
ter cannot pass through. Therefore, the food must be in solution and its absorp¬ 
tion by the rootlets is obtained by means of diffusion or “osmosis.” The food de¬ 
rived from the soil is not taken up as in¬ 
dividual chemical elements but chiefly in the form of acids or salts. Thus nitrogen is combined with oxygen to form nitric acid and when united with bases like po¬ 
tassium or calcium forms potassium ni¬ 
trate or calcium nitrate. These weak so¬ 
lutions taken up by the roots are concen¬ 
trated in the upper part of the plant ow¬ 
ing to rapid evaporation by the leaves and are used in the formation of new tis¬ 
sue. 

While considerable research has been given to the work of determining the functions performed by the different con¬ 
stituents taken into' the plant, yet there is very little definite knowledge on this subject at the present time. 

As the material furnished by the air is supplied freely and abundantly to' every plant it will not be necessary to devote any time to it but we will turn our atten¬ 
tion to the substances furnished by the soil. The soil does not always supply the plant with sufficient material for its growth and as these deficiencies must be made good by man before he can hope for abundant harvests we will consider for a few moments the part they play in plant life. 

Of the elements supplied by the soil as plant food, magnesium, iron and sulphur, 
and sometimes calcium, are usually found to exist in sufficient quantities to supply the requirements of plants. Potassium, 
phosphorus and nitrogen, and some-

12? 


times calcium 1 , are not always present in sufficient amounts in an available form to supply the needs of the growing plants. 

Sulphur occurs in plant tissue in com¬ 
paratively small amounts. It is taken into plants in the form of sulphates, as potas¬ 
sium sulphate, calcium sulphate, and oth¬ 
er sulphates, and plays a very important part in the formation of albuminous mat¬ 
ter of plants. These albuminoids move about in the plant, principally towards the grain and fruit. In some plants sul¬ 
phur is a constituent of the essential oils and can be detected by the odor such as in the onion, garlic, horseradish and oth¬ 
ers. 

While iron is necessary for plant growth and is always present in plants, it occurs in about the smallest amount of any of the ash elements. The function of iron is to assist in the formation of chlor¬ 
ophyll or the green coloring matter of plants. It is not known yet whether iron enters into the chemical composition of chlorophyll or is merely associated with it.. 

Magnesium occurs in much smaller amounts than calcium does although it is stored up in the seeds about three times more liberally than is calcium. Magnes¬ 
ium assimilates more slowly than any of the other ash constituents of plants. It en¬ 
ters into the chemical composition of the chlorophyll although plants do not re¬ 
quire much magnesium until the period of formation of the seeds. It has been found that plants grown with an incom¬ 
plete supply of magnesium frequently have sterile seed. 

Calcium is always present in the ash material and plants cannot reach full ma¬ 
turity without it. In fact some crops, such 


as clover, peas, alfalfa, require so much calcium that they are called ‘dime plants.” The special function of calcium is in assisting in the construction of the cell walls, and no new plant cells can be formed without it. Calcium, is found in the leaves of plants at all stages of growth and is very essential for their full devel¬ 
opment. It has been stated that calcium compounds are necessary for the conver¬ 
sion of starch into cellulose. 

When the growth of a plant has been checked by withholding calcium, the plant will show increased vigor within a few hours after supplying it. Calcium un¬ 
like magnesium is assimilated in the early stages of the plant’s growth, for example in wheat 80 per cent, is assimilated before the plant heads. It does not accumulate to such an extent in the seeds as do- some of the other ash elements for only about i-io of the amount removed by grain crops is in the seeds, the remaining 9-10 
being distributed throughout the straw. 

It is probable that more work has been devoted to the study of nitrogen as a food for plants than to any other element. 
This is a specially interesting subject for the reason that plants are surrounded by an atmosphere of nitrogen and it was to determine whether it was possible for plants to use the nitrogen direct from the air. It has been found that there are only certain plants called legumes that have the power of utilizing this nitrogen for food by means of nodules or tubercles on their roots. Nitrogen is taken up by the roots of plants in the form of nitrates and combines with carbon, hydrogen and oth¬ 
er elements to form the nitrogenous com¬ 
pounds so largely present in plants. In the absence of nitrogen a plant makes no

12S 

appreciable growth and when there is an insufficient supply of this element the plant's foliage does not develop a rich green color but takes on a yellowish tinge. 

Phosphorus occurs in parts of the plant in the form, of phosphates. These phosphates play a very important part in the development of the young plant at the time of germination. 

Phosphoric acid is one of the constitu¬ 
ents of chlorophyll and is necessary ft li¬ 
the building up of every plant cell. It is not only important to young plants but is necessary at all stages of the plant’s growth. 

The chief function of phosphorus may be said to be to aid in the production and transportation of the proteid sub¬ 
stances. These proteid bodies which are produced in the leaves are finally trans¬ 
ported to the seed where they accumulate to the greatest extent. From 60 to 75 per cent, of the total phosphates removed in a crop is found in the seeds. 

The translocation of phosphoric acid in the plant is very interesting. It is the most mobile substance of all the inorgan¬ 
ic constituents of plants. It is continually moving from the lower to the upper part of plants, and a large percentage of phos¬ 
phoric acid found in the grain was moved from the leaves and stems of plants even after it had once come to a rest in these organs. 

In speaking of the function of potassi¬ 
um Prof. Harry Snyder in his excellent work on “The Chemistry of Plant and 
Animal Life” says: “Potassium is one of the most important and least variable of all the elements found in the ash of plants. It is quite evenly distributed 


throughout the growing plant and gener¬ 
ally occurs in the entire plant in the larg¬ 
est proportion of any of the essential ash elements. It is taken up in the early stages of plant growth and is always present to the greatest extent in the active and growing parts as in the leaves where the production of plant tis¬ 
sue occurs. Potassium is one of the ele¬ 
ments most essential for the plant’s de¬ 
velopment. 

“The function of potassium is appar¬ 
ently to aid in the production and trans¬ 
portation of the carbohydrate com¬ 
pounds, as starch and sugar, and thus in¬ 
directly in the formation of all organic matter. In sugar and starch-producing crops, as sugar beets and potatoes, it takes an important part in the growth and development. Potassium doubtless has much to do in the way of regulating the acidity of the sap by forming organic salts such as potassium bitartrate in grapes. At the time of seed formation there is a slight retrograde movement of the potash, in some cases a small part be¬ 
ing returned to the soil. The supply of available potash in the soil has great in¬ 
fluence upon the vigor of plant growth. 
Weak and sickly plants are always defi¬ 
cient in potash. Some crops require more growth than do others and some experi¬ 
ence difficulty in obtaining it. Some plants contain such large amounts of pot¬ 
ash that they are called ‘potash plants/ ” 

All research shows that in the higher order of plants potassium; cannot be re¬ 
placed or substituted by any other ele¬ 
ment 

It is a common fact to all plants that the various constituents move about in the plant during its growth.

The leaf of the plant is its laboratory where food is prepared for the support of the parts of the plant. But when the leaf has grown old and the purpose of its existence has been performed, it gives up its life and substance to 1 perfect tffe parts of the plant and 1 finally to the per¬ 
fection of the seed whereby the plant may perpetuate itself. 

It is known that plants do not have the same chemical composition at different 


stages of growth and it is due to the dis¬ 
covery of this scientific principle that we have been taught some highly important lessons as to the times and seasons at which crops may best be harvested. 

There is yet much work to 1 be done in adding to our present knowledge of the special functions of different plant food constituents and no field of research offers better opportunity to our scientists than investigations of this character. 


THE STATE CHEMIST'S AID TO THE FARMER. 


By B. H. Bridges. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Having been placed on the committee to report on Fertilizers, and being fa¬ 
miliar with the control of the state’s supply, I have decided to devote my pa¬ 
per to the discussion of the fertilizer trade, paying special attention to the past year. 

At the outset, I may say that the fer¬ 
tilizer found upon the market during the past year has fully met, and on the aver¬ 
age been above, the standard represented by the analysis on the tags. It is my be¬ 
lief that no manufacturer of a commo¬ 
dity in this country is so careful as to the quality of his goods as is the manu¬ 
facturer of fertilizers. 

In this day when the spirit of com¬ 
mercialism has permeated every endeav¬ 
or we may justly ask the question if it is business for the manufacturer of fertil¬ 
izer to try to defraud the consumer of 


fertilizer. Those who are not intimately acquainted with the facts might say that any manufacturer will defraud the con¬ 
sumer when he can. I do not believe this to be so for the reason that it is not to the best interest of the manufacturer to practice fraud. And the reasons why it is not to the best interest of the manu¬ 
facturer to defraud the consumer is be¬ 
cause there is a true co-partnership rela¬ 
tion between the consumer and the man¬ 
ufacturer; and second, because of the en¬ 
forcement of the fertilizer law by the state authorities and the exercise of the privilege of the special sample by the citi¬ 
zens under the law. 

It is an unquestioned fact that a ma¬ 
jority of the fertilizer sold, is sold on time, i. e., the manufacturer receives his pay for the fertilizer when the consumer has received payment for his crop. Now if the manufacturer sells his customer a 


9 




130 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


bill of fertilizer and depends on the suc¬ 
cess of his crop for his pay, does this not establish just as true a co-partnership re¬ 
lation between the farmer and the manu¬ 
facturer as exists between Smith and 
Brown who sell dry goods in co-partner¬ 
ship? The manufacturer who sells goods on time is interested in the success of the farmer because he has money invested there. If the farmer fails, then there is hardship on him to pay his fertilizer bill, 
and hence the pocket of the manufactur¬ 
er is touched. Mr. F. B. Dancey, in a paper delivered in Atlanta, a few months ago, said that as a farmer followed his wandering boy because his heart was touched, so the manufacturer of fertil¬ 
izer follows his wandering dollar because his pocket is touched. 

If the average farmer could once un¬ 
derstand that it is not profitable for the manufacturer to practice fraud there would be a better understanding of the manufacture, control and demand of this indispensable commodity—fertilizer. No man can judge accurately as to the qual¬ 
ity of a fertilizer by the senses of ap¬ 
pearance, smell and touch. There is one and only one way to test fertilizer and this is the chemical laboratory. For this reason, not many years ago, there was perhaps more sophistry practiced in com¬ 
mercial fertilizer than any other manu¬ 
factured product. The average farmer bought Brown’s fertilizer because he heard some one say Brown’s was good. 
Gradually conditions have changed. More farmers are buying fertilizer on a guar¬ 
antee basis, the same as the manufactur¬ 
er does. What manufacturer would purchase a cargo of Brown’s potash, 
without knowing how much potash was 


in it? There is more competition in the manufacturing industry and our manu¬ 
facturers are nearer home where we can get at them should they attempt decep¬ 
tion. And again, as stated above, the saying that honesty is the best policy was never truer relative to any business than when applied to the fertilizer indus¬ 
try. 

It is not my intention to discredit our state control department in the least, nor to minimize the importance of this branch of government. Were it not for the state laboratory the consumer and the honest manufacturer would suffer at the hands of the dishonest manufacturer. 
It seems to be an universally recognized fact that the farmer does not get his share of this world’s goods. So if it were not for the control afforded by the state laboratory the honestly inclined manufacturer would be compelled to seek dishonest methods in order to suc¬ 
ceed in business, and hence the farmer would be the ultimate loser. The com¬ 
missioner of agriculture in his report for the years 1907 and 1908 says: “The 

people as a whole reap more direct bene¬ 
fit from the proper application of the stock feed and fertilizer laws than from any other statutes that mark the pages of our law books.” 

The fertilizer law is enforced by the taking of what we designate as official samples, and analyzing the samples so taken, and publishing the results in the 
Florida Quarterly Bulletin. These sam¬ 
ples referred to are taken by the state chemist himself, or by other sworn in¬ 
spectors of the department. There has never been a complaint, so far as I know, 
of a manufacturer or consumer, that we

131 


did not procure a fair sample of any goods. The law itself designates how samples shall be taken and inspectors com¬ 
ply with its requirements. 

Nearly all the states have a fertilizer law which embodies about the provisions of our official sample, but very few have the special sample. Under the Florida law, the consumer may, under proper safeguards, have samples of his goods analyzed by the State chemist. We think this provision of the law affords an addi¬ 
tional protection to the honest manufac¬ 
turer and to the consumer, which can not be had by the official sample alone; 
and accounts in a good measure for the excellence of the fertilizer sold in this state during the past years. 

Another fact which contributes to the efficiency of the fertilizer law is the rep¬ 
resentatives of /the different fertilizer 


companies. If there are goods on sale below the analysis printed on the guar¬ 
antee tags, agents of other companies are quick to dscover it and take advantage thereof. 

Finally, as evidence of the status of the fertilizer trade during the year 1908, 
I incorporate in my paper the facts set forth in the annual report of the state chemist, wherein he says: “The average of 127 complete fertilizers was: 

Ammonia .3.82 p. c. 

Available Phos. Acid (P2O5). 6.94 p. c. 
Potash (K2O) .7.08 p. c. 

The average state value of the 127 sam¬ 
ples of complete fertilizer was $28.82 per ton. The average price of the various brands sold throughout the state was 
$33.04 per ton an excess over state val¬ 
ues of $4.22 per ton.” 


CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT FOODS. 


By Mrs. N. M. G. Prange. 


I am asked to continue an account of my study of plant foods and to tell how it has benefited me practically. I can not tell just how much practical good I 
have gained. The greater benefit from such things conies in indirect ways and 
I know my life is broader, my enjoy¬ 
ment has been greater, my interest keen¬ 
er—all my faculties more alert, because of this study, and a wide-awake person is likely to get his share of the dollars and cents. I have not tried to become 


a scientist, nor have I experimented with the idea of “adding (?) to the world’s knowledge.” This last is a dangerous and expensive proceeding for a beginner. 
My aim is first to learn and understand things that have been learned by others, 
to acquire what I can of what has been gathered through many years, by many men of many minds; after which I hope to use some judgment in selecting the methods that are adapted to my situation. 

He who criticizes “book farming' 







132

should remember the good he has gained from other books. Take geography, for instance, he would feel it to be unwise to depend entirely upon his own explora¬ 
tions, and also would find it hard to tell where his study of geography has added to his dollars, still he recognizes its need; 
and it is just such a need that I feel for all information pertaining to plant foods, 
especially as applied to citrus culture. 

My first problem was the K2O used as standard for potash. I do not buy pot¬ 
ash any cheaper because of tracing it out through chemistry as follows: The least part of a substance which retains the identity of that substance is called a molecule. Each molecule is composed of a definite number of atoms. An atom is the smallest part of an element. An ele¬ 
ment is a substance that can not be di¬ 
vided into other substances and is rep¬ 
resented by a symbol—a letter or letters from its English or Latin name—stand¬ 
ing for one atom of that element. Each compound has, in chemistry, a formula showing how many atoms of certain ele¬ 
ments are found in each molecule of this compound. The K2O is the formula of pure potash, the K standing for kalium, 
the latin name for potassium, and the 2 
showing there are two atoms of potas¬ 
sium, and the O indicating one atom of oxygen. The chemical name is oxide of potassium. No, I don’t buy potash for any less money and it doesn’t do my trees any more good, but I do feel more self-respecting when I talk about it, and besides, doesn’t one stand a better chance to choose a suitable method of cultiva¬ 
tion and fertilization if he understands just what his plant foods are, just what changes must take place to make them 


available to the plant, and just what con¬ 
ditions will facilitate or retard those changes ? 

The question that naturally comes next is, “What is sulphate of potash?” It is not the fault of the kali works if one lacks information about potash. In their 
“Stassfurt Industry” we find “Sulphate of potash is simply actual potash com¬ 
bined with sulphuric acid.” What is an acid? “Something sour?” Well then what makes things sour? “The acid in them of course” And there we are, in a neat little circle. 

Chemistry tells us “An acid is a com¬ 
pound formed by the union of a non- 
metal with hydrogen and usually oxy¬ 
gen.” When formed of two elements it is a bin ary acid and when formed of three elements it is a tern ary acid. Web¬ 
ster ends his definition with “and in its compounds ’exchanges its hydrogen for a metal.” It is this quality of exchang¬ 
ing its hydrogen for a metal that gives to us our chemical fertilizers. When the metal acts thus it is in the form of a hy¬ 
droxyl, that is, is combined with hydro¬ 
gen and oxygen, and is called a base. 
When the change has taken place we have neither acid nor base, but a salt and water. 

Binary salts, that is, salts made from binary acids, are named by adding ide to the name of the non-metal. Ternary salts are named from the acid that forms them. If an acid ends in ic the salt ends in ate . Nitric acid (HNO3) makes ni¬ 
trates. If the acid ends in ous the salt ends in ite. . Nitron acid (HNO2) 
makes nitric. 

A ternary acid ending in ic is far stronger than one composed of the same 


i 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


elements ending in oils but the only dif¬ 
ference in the formula is that it has one atom more of oxygen. 

The name “Sulphate of potash” tells us it is a salt formed by the hydrogen in sulphuric acid being displaced by the base KOH. We wonder how it “works out” so turn to acid formulas. Sulphur¬ 
ic acid is H2SO4 and we write out our example: 

H2SO4 * 2 KOH = K2SO4 + 2H2O 

Sulphuric Potassium Sulphate Water 

Acid Hydroxyl Potash 

It would take too long to explain why we take KOH twice but there is a reason given in chemistry under the head of “valence.” 

What we buy as high grade sulphate of potash is guaranteed to be from 90 
to 95 per cent chemically pure and to give 49 per cent K2O. Let us reckon it out. An atom is so inconceivably small it cannot be weighed and the calculation must be made by proportion. As hydro¬ 
gen is the lightest substance known, oth¬ 
er atoms are said to weigh “so many times as much as hydrogen.” We turn to the table of atomic weights and find two atoms of potassium weigh 78.2, one atom of sulphur, 32, and four atoms of oxygen, 64; making the molecules 
K2SO4 an d K2O weigh 174.2 and 94.2 
respectively. Therefore in 174.2 ounces, 
pounds or tons of sulphate of potash 
(K2SO4), 94- 2 ounces, pounds or tons would be pure potash (K2O). We have to buy 193.55 lbs, of 90 per cent sul¬ 
phate, or 183.36 lbs. of 95 per cent sul¬ 
phate to get 174.2 lbs. of pure sulphate 
(K2SO4). Our 94.2 lbs. K2O is 47.63 
per cent of the former and 51.3 per cent of the latter, so we are sure of our prom¬ 
ised 49 per cent, and we see all these for¬ 


133 

mulas and per cents that have seemingly been so intricate are readily mastered when given a little thought. But—do I 
hear not one but many ask what is that 
10 per cent of the high grade and 52 per cent of the low grade sulphate of potash that is not sulphate of potash chemically. 
It is a variety of natural salts formed with the sulphate of potash and not en¬ 
tirely removed because of the expense. 
They do no damage and indeed many consider the large percentage of sulphate of magnesia found in the low grade a decided advantage. 

Though we do not use muriate of pot¬ 
ash on our trees, as we were looking at the acid formulas, we wondered what el¬ 
ement gave it the name “Muriate” and glanced down the list but did not find it. 
It was some weeks before we stumbled across the statement that “Sulphuric acid is often called ‘oil of vitriol’ and hydrochloric acid is generally known as 
‘muriatic.’ Muriate of potash then would really be chloride of potassium, (Kcl), 
but why called ‘muriate’ ?”. A good friend tells us the name has its origin from the 
Latin “muria” meaning salt, because the acid was commonly made from salt or brine. We find salt is chloride of sodium 
(NaCli). Its chlorine is made to unite with hydrogen to form hydrochloric or 
“muriatic” acid (HCli). No wonder we are cautioned against the use of muriate of potash when chlorine will hurt the proposed crop—for nearly one-half of it is chlorine! 

Sulphate of ammonia ( 2 NH 4 ,S 04 ) 
should be called sulphate of ammonium. 
There is one atom more hydrogen in ammonium (NH4) than in ammonia 
(NH3). By far the greater portion of 






134 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


this salt is a by-product of coke and gas works. Coal contains from i 1-5 per cent to 1 3-5 per cent nitrogen, or from 
24 lbs. to 32 lbs. per ton. Upon reck¬ 
oning the atomic weights of the formula 
2NH4,S04, we find 28 lbs. nitrogen makes 132 lbs. sulphate of ammonia. 
When we read that 20 lbs. to 22 lbs. of the sulphate is considered a fair yield per ton of coal, at either coke or gas works, 
and that comparatively few works try to save any at all, we think it would be well for some genius to perfect machinery for this purpose. 

Nitrate of soda, or properly, nitrate of sodium (NaNC>3) shares honors with sulphate of ammonia as a source of nitrogen for plant food. It is found in 
Chili and like the sulphate and muriate of potash from Germany is made by the great chemist, Nature, but is as truly formed as described as though the nitric acid and sodium were mixed with human hands. 

Guano is another valuable source of plant food, giving us some of all three essentials. There are many different de¬ 
posits but in our market we hear only of Peruvian guano from the islands off the rainless coast of Peru. It is formed by sea birds, seals, etc., during life and after death. The deposit is often over 
100 feet deep. The lower layers are so fossilized as to be “rock guano.” Above this have been found seal fur, and some¬ 
times petrified birds’ eggs are taken from a depth of from two to twenty-five feet. One kind of egg is filled with pearly crystals, but you may be sure no such curios find their way into a fertiliz¬ 
er sack. Being of such origin the con¬ 
stituents of guano vary greatly and each 


lot must be analyzed. It used to be high in ammonia content but now is often classed as a phosphatic fertilizer. It con¬ 
tains plant food in many different com¬ 
binations and is especially fitted to some lands; but like all good things it has its place, so make sure whether your land re¬ 
quires it, for it costs high. And, too, 
make sure you get it when you do buy it. 

I may as well confess right here that, 
thinking it as well for the consumer as the manufacturer to be “up-to-date,” I 
subscribe for a magazine published for the fertilizer trade. From it I learn some points that otherwise I might not come across. One thing I noticed was the way garbage, leather and wool waste, 
etc., are treated. From them can be and is made a very good substitute for gu¬ 
ano when put in a ready mixed fertilizer. 
It is good, and such things should be utilized, but it is not guano, and when we buy it we do not want to pay for guano! So let us be thankful for our fertilizer laws and LOOK AT THE 
TAG. 

As we study the sources of phosphoric acid, we remember the contents of Farm¬ 
ers’ Institute Bulletin No. 1, and decide to skip “dissolved bone,” “boneblack,” 
etc., and learn all we can of plain acid phosphate. We find the largest fields of the best phosphate here in our own fair 
Florida. From them is shipped 80 per cent, of the world’s product. It is sold under a guarantee of minimum 77 per cent phosphate of lime and maximum 3 
per cent oxides of iron and aluminum. 
This standard is far higher than the Eng¬ 
lish products, yet Griffiths says in his 
“Manures”: “It would be well if the prejudice against manures containing

135 


mineral phosphates were stamped out, 
for even measured by a standard of pur¬ 
ity, minerals can hold their own against bone phosphates/’ Let us see exactly what acid phosphate is. The chemical formula of the pure tri-calcium phos¬ 
phate is Ca 3 P 208 . By recokoning atomic weights we find the proportion to be— 
120 lbs. calcium, 62 lbs. phosphorus, 
and 128 lbs. oxygen. Though there is a excess of lime, the impurities in the 
Florida rock are of no moment except the oxides of iron and aluminum. These are kept at an extremely low per cent by careful washing, after which the rock must be well dried. The process of mak¬ 
ing soluble phosphate is based on the stronger attraction for lime, sulphuric acid (H2SO4) has over phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The sulphuric acid used is very weak—only about half strength, for the water is needed to fa¬ 
cilitate the chemical process. While 
Voorhees ignores the fact that one thinks of the “parts” as being equal when told that a substance is divided into certain parts, he has made the change very clear to one’s mind by describing the rock as three parts lime to one part phosphoric acid. Just the right amount of sulphuric acid is added to combine with the other constituents and leave one part lime with the phosphoric acid, in which combination the phosphoric acid is easily dissolved. So were our acid phosphate pure and well made it would be a phosphate of lime mixed with sulphate of lime or gypsum. The making is mere¬ 
ly a matter of fine grinding and thorough mixing with the proper amount of acid. 
Things easily done in these days of first class machinery and skilled chemists. The 


acid, weak as it is, costs $6 per ton while the phosphate rock is worth less than $8, 
and it takes 63 lbs. of acid for each 100 
lbs. of pure tri-calcium phosphate. We can readily see that it behooves the manu¬ 
facturer to look well to the economical using of his acid. This same question of cost insures us of his being most exact¬ 
ing about impurities, for sulphuric acid will combine with the oxides of iron and aluminum before it will with the lime. 
Every 100 lbs. iron oxide will take 184 
lbs. acid and 100 lbs. alumina absorbs over 
285 lbs. of acid. The manufacturer can not afford impurities. Another safe¬ 
guard is the ease of detecting a poorly made or impure acid phosphate. If an excess of sulphuric acid is used it com¬ 
bines with so much lime as to leave free phosphoric acid. I underscore phosphor¬ 
ic, because so many think the “free acid” 
they hear about is sulphuric. The free phosphoric acid attracts moisture from the air and the fertilizer containing it is a damp luntpy mass. Too little sulphuric acid leaves some of the phosphate in the di-calcium, which is the same as the “re¬ 
verted” state. Too high a percentage of impurity makes a sticky product, high in insoluble phosphoric acid. We are well protected. It is cheaper for the manu¬ 
facturer to make a good article, and be¬ 
sides a poor acid phosphate proclaims it¬ 
self. So now we understand quite clear¬ 
ly, just what we are feeding our orange trees, and our next step is to learn just how this food reaches them and is as¬ 
similated.

FORMULA WORF 


By Mrs. N. M. G. Prange. 


Before presenting this work, I wish to assure those who are chafing at the thought of being bored by figures, that 
X shall give but two illustrations. 

All will please remember that these are fanciful formulas and are newt recom¬ 
mended for use. In my grove I use the standard formulas of trade, considering my conditions are in no way so peculiar that they cannot be met by some of the various formulas on the market. Know¬ 
ing these formulas are the result of years of patient study and trial to supply the needs of trees at all seasons and in all parts of the State, I feel it needless for me to go back to the beginning, trying perhaps what others before me have al¬ 
ready found lacking. Rather would I 
benefit by what they have learned and spend my time in a careful selection from what has proven to be of value. 

I use this formula work simply to as¬ 
certain the market value orf the plant food offered in a formula and trust oth¬ 
ers will do the same. 

As simple a formula as we can find can be made from sulphate of ammonia, dis¬ 
solved boneblack and high-grade sulphate of potash. We write its name “Fruit and 


Vine” at top of sheet, its percentages, 
3-6-12, at left hand corner and the cata¬ 
logue price at right of name. Our next step is to write the name of materials to be used in a column, leaving space at left for the number of pounds, and spaces at right for content in pounds of ammonia, 
phosphoric acid, and potash—for price per ton and for cost of quantity used, 
making in all seven different columns. 

Ammonia 3 per cent, gives 60 lbs. in a ton. In the State Chemist’s report we find sulphate of ammonia contains 25 per cent, ammonia and is worth $74 per ton. Since there are 25 lbs. Ammonia in one hundred pounds of the sulphate, it will take as many hundred pounds to sup¬ 
ply the 60 lbs., as 25 is contained in 60 
which is 2 2-5; equalling 240 lbs., or we can add two ciphers to the 60 and the answer will come in pounds—that is 25 
will go in 6,000, 240 times. We write 
“240 lbs.” before the item “Sulphate of 
Ammonia,” “60" in the column for am¬ 
monia content in pounds and $74.00 in column for prices per ton. The easiest way to reckon the cost of an irregular number of pounds is to multiply cost of one thousand pounds, or one-half ton, by 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


number of pounds taken and point off three figures—240 lbs. of sulphate of arm monia at $37.00 per thousand amounts to 
$8.80, which we write in the last column on the right. 

Dissolved boneblack contains 17 per cent, phosphoric acid and is worth $24 
pier ton. We need 120 lbs. available phosphoric acid to make 6 per cent. By annexing two ciphers to 120 and dividing by 17 we find it takes between 705 and 
706 lbs. boneblack. As we believe in good measure we take 706 lbs. which gives 120.02 A. P. A. and costs $8.47. 
We put all these amounts in their proper columns on the boneblack line. 

HHgh-grade sulphate of 'potash con¬ 
tains 48 per cent, potash and 1 costs $50.00 
per ton. We need 240 lbs. potash which necessitates buying 500 lbs. high-grade sulphate of potash. As 500 lbs. is just a quarter of a ton, we divide $50.00 by four and get $12.50 to complete our cost col- 
umjni. Oh no—not “complete" for to have our per cents right we must have a bulk of 2,000 lbs. and to get this we add 
554 lbs. land plaster at $12.00 per ton which amounts to $3.33. Then we allow 
$1.50 to pay for mixing and bagging and find the total cost to be $34.60. 

Do not object to that land plaster. You need it and it is worth the $12.00 per ton, 
but DO notice what you are buying and get your fertilizer for what it is worth. 

Probably the hardest formula to figure is one made with Peruvian Guano as a base. We will call this Peruvian manure and have our per cents, run 4-6-2-S; but in figuring the formula we count all the phosphoric acid together for one never tries to get a certain per cent, of insol¬ 
uble. Whatever insoluble matter there 


i ?.l 

is in any formula naturally accompanies the soluble matter or in treated goods is proof that no “free acid’’ exists. Besides the guano we will use nitrate of soda, 
sulphate of ammonia, ground bone and sulphate of potash. Guano varies in its percentages and is bought on its analysis so we find no standard price and content. 
For our purpose today, we will take fig¬ 
ures from a trade list that is out of date—* 
ammonia 31-2 per cent., phosphoric acid 
16 per cent, potash 2 per cent., price 
$32.00 per ton. We have been told that 
900 lbs. guano is a good foundation so we start with that:—900 lbs. Guano gives 
31.50 lbs. ammonia, 144 lbs. phosphoric acid and 18 lbs. potash and costs 
$14.40. We write all these amounts in their proper columns. 

As we are to get the rest of the phos¬ 
phoric acid from ground bone we make that the next item. Its content is am¬ 
monia 4 per cent and phosphoric acid 22 
per cent, and its price is $32.00 per ton. 
As we need 16 lbs. more phosphoric acid we take 73 lbs. ground bone which gives us 16.06 lbs. P. A. and also 2.92 lbs. am¬ 
monia and costs $1.17; all of which we enter in the proper places. We still lack 
45.58 lbs. ammonia. We will use 100 lbs. 
sulphate of ammonia to give 25 lbs. and to cost $3.70 ; and 122 lbs. nitrate of soda which contains 17 per cent, ammonia and costs $60.00 per ton; therefore from the nitrate we got 20.74 lbs. ammonia at a cost of $3.66. 

Our guano gave 18 lbs. potash and 
547 lbs, L. G. sulphate of potash analyz¬ 
ing 26 per cent. K2O, price $30.00 per ton supplies 142.22 lbs. potash and costs 
$8.20. Our ton is completed by the addi¬ 
tion of 258 lbs. land plaster for $1.55, 





138

and mixing and bagging $1.50 making a total of $34.18. If the catalogue price is much in excess of this we shall look for a lower priced dealer for we are buying standard materials and there is no effi¬ 
cacy in the name on the bag. Still we must remember a ton of this analysis of these materials 'costs the manufacturer some more than we have figured for he is obliged to give excess over guarantee to 


make sure the analysis will actually test as guaranteed and besides he has to deal in round numbers and cannot weigh out these odd amounts as we have figured. 
However, all manufacturers have to meet these conditions so our work is as fair to one as another and does very well for what we intend it. When completed it should look like this:

PRODUCTION OF PHOSPHATE ROCK IN FLORIDA. 


By E. H. Sellards, State Geologist. 


The first attempt to use Florida phos- 
Pha tes as a fertilizer, so far as the writer has been ahle to learn, was made by Dr. 
C. A. Simmons, of Hawthorne, Fla. Dr. 
Simmions is said to have recognized the phosphatic character of certain deposits lying near Hawthorne as early as 1879, 
and to have operated a mill for grinding pebble phosphate for direct application to soils as early as 1883 or 1884. In 1880 
Professor E. A. Smith collected samples from a quarry being operated for build¬ 
ing stone by Dr. Simmons. Analyses of these samples made at Washington under 


the direction of the Census Bureau showed this building- rock to contain 12 
to 13 per cent, phosphoric acid.* 

*IIawes, G. W.j Nat. Mus. Proc., 1883. Smitk, 
E- A., U. S. 10 th Census, Vol X., 1883 . 

The mill operated by Dr. Simmons was subsequently abandoned, and the produc¬ 
tion of phosphate on a commercial scale is commonly accepted as dating from the first shipment of river pebble from Peace 
River in 1888. 

The phosphates of Florida are known in the market as hard rock phosphate^ 
land pebble phosphate, and river pebble

phosphate. The plate rock phosphate now being mined near Anthony is includ¬ 
ed in this paper with the hard rock. The soft phosphate of which there is a con¬ 
siderable quantity intermixed with other phosphates is, under present methods of mining, unfortunately not recovered. 

The hard rock is a high-grade phos¬ 
phate. Most of it is sold under a guarantee that the entire shipment will average 77 
per cent, calcium phosphate (“bone phos¬ 
phate of lime;”) that iron and alumina combined will not exceed 3 per cent.; and that the moisture content will not exceed 
3 per cent. The hard rock which is now being mined occurs along the gulf side of the Florida peninsula from Suwannee and Columbia Counties on the north to 
Citrus and Ffernando Counties on the 
South. It lies in pockets of irregular oc¬ 
currence and extent and rests usually up¬ 
on limestone of Vicksburg (Lower Oli- 
gocene) age. 

The land pebble deposits are of Plio¬ 
cene age, and are less irregular in their manner of occurrence than are the hard rock phosphates. The chief land pebble region lies to the South of the hard rock region. The deposits being worked lie in Polk and Hillsboro Counties. Most of the land pebble is sold under a guarantee of 68 per cent calcium phosphate, iron and alumina not to exceed 3.5 per cent, 
to 4 per cent, and moisture not to exceed 
3 per cent. 

River pebble has been produced chiefly from Peace River and its. tributaries. The usual guarantee is 60 per cent, calcium phosphate; iron and alumina 3 per cent, 
and moisture 3 per cent. 

Phosphates varying in quality and in quantity, mostly low-grade and at pres¬ 


ent undeveloped are found at numerous other localities in Florida from the Apa¬ 
lachicola River on the West to Lee Coun¬ 
ty on the South. 

The production of river pebble, the first of the Florida phosphates mined, in¬ 
creased gradually from 1888 to 1893 
when the maximum production of 122,- 
820 tons was reached. From the year 
1893 to the present time there has been with some fluctuations a decrease in the output of river pebble, the total for 1908 
being 32,950 tons. 

The discovery of hard rock phosphate was made soon after the beginning of mining of river pebble. The first ship¬ 
ment of hard rock was probably made in 
1890. The output of hard rock phos¬ 
phate has gradually increased from the beginning of mining to the present time. 
The total hard rock mined during 1908 
was 768,011 long tons, which is a con¬ 
siderable increase over the production of any previous year. 

The first shipment of land pebble was probably made in 1891, although develop¬ 
ment began somewhat earlier. In 1892 
the production amounted to 21,915 tons. 
The rate of increase of land pebble was at first gradual, but in late years has been very rapid. In 1906 the output of land pebble for the first time exceeded that of hard rock. The amount of land pebble mined during 1908 is greatly in excess of that mined during any preced¬ 
ing year, falling little if any short of 1,- 
150,000 tons. 

The total amount of phosphate mined in Florida during 1908 was 1,950,961 
long tons. At the present rate of in¬ 
crease Florida, five years hence, may be 


140

expected to be producing 2,000,000 tons of phosphate annually. 

Practically all of the hard rock phos¬ 
phate produced in Florida is exported, 
the home consumption of this grade be¬ 
ing insignificant. During 1908 only 9,- 
900 tons of hard rock was consigned for use in the United States, 6,000 tons of which is reported as having been used in 
Florida. The river pebble, although not used in Florida, is used entirely within the United States, no part of the 1908 
output having been exported. Of the land pebble output for 1908, 150,377 
tons is reported as consigned for use in 
Florida. Of the total amount marketed the remainder was approximately equally divided between domestic and foreign ports. 

In the United States, Tennessee and 
South Carolina are, next after Florida, 
the largest producers of phosphates. Oth¬ 
er states which in 1907 produced a lim¬ 
ited amount of phosphate were: Ar- 
kasas, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. The deposits of the western part of the United 
States although as yet undeveloped are reported to be very extensive. The re¬ 
cent withdrawal from settlement by ex¬ 
ecutive order of large tracts of public lands will somewhat delay the exploita¬ 
tion and exhaustion of these western phosphates. The United States is now supplying almost two-thirds of the total phosphate produced in the world. Of the total for the United States, Florida pro¬ 
duces more than one-half, and of the to¬ 
tal for the world approximately one- 
third. 

LOSS OF PHOSPHATE IN MINING. 

That there is considerable loss of phos¬ 
phate in mining is well known. Practi¬ 


cally all deposits contain along with oth¬ 
er material more or less phosphate in a soft or pulverulent condition. Under pres¬ 
ent methods of mining, this “soft” phos¬ 
phate is necessarily lost in the process of washing, being carried to the dump along with the sand, clay and other ingredients of the matrix. The amount of phosphate thus discarded may be expected to vary with different deposits and under differ¬ 
ent conditions. After reaching the dump there is also more or less mechanical sep¬ 
aration, so that samples taken from one part of a dump may be found much rich¬ 
er in phosphate than samples from some other part of the same dump. Samples 

• 

taken by the writer somewhat at random from the dumps in the hard rock region gave the following results: Sample No. 1 
is from mine No. 5 of the Cummer Lum¬ 
ber Company, at Newberry; No. 2 is from the dump of the Camp Phosphate Com¬ 
pany, five miles southeast of Dunnellon.

Mr. Jumeau estimates that in this plant approximately four tons of material are handled in order to obtain one ton of high grade rock phosphate (77 per cent). 
In other words, of the material taken from the pit three-fourths carrying about 27 per cent calcium phosphate goes into the dump, while one-fourth carry¬ 
ing 77 per cent calcium phosphate is saved. It is thus seen that of the total phosphate taken from the pit in this in¬ 
stance fully one-half goes into the dump.

Chaux des Etats-Unis, Paris, 1906. 


From these analyses it is apparent that a very large amount of Florida phos¬ 
phate is being lost annually. Methods of utilizing these floats, or of reclaim¬ 
ing this waste if such can be devised are clearly of the greatest importance both to the phosphate producers and to the agricultural interests. Phosphoric acid is a soil essential, and any permanent system of agriculture must provide a phosphoric acid supply. With the ex¬ 
tension of agriculture necessary to sup¬ 
port increased population, together with and naturally rich soils there arises in¬ 
creased demands upon the phosphate sup¬ 
ply. At the present time this demand is coming chiefly from the older countries of Europe. The time is not far distant, 
however, when an equally strong demand will come from the exhausted soils of our own country. 








Peaches and Other Deciduous Fruits. 


By W. L. Floyd, M. S. 


The cultivation of peaches as a com¬ 
mercial crop seems to be on the decrease. 
One reason for this is the competition of cantaloupes which have become an im¬ 
portant crop in the South in recent years. 

There is an average crop on the trees this year, but the quality is not satisfac¬ 
tory because of more worms (curculio larvae), in them than usual. Our grow¬ 
ers need to be impressed more fully with the importance of gathering up and de¬ 
stroying all fruit that falls to the ground. 
Old settlers tell us that the peaches of the pioneer days were almost free from worms. To-day they are abundant in all orchards, and are increasing because the number of trees planted has increased the food supply. Prices this year for good early fruit promises to be quite satisfac¬ 
tory. 

The selection of the proper variety for planting needs re-emphasis. Representa¬ 
tives of outside nurseries are coming among us and by persuasive voice and at¬ 
tractive illustrations are selling kinds that do well in states near by, but to the north of us, but which will not do well in middle and South Florida. The derivatives of the Peento and Honey groups for com¬ 
mercial planting, and some varieties of the Spanish for the home garden are all we can expect to grow with success here, 
certain varieties of these are specially 


suited to certain localities. Our people need therefore to observe closely what succeeds about them then buy from a reliable nearby nursery what has proven good. 

The San Jose scale is being held in check in some of our largest orchards by the red-heated fungus (sphaerostilbe cocophila) and black fungus (myrian- 
gium duriaei). Our climatic conditions are peculiarly favorable to the growth of these fungi and when applied at proper time and in proper manner are quite ef¬ 
fective. 

The growing of the peach on Pasco plum roots in order to avoid root knot is reported a success in some places. Many of us are trying this and can report more fully as to its value later. 

Pears are of but little commercial im¬ 
portance, and their planting in the home garden is decreasing because of blight. No preventive has been found for this bac¬ 
terial disease, pruning off diseased branch¬ 
es back to the healthy wood is the best thing we know to do. Beware of the agent who offers a blight-proof tree, we doubt if such a thing exists. The Su- 
wanee pear is a new variety now being in¬ 
troduced by a prominent nursery of the state, which promises well, its advantages over the LeConte and Keiffer need yet to be proven.

143 


Plums of the pure-bred Japanese va¬ 
rieties seem to be unsatisfactory in Flori¬ 
da, the cross-bred kinds especially the Ex¬ 
celsior and Terrell do well. Florida 
Queen and Howe are two new varieties that deserve a trial. 

Of apples there is little to be said. The 
Jennings does reasonably well in some places in the northern and eastern part of the state. The settler who has come here from an apple-growing region, and de¬ 
sires to grow a few apple trees for old as¬ 
sociation’s sake we think will find this the best to plant. We have heard of the successful growing of apples on a haw 
(crategus) stock but have not tried it nor seen it tried. 

Figs, grapes and Japan persimmons may properly come under the subject given. There are varieties of each that do fairly well in Florida and should be given a place in the home fruit garden, we rec¬ 
ommend consulting a near by, reliable nursery if the planting of these is being considered and there is ‘doubt as to what will do well. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Henderson—This is the subject in whcli I am most interested. One thing about which I think growers of these fruit should be warned against is putting too much confidence in the nursery drummers who come down from the north. They come down with their nice cuts of fruit and show what nice fruit they produce, 
but when they are planted down here nine times out of ten they don’t bear fruit at all. The pictures are seldom a true repre¬ 


sentation of the fruit produced. There is an agent around Gainesville to-day who is selling peach trees at $i apiece from the book, that they can buy from the 
Florida nurseries for ioc. You never can get a peach from them that will bear fruit here. I have tried all those northern peaches, and you can’t grow them at all here. You never will get more than a half a dozen peaches to the tree, if that many, from the northern grown trees. 
The Peento and Honey varieties are the ones we have to depend on in Florida for our crop. South of Ocala we have to de¬ 
pend almost entirely on the Peento va¬ 
rieties such as Hall’s Yellow, Jewell, Bid- 
well’s Early and a few others practically of the same type. 

Now, as I have said, these agents come in and sell peaches, pears and plums abso¬ 
lutely worthless here. 

As to the apple, that may be grown for ornamental purposes and for old associa¬ 
tion’s sake. I went to the woods and took up a couple of haw roots about the size of my thumb and put apple graft in them and then put them in the ground and the first year the graft grew six feet high. I 
never saw such a growth. The third year it had a pretty nice crop of apples on it. 
Then the San Jose scale got on it before 
I learned how to kill it with fungus, and it never was any good after that. I be¬ 
lieve we can make a success of growing a few apples for apple pies around the home in Florida, but I don’t think it will ever be grown for commercial purposes. 

I think the fig is a coming fruit. I 
don’t think we have given enough atten¬ 
tion to figs. I have a fig tree in my yard that I would not take $50 for. It pro¬ 
duced enough for my own table, we put 




144 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


up about four gallons of preserves and gave our neighbors all they wanted. There are several varieties of figs that are very hardy and they are very easily raised and anyone who has a back yard can have a fig tree that will give him all the figs he wants. 

The pear tree, I am pleased to note, is recovering from the blight very rapidly in all sections of the country. The pear will not stand much cultivation and too much ammonia. In some orchards, the blight has almost disappeared. They need phosphoric acid and potash. I be¬ 
lieve the blight is caused by improper treatment and fertilizing with too highly ammoniated manures. 

I do not think the deciduous fruits are given the attention in this society that they should have. 

As to the decline of the peach business in Florida, possibly the San Jose scale has done as much to discourage it as any other one thing. It has gone all over the state. However, it is very easily over¬ 
come now by the use of red-headed and the black fungi. The curculio from the north is advancing very rapidly down the state. It is down perhaps to Ocala. Down 


about Lakeland and that country the worms have not appeared. It seems to be our most dangerous enemy to the peach. They have had it in Georgia since 
I was old enough to know much about worms. They have been trying to learn ways to fight it for the last twenty-five years. I know it will destroy the fruit, 
but don’t know how to destroy it. To the peach, it is worse than the whitefly to the orange. You can’t touch him with the spray, because when the spray hits him he curls up and drops off on the ground. You can’t hardly see him or find him. You simply have to burn him up with fire to get rid of him at all. 

Another thing I notice is that when peaches are stung by the curculio it does not necessarily ruin every peach, because hundreds of them that are stung make good peaches. Of course, you can see where they were stung, because a little bit of white wax comes out where it is stung. As I said before, I think we ougnt to give some attention to other things be¬ 
sides oranges. We spend two or three days talking about oranges, and then put off the other fruits with an hour or two. 
It isn’t hardly fair to those of us who are interested in other things. 


Ornamentals. 


THE PRINCES OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM IN OUR FLORI¬ 
DA GARDENS. 


By H. Nehrling. 


I. 

Palms! The very word creates vi¬ 
sions of beauty and magnificence in our minds. Groups of palms! Ave¬ 
nues of palms! Forests of palms along our streams and bordering our clear water lakes! Thickets of palms in our flat woods! Groves of Cocoanut Palms on the East Coast! Royal Palms on the borders of the Everglades! Florida is the land of palms. They are in¬ 
separably connected with this land of flowers, clear water lakes, invigorating breezes and bright sunshine. The word “palm” stands for all that is noble and grand in the plant world. Linnaeus called them the “princes of the plant- 
world.” And, indeed, they are a royal family, glorying in isolation, proudly waving their graceful foliage in the breezes of a tropical landscape. Not all the members of the tribe, however, 
show this nobility and grandeur. As in every-day life, they have—like many noble families—low connections and poor relations. It is only neces¬ 
sary to allude to our proud and elegant 


Cabbage Palmetto on one side and its congener, the lowly Saw Palmetto, on the other. Both reveal a very strong and unmistakable family likeness. But how very different are both! 

Systematic botanists tell us that in their external structure, as well as in their internal organization, palms ap¬ 
proach nearest the grasses—plants which have been termed by Linnaeus the “plebejans” of the order. Super¬ 
ficially viewed, this appears a rather distant relationship. In making com¬ 
parisons, however, we must not select the Cabbage Palmetto and the Bermu¬ 
da grass for examples, but, replacing the latter by the giant bamboo, we im¬ 
mediately see the truth of the above statement. And, indeed, palms and bamboos are the greatest attractions of our Florida gardens. Grown side by side, they create unique tropical effects, charming pictures of beauty and poetry not obtainable by other plants. 

The chief feature of the palms con¬ 
sists in the cylindrical trunk, crowned by a mass of either plume-like or fan-

shaped leaves. Our native palmettos belong to the last group, while the 
Date Palm, the Royal Palm and the 
Cocoanut Palm have pinnate or plume¬ 
like leaves. The different species vary in height from a few feet to a hundred and more. Some are stemless, but the great majority have slender tall trunks. 
In some species the diameter of the stem, which does not vary very much in its whole le ngth, is thick and mas¬ 
sive, in others, slender and polished, 
while some of the smaller species have trunks not thicker than a walking stick or a pen holder. Most of the palms have a single stem, not produc¬ 
ing any side shoots at all ; others send up quite a number of stems from one root-stock. The trunks are sometimes smooth or ringed, but more frequently they are covered with the old bases of the fallen leaves and sometimes they are armed with formidable spines. In some cases the leaves fall to the ground as they decay, leaving a clean scar, in most cases, however, they are persis¬ 
tent, rotting slowly away and leaving a mass of fibrous stumps attached to the upper part of the stem. This rot¬ 
ting mass next to the trunk forms an excellent material, a kind of a peaty soi 1 , for ferns, orchids, many tillandsias and arads, which form an exceedingly decorative feature on what would oth¬ 
erwise be an unsightly object. Thus nature gives us a hint how to decorate the bare stems of our garden palms. 
The sheathing margins of the leaves often break up into a fibrous mass, 
sofetimes resembling coarse cloth and sometimes bast or even horse hair. 
The climbing palms are very remark¬ 


able. These are the Ratang Palms, 
which supply the rattan from which the seats, etc., of our cane chairs are made. Naturally very prickly, these stems, by means of reflexed hooks, 
with which the ribs of the leaves are provided, climb high up into the lof¬ 
tiest forest trees. All the species of the genus Calamus of the Old World and of the genus Desmoncus of tropi¬ 
cal America are climbing palms. The stems of these “vary in size from the thickness of a quill to that of a wrist, 
and where abundant they render the forest almost impassable. They lie about the ground coiled and twisted and looped in the most fantastic man¬ 
ner. They hang in frestoons from trees and branches, they rise suddenly through mid air up to the top of the forest, or coil loosely over shrubs and thickets like endless serpents. They must attain an immense age, and ap¬ 
parently have an unlimited power of growth, for some are said to have been found which were 600 or even 1,000 
feet long, and, if so, probably are the longest of all vegetable growths.” 
(Wallace on “Tropical Nature.”) 

The leaves of many palms are of im¬ 
mense size even under cultivation. A 
specimen of the Cohune (Attalea Co- 
hune) in Horticultural Hall, Fair- 
mount Park, Philadelphia, not yet hav¬ 
ing formed a trunk, has pinnate leaves 
30 feet long. Those of Manicaria sac- 
cifera of Para are 30 feet long and five feet wide. They are not plume-like, 
but entire and very rigid. Some of the pinnate leaved palms are much larger, 
those of Raphia taedigera and Maximih iana regia being both sometimes more

147 


than 50 feet long. The fan-shaped leaves of the West 1 , Indian Cabbage 
Palmetto (Sabal umbraculifera) are eight to ten feet in diameter. 

I11 tropical countries the uses of the palms are so exceedingly important and so varied that it would fill volumes to go into detail. Suffice it to say that they furnish everything to the inhabi¬ 
tants of the tropics: food, cloth, houses and ornaments. We all know some¬ 
thing of the uses of the Cocoanut Palm and the Date Palm, but these are only two species while there are hundreds of other useful kinds. Sugar of the best quality is made of the sap of the 
Sugar Palm (Arenga saccharifera) and the Indian Date Palm (Phoenix syl- 
vestris), the latter a most beautiful palm of our gardens. “The sap which pours out of the cut flower-stalk of sev¬ 
eral species of palms,” says Alfred R. 
Wallace in Tropical Nature, “when slightly fermented, forms palm wine or toddy, a very agreeable drink, and when mixed with various herbs or roots check fermentation, a fair imita¬ 
tion of beer is produced. Other arti¬ 
cles of food are cooking oil from the 
Cocoanut and Baccaba Palm, salt from the fruit of a South American Palm 
(Leopoldina major), while the terminal bud or 'cabbage' of many species is an excellent, nutritious vegetable, so that palms may be said to supply bread, oil, 
sugar, salt, fruit and vegetables. Oils are made from several distinct species, 
especially the celebrated Oil Palm of 
West Africa, while wax is secured from the leaves of some South Ameri¬ 
can species (Copernicia cerifera, etc.). 
The resin called 'dragon’s blood’ is the 


product of one of the rattan palms. 
The fruit of the Areca Palm (Areca 
Catechu) is the 'betel nut’ so universal¬ 
ly chewed by the Malays as a gentle stimulant and is their substitute for the opium of the Chinese, the tobacco of the European and the cocoanut leaf of South America.” 

The so-called vegetable ivory is sup¬ 
plied by a beautiful plume-leaved palm 
(Phytelephas macrocarpa) of South 
America. 

Many of the most beautiful and most impressive palms are at present culti¬ 
vated in the palm houses of our large cities. The "Palmengarten” in Frank- 
fort-on-the-Main has a world-wide fame, not only as a scientific institu¬ 
tion, but also as a resort of pleasure and recreation. The largest scientific collection is found at Herrenhausen, 
near Hanover, over which the cele¬ 
brated palm specialist. Hermann 
Wendland, presided for half a century. 
In our own land the rare collection of magnificent palms in Horticultural 
Flail, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, is undoubtedly the finest in the country. 
This palm house is almost seventy- 
five feet high and many specimens reach quite the top of the glass roof. 
When I first saw the tall and majestic specimens of Fivistonia sinensis, Cocos plumosa, Ceroxylon andicola, Phoenix 
Canariensis, Seaforthia elegans, Atta- 
lea Colnine and many others in com¬ 
pany of the Norfolk Island pine (Arau¬ 
caria excelsa) and the Bunya-Bunya 
(Araucaria Bidwilli), large clumps of bamboos, clusters of screw pines (Pan- 
danus), masses of bananas, huge tree ferns, immense specimens of the glossy

Cycas circinalis, I had the impression of being in a fairyland. The trunks of most of these palms were densely cov¬ 
ered with conspicuous tropical creep¬ 
ers, particularly philodendrons, an- 
thuriums, Monstera deliciosa, Pothos aurea and other arads. Underneath them were fine masses of the pretty flowering banana (Musa coccinea), al¬ 
most always in bloom and extremely showy; of garland flowers (Hedyc.hium 
Gardnerianum), of Pandanus Veitchii and P. caricosus, thickets of Bamboo 
Palms (Rliapis flabelliformis and Rh. 
humilis), clumps of fancy-leaved Cala- 
diums, spider lilies (Hymenocallis) and crinums, exquisite specimens of Ma- 
ranta zebrina, Phyllotaenium Lindeni, 
various Alocasias and of ferns and sel- 
aginellas. How often have I feasted my eyes on these tropical landscape idyls! How charmingly was Nature in her poetic beauty copied here by the artistic hand of the landscape gardener! There is no doubt that in our Florida gardens similar effects can be obtained by judicious planting—in¬ 
deed they have been obtained in many of our gardens. We have a large assemblage of highly colored and beautiful leaved plants and tropi¬ 
cal flowers at our command which form charming adjuncts to our garden palms, an advantage not found in any other part of our country, and we should make extensive use of them. 

Though mainly inhabitants of the equatorial regions of both hemis¬ 
pheres, there are quite a number of palms growing in high altitudes or overstepping their northern or south¬ 
ern limit. About 1,200 different spe¬ 


cies are known to science, their great¬ 
est abundance having been recorded by naturalists to be in the Amazon val¬ 
ley and adjacent regions. About 14 
species are indigenous to Florida. One is found in California and there are sev¬ 
eral species occurring as far north as 
South Carolina. Many of the strictly tropical palms thrive splendidly in 
South Florida, while many of the sub¬ 
tropical species find a congenial home all along the gulf coast. 

While I have seen grand specimens of the Canary Island Date Palm and the Cabbage Palmetto in New Orleans, 
it can be safely said that extensive col¬ 
lections can only be formed in Florida and California. These two states, 
however, have a very different climate. 
Florida is rather humid, but the soil is usually light and not rich, while Cali¬ 
fornia has a dry climate and a very heavy, rich soil. Florida has, during the summer, heavy rains, while in Cal¬ 
ifornia no rain falls during this season. 
For this reason it is evident that many palms, growing well in Florida, cannot be grown successfully in California and vice versa. Howeas (Kentias) and 
Arecas do very well in Southern Cali¬ 
fornia, but they are no success in Flor¬ 
ida, even under the most favorable conditions. On the other hand, such glorious palms as the Cocoanut, the different Royal Palms, Acrocomia To- 
tai and numerous other species do not seem to thrive at all in California. The richest collections of palms in the lat¬ 
ter state are found in Santa Barbara, 
Pasadena and Los Angeles. 

In our own state the late Mr. Ed¬ 
mund H. Hart, of Federal Point, has 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


149 


brought together a most beautiful col¬ 
lection of species. Mr. Theo. L. Mead, 
of Lake Charm, has experimented for years with a large number of palms, 
and Mr. George Abbott, of Orlando, 
has a very representative collection. 
Mr. J. F. Dommerich at Maitland has also a fine collection. In Orlando, the floral city of our State, there are num¬ 
erous large specimens in many gar¬ 
dens, notably in Mr. Overstreet's and 
Fuller’s, the latter planted by the late 
Mr. Geo. B. Breen, Bishopstead, is also replete with palms and bamboos. Mr. 
E. N. Reasoner, the introducer of hun¬ 
dreds of beautiful tropical plants adapt¬ 
ed to our soil and climate, has dissem¬ 
inated many fine and rare palms. 
There is a wealth of grand specimens, 
tall and majestic, in the grounds of the 
Royal Palm Nurseries. Many of them were planted by the late P. W. Rea¬ 
soner more than thirty years ago. 
Florida is a large state, touching al¬ 
most the tropics. Many species not hardy enough in the northern and cen¬ 
tral parts of the state can undoubted¬ 
ly be grown successfully in the ex¬ 
treme south—in places where the man¬ 
go, the sapodilla and avocado ripen their fruits. I am of the opinion that as yet we only have touched the fringe of what we may hope to achieve in the cultivation of tropical palms. What a magnificent sight do the groves of 
Cocoanut palms present at Palm Beach and elsewhere on the East Coast, 
where the glowing blossoms of the royal poinciana light up the landscape like fiery flames, where the leaves of the traveller’s tree attain gigantic pro¬ 
portions and where thickets of crotons 


abound in every good garden! The 
Royal Palms of Biscayne Bay and of 
Fort Myers are well known to all plant lovers who visited these places. Sea- 
forthia elegfans thrives splendidly in 
Bradentown. Elais Guineensis, the 
Oil Palm, is a feature in Mr. Chas. T. 
Simpson’s garden at Little River near 
Biscayne Bay. Why should not the magnificent Cohune, the various As- 
trocaryums and Raphias, Euterpes, 
Caryotas, Arengas and others thrive equally well in South Florida? Coper- 
nica cerifera, the Wax Palm of Para¬ 
guay and its near allies thrive splen¬ 
didly in Southern Italy, and I am sure these fine palms will do equally well in 
Central and South Florida. Mr. A. 
Fiehe under the late H. P. Plant—a real benefactor of Florida—landscape gardener of the Plant Railroad Sys¬ 
tem, set out years ago an avenue of the beautiful Cocos plumosa in front of the Tampa Bay Hotel. They are to¬ 
day about 50 feet high and bear fruits heavily. I have scarcely ever seen a more impressive picture. Then there are in the same grounds avenues of 
Cabbage Palmettos and fine bearing specimens of the Chinese Fan Palm 
(Livistonia sinensis). Cocos plumosa and C. flexuosa are successfully grown on Mr. Dommerich’s place, “Hiawa¬ 
tha,” at Maitland. Mr. E. H. Hart at 
Federal Point has successfully grown the beautiful! Diplothemium jCaudes- 
cens and D. campestre of Southern 
Brazil, the very beautiful Livistonia 
Hoogendorpii of Java, Livistonia oli- 
vaeformis (Corypha Gebanga) and the splendid Livistonia rotundifolia, also of 
Java, for many years. He wrote me 



150 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that all these palms, Livistonia sinen¬ 
sis and L. australis included, need shade and very rich soil in order to grow them successfully. Many of the pigmies of the family, particularly the species of the genus Chamaedorea, 
Geonoma and others thrive well in sheds from which frost can be exclud¬ 
ed, and on verandas. 

I cannot refrain from mentioning in this connection, as a matter of fact, 
that the two Fan Palms from Lower 
California, Washingtonia robusta and 
W. Sonorae, thrive better in our state than they do in California. And I also want to impress on the mind of my reader that these two palms are the coming avenue palms par excellence for Florida, thriving as they do equal¬ 
ly well in Jacksonville and in Miami. 
Majestic specimens of these palms are met with all over the state, especially in St. Augustine in the grounds of the 
Ponce de Leon, etc., in Federal Point, 
Lake Charm and elsewhere. 

Florida, the home of so many wild species, should everywhere abound in groups and avenues of palms. They imbue dignity, beauty and an inde¬ 
scribable charm to every place where they have been rightly used. The Cab¬ 
bage Palmetto should always be plant¬ 
ed in groups or avenues while the mas¬ 
sive Canary Island Date or the Indian 
Date look very beautiful as isolated specimens on the lawn, the former hav¬ 
ing a spread of 30 feet in diameter. A 
group of the various species of hardy 
Cocos is very charming, particularly when magnolias, araucarias, cupressus torulosa and other evergreens form the background. 


Small palms are very cheap. Set out in rich soil and carefully attended to, they soon attain their unique beau¬ 
ty. They increase from year to year in beauty and in value. With a com¬ 
paratively small outlay the most ex¬ 
quisite landscape pictures can be creat¬ 
ed, the like not to be seen in any other part of our country. How barren and desolate do our small towns and cities generally look. It has always been a pleasure to me to return to Orlando with its beautiful garden homes. This state is pre-eminently the home of countless winter sojourners and pleas¬ 
ure seekers, not only from the north but even from Europe, people who are not only equipped with a full pocket- 
book, but also with a broad mind, an excellent education and a good taste. 
They will not stay in desolate places. 
In order to attract them many things are essential, but I think nothing is more imporant than to beautify our cities and rural homes with tropical vegetation. Every community in 
Florida, every city and town should not only embellish their homes but also should create attractive public places. Large and well laid out parks are a necessity ol every larger town, 
not only in an educational sense for the residents but primarily to attract the winter visitor. Such men like the late H. B. Plant, and in our days, Mr. 
H. M. Flagler, were well aware of this fact. There are thousands upon thousands every winter pouring to the East Coast, to St. Augustine, Palm 
Beach and Miami, because these places have a world-wide fame as points of beauty. And this beauty mainly con-

sists in the art of the landscape gard¬ 
ener. Particularly the palms, so lav¬ 
ishly planted around the great hotels, 
in connection with other tropical plants, are the foundation of this fame. Earthly paradises have been made out of sandy tracts and mosquito infected marshes. If Mr. Flagler had done nothing else in his life but to cre¬ 
ate these enchanting gardens, he would deserve an everlasting monument. 

The palm is a formal tree. No other plant can be used so advantageously in connection with classic architecture. 
While the Giant Bamboo, formal, too, 
in outline, is more a plant to hide un¬ 
sightly places and to overshadow the cabin of the simple dweller, the proud and majestic palm always heightens the effect of refined and beautiful arch¬ 
itecture. But palms never must be grown to the exclusion of other fine evergreens. Avenue of palms, groups of palms and single specimens look most beautiful when bamboos, mag¬ 
nolias, royal poincianas, rubber trees or banyans form the background. Es¬ 
pecially the bamboos are excellent companion plants of all palms. 

I grow over 70 different palms in my garden, the most tender and the shade- 
loving species under a lath shelter. 
Though this number may perhaps be reduced considerably from a strictly botanical standpoint, they are all dif¬ 
ferent horticulturally. 

It may be well to state here that hardiness is frequently a question of size, the larger ones passing a cold spell unharmed, while the small ones perish if not protected. Many palms also need protection from sun more 


than from frost. This particularly holds true in the case of Livistonia sinensis and L. australis, two very beautiful and imposing Fan Palms. The dwarf 
Bamboo Palms (Rhapis flabelliformis and Rh. humilis) and all the Chamae- 
doreas and Geonomas will only grow in the shade. Most all species of Co¬ 
cos, Phoenix, Sabal, Acrocomia, Ore- 
odoxa, Caryota, etc., revel in bright sunshine. 

The preparation of the soil preced¬ 
ing the planting is the most important point in the cultivation of palms every¬ 
where, but particularly in Florida where the sandy soil is very deficient in plant food. Undoubtedly, many palms will grow in rather poorly pre¬ 
pared soil, but they have to keep up a constant struggle for existence, grow¬ 
ing either very slowly or being at a standstill for an indefinite period. Such specimens never will reveal their beau¬ 
ty and are always a pitiful sight. 

In setting out palms it must be our aim to grow them into fine specimens as rapidly as possible. Only as such do they reveal all their elegance and grace, their refined and unique beauty. For all large growing palms,, 
such as Sabals, Phoenix, Washingto- 
nias, Acrocomias, Fivistonias, Cocos,, 
etc., it is necessary to dig' large holes 
—six feet deep and six feet in diameter is not too much. These holes should be filled two-thirds with rotten wood, 
pine needles, leaves, bones and stable manure, preferably cow dung. Bones and old tin cans should be placed at the bottom. The entire mass must be well trodden down and left to the elements, rain and sunshine for at least 



152

six or eight months. The upper third should be filled in when the planting is done. It should consist of a mixture of well rotted stable manure and sur¬ 
face soil. If there is no stable manure at hand, cotton seed meal may be used advantageously, but this must be ap¬ 
plied several months before planting as it would be injurious in a fresh state. 
It must be well mixed with the soil, 
but in every case planting must be de¬ 
ferred until this material has become well decomposed. After the hole has been brought into a good condition, 
plant your palm in the center, spread out the roots with the hand, fill in the 
-soil and tread it down with your feet; 
then apply water to settle the soil. A 
mulch of leaves, pine needles, or grass is the next procedure. Place it thickly around the plant. Later, when the roots have taken hold of the soil and a vigor- 
ous growth has followed, a mulch of stable manure is necessary. When this rots it should be dug in around the plant. 
Never burn old rotten wood, leaves or weeds, but dig them in around your plants. In order to keep up a vigorous and rapid growth and to obtain grand and imposing specimens, fertilizer and water are the most important factors. 
The far-famed specimens of beautiful palms in the Riviera every spring receive a one-horse cart of stable manure each 
In our soil two applications of fertilizer should be given—one in May or June, 
consisting of a thick mulch of stable man¬ 
ure or cotton-seed meal. In October this should be dug in and an application of commercial fertilizer, rich in potash and phosphoric acid, should follow. This will harden the plants sufficiently to with¬ 


stand our occasional cold spells. When setting out small specimens from pots just received from the nursery it is not necessary to prepare large holes. In this case it will suffice to dig holes 3 feet deep and 3 feet in diameter. 

In dry weather all newly planted palms must be well watered. Applications of manure water now and then also prove exceedingly beneficial. 

Our open air palms are rarely troubled with insects. Some time scale insects infests the leaves, but they are easily eradicated by spraying with soap water to which some kerosene oil has been ad¬ 
ded—about a cup of kerosene to a large bucket of water. The underside of the leaves particularly must be sprayed. 

Small palms are easily protected from frost, but banking with soil is of little use if we fail to protect the heart. This is best done by placing evergreen boughs over the center of the plant, followed by old bags, Spanish moss, paper and straw or hay. This material must be removed as soon as the cold wave has passed. I 
usually place over the center of my large tender palms bunches of excelsior and dry pine needles, followed by green pine branches and Spanish moss. Of late years I have never protected the tender 
Phoenix species or Da'e Palms, and they have not suffered in the lea r \ 

II. 

The following four genera ol rather tall-growing and hardy palms are the most important for our Florida gardens. 

Cocos, or Cococmut Palms. 

Phoenix, or Date Palms. 

Sabal, or Cabbage Palmettos.

W ashing tonia, or California Fan 
Palms. 

Among the palms suitable to our soil and climate, I must assign the first place to the genus Cocos. This consists of the true cocoanut; of the tender soft- 
leaved section, including the beautiful 
Cocos plumosa, C. flexuosa and C. Ro- 
manzoffiana; of the dwarf and elegant 
C. Weddelliana and, most important of all, the species of the C. australis group. 
They are not only the quickest growers and the most ornamental and elegant palms, but many of them grow faster and better in our high pine land than any other palm, being particularly adapted to poor and rather dry soils. On my place in the high, dry pine region, 
self sown seedlings come up everywhere without any care. This genus is pre¬ 
eminently American, being found in many species in Brazil and extending southward to Argentina. Mostly the species are gregarious, like our Cabbage 
Palmetto, growing together in large groups or groves. 

Cocos nucifera , Linn., the true Cocoa- 
nut Palm, is at present a cosmopolitan, 
being found in all tropical coast regions of the world, never occuring far inland. 
Very likely, an inhabitant of the Amer¬ 
ican continents in remote times, it has found since times immemorial a home in all warm parts of the world, the waves of the ocean having acted as a mean? of distribution. In Florida it has evident¬ 
ly been introduced from the West Indies. 
It is a common and most conspicuous palm all along the east coast from Palm 
Beach—this far-famed winter resort takes its name from the groves of Cocoa- 
nut Palms along its beach—southward. 


On the west coast it grows as far north as Punta Gorda. The large groves of these palms all along the ocean form very impressive and lasting pictures in the mind of the lover of the beautiful. 
They thrive like native plants, fruiting heavily and being rarely injured by frost. 
In one of his interesting letters, Prof. C. 
T. Simpson of Little River writes me as follows: “I wish you could sit here by me, in this pavilion eighty feet out in the bay, on the end of the wharf and enjoy the breeze and the lovely view over and down Biscayne Bay, with a peep out through the keys in the open Atlantic. 
Down the shore along Lemon City the growth is largely tall mangroves where they have not been cut away, and, where they have, everybody has planted Cocoa- 
nut Palms until they look like a forest along the beach, from twenty to fifty feet high. Away down at the lower end of Lemon City a few scattered, tall ones cut the sky-line with beautiful effect and they always look better that way than in groves or rows. 

The Cocoanut generally bears all the time here and I have seen trees with a two-horse wagon load of nuts on at one time, but I have seen Cocoanut trees twenty-five feet high so scorched by the freeze that for months I thought they were dead.” 

Stoddard, in his delightful book “South 
Sea Idyls,” calls the Cocoanut palms “the exclamation points in the poetry of the tropical landscape.” 

In Polynesia this is the most valuable of all plants, supplying oil, clothing, all kinds of important utensils, food, drink in the shape of Cocoanut milk, and an ex¬ 
cellent palm wine is made from the sap

by the Singhalese. Nowhere it thrives far inland and rarely specimens are seen in our large conservatories. The aid of the sea water, crushed shells in the soil and the sea weeds acting as a fertilizer are needed to grow them successfully. 
The Singhalese have a saying that the 
“Cocoanut trees do not thrive unless you walk and talk amongst them,” which in¬ 
dicates that they must receive loving care in order to supply the wants of the peo¬ 
ple. 

Everywhere along our coast this mag- 
nificant palm should find a place in the gardens and parks and should be largely planted. 

Cocos Weddelliana Wendl is one of the most popular palms for home decora¬ 
tion in all civilized countries, its easy growth, small size, elegance and beauty adapt it particularly for this purpose. It is a native of Braizl where it rarely grows taller than 6 or 7 feet. The delicate, 
glossy, deep, green, feathery leaves form a perfect circle of elegance. It is a shade and moisture-loving plant, growing fine¬ 
ly in plant sheds. In such plant sheds, 
which should be added to every good gar¬ 
den in Florida, it can be easily protected from sun and cold. My specimens have not been injured by a temperature of 26 
degrees Fahrenheit, but they were cover¬ 
ed with pine needles and green pine branches. In Orlando a specimen has borne good crops of seeds for several years. This shed, in which asparagus plumosus is grown for the market, is heated by stoves during very cold weath¬ 
er. It also makes a fine veranda plant. 

Cocos plumosa, Hook , is one of the most elegant and beautiful of all palms, 
and it has the additional good quality of 


being a very fast grower. Its native home is central Brazil, where it usually grows in rich, moist soil. This is one of the most important palms for outdoor culture, being hardy as far north as Or¬ 
lando and Lake Charm. Mr. Mead, the introducer of many a garden jewel, was the first who grew this and other spe¬ 
cies of the genus. When the great freeze of 1895 occurred, his tall and imposing specimen was killed outright. There are fine young specimens at Mr. Dommer- 
ich's place, “Hiawatha,” at Maitland. In the idyllic grounds of the Tampa Bay 
Hotel I feasted my eyes on a long avenue of these palms which are about 50 feet high. They have magnificent crowns of leaves, and ripen annually large bunches of fruit. The tallest and most impres¬ 
sive specimens of this palm I saw in the grounds of Reasoner Bros, at Oneco, Fla. 
Lofty and graceful, their magnificent crowns of feathery leaves, touched by the soft breezes, appeared to be pictured from dreamland. And near them grew large specimens of Acrocomia Totai, tall and massive Phoenix Canariensis, P. sylves- 
tris, Ph. reclinata, and nearby the finest and densest coniferous tree I ever saw, 
Araucaria Bidwilli. Gigantic specimens of feathery bamboos stood in the back¬ 
ground, swaying their leaf-masses in the breezes. In and near Orlando this palm needs, during the first few years, some protection from very cold weather. It should be largely planted where there is a chance that it may prove hardy, because it is one of our noblest palms and has a beauty and elegance entirely its own. 

Cocos flexuosa, Mart , is another of the of the feathery soft-leaved species from 
Brazil and in its young state is scarcely

distinguishable from the former., In older specimens the leaflets along the midrib stand more closely together and the entire aspect, though not easy to describe, is somewhat different. It is also a much hardier plant, a slower grower and not so tall. I have a specimen 8 or 9 years old that has been outgrown by 3 year old plants of Cocos plumosa. 

Cocos Romans of liana, Chamisso., an exquisite palm closely related to the two former. It is hardier than both, more massive and very ornamental. The trunks attain a height of 30 to 40 feet and the leaves are 15 to 20 feet long. It is a common palm in Southern Brazil near the sea and is largely planted in the parks and streets of Buenos Ayres and other places of Argentine, where magni¬ 
ficent avenues of it form the delight of travellers. Unfortunately, it has not yet gained a foothold in our gardens, young specimens only being known and these look very much like those of the two pre¬ 
ceding species. There is no doubt that it will be hardy in Central and South 
Florida. My young specimens have not suffered from frost during the past few winters. Seed can easily be imported from Buenos Ayres. 

Cocos coronata, Mart., another Brazil¬ 
ian species which has been disseminated by Reasoner Bros, of late years, looking very much like C. plumosa in its young state. 

We now come to the most important members of the genus,—important be¬ 
cause they all revel in rich and rather dry soil, are perfectly hardy as far north as 
Jacksonville, bear immense quantities of plum-like, intensely fragrant, juicy fruit and are comparatively rapid growers. 


Their leaves are mostly bluish-green, 
hard to the touch and recurved in out¬ 
line. All my specimens, with a few ex¬ 
ceptions, were raised from seed which I 
mostly obtained from Southern Brazil, 
Blumenan, Porto Alegre and other Ger¬ 
man settlements. Some came from the 
Riviera, where these elegant palms form a most charming feature in the sub-trop¬ 
ical gardens. None of these species are adapted to moist flat-woods soil, but they are easily grown in high hammock and pine lands. When planting young spe¬ 
cimens, set them in depressions at least half a foot deep. If set too high they will not have a tight stand and are easily blown over when large. The seeds of all species of the genus have the charac¬ 
teristics of the true cocoanut—in fact they are cocoanuts in miniature. This class, 
known as the Cocos australis group, has the leaf stems nearest the trunk provided with blunt spines. 

Cocos australis, Mart., the Pindo Palm is a native of Paraguay, Southern Bra¬ 
zil and Argentine, where it occurs in a wild state on rather high river banks, 
and in mostly immense groves to the exclusion of almost every other taller plant. The glossy, bluish-green, pin¬ 
nate leaves are recurved and very ele¬ 
gant. It is one of the fairest palms known, and of a charm entirely its own. The flower-spathe is long, point¬ 
ed on both ends, club-like in the center and contains a spike of yellowish-red flowers. The fruit is not produced in such quantities as in some other spe¬ 
cies, usually only a hundred reddish- 
yellow, fragrant, cherry-like fruits on a spike, but often much less. Dr. T. 
Morong says, that the fronds are 


156 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


largely used in Paraguay in the decora¬ 
tion of churches, dwelling-houses on festive occasions, and that on Palm 
Sunday crowds may be met on the streets bearing the green fronds in their hands. He also asserts that it makes a beautiful shade tree, being a great ornament in the parks and gar¬ 
dens of Asuncion. 

Cocos Datil, Drudc , the Entre Rios 
Palm, the most masssive of all the spe¬ 
cies, rivalling in this respect almost the 
Canary Island Date, though the leaves are much shorter. In mature speci¬ 
mens the trunk is about 30 feet high. 
I have a few fine photographs of these palms, said to have been taken by Dr. 
G. Niederlein in the Missiones, Ar¬ 
gentine, which exhibits quite large dense forests of tall specimens grow¬ 
ing in rather rocky and stony soil. I 
have only one specimen now, about 15 
feet high with a very thick and massive trunk about seven feet high. Ferns 
(Phlebodium aureum) grow all around it in dense masses and form a beautiful decoration on the rough stem which is still provided with the old leaf-bases. 
The magnificent crown of stout, al¬ 
most upright leaves, overtopping the sturdy trunk, make the specimen an exceedingly stately one. Each year it matures about eight to nine fruit- 
bunches, weighing from 35 to 50 
pounds each. Each fruit, of a light or¬ 
ange color, is as large as a plum, very rich in sugar, juicy, intensely fragrant, 
like a combination of bananas and pineapples, and edible. The fruits are as closely set as a bunch of grapes, f have counted over 1,000 in one cluster. 
Idle large divided flower-scape is en¬ 


closed in a very massive spathe of the size and form of a baseball club, or, as a visitor expressed himself, of a “huge 
Hercules’ club.” An excellent wine, 
jam and jelly can be made of the fruits. It grows freely in rich, dry pine land soil and, like all the other species of this group, it does not seem to require much attention. To Mr. 
Theo. L. Mead belongs the credit of having introduced this palm into cul¬ 
tivation, but I think his specimens on rich, moist land all have perished. It is perfectly hardy and should be grown everywhere in the state and all along the gulf coast where the soil is suitable. 

Cocos eriospatha , Mart ., From South¬ 
ern Brazil where it attains a height of 
20 to 25 feet. A particular character¬ 
istic of this palm is the very recurved leaves—more recurved than in any other species. The trunk is short and thick and the flower-spathe is large and club-like. This usually bursts open with a loud crack, and reveals a verv large and much branched flower-truss of a deep violet-red color which soon becomes darker yellow. The flower- 
spathe, as well as the flower-stem, is thickly covered with a mealy powder. 
The fruit is almost as large as a good sized plum and of the form of a peen- 
to peach, i. e., flat on both sides, and when ripe, of a deep yellow color. It is very juicy and so full of sugar that it becomes very sticky when fully ripe. 
It is strongly aromatic and of a delic¬ 
ious flavor. The bunches weigh from 
25 t° 35 pounds and consist of about 
500 fruits. This is the best fruiting 

o 

kind and, next to Cocos Datil, the most

prolific, outrivalling all others in qual¬ 
ity. I have already alluded to the fact that the nomenclature of these garden palms is in a chaotic condition and it will require the painstaking study of a trained botanist to clear it up. Like almost all the other species, this is also a very elegant palm and perfectly hardy all over the state and along* the gulf coast. 

Cocos petraea , Hort. also comes from 
Southern Brazil. It is a very distinct plant with rigid leaves not as numerous as in other species. Their color is glaucous green. The long petioles are provided with blunt spines. My speci¬ 
men has not yet flowered. 

Cocos campestris, Mart. Stem slen¬ 
der and leaves short—not more than four feet long, very numerous, which gives the plant a dense aspect. This palm attains a height of only eight or nine feet and is well adapted to be planted in the foreground of palm groups. The fruit is creamy in color and not larger than a pea. About ioo to 150 are contained in one bunch. It is a fast grower and does well in the shade of tall trees. A specimen near a camphor tree and several magnolias has outgrown all others standing in full sun. Native home, Southern Bra¬ 
zil. 

Cocos Gaertneri, Hort. This is one of the very best of our garden palms, 
a fast grower, very elegant, with a dense leaf crown of rather erect fronds. My specimen is about fifteen years old. I raised it from seed which was sent me by the late Mr. Gaertner from Southern Brazil. He wrote me 


that the stems in its native habitat were mostly decorated with ferns and bromeliads and not infrequently with clusters of a fine cactus (Epiphyllum 
Gaertneri). The trunk is at present six feet high and is covered all over with several species of orchids, brome¬ 
liads, cacti, (Phyllocactus latifrons), 
ferns (Phlebodium aureum). It bears heavily and I have counted as many as 
980 fruits in one bunch. They are closely packed, of the size of a small plum, orange-yellow with a red cheek, 
very juicy, intensely fragrant and of an apricot flavor. Chickens and chil¬ 
dren are very fond of them, and so are opossums, raccoons, squirrels and blue- 
jays, not to mention the very injurious fish crows which mostly in swarms set¬ 
tle in the trees and destroy the entire crop in a very short time. This is a most beautiful palm, reminding in its shape very much of C. Datil, but it is not so massive. The leaves are about ten feet long. 

Cocos Yatay, Mart., with a trunk of about 10 to 15 feet in its habitat, South¬ 
ern Brazil. The beautiful, gracefully re¬ 
curved leaves are abount nine or ten feet long. Dr. Udo Dammer, the greatest living authority on garden palms, states that the leaves in full- 
grown specimens are 4.25 meters 
(about 13 feet) long. The spines on the leaf-stems are described as black, 
but in my specimens they are, like the entire leaf-stem, deep violet purple and the leaves arch gracefully to all sides. 
This species grows extremely well un¬ 
der the shade of oaks, grevilleas, mag¬ 
nolias, gordonias and bamboos in my garden. It has not yet flowered.

Cocos Blumenavia Hort. This very fine and elegant palm comes from 
Blumenau, Southern Brazil. The stem of my largest specimen, about fifteen years of age, is about six feet high, 
surrounded by a dense crown of arch¬ 
ing* glaucous fronds, about seven to eight feet long. At first sight it seems to resemble Cocos australis, but it has a much denser leaf-crown. The small cherry-like fruits are produced in dense clusters almost all the year round, as in C. Gaertneri. 

Cocos Bonneti, Hort. From the Ri¬ 
viera. There is a great confusion among most all the species of these garden palms and quite a number, dis¬ 
tributed at present from the Riviera and Southern Italy, may have originat¬ 
ed through accidental cross pollina¬ 
tion. This variety is very likely such a chance hybrid. It reminds very much of the former, but the leaf-crown is more open and altogether less beauti¬ 
ful. The lower leaves die off much quicker than is the case in other spe¬ 
cies. It ripens large bunches of strong¬ 
ly aromatic fruits the size of a hazel¬ 
nut. 

Cocos argentea, Hort. This is one of the most striking and beautiful of all my palms, the leaves being very long, quite erect and the lower ones gracefully re¬ 
curved and of a very striking, silvery whiteness. The fronds are about 12 feet long and the trunk is at present 5 feet high. It has not yet flowered and I have seen this most impressive palm nowhere else. The seeds were received from 
Hoage & Schmidt, Erfurt, Germany, in the fall of 1891, who had imported them from Southern Brazil. 


Cocos Nehelingii, Hort. This name was given to this most singular palm provisionally by Mr. George Abbott, the palm specialist of Orlando and Philadel¬ 
phia. He was so struck with the inde- 
scrible beauty and elegance of this Cocos that he insisted upon naming it after the author in order to distinguish it from other kinds. It is the fastest grower of all the species of this group, my largest specimen being about 16 feet high and a little more in diameter. It was raised from seed ten years ago. They came from Blumenau, Brazil. The trunk is about 15 inches in diameter, densely cov¬ 
ered with fibrous masses of brown bast. 
The lower leaves are about 15 feet long, 
gracefully arched and touching the ground while the central ones are more erect. The color is a deep glossy green with a slightly glaucous hue, and the un¬ 
derside is more silvery. The flowers ap¬ 
pear early in the season, often in Jan¬ 
uary. The spathe is very slender, thin, 
sharply pointed and about 3 to 4 feet long. The flowers are very different from all others, the scape being much branched, of a deep purplish color and the flowers are very conspicuous violet or lavendar and very ornamental. Only about fifty fruits are usually scattered over the large scape. They are as large as a hazel nut and of a very striking red color with a small green apex. When ripe they are glossy red with a small greenish-yellow point. They are quite dry and of little aroma. This exquisite palm grows vigorously on high, dry pine land. As it ripens about ten spikes of fruit annually, I hope to be able to dis¬ 
tribute it over the entire State. The two

last named species are the finest of the genus in my garden. 

Cocos Meadiae, Hort. This name I 
apply to a very distinct, small-growing 
Cocos which was introduced by Mr. 
Theodore L. Mead of Lake Charm. It is a dwarf-growing species with short, 
much recurved fronds, about 3 feet long. 
The color is a very striking bluish-green. 
The young leaves when unfolding are provided with brown filaments which are very brittle and drop when the full growth is finished. The stem is short and stout. At present my two specimens, 
about seventeen years old, are scarcely more than 5 feet high. They have not yet flowered. 

Cocos Alphonsei Hort., the Belair 
Palm common in our gardens. Large specimens of this fast growing kind I 
examined years ago in the once famous grounds of the late General Sanford at his place, Belair, near Sanford. They were about 50 feet high with tall, slen¬ 
der trunks and rather small, thin crowns of leaves. At the time they did not strike me as particularly impressive, and 
I must admit that I was quite disappoint¬ 
ed when I saw them. It seems to me that this palm grows better on low, moist ground than the other members of the C. 
australis group. A few specimens in my collection, about thirteen years old, are not more than 3 or 4 feet high, though they look quite healthy. I think they are the least beautiful of all the varie¬ 
ties of Cocos I so far have seen. As the 
Belair specimens have ripened seed for many years, this kind has been widely distributed over the State. 

“Fortunately for horticulture,” says the late Mr. E. H. Hart, “there are many 


species of palms in existence capable cf enduring the asperities of winter in 
Florida without material damage. When these shall have been collected and nat¬ 
uralized here, it will be possible for us to achieve scenic effects in landscape gar¬ 
dening that would have thrown Charles 
Kingsley into raptures,” and I add, all other lovers of beautiful and refined tropical plants also. The species and var¬ 
ieties of Cocos described in these lines take the lead among hardy palms. 

The next most important group for the embellishment of our gardens are the members of the genus Phoenix, or the 
Date Palms. They are all inhabitants of the warm regions of Asia and Africa, 
and, while a few occur in swampy places, 
the majority is found in rather high and dry ground, some even in the driest and hottest regions of the world, where scarcely any other form of vegetation exists. About twelve to fifteen well de¬ 
fined species are known to science, and all of them grow well in our climate. 
They vary considerably, and there are quite a number of distinct local forms all placed under one name, though differ¬ 
ent in a horticultural sense. In the Ri¬ 
viera where most of the species are ex¬ 
tensively grown in gardens, and whence most of the seeds come, they cross freely amongst themselves and many hybrids have been produced. This also ocurs in mv garden, where most of the different species ripen abundant crops of seeds. For this reason the cultivated species of Phoe¬ 
nix are the most difficult to define. All the species are dioecious, that is, male and female flowers are borne on different plants. They differ from all pinnate palms in having the leaves folded up-

wards, lengthwise, and in the peculiar form of their seeds, as seen in the com¬ 
mon Date Palm stones. Some of the species, like the Canary Island Date and the Indian Date, have solitary trunks, 
very massive and of great height, while others are tufted, producing suckers free¬ 
ly, like Phoenix reclinata, etc. Most of the latter group are small, some of them belonging to the smallest and most charming of pot palms, like Phoenix 
Roebbeleni, Ph. rupicola and others. The tall growing kinds usually have very rigid leaves, their bases being provided with very long and formidable spines, in¬ 
flicting severe wounds when carelessly approached. The leaves of the small¬ 
growing species are often very soft to the touch, and the spines at their bases are not quite so sharp and dangerous. They all require a very rich soil and during their growth an abundance of water. 

While all the Cocos species spread their roots along the surface soil and are easily blown over if not set deep in planting, 
the Date Palms send their long rope-like roots to a considerable depth. It is not unusual to find roots of the Canary Is¬ 
land Date Palm twenty feet deep in the soil. All the tall growing species look very imposing as avenue trees, of which fine examples can be seen in the Tampa 
Bay Hotel grounds, on Fort George Is¬ 
land and elsewhere, they ought not to be used indiscriminately. Many years ago, 
the late P. W. Reasoner gave the follow¬ 
ing advice, which is worth repeating: 

“In planting out large and extensive grounds one mistake is commonly made, 
that of dotting the trees around at reg¬ 
ular distances apart, giving the appear¬ 


ance of a checker-board in a great degree. 
A group here and there, with now and then a single specimen apparently plant¬ 
ed indiscriminately, but really with an eye to the future and general effect, will make a great difference in the beauty of the picture. No rules can be laid down, 
however, upon this subject, but good taste, common sense and general fitness of things should go hand in hand with careful thought of how it will look in the future in laying out such grounds.” 

The Date Palms for horticultural pur¬ 
poses can be divided into two groups: 

1. Tall growing species, hardy all over 
Florida. 

2. Tufted and tender species, hardy in the orange belt only. 

Phoenix dactylifera , Linn, the Com¬ 
mon Date Palm, is, after the Cocoanut 
Palm, perhaps, the most useful fruit tree of the world, and the most celebrat¬ 
ed palm in existence. It is the palm tree of the Bible, and Palm Sunday has been named in honor of it. Enormous quantities of fruits are harvested in 
North Africa and in Persia, supporting whole populations of those dry and hot desert countries with food. Immense quantities are annually exported to Eu¬ 
rope and America. Although growing very well in Florida, the fruit of the 
Date Palm is valueless in humid clim¬ 
ates. In the dry and hot regions of 
Southern Arizona and California it grows and fruits, however, very satis¬ 
factorily. For this reason the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of 
Agriculture has sent an expert, Mr. Wal¬ 
ter Swingle, to the home of the Date 
Palm to collect the best varieties and to

introduce them to our extreme south¬ 
western border.* 

It requires a very dry and hot atmos¬ 
phere to mature its delicious fruit bunches. The Arabs have a saying that the “Date Palm must have its head in the fire and its feet in wateF’in order to be a success as a fruiting tree. Volumes have been written on the uses of the Date 
Palm. There are numerous distinct varieties of dates grown, all readily dis¬ 
tinguished by the Arabs and provided with names. These varieties are propa¬ 
gated by suckers which appear more or less numerously around the bases of the trunks. Many large Date Palms are found in the gardens of Florida, grown by the earlier settlers from the stones of commercial dates. Most of these, often quite tall, have only a scanty crown of light grayish-green leaves, while others are extremely dense and very beautiful, 
showing a much darker bluish-green color. They usually also produce num¬ 
erous suckers almost as large as the main stem, forming in this way frequently very tall and impenetrable thickets. 
When these side shoots are removed, the main trunk usually grows much faster. 
Years ago, I received seeds of a variety, 
Ph. dactylifera excelsa, from the Ri¬ 
viera, which is perfectly identical with many of the dense and darker green seedlings found in our gardens. Though well grown specimens of the Date Palm are beautiful, they cannot rival in beauty with the two next species. 

Phoenix sylvestra, Roxh. East Indian 
Wild Date Palm, Sugar and Wine Date 
Palm. This is one of the most beauti¬ 
ful and one of the grandest palms in ex-

istence. It is also one of the fastest growers with an immense crown of bluish-green leaves, having a spread of 
20 to 25 feet in diameter. This most exquisite palm should be grown every¬ 
where in the State, as it is hardy from 
Jacksonville southward. To do its best, 
it requires a rich—in fact a very rich—• 
soil and moisture. It will grow well in poor uplands, but then extra applications of fertilizer must be given. There are a few fine specimens in Florida, the most beautiful, I think, can be seen in the grounds of the late Mr. E. H. Hart, at 
Federal Point. I quote from one of his articles: “In the vegetable as well as in the animal kingdom, the most useful are not always the most beautiful, hence we need not be surprised at finding some palms whose fruit is comparatively worth¬ 
less to be the most desirable for orna¬ 
ment. Chief among such is Phoenix sylvestris, the Wild Date of India, whose rapid growth, hardy constitution and dense crown of elegantly curved leaves, 
densely set with narrow leaflets, espe¬ 
cially adapt it for decorative purposes. 
Although yielding a small and inferior berry, yet as an economic plant it stands in the foremost rank. In India it is ex¬ 
tensively cultivated for the sake of its sap, which, drawn off from the bud, is boiled down into syrup and sugar, or by distillation converted into arrack, a fiery tipple of the Orientals. The fresh juice in the early stages of fermentation becomes a pleasant and wholesome wine, 
and later on it furnishes a yeast of excel¬ 
lent leavening power * * * * It 

may surprise many in this hemisphere who love the drink which ‘gladdeneth the heart of man’ to learn that among the 




162

nations of the earth there is consumed, 
in the aggregate, a larger measure of wine from the palm than of the juice of the grape.” Mr. Hart describes a spe¬ 
cimen twelve years old in his grounds with a clean trunk of 7 feet, and with a very large and dense leaf-crown. 

In my grounds, there are two speci¬ 
mens fifteen years of age with immense leaf-crowns and a trunk 6 or 7 feet high. They grow on very dry and poor soil. In good, moist ground they would be at least double that size. The most beautiful specimen I have seen was near the office of Jessamine Gardens, in Pas¬ 
co County. The leaves were deep bluish- 
green. There are tall wild Date Palms in the Royal Palm Nurseries at Oneco and at Mr. Mead’s and Mr. Hart’s places. This extremely magnificent palm should find a place in every garden in 
Florida. 

Phoenix Canariensis, Hort. (Ph. te¬ 
nuis. Verscli., Ph. Jubae, Webb). This is a most glorious palm, and no garden is complete without it. It is the noblest of all Date Palms and one of the most majestic palms in cultivation. No other palm thrives so well in this State, and none other is so massive and full of gran¬ 
deur. On high, dry land it suffers very much from drouth, but if the ground is made deep and rich and kept moist, it will even here form fine specimens, but it takes much longer than on naturally rich and moist soils. In all the large gardens of the State the Canary Island 
Date is cultivated and there are every¬ 
where magnificent specimens. It makes a fine and imposing avenue tree and sin¬ 
gle specimens with their huge crowns of spreading leaves, often 30 feet in diame¬ 


ter, are often seen. It is also fine in groups. In Orlando may be seen large and massive specimens in company of large masses of bananas and clumps of bamboo, and this combination is extreme¬ 
ly effective. In order to grow this state¬ 
ly palm well, a deep, rich soil, much water and regular applications of stable manure and commercial fertilizer are necessary* 
On dry land, mulching is a very import¬ 
ant point, particularly when the plants are young. Frequent applications of manure strong in nitrogen, and irrigation will help them along wonderfully. As in most Date Palms, the strong spines along the leaf-stems nearest the trunk are dreadful weapons, therefore, great cau¬ 
tion in handling them is necessary. All the old leaves should be cut off with a sharp pruning knife or a clipper as near to the trunk as possible. 

The Canary Island Date is a hardy palm, 
the hardiest of the genus. I have seen large specimens in St. Augustine, Jack¬ 
sonville, Pensacola, Mobile and New 
Orleans, where the mercury quite often drops to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, and now and then even to 10 degress Fahrenheit. 
The leaves are bright, deep, glossy green 
—a very peculiar tint and difficult to de¬ 
scribe—and the midrib has a somewhat yellowish cast. The outer ones are gracefully arched, while the central ones stand upright. The crown often con¬ 
sists of over 100 leaves, each one being from 12‘to 15 feet long. Planted to¬ 
gether with other palms, tall, tufted bam¬ 
boos and magnolias, it creates wonderful scenic effects. Young plants are very cheap and no garden, large or small, 
should be without one or more specimens. 
In New Orleans I saw a specimen in a 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


163 


park with a leaf-crown fully 30 feet in diameter. Seats were placed all around the massive trunk, and I was at once convinced of the fact that it makes an ideal park tree for sub-tropical regions. 
Phoenix tenuis seems to be a more slen¬ 
der form of this palm. I have a few hybrids between this species and Ph. 
dactilifera which I raised from seed com¬ 
ing from the Riviera. They are quite massive, bluish-green, with a wreath of small suckers all around the bases. Hy¬ 
brids of this palm and Ph. sylvestris are very massive, but also very variable, no two being alike. 

We now have to consider the tender species of Date Palms. The very beau¬ 
tiful and more elegant, they cannot com¬ 
pare in massiveness and grandeur with the hardy species. They all can be grown successfully in the orange belt. In my garden the entire leaf-crowns of most all the species are now and then cut back by frost when the thermometer falls to 
20 degrees Fahrenheit. Though the heart is in such cases usually lost—I 
have frequently pulled it out as a rotten mass—they soon recuperate, forming a new crown in a short time. 

Phoenix reclinata, Jacq. Of this fine 
African species there are quite a number of distinct varieties in cultivation which have not been admitted to specific rank by botanists. It is now generally con¬ 
ceded that Phoenix spinosa, Schum. and 
Ph. Zanzibarensis, Hort, belong to this species, though these and several others have to be considered as distinct local forms. Some of these varieties are sin¬ 
gle stemmed, others show a more tufted growth, often five or six stems springing up from one root-stock. Not quite as 


hardy as the large growing species, Ph. 
reclinata is found in magnificent speci¬ 
mens in the gardens of Mr. E. H. Hart, 
at Federal Point and in the grounds of 
Mr. Theo. L. Mead and my own. Beau¬ 
tiful specimens also can be seen in sev¬ 
eral gardens of Orlando. The long plume-like leaves are so much reclined that they gracefully hang down, the lower ones almost touching the ground. The finest specimen which I ever saw grows in Mr. E. N. Reasoner’s nursery at 
Oneco, Fla. It is about 30 feet high and a picture of tropical beauty. Young plants are easily lost by a strong freeze. 
Therefore a protection of pine-needles is necessary, or pine-boughs must be placed over young and newly set spe¬ 
cimens. Soil banked around such plants also proves an excellent protec¬ 
tion. 

Phoenix Senegalensis, Van Houtte, as growing in my garden, is certainly not synonymous with the former, being en¬ 
tirely different in habit and growth. It is a very dense, soft-leaved, deep-green 
Date Palm, growing in very large and tall clumps or tufts. A specimen in my gar¬ 
den, about twelve years old, has reached a height of about 20 feet with very thiick stems about 8 feet high. The spatlie and flower-spikes are bright yellow. 
While the former species comes from 
South Africa, this one has been intro¬ 
duced from the region of the Senegal and other tropical places of Central 
Africa. It is very tender, but is well adapted to all the gardens of the orange belt. 

Phoenix Leonenesis, Lodd, another palm from tropical Africa, is one of the most distinct and beautiful of the fam- 




164

ily. Though said to be identical with 
Ph. reclinata, my specimen is very dis¬ 
tinct. It is the fastest grower of all 
Date Palms, very massive,* with a dense crown of long, glossy, green leaves. The leaflets along the midrib are arranged in two’s and sometimes three’s and stand close together. The flower-spathes appear in March in a circle all around the upper part of the stem. I counted twelve of them at one time. They are about two feet long and are of a beautiful orange-yellow color. The spike is much branched and of the same color. The fruit is deep purplish-brown, as large as the common date and very sweet. None of my Date Palms have grown so rapidly. 
The trunk of the specimen, which is about twelve years old, is about seven or eight feet tall and there are cpiite a number of small suckers all around the base. It is easily hurt by a strong freeze but soon recuperates. 

Phoenix padulosa Roxh., from In¬ 
dia, is a fine tufted palm with long, 
gracefully arched, spreading leaves eight to ten feet long; trunk 12 to 15 
feet high. The leaves are whitish be¬ 
neath. Rare. 

Phoenix rupicola , Anderson. The 
Sikkim Date Palm from the Himalav- 

j 

as, from whence so many beautiful magnolias (M. Campbelli, Talauma 
Hodgsonii), tree rhododendrons and elegant bamboos come. It is an ex¬ 
ceedingly graceful and elegant palm, 
having a slender stem 12 to 20 feet high. The numerous, glossy, green leaves are all on one plane. It is very tender and must be protected a little in very cold weather, especially in its 


younger state. I have only seen young specimens in our gardens, but all are perfect pictures of health and beauty. 

Phoenix pnsilla, Gaertn. (Ph. Zey- 
lanica, Hort., Ph. cycadifolia, Hort.). 
This is also a tender and beautiful spe¬ 
cies from Ceylon, reminding, in the ar¬ 
rangement of its flat leaflets, of cer¬ 
tain species of Cycas. Though a very slow-growing palm in my garden, it attains a height of 10 to 15 feet in its native home. The foliage is deep, 
glossy green, with a yellowish midrib. 

Phoenix . farinifera, Roxh. From 
Ceylon and India. A shrubby palm with very rigid leaves and strong spines. The leaves are covered with a whitish powder. As in most species of the small and tufted Date Palms, the leaf-stems of this species at their bases are provided with long, stout spines, 
which make it impossible to walk through clumps of it, and it is always necessary to be careful when working among them. It would make a fine hedge-plant, as neither man nor beast can penetrate thickets of it. It never grows tall. 

Phoenix humilis, Royle, from India and its variety, Ph. humilis Hanceana, 
Beccari, from Southern China, are ex¬ 
tremely handsome and elegant tender palms, never growing very tall. 

Phoenix Roehheleni, O’Brien, from 
Assam and Cochin China, is also closely allied to the former. It is such an ele¬ 
gant small palm that it has become a rival of Cocos Weddelliana in pot cul¬ 
ture. 

Phoenix Loureiroii, from Hong Kong 
Ph. peduncalata, from Khasya, and Ph. 
Onselyana, from Central India, have

all been reduced to varieties of P. hu- 
milis by Beccari, though in a horticul¬ 
tural sense they prove distinct enough to deserve a place in all our gardens. 
They are all charming little palms and are particularly adapted to small gar¬ 
dens where the massive growing spe¬ 
cies cannot be grown. They are all hardy in South Florida and in rich soil soon form very graceful specimens. 

Phoenix aculis , Burch is a stemless 
Indian species, with leaves five to six feet long and upright. 

Phoenix glaxtca, Hort. I received the seed of this Date Palm from Haage 
& Schmidt, of Erfurt, Germany, about twelve years ago. It has formed a very slender stem seven feet high, with long, arching leaves of a glaucous color. Quite a number of strong suck¬ 
ers are found around the base. The flower-spathe is greenish-white and the flower-scape, sulphur-yellow. The small fruits, the size of a coffee-bean, 
are deep red. This is one of the most distinct and elegant of all my palms. 

Phoenix tomentosa , Hort , in my gar¬ 
den seems to be identical with Ph. 
farinifera. 

All the foregoing palms belong to the feathery or pinnate-leaved section. The members of the following two genera have all beautiful fan-shaped leaves. L 
shall first call the attention of my read¬ 
ers to the genus Sahal, the Cabbage 
Palmettos. The genus is strictly 
American. Our native Cabbage Pal¬ 
metto is fully described in a previous paper. 

Sahal Mexicana, Martins , Mexican 
Cabbage Palmetto, closely allied to our native species. It is found in ex¬ 


treme Southeastern Texas and in Mex¬ 
ico, where it forms a beautiful feature in the landscape, often growing to¬ 
gether in immense numbers. Up to a height of 15 to 25 feet, the bases of the old leaf-stalks remain on the trunk adding much to its picturesqueness,, 
precisely as in our Florida Cabbage 
Palmetto. As this species has been distributed for quite a number of years, all over the state, there must be large specimens in many gardens, 
though there is a possibility that they may be confounded with the native species. Both are, however, easily told apart. The Mexican Cabbage Palmet¬ 
to is more robust, has a broader and denser leaf-crown and grows much quicker. The entire aspect is quite dif¬ 
ferent. The trunk attains a height of 50 feet and is two feet in diameter. 
The leaf-blades are very large, some¬ 
times six feet long and seven feet wide, 
‘"divided to the middle in verv narrow 

j 

two-parted segments, which are fila¬ 
mentous near the margin.” It grows easily and should be found in all gar¬ 
dens where the beauty of palms is ap¬ 
preciated. 

Sahal Blackhurniana, Glazehrook, 
Bermuda Cabbage Palmetto. There is some confusion about this species. The seeds from which my specimens were grown came from Bermuda, the botan¬ 
ical authorities give the West Indies as its habitat. I call special attention to a very fine article on the subject in that fine publication of Prof. C. S. Sar¬ 
gent, “Garden and Forest” (Vol. IV., 
page 307), where a full description and an illustration is given. I have quite a number of specimens in my 








166 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


garden, but they are all very slow growers. The leaves are flat, divided into about forty lobes. Where the rather short leaf-stem joins the blade there is a triangular, greenish-white spot. It is a large and distinct palm, 
and closely allied to our native species. 
See “Garden and Forest/’ Vol. IV., 
pages 302 and 307 for further informa¬ 
tion. 

Sabal umbraculifera, Mart ., Jamaica 
Cabbage Palmetto, Palmetto Royal, 
Giant Fan Palm, Big Thatch Palm of 
Jamaica. Some botanists have made this species synonymous with the former, but it is decidedly distinct from the palmetto coming from Bermuda. 
A magnificent palm, very massive and noble in appearance. The trunk at¬ 
tains a height of 90 to 100 feet, and ac¬ 
cording to Sir D. Morris, the leaves are five to six feet across. “This palm,” 
he continues, “is essentially gregari¬ 
ous ; it is found covering several thou¬ 
sand acres, literally forming extensive groves in the Pedro Plains * * * 

They occupy, chiefly, dry, elevated banks and dry strips of land between numerous lagoons and morasses—the haunts of turtles and alligators. Seen across one of these lagoons, the ef¬ 
fect produced by a view of this palm forest is indescribable. The tall, 
straight, cylindrical columns sur¬ 
mounted by their globular masses of fronds, often 25 to 30 feet across, are seen to rise out of the sea of green sedges and grasses, and as no other growths intervene the result—merely as a matter of scenery—is well worth a visit to the tropics to behold. Un¬ 
der such circumstances even the most 


sceptical would admit that palms are rightly named ‘the kingly race of plants.’ Riding underneath nothing could surpass in grandeur and beauty tall stems, canopied by immense fan¬ 
shaped leaves rustling and rattling against each other in the refreshing breeze.” The very word of these lines fits our native Cabbage Palmetto as seen in groves in many places of our beautiful state, the Jamaica Royal Pal¬ 
metto is much larger in all its parts. 
Of the economic use of this species, 
mention may be made of the leaves, 
which form the only thatching ma¬ 
terial of the houses of the region for both negro and European. Mats, ropes, 
hats and baskets are made and the hollowed trunks, cut into short lengths, make admirable bee-hives and are even used as flower pots. 

I have fine specimens of this grand palm in my collection, and I have found that they are entirely hardy. 
They were raised from seed received from Mr. Wm. Fawcett, Director of 
Public Gardens and Plantations, Ja¬ 
maica. Only the following species seem to have larger leaves. On my young specimens they are 8 to 10 feet in diameter. There are quite a num¬ 
ber of fine specimens growing in vari¬ 
ous gardens in Florida. Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead, at Lake Charm, has a magnifi¬ 
cent specimen on his place, fully 30 
feet high, with a very broad and im¬ 
posing leaf-crown. Like all the Cab¬ 
bage palmettoes it is perfectly hardy in the orange belt, growing with great vigor in rich, moist soil, but when well cared for, it also grows finely on high pine land. Several palms in my gar-

167 


den grow under the names of Sabal princeps and S. Ghiesbreghtii seem to be identical with this species. The 
Sabals develop slowly, and it does not seem unlikely that one or the other may prove distinct when fully grown. 
This species has the habit of flowering and bearing fruit when just commenc¬ 
ing to form a stem. I have quite a number of such specimens in my gar¬ 
den. Neither S. Palmetto nor S. 
Blackburniana show this trait. The berries are as large as a grape and deep bluish-black. 

Sabal mauritiae forme, Griseb, and 
Wendl., Savana Palm, is common in the West Indies, and is very likely identical with Sabal Havanensis Lodd., 
S. glaucescens Lodd., or these latter may be merely local forms of it. Ac¬ 
cording to Mr. E. N. Reasoner, it is the largest of all palmettos, having gigantic leaves 12 feet across. My specimens are all small, but they have proved to be perfectly hardy. It grows best in rich, moist soil, but can also be grown on higher and drier land if kept moist and well fertilized. Palms give dignity and an indescribable grace and glory to every garden, and the Sabals can be particularly recom¬ 
mended to all lovers of the beautiful. 

There are quite a number of dwarf stemless species, such as Sabal Adan- 
sonii, S. Mocini, S. longipednacalata, 
etc., which are only valuable for large collections, being far less ornamental than many other small growing palms. 
All are perfectly hardy. Dr. Wm. 
Trelease, Director of the Missouri Bo¬ 
tanical Garden, decribed a tall growing species new to science, from Mexico. 


This may be a valuable addition to our garden palms. Its scientific name is 
Sabal Uresana, Trelease. 

The next most important group of 
Fan Palms for our gardens are the species of Washingtonia, the Califor¬ 
nia Fan Palms. They are all large growing species with massive trunks and beautiful leaf-crowns. Three dis¬ 
tinct species have been described. 

Washingtonia Ulifera, Wendl. (Bra- 
hea filamentosa Plort., Pritchardia fili- 
fera Wendl.), the California Weeping 
Palm. It has a cylindrical trunk, 
much enlarged at the base with a crown of large fan-shaped leaves pro¬ 
vided with numerous threads or fila¬ 
ments. It is not rare in the foot-hills of Southern California bordering the desert. Where it is found, the soil is usually black and it always grows— 
mostly in groups—where it can ob¬ 
tain a constant supply of water. In the high pine lands of Florida this, the most hardy species of the genus, can¬ 
not be successfully grown, and the lower leaves always get yellow. I have a specimen twelve years old, growing near several Phoenix and Cocos spe¬ 
cies, but it is still dwarf, overtowered by all the rest. There are, however,, 
magnificent, tall specimens in St. Au¬ 
gustine, on the place of the late Mr. E. 
H. Ffart and elsewhere, but they al¬ 
ways grow in rather rich, black soil which is always moist. 

Washingtonia robusta Wendl. In aspect and growth this beautiful palm is decidedly different from the former. 
It was first discovered near the coast of Western Mexico in the vicinity of 
Guayamas. In California it is much 









168 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


grown and is the more satisfactory of the two. Mr. Ernest Braunton, one of the leading authorities on California horticulture, says that it grows four times as fast as the former. “Grown under identically the same conditions, 
this species, at twenty years of age, 
had made 40 feet of solid (matured) 
trunk, while the more common spe¬ 
cies had made 10. The deeper and more constant green .of W. robusta is a strong point in its favor as a decora¬ 
tive plant.” It also differs from the former in its shorter leaf-stalks and more compact habit—the darker color in all its parts. The base and edge of the petiole are light brown in W. fili- 
fera, but violet-black in W. robusta. 
The latter also has a much darker col¬ 
ored trunk, and the seeds are only half as large as those of W. filifera. With the exception of Cocos plumosa, this is the fastest grower of all garden palms, and it has the great advantage of being hardy in all parts of Florida where Sabal Palmetto is found wild. 
Though preferring moist, rich soil, it grows tolerably well on high pine land, 
provided the soil is made very deep and rich and kept moist. Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead has a wonderfully glorious speci¬ 
men on his place “Wait-a-bit” at Lake 
Charm. It is so noble and distinct in aspect, so immense and majestic on the side of Sabal umbraculifera and Phoe¬ 
nix Carnariensis that it arouses the en¬ 
thusiasm of every passerby. This palm must be about 40 feet high and has a broad, spreading crown. Mr. C. T. 
Simpson, of Little River, near Miami, 
writes me that these Washingtonias 
“are going to be the avenue palms 


here” (at Miami). This and the fol¬ 
lowing species should be largely plant¬ 
ed everywhere in the state. They look very beautiful in groups of a few to even a dozen or more; they are fine as single specimens on the lawn, and they are exquisite as avenue trees. 

Washingtonia Sonorae, S. Watson. 
This fine palm is a comparatively re¬ 
cent introduction from La Paz and Sail 
Jose, Mexico, promising to rival in beauty with the former. It has been much planted in Florida, seedlings having been distributed all over the state by Reasoner Bros., Oneco, Fla. 
This firm has also disseminated the gi¬ 
gantic Sabal umbraculifera and S. mau- 
ritiaeforme in large numbers over Flo¬ 
rida, and we may be sure to see a won¬ 
derful display of these large palms in our gardens in the near future. Of the 
Sonora Washingtonia I have only seen small plants, but they all grow beau¬ 
tifully, particularly in rich, hammock soil, and even in rich pine land. The trunk is said to grow 20 feet high, the leaves being* three to four feet in diam¬ 
eter. 

III. 

Other Hardy Palms. 

There are quite a number of most beautiful and elegant, hardy palms which are only rarely seen in our gar¬ 
dens. The cause of this singular fact is difficult to understand. It is true they mostly like shade and rich, very rich soil, but both can easily be pro¬ 
vided by a true lover of these royal plants. The palms in question belong to the following genera: 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


169 


Chamaerops. 

Trachy carpus. 

Livistonia. 

Rhapis. 

Erythea. 

Diplothemiuni. 

Jubaea. 

Though growing so easily the fact must always be remembered that while many palms will bear much neglect, 
yet the best results are only to be had by giving them plenty of nourishment and good cultivation. If this is kept in mind and carried out, most members of these genera will grow well here. 

Chamaerops humilis, Linn., the Eur¬ 
opean Fan Palm, is the only species of the genus, but it is split up in quite a number of more or less distinct varie¬ 
ties. It grows wild in Sicily, Spain and 
Northern Africa, where it is found in dry, uncultivated, sandy tracts in the same way as our native Saw Palmetto. 
This palm and its various forms are very distinct and beautiful and are well adapted to our soil and climate. They all are excellent palms for all parts of 
Florida and along the Gulf Coast west to Texas. They grow well and rapidly in good soil. I have a few specimens that are pictures of beauty, but they were cared for, while others that re¬ 
mained in the nursery rows are small and poor. All the varieties sucker very much. These should be removed if t single-stemmed specimen is desired. If carefully taken off they can be use 1 
for propagation. Mr. Theo. L. Mead has such a single-stemmed European 
Fan Palm with a beautiful round leaf- 
crown about 15 feet in height. In Feb¬ 
ruary, my plants begin to bloom, and 


this is noticed with surprise even by people who do not care for plants that do not furnish a money crop. We see now, densely attached to the stem, 
bright yellow sponge-like masses, 
looking like a large fungus. I grow the following varieties: 

Chamaerops humilis elegans, tufted, 
the stems growing about five feet high. 
Leaves very soft on long petioles which are, like all the varieties, pro¬ 
vided with short spines. 

Ch. h. argentea, with glaucous, 
scurfy foliage, deep green above, sil¬ 
very beneath. 

Ch. h. macrocarpa with black spines along the leaf-stems. 

Ch. h. arborescens, growing much taller than the other kinds. 

C. h. tomentosa, covered with a whitish powder. All these local forms or garden varieties are very elegant, 
and should be largely planted. They form fine groups by themselves or in connection with other • small palms. 
They do not always come true from seed. The best way is to propa¬ 
gate them from suckers, which appear numerously around the base of the stem. All grow very well on high, 
dry pine land, in fact they do better here than in moist black soil. 

The genus Trachycarpus consists of four species of hardy fan-leaved palms, 
two of them being indigenous to the 
Himalayan region, and two are found, 
respectively, in China and Japan. 
The last two have fine polished trunks, while the Himalayan kinds have their stems clothed with the old leaf-sheath. I have never seen the latter in cultivation in Florida, 





170 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


while the Japanese and Chinese species are only sparingly represented in our gardens. They require more care and attention during the first years, being easily lost if not attended to in a prop¬ 
er way. The soil should be very rich and rather heavy, and a little shade is necessary for young plants. Lack c<f water for any length of time proves fa¬ 
tal to them. When once well estab¬ 
lished and in full flourishing condition, 
they are all fine and elegant palms. 

Tr achy carpus Fortunei, Wendl. For tune’s Palm, is of unique interest as it is the hardiest of all palms, growing well in many parts of England in the open air. Its growth is rather slow, 
but eventually it attains a height of 30 
feet. This species should be planted everywhere in Northern Florida, in 
Georgia, South Carolina and West to 
Texas. It would undoubtedly look very well in groups and on the lawn. 

Trachy carpus excelsa Wendl., the 
Chusan Palm. In California, where it is one of the most common garden palms as far north as San Francisco, it is called the Chinese Windmill Palm. 
Though this species is said to have a smooth trunk, I have only seen speci¬ 
mens which had their stems clothed with a network of fibers from the old leaf-stalks. It is a very beautiful and distinct looking species, especially in a large state. As it comes from South¬ 
ern China it is perfectly hardy all over the state, and there are a few speci¬ 
mens found in several gardens. The finest Chusan Palm I saw in Florida is in the grounds of Mr. Wm. J. Ells¬ 
worth at Jessamine, Fla., a plant of very striking beauty and elegance. In 


my grounds there is also a fine young specimen with a trunk about three or four feet high. This palm should be planted largely in all our gardens and 

its hardiness, beauty and distinction

entitle it to a foremost place wherever these noble plants are grown. 

Trachy carpus Khasiana, Wendl., Hi¬ 
malayan Fan Palm. Major Madden found it at 6,500 to 7,800 feet altitude amidst rhododendrons, bamboos, an- 
dromedas, etc. “In damp, shady glens,” 
he writes, “on the north and southeast but chiefly on the northwest exposure, 
this palm is found in great numbers, 
forming clumps and rows, the trees rising from 30 to 50 feet high, each with a superb crown of large flabelli- 
form leaves, rattling loudly in the breeze. At six feet from the ground the stems are two feet in circumfer¬ 
ence, but become thicker above. The flowers appear in April and May, and the fruit, which is of a dark, glossy blue, about half an inch long, ripens in 
October and, at the time of my visit, 
(March 20, 1847) lay strewed in abun¬ 
dance at the foot of the trees.”* 

Trachy car pus Martiana, Wendl. An¬ 
other Fan Palm of the Himalayas, said to be very similar to the former from a botanical point of view. In fact, the two are united by recent botanists and the name “T. Martiana” is used for both. I am not aware that they are in culthation in Florida. I had them both raised from seen which was sent me from Darjeeling, but all the small plants succumbed to the heat on my dry pine land. Had they been planted

in sheds in moist cool soil they would undoubtedly have made a good growth. Palm specialists should again introduce these species. 

Another genus of palms, far too rare¬ 
ly grown in our gardens, are the Livis- 
tonias. This group consists of about fourteen well-marked species of stately fan-leaved palms, but only three or four are now and then found in our gardens. There are magnificent speci¬ 
mens in the late Mr. E. H. Hart’s col¬ 
lection, even a few of the strictly trop¬ 
ical species. Most people who only look at these palms superficially find them too much like our common Cab¬ 
bage Palmetto, and for this reason pass them by. But there is, however, a great difference, not only in aspect, in the foliage and flowers, but also in the short, dense fruit-clusters. In or¬ 
der to succeed with these palms, which are hardy in the orange belt, rich, 
moist soil and—in their young state— 
shade are essential requisites. On high, dry pine land not under constant irrigation they are a failure. Large and well developed specimens are very beautiful and show a grandeur entirely their own. 

Livistonia Chine nsis, R. Br. (Lan- 
tania Borbonica, Hort.), of Southern 
China, is one of the most numerous and popular Fan Palms in cultivation, be¬ 
ing undoubtedly the best commercial 
Fan Palm for pot culture. In all the large conservatories it is never absent. 
In Horticultural Hall, Fairmount 
Park, Philadelphia, there are several specimens 60 to 70 feet high—tall and imposing palms with slender, smooth, 
gray trunks and magnificent leaf- 


crowns. The leaves are flat and per¬ 
fectly fan-shaped, three to four and even six feet in diameter and of a beau¬ 
tiful light green color. The fans im¬ 
ported in such large quantities from 
China are made of the leaves of this palm. In Orlando, where particularly the older and more enthusiastic set¬ 
tlers planted many exotic trees and shrubs, this palm is scarcely met with. 
There are, however, noble specimens in Mr. Hart’s garden, at Federal Point, 
and in the grounds of the large hotels along the East Coast many good Chi¬ 
nese Fan Palms can be seen. I saw recently a few fine young specimens near the entrance of Tampa Bay Ho¬ 
tel: They are about 15 feet high, very dense and perfect in form, bearing- 
large bunches of nearly ripe fruit when 
I saw them—February 27, 1909. These home-grown fruits should be carefully gathered and planted, as they very like¬ 
ly will produce plants perfectly accli- 
limatized. This palm is a fast-grower in rich, moist soil, but it needs shade, 
particularly in its younger state. 

Livistonia australis, Mart. (Cory- 
pha australis, Hort.), the Australian 
Fan Palm, another exquisite and dis¬ 
tinct palm that should find a home in our gardens. The leaf-crown is some¬ 
what denser and the color a deeper green than in the former. It is perfect¬ 
ly hardy in Central Florida, being found in Australia as far south as Mel¬ 
bourne. It grows best in rich ham¬ 
mock and low pine land, where it nev¬ 
er suffers from lack of water. My specimens had attained the height of six or seven feet and the diameter of the leaf-crown was 10 feet. A dense 





172

and well-grown specimen is a very charming and refined object. It is very seldom seen in our gardens and should be largely planted. Baron Ferdinand von Muller, the great Australian bot¬ 
anist, described a number of other Au¬ 
stralian Fan Palms, which appear to be closely allied to this species. 

Livistonia Hoogendorpii, Hort ., from 
Java, a very striking and grand palm from Java, perfectly hardy at Federal 
Point. A large and broad specimen which stood the large freeze of 1895 al¬ 
most unharmed was the pride of Mr. 
Hart. It occasionally loses its leaves, 
but these are soon replaced by new ones. The leaves are four to six feet in diameter and their stems, being of a very conspicuous reddish-brown color, 
are three to five feet long and armed with stout spines. Shade and rich, 
moist soil is the secret of the culture of all Livistonias. 

Livistonia humilis R. Br ., another 
Australian Fan Palm, said to be identi¬ 
cal with Baron F. von Muller’s L. Ma- 
riae, has stems four to twelve feet tall and large fan-shaped leaves about three feet in diameter. It grows abundantly in North Australia and will undoubt¬ 
edly prove hardy in the orange belt. 

Livistonia rotundifolia, Mari. (Cham aerops Biro, Sieb.), one of the most popular pot palms from Java, is not quite as hardy as L. Hoogendorp II, 
but, if well protected when young, I 
believe it will be able to stand sharp freezes when it has attained a good size. There is no doubt that it will be one of the best garden palms for South 
Florida. I had planted out all these species, and also L. olivaefornfis. Mart. 


in my plant shed. They grew vigor¬ 
ously in the rich, moist soil in half¬ 
sheds, came through a number of win¬ 
ters unharmed, but were finally de¬ 
stroyed by the rise of the lake during my absence. Not the cold, but the water killed them. 

All the members of the genus Rha- 
pis are well adapted to our soil and climate, thriving admirably in rich, 
moist land and shade. There are five distinct species known to science all coming from Southern Japan and Chi¬ 
na where they are grown since time immemorial as decorative plants. As they are small and of an elegance and beauty distinctly their own, the Jap¬ 
anese plant them largely around their homes in company with Cycas revo- 
luta, Camellia Japonica and bamboos. 
They are among the few palms pro¬ 
ducing suckers at the base, thereby forming very beautiful, large clumps often 50 to 60 stems being counted on one plant. No other palms are so well adapted to ornamental plant-sheds as the Rhapis species. My specimens are growing together with ferns, fancy¬ 
leaved Caladiums, xanthosomas, colo- 
casias, alocasias, marantas, calatheas and similar shade-loving plants, and, 
among them, they form pictures of elegance and beauty. The leaves are small, much divided and fan-shaped. 
All the species will be hardy anywhere in Florida in sheds. Thev must be 

j 

handled with care as the leaf-stems are quite delicate and are easily brok¬ 
en. Good plants, about two-and-one- 
half to three feet high with two or three shoots, are usually sold at $5 
apiece, wholesale, while plants six feet

high and six feet in diameter can rare¬ 
ly be bought for less than $150 each. 
These beautiful palms are not easily obtainable, even in a small state, and lovers of palms should be on the look¬ 
out for them. Thousands are annual¬ 
ly imported from Japan, but the de¬ 
mand is always larger than the sup¬ 
ply. Propagation is effected by sever¬ 
ing side-shoots from the mother plants and potting them separately. This is a very slow process and it explains why these charming dwarf palms are more expensive than most others. 
Seeds are rarely produced and are rare¬ 
ly offered. 

Rhapis flabelliformis, L’Herit., com¬ 
mon Bamboo Palm, Ground Rattan 
Cane, from China and Japan where it is much grown. The most common spe¬ 
cies of all the Bamboo Palms, growing in large, dense tufts 7 to 8 feet high in moist, rich soil and in shade. Large, 
well-grown specimens are marvels of beauty. Shade, very rich soil and mois¬ 
ture are necessary for its well-being. It will not grow in the sun or in dry, high soils, but it is a most beautiful plant for shady nooks and corners near the house where it can have plenty of room to de¬ 
velop its charms. Full-grown stems are about as thick as a thumb and are cover¬ 
ed with the old leaf-sheaths. 

Rhapis humilis , Blum, from China and very likely also from Southern Japan, 
where it is much grown on account of its delicate beauty and density of form. It is smaller in all its parts, rarely growing more than 3 or 4 feet high, but in gener¬ 
al aspect it is similar to the former. 

Rhapis Cochinchinensis, Mart., from 
Cochin China. This species I have never 


been able to obtain. It is said to be the largest and most imposing of the genus, 
growing 8 to 10 feet high, and some au¬ 
thors say that it even attains a height of 
12 feet or more. There is a magnifi¬ 
cent clump of a Rhapis species in the grand collection of Horticultural Hall, 
Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, which I 
have always thought to be this species. 
It is at least 12 feet high and consists of a dense mass of perfect stems. It stands in the foreground and there are some tall plume-leaved palms, araucarias and rubber trees in the background—a very impressive combination. There are only a few gardens in Florida where these fine, small palms are grown. They de¬ 
serve a growing interest and many friends. 

Erythea, one of the Hesperides, Daugh¬ 
ter of Evening, is the poetical name given to a distinct genus of beautiful Western 
American Fan Palms by Sereno Watson. 
They are spineless, of robust growth and would be perfectly hardy all over our 
State if soil and climatic conditions would be to their taste. They like a rather heavy soil and a long, dry season. 
In Italy and the Riviera and in Califor¬ 
nia they belong to the grandest of all palms. Many years ago, I sent a large number of seedlings to my place in 
Orange County. They were set out on high, dry pine land and all pined away. 
A few years later I sent a few larger ones, but they also succumbed to our hot dry soil. Mr. George Abbott has a fine, healthy young specimen in his gar¬ 
den at Orlando, and I have been informed that there are a few others in various parts of the State. These palms are so charmingly beautiful and so distinct that 



174

they should be planted wherever palms are admired. In moist, rich soil—per¬ 
haps with a small admixture of clay— 
they will undoubtedly thrive just as the 
Washingtonias, from the same region, 
thrive with us. Only two species are known. 

Erythea armata, S. Wats., Blue Palm, 
California Blue Palm, in Italy mostly known under the name of Brahea Roezli, 
is a native of Lower California, where it is called “Palma azul.” It is one of the most glaucous palms known and de¬ 
serves its name, Blue Palm with perfect right. In its distribution it is strictly limited to the peninsula of lower Cali¬ 
fornia, making its first appearance about 
40 miles south of our boundary line, and ranging south to almost St. Lucas, always in the dry, mostly hilly and stony inter¬ 
ior, never near the coast. It is therefore essentially a palm of dry regions, con¬ 
trary to E. edulis, which effects moist canons. Under cultivation, the Blue 
Palms show a remarkable adaptability to better conditions, not even disliking irri¬ 
gated California gardens and parks, pro¬ 
vided the soil is well drained, and making a very fast growth when planted out. A 
specimen about 13 years old flowered for the first time in a Santa Barbara garden in 1895. It sent out three flower-scapes over 12 feet long, gracefully arching and of a feathery appearance, bearing myr¬ 
iads of exceedingly minute flowers. In 
California this magnificent palm is get¬ 
ting a feature of all the better gardens, 
why not in Florida? With a little ex¬ 
perimenting and coaxing it will undoubt¬ 
edly thrive. 

Erythea edulis, S. Wats., the Guade- 
lupe Palms, from the lonely and gloomy- 


looking island of Guadelupe, about 250 
miles south of San Diego, California. It was discovered by Dr. E. Palmer, who found it “frequently in deep, warm rav¬ 
ines * * * * It attains a height 

of about 40 feet, and 15 inches in diame¬ 
ter. Each tree bears one to four clus¬ 
ters of fruit, 4 feet in length and weigh¬ 
ing 40 to 50 pounds. The fruit is eaten by men, goats, birds and mice. In flow¬ 
er near end of March.” 

A recent writer states that it is the most elegant of all Fan Palms from 
North America—a fast grower, quite suitable to conservatories and the open air in the South, “where in a prominent place it is likely to thrive, also in regard to its fruits, which are similar in size and taste to prunes.” A peculiar char¬ 
acteristic of this palm is that the trunk is quite slender in comparison to its height and often is slightly bent at the base, so that it has nothing of the heavy massiveness of the Washingtonias and 
Sabals. The leaves do not stand stiff and rigid, as in other species of the temper¬ 
ate regions, but droop gracefully, owing to the length and flexibility of the petio¬ 
les. What adds much to the elegance of the plant is that the old leaves, when dead, do not remain to disfigure the up¬ 
per part of the trunk, but fall down by themselves. The flower stalks reach fully 6 feet in length, and they must be grand indeed, those huge bunches of fruit, quite black when ripe, weighing 
40 to 50 pounds. The fibrous expanse of the petioles, when the leaves die off, 
falls down in a sort of soft, thickly- 
woven mat—a splendid material for packing plants,—and it may also be used for other purposes. It grows abundant-

ly on the north side of the little island where the climate is quite foggy and humid. This is very likely a good palm for Florida. I have given as full an ac¬ 
count as is possible here, in order to in¬ 
duce all plant lovers to try this fine palm. 
No time and money should be spared to introduce it in large quantities. Its beauty, distinctness and utility deserve that every lover of the palms concen¬ 
trate his attention on this noble Erythea, 
which attains, when fully grown, about 
30 feet in height. 

Th eDiplothemiums form a small genus of about four dwarf palms, reminding somewhat of the species of the Cocos aus¬ 
tralis type. They are all inhabitants of 
Southern Brazil. Though of indescrib¬ 
able elegance and easily accommodated, 
they are- extremely rare in our gardens. 
Mostly stemless or developing only short ringed trunks, they can be easily protect¬ 
ed in severe weather. They all revel in sunshine, needing about the same treat¬ 
ment as the hardy species of Cocos. The late Mr. Edmund H. Hart was very fond of these palms and had fine specimens of about three species in cultivation. Of the four known species, two inhabit the coast regions of Brazil, the other two, the dry campos. These latter thrive well on high pine land, while the former need more water and richer soil. 

Diplothemium cdmpestre, Mart, is a common palm in the region of Blumenau, 
South Brazil, and is the best known spe¬ 
cies of the genus in Florida. In Mr. 
Hart’s garden at Federal Point, there is a fine large specimen which has proved entirely hardy and has never suffered from cold. It is almost stemless and 


consists of a number of short-stems flowering and fruiting regularly. 

Diplotkermum littorale, Mart., is also a species of the campos, like the former and would very likely prove equally hardy. 

Diplothemium maritumum, Mart, is a low-growing, fine, plume-leaved palm of the coast regions of Brazil, but I am not aware whether or not this has ever been introduced. 

Diplothemium caudescens, Mart., Cer- 
oxylon), is the most striking of all the species of this genus, being a common plant of the burning coast regions of 
Southern Brazil. The fruit hangs in yellow bunches just below the silvery undersurfaces of the leaves and the na¬ 
tives can easily refresh themselves with its sweet pulp, as the trunks never attain any great height. There was a fine young specimen before the freeze in the garden now known as “Bishopstead” in 
Orlando. When I saw it in November, 
1894, it was a picture of health and beau¬ 
ty—in fact, I have scarcely ever seen a more impressive and elegant palm. The arching pinnate leaves were about 8 to 10 
feet long and 2 feet broad and looked very massive and perfect. The upper- 
side showed a most distinct, deep glossy olive-green and the underside, a very con¬ 
spicuous silvery-white. The entire plant was about 10 to 12 feet high, but the trunk was only short and quite thick. 
There were other palms in this fine gar¬ 
den, but in point of beauty this was sec¬ 
ond to none. It was shaded by a large specimen of Bambusa spinosa, and near by was a large and dense specimen of 
Arabia papyri f era, the Japanese rice paper plant,, in full bloom. When I 



170 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


again visited the spot, several years later, 
all these plants were gone—whether de¬ 
stroyed by the freeze or removed to other quarters, I was unable to ascertain. To me, this palm looked as robust and hardy as Cocos Datil and C. australis. As all these palms will undoubtedly thrive in the orange belt, their introduction should be the aim of all lovers of palms and sub-tropical plants. They never grow tall and are, therefore, easily protected. 
A situation in full sun is essential to all of them. 

Jubaea spectabilis, Humboldt is the most southern of all palms, being found in Chili in latitude 40 degrees. This is the Coquito, or Monkey Cocoanut of the 
Chilians, and exceedingly massive and beautiful species in its young state, and one of the greatest ornaments of the gar¬ 
dens of California, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the Riviera, where it grows to per¬ 
fection. When grown to its full size it is, according to Darwin, who studied it in the highlands of the Andes, an ugly tree on acount of the very thick central part of the trunk. This palm is easily raised from seeds. Years ago, I plant¬ 
ed out quite a number of small plants with a lot of different species of Phoenix, 
Sabals and Cocos, but, while all the lat¬ 
ter have assumed glorious proportions, 
the Jubeas are still very small, though healthy. Those in full sun pined away, 
but others in rather shady positions un¬ 
der trees have remained perfectly healthy. 
The largest specimen is only 2j4 feet high. Perhaps, in richer and moister soils and in somewhat shady places, this palm, like the California Fan Palms, can be naturalized.

Tropical P'alms. 

I11 this connection I cannot refrain from quoting Charles Kingsley: “For it is a joy forever, a sight never to be for¬ 
gotten, to have once seen palms breaking through, and, as it were, defying the soft, rounded forms of the broad-leaved vegetation by the stern grace of their simple lines; the immovable pillar-stems, 
looking the more immovable beneath the toss, and lash, and flicker of the long leaves, as they awake out of their sun¬ 
lit sleep, and rage impatiently for awhile before the gusts, and fall asleep again. 
Like a Greek statute in a luxurious draw¬ 
ing room, sharp cut, cold, virginal, sham¬ 
ing, by the grandeur of mere form, the voluptuousness of mere color, however rich and harmonious; so stands the palm in the forest—to be worshipped rather than to be loved.” All the large palms, 
even our native palmetto, show this gran¬ 
deur. How I raved when I first saw the beautiful groves of palmettos on the far- 
famed St. John’s—called by the Indians more appropriately “Welaka”! How I 
I longed to own such a grove or to plant one with many different species when I 
meditated, in the cold winter days, of my northern home! And, since I have cast my lot on this peninsula, I have been fully aware of the fact that it can be done that there are many of the most beautiful and noble palms at our disposal to form earthly paradises. But palms, 
like princes, demand our attention and devotion, if they are expected to unfold all their beauty, elegance, grandeur and nobility. Plant them in your gardens and parks; surround your homes, be with

them, care for them in a proper way, and they will be a continuous source of the purest pleasure this life is able to give. 
They will be monuments to your memory long after you have gone and long after you have been forgotten. 

There are quite a number of tropical kinds that can be planted successfully wherever the orange, pomelo and lemon grow. I have already alluded to several such species, like Cocos plumosa, C. nu- 
cifera and others. The genus Acromia comprises a few such species which grow as far north as Winter Park and Lake 
Charm. They are all imposing and ele¬ 
gant palms, and the stems, as well as the leaves, are provided with numerous spines. All are common in the Amer¬ 
ican tropics and one species occurs as far South as Paraguay. This is Aero - 
comia Totai, Mart., a very fine and most elegant palm, being only sparingly found in a few of our best gardens. The first large specimens I saw in Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead’s garden, “Wait-a-bit,” at Lake 
Charm. The tallest and grandest are un¬ 
doubtedly found in the grounds of the 
Royal Palm Nurseries at Oneco, Fla. 
They are not quite as tall, but fully as beautiful as the tall specimens of Cocos plumosa standing not far from them. 
They have much more massive stems, 
however; the leaf-crown is denser and the leaves are shorter. I think Mr. 
Reasoner’s plants are about sixteen years old, having attained a height of about 
25 feet. They have grayish trunks, cov¬ 
ered with long, blackish, blunt spines, 
and the leaf-stalks, as well as the small leaflets, are covered on their underside with small, sharp, dark-brown thorns. 


This palm requires good, rich deep, ham¬ 
mock soil or flat-woods soil, but it will grow fairly well on high pine land if a rich compost and sufficient water is ap¬ 
plied. In Mr. Mead’s garden this spe¬ 
cies has endured a freeze of 18 degrees 
Fahrenheit, but it lost most of its fine, 
plume-like leaves, and, in my garden it has been subjected to almost the same cold without suffering much damage. It is one of the most common palms of Para¬ 
guay, where tons of its seeds are used in the manufacture of an excellent oil, 
and the meat of its nuts forms a favor¬ 
ite article of food among the Paraguay¬ 
ans. Mr. Mead deserves the thanks of all lovers of palms for the introduction of this fine species. Dr. Morong col¬ 
lected the seeds near Asuncion, and I 
think all our specimens were derived from these seeds. I do not think that the true A. Totai can be had in Florida to¬ 
day, but seeds could easily and in large quantities be imported from Asuncion, 
Paraguay. 

Aero comia sclerocarpa, Mart., the 
Groo-Groo Palm of the West Indies, is much more tropical and, therefore, very tender. Mr. Reasoner says that is is not hardy at Oneco, but it will unquestion¬ 
ably thrive in extreme South Florida. 
The same may be true of A. lasiospatha, 
Mart., the great Macau Palm of Vene¬ 
zuela, Colombia and Jamiaca. A. Mex- 
icana, Kano., from the cooler regions of 
Mexico up to 3,000 feet, will likely prove almost as hardy as A. Totai. It is a prickly palm, reaching 20 feet in height, 
growing in company of splendid Chae- 
madora Palms in the shade of oak- 
forests. (This may be identical with 
Astrocaryum Mexicanum, which see.)

Attalea. This genus of American palms comprises about twenty different species, but only two can be mentioned here, as they 'will very likely prove har¬ 
dy when having attained a certain size. 
These are large-leaved palms of noble as¬ 
pect when fully grown and very orna¬ 
mental when small. They are unarmed, 
with ringed stems and very long gigantic, 
plume-like leaves, the segments of which are regularly placed along the midrib and at right angles with it. There is a mag¬ 
nificent specimen of A. Cohune in Horti¬ 
cultural Hall, Philadelphia, which not yet has formed a trunk but with huge leaves fully 30 feet long, all pointing up¬ 
wards. The Attaleas require very rich and deep soil and a constant supply of water and protection from frost. 

Attalea Cohune Mart. Cohune. This is one of the most common as well as one of the most royal palms of the East 
Coast of Central America. The large seeds supply an oil of great purity and excellent flavor. Perhaps hardy from 
Palm Beach southward. 

Attalea compta, Mart., Pindova Palm a very common species in Southern 
Brazil, particularly near Blumenau where it is held in high esteem. It is a glory of the landscape and is called the Queen of Palms by the German settlers. Growing in the same region as Cocos Blumenavia, C. Gaertneri, C. 
Yatay, Diplothemium campestre and others, all perfectly hardy in our gar¬ 
dens, it will undoubtedly prove a most valuable acquisition to the orange belr. 
This beautiful palm should be intro¬ 
duced and largely planted in properly prepared soil in the full sun. A. Co¬ 
hune, which is one of Mr. Reasoner's 


stand-bys in his catalog, should also be experimented with more extensively. 
If well protected with moss and pine- 
boughs, particularly around the heart, 
it will endure an ordinary freeze of a few degrees unharmed. The stem should also be banked with dry soil. 
Older plants will very likely prove much hardier than small ones. Every effort should be made by our wide¬ 
awake nursery men to introduce the unrivalled A. compta. 

Astrocaryum is another genus of ex¬ 
quisite American palms, with long feathery leaves. They are all exceed¬ 
ingly spiny, the foliage even of young plants being covered on both sides with sharp spines. When large, every por¬ 
tion—the trunk, the leaves, the fruit- 
stalk and the flower-spathes—shows a thick covering of formidable thorns. 
But they all are extremely beautiful in spite of their repulsive armor. 

Astrocaryum Mexicanum, Liebm., is the only species that now and then can be bought in this country; all the others have to be raised from seed, 
which I usually receive in a fresh state from Hoage & Schmidt, Erfurt,' Ger¬ 
many. In its young state this species is quite tender, but when well estab¬ 
lished and in vigorous growth it can stand a few degrees of frost under a shed. My plant was raised from seed which ripened in Horticultural Hall, 
Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. It is a dwarf palm,from Mexico, the trunk never growing taller than four to six feet. On account of its small size it is easily protected in a severe cold. I 
hope that further experiments will show its adaptability to our soil and

179 


climate. It may also prove hardy in dense hammock woods. 

In extreme South Florida the beau¬ 
tiful Muru-Muru Palm, Astro car yum murumuru, Mart., very likely will prove hardy in rich, half-shady spots. 
Like the Mexican species, it is a mar¬ 
vel of elegance, being of medium size— 
its ultimate height being about 12 to 
15 feet—and therefore easily protect¬ 
ed. The trunk is densely covered with stout black spines about six inches long. The fruit ripens in large bunches and the seed is enclosed in fleshy mass which is edible. In the different spe¬ 
cies this fruit varies from the size of a hickory nut to a hen’s egg. I had a few small plants, but they were killed outright in the big freeze of February, 
1895. 

.Acanthorhiza. Another genus of 
American palms with fan-shaped leaves. Only A. aculeata, Wendl. can be considered here. It is a native of 
Mexico and is quite hardy under ordi¬ 
nary circumstances and with slight protection during the winter months. 
It is easier lost during our drv sea- 
son than during the cold spells. The most conspicuous point in the charac¬ 
ter of this palm is the spine-like air- 
roots which are developed around the base of the trunk and which grow in an upward direction along the stem. 
Old trunks are entirely surrounded by a network of these spines which are of a blackish color. It will only grow in a moist soil, rich in leaf-mold, and in a rather shady position. This spe¬ 
cies is so interesting and unique in a collection that it should be introduced wherever choice palms are grown. 


Howcas. This genus is represented in our gardens by two species, usually known as Kentias, all from Lord 
Howe’s Island, namely Hozvea Balmo- 
reana, Becc. and H. Forsteriana , Becc. 
These two species beyond doubt are the most popular and satisfactory palms in the trade, being used largely for house-decoration in the north. Mr. 
J. D. Eisele, of the firm of H. A. Dreer, 
told me that they sow annually 75 
bushels of seeds of these two species. 
They seem to do very well in South 
California near the coast in shady po¬ 
sitions, but I have not been able to establish them in my garden. They g'rew for a while in my plant-shed, 
came unharmed through the winter, 
but were affected later with a fungus disease, and were pining away slowly. 
They are smooth-stemmed, pinnate palms of exceptional beauty'). The same applies to Hedyscepe Canter - 
bury ana, Wendl. and C lino stigma, 

Mooreanum, F. von Muller, coming from the same island. Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead tried to establish them in the shade of his hammock woods, 1 but without success. 

Ptychosperma. The palms of this genus were formerly known as Sea- 
forthias. They remind somewhat of the Kentias or Howeas but are taller and more massive, and they do exceed¬ 
ingly well in South Florida, at least the two species which are here only con¬ 
sidered. Years ago they were culti¬ 
vated to a greater extent than any other palms, but they have been su¬ 
perseded by the Howeas. They have beautiful, smooth trunks and magnif¬ 
icent crowns of long, feathery leaves.

Tall growing and fast growing species, 
they soon assume magnificent propor¬ 
tions. No other palms are used so much in pot and tub culture in Florida as are the Seaforthias, and they are en¬ 
tirely free of the fungus disease which makes the cultivation of the Howeas well-nigh impossible in our state. They need rich, moist soil and shady posi¬ 
tions. 

Ptychosperma C mining hami, Wendl., 
the real Seaforthia elegans, the Austra¬ 
lian Feather Palm, is perhaps more grown for ornamental purposes in 
Florida than any other palm—mostly in tubs. It is a native of East Austra¬ 
lia, as far south as Illawarra, thus being one of the most Southern of all palms. 
The beauty and grandeur of tall spe¬ 
cimens is indescribable. The experi¬ 
ments with exotic palms are still in their infancy in our state and, for this reason, specimen plants of Seaforthia elegans are very rare in the open air 
It is believed that it will not grow in 
Central Florida. There is a fine, tall specimen at Bradentown, south of the 
Manatee River. The Manatee at this point is about a mile broad and affords 

X 

excellent water protection for a host of tropical plants. Mr. Reasoner has hundreds of most beautiful plants of this species—all pot-grown—in his nursery at Oneco, many of them hav¬ 
ing stems six to ten feet high. He in¬ 
formed me that it is not quite hardy at 
Oneco, about six miles south of Bra¬ 
dentown. 

Ptychosperma Alexandrae, Ferd. 
von Muller, the Alexandra palm of 
Queensland, the tallest of the Austra¬ 
lian palms, and one of the noblest 


forms in the whole plant world. It attains to a height of ioo feet “and is likely destined to grace many shady, 
moist groves yet outside the tropics, 
so long as they are free from frost, as this palm seems less tender than most others.” This is undoubtedly a gem for such places as Palm Beach, Miami and other places in extreme South 
Florida. 

Elaeis. This genus of tropical, 
feathery palms is entirely thornless. It consists of about six or seven species, 
one from Western Africa, and the rest from tropical America. 

Elaeis Guineensis, Jacq., the Oil Palm of Western Africa, one of the most use¬ 
ful of all plants, has been ascertained to be hardy in South Florida, where it has withstood several degrees of cold unharmed. It does not attain any great height, not more than 20 or 30 
feet. The trunks are thick and are covered with the remains of the stalks of the dead leaves. Below the large tuft of prickly-stalked leaves are to be seen the dense heads of vermilion or yellowish fruits. The palm oil is ob¬ 
tained from the outer fleshy coating— 
not from the kernels—of the fruit, by boiling in water and skimming off the oil. It is of bright orange-red color, 
with the consistence of butter, and when quite fresh has a pleasant odor like violets. It is used in the man¬ 
ufacture of soap and candles and is exported in immense quantities. The very elegant, rather upright or slightly recurved, deep green leaves are 10 to 
15 feet long. In all its stages the Oil 
Palm is one of the most ornamental and lovely.

Mr. Charles T. Simpson of Little 
River, near Miami, writes me under date of June 27, 1909.. as follows: 
“Elaeis Guineensis, nine feet high and 
12 feet across, is now in bloom, male flowers in one head, females in anoth¬ 
er, as large as a child’s head. It is said to bear lovely red fruits.” 

This is very important news, show¬ 
ing that this exquisite palm is hardy and can be grown in the southern part of our state. Further investigation may prove that it can possibly be grown much further north. 

Copernicia. This is a small genus of fan-leaved palms allied to the Thrin- 
axes, all natives of Southern Brazil and 
Paraguay. They need for their culture a rich, moist soil in the full sun. 

Corpernicia cerifera, Mart., the Car- 
anda of Brazil, and the Palma negra of 
Paraguay, is a fine fan-palm, growing 
30 to 45 feet high with a full crown of distinct leaves. This species, known also as the Wax Palm, is hardy in the 
Riviera and will undoubtedly prove a valuable garden palm for the orange- 
belt, if seeds are imported from its southernmost habitat, Paraguay. It abounds there in great numbers along the banks of the Pilcomayo River, and throughout the Gran Chaco. When young the stem is covered below with the bases of the petioles, but these fall off at maturity, leaving the trunk bare and smooth. Wood dense, hard and black, forming a valuable timber which is used all over Paraguay for rafters and fence posts. The leaves are cov¬ 
ered with a white waxy substance, 
which is scraped or shaken off, and made into the well-known carnawba- 


wax. “This species,” says Dr. Mo¬ 
rong, “is considered, with good reason, 
one of the most valuable trees in Para¬ 
guay. Not only does it furnish strong, 
durable timber and wax, but its ber¬ 
ries are eaten by the Indians, the ten¬ 
der vertex of the caudex makes an ad¬ 
mirable cabbage and its leaves are em¬ 
ployed for various purposes, such as thatching, making fans, strawbraid, 
thread, fishing lines, cordage and the like.” 

I am not aware that this species is in cultivation in Florida at present, and the only specimen I ever saw grew in my own garden for about ten years. 
It was an exceedingly slow grower on high pine land, but would undoubtedly have grown much faster in rich, moist soil. To such a position I removed it in April—just at a time when the dry season held full sway—but I lost it. 

Dr. Morong describes two new and entirely distinct species from the same region— Capcrnicia alba , Morong and 
C. rubra , Morong. Both are beautiful and both will very likely do well in 
South Florida. The first one is a rath¬ 
er low palm, frequently not over 10 
feet high and seldom reaching a height of 30 feet. The crown is much larger than in C. cerifera, containing many more leaves. The wood is nearlv worthless. In C rubra the trunk is clothed nearly to the top with the old leaf-stalks, never smooth as in C. cer¬ 
ifera, and always much thicker. The leaf-crown is large and round and Aery beautiful. For ornamental purposes these two new species will be great ac¬ 
quisitions to our gardens and should be introduced.

Thrinax. Allied to the former. All beautiful and exceedingly elegant 
American fan-leaved palms of rather small size and slow growth, succeeding finely in South Florida, particulailv along the East Coast from Palm Beach southward. Of this genus about io species are known to science, six of them occuring wild in Florida. 

Thrinax Florid ana, Sargent, a slen¬ 
der palm, becoming about 30 feet tall and the trunk about six inches in diam¬ 
eter. The leaves are beautiful yellow¬ 
ish-green and lustrous above, silvery- 
white beneath. The flowers are pun¬ 
gent aromatic. It naturally grows 011 
the sandy shores and coral-ridges of 
South Florida and the Keys. 

Thrinax microcar pa, Sargent, also in dry coral soil of the same region, has leaves about three feet in diameter, 
pale green above and glaucous under¬ 
neath. It grows about 35 feet high. 
Also a very elegant palm. 

Thrinax Kcyensis, Sargent. In its native haunts, the Florida Keys, this fine species attains a height of about 30 
feet, “raised on a base of matted roots sometimes about one meter high/” 
Leaves longer than broad, about three feet in diameter, glossy yellowish- 
green above, and bluish-green and more -or less covered with silvery- 
white hairs beneath. Flowers faintly aromatic. 

Thrinax Garberi, Chapin. (Coccc- 
thrinax Garberi Sargent) common on dry coral ridges along Biscayne Bay. 
Almost stemless, with yellowish-green leaves, silvery underneath. 

Thrinax argentea Chapin, (Cocothri nax jucunda, Sargent). Also occurring 


on dry coral ridges of South Florida. 
Stem from 10 to 25 feet high. The crown consists of numerous yellowish- 
green, glossy leaves, glaucous on the underside. One of the most beautiful species of the genus, being also com¬ 
mon in the West Indies. These are all hardy in South Florida and are easily grown. There are very fine 
West Indian species which will do equally well where the others find soil and climate congenial. The fol¬ 
lowing are offered by Mr. E. N. Rea- 
soner, of Oneco, Fla.: Thrinax Bar- 
badensis, Lodd. from Barbadoes, “one of the handsomest of all small fan palms. Each specimen carries a full head of fine leaves and is always a fine object.” Never seems to grow tall. 
Thrinax excelsa, Lodd. from Jamaica and Thr. parviflora Swz., from the Ba¬ 
hamas. Both are very elegant species, 
the last named attaining a height of 10 
to 20 feet. Thrinax Morrisii Wendl., 
a native of Anguilla, is a dwarf, never over two and one-half feet tall in its native state. Very beautiful. Mr. C. 
T. Simpson, of Little River on Bis¬ 
cayne Bay, has all these species in cul¬ 
tivation and he writes that they are doing finely. 

Oreo do xa. The Royal Palms. “The 
American Palms,” writes Dr. Berthold 
Seemann, alluding* to the Oredoxas, 
“may be said, to have been anxious to appear to the best advantage, when they were about to form the ac¬ 
quaintance of those who were about to seek a new world in the west. They placed on the very threshold of their native country several representatives, 
which, in elegance and majesty of form

are equalled by few and surpassed by scarcely any of the whole order of palms. Even ere the anxious voyager has set his foot on shore, he has al¬ 
ready perceived their graceful foliage fluttering in the breeze, and waving, 
as it were, a hearty welcome to the newly-arriving steamer. Since the time when Columbus first discovered the 
West Indian Isles to the present day, 
these palms have been seen and ad¬ 
mired by all who possess an eye for the beautiful.” 

Oreodoxa regia , Kunth., the true 
Royal Palm, the Palma real of Cuba, 
is regarded the most beautiful, most imposing and noblest of all palms for ornamental planting in the tropics. The grand avenue of these palms at Boto- 
fago, the Botanical garden near Rio de 
Janeiro, has a world-wide fame. It is the avenue palm of Honolulu and other places in Hawaii, and figures in almost all photographs of the sceneries of these islands. It is likewise largely planted at Paradenyia, Ceylon, and at 
Buitenzorg*, Java—two of the world’s most famous botanical gardens. The 
Royal Palm is a native of Florida, be¬ 
ing found quite abundantly in the Ever¬ 
glades, where it forms trunks 50 to 60 
feet high, bearing magnificent crowns of very long feathery leaves. It is found sparingly along the lower Kis¬ 
simmee and on the Caloosahatchee, and is said to have grown as far north as the Manatee River. In fact the Royal 
Palm Nurseries at Oneco were named by the lamented Mr. P. W. Reasoner after these magnificent and beautiful palms. It is much planted around 
Biscayne Bay, at Fort Myers, Punta 


Gorda and Bradentown, and it invar¬ 
iably forms imposing specimens in a few years if planted on hammock and low land. It will not grow on high, 
dry pine land. Mr. E. N. Reasoner says “that it has immense, plumy, 
feathery leaves and a straight, white trunk.” “It is a good tree,” he con¬ 
tinues, “for extreme South Florida for avenue planting, and is valuable in all sizes, but especially when four feet or over in height.” The late Mr. P. W. 

Reasoner mentions in one of his arti- 

% 

cles a place which was known as Palma 
Sola, where two very tall and noble specimens grew which could be seen far out in the gulf. One winter a few vandals cut down these trees wantonly, 
which had been landmarks for centu¬ 
ries—the most northern of its habitat. 
In Orlando, where so many northern plant and flower-lovers have their win¬ 
ter homes, I have never seen the Roy¬ 
al Palm in the gardens, and I do not think that it will be entirely hardy so far north. It can, however, stand a few degrees of cold unharmed, suffer¬ 
ing less than the Cocoanut Palm, It is entirely smooth all over, being not provided with spines or thorns as many other palms. It also occurs abundant¬ 
ly in Cuba, Antigua, etc. 

Oredoxa oleracca Mart., the Royal 
Cabbage Palm, the Palmiste of Ja¬ 
maica, is one of the most common palms of the West Indies with trunks 
100 to 120 feet high. 

Oredoxa Borinquena, the Porto Rico 
Royal Palm, differs from the Florida species in being still more vigorous and more stocky. Mr. C. T. Simpson in¬ 
forms me that all these species do well

on Biscayne Bay, requiring hammock and lowland soil. 

Pritchardia. Most beautiful, medi¬ 
um-sized fan-leaved palms from the islands of the South Pacific. They are very tender and will not be hardy north of the most southernmost point of 
Florida. Mr. Chas. T. Simpson writes me that he has lost his small specimens so often that he is not much encour¬ 
aged. Perhaps they will endure such a freeze as may occur on Biscayne Bay without much harm, when they are larger. As far as I know, only the fol¬ 
lowing three species have been or are still in cultivation in South Florida: 

Pritchardia Pacifica, Seem, and 
Wendl ., from Samoa and Fiji. Trunk grows about 30 feet high. Pritchardia 
Gaudichaudii, Wendl , and P. Martii, 
both from the Hawaiian Islands, are rather small species, the first reaching ultimately a height of 20 feet, the sec¬ 
ond having a trunk not exceeding five to six feet ; all are exceedingly elegant and are well worth a little extra care to protect them from cold when neces¬ 
sary. They need rich, moist soil and some shade. The fierce rays of the sun are as obectionable to them as a cold spell. 

Licuala. An allied genus of most ex¬ 
quisite fan-leaved palms from the tropical islands of the Pacific, requiring the same care as the Pritchardias. 

Licuala grandis, Wendl., from New 
Britain, is one of the most beautiful palms in the world and without doubt the most royal of all fan-leaved spe¬ 
cies. It is not so long ago that a well developed speciman was sold in- 
England for $1,000. At present, seeds 


of this species, as well as of many other tropical palms, can be easily obtained from Trinidad. Mr. Eugene Andre, 
the celebrated naturalist and explor¬ 
er, grows quite a number of the grand¬ 
est tropical palms in his garden near 
Port of Spain. From him I received a few years ago, a number of seeds which all sprouted. The young seedlings have endured the cold of the two la^t winters without harm, and are now growing finely. They were protected during cold weather with pine boughs. 
This seems to indicate that this spe¬ 
cies and L. pelt at a , Roxb.. of India may grow out of doors in extreme South 
Florida. They evidently are small or medium-sized palms and the leaves are rather delicate and are easily injured. 

Brahea. Allied to the two former genera, but with much more rigid, fan- 
leaves and short, massive trunks. Bra¬ 
hea dulcis, Mart., Palma dulce of Mex¬ 
ico, where it ascends mountains up ’o 
4,500 feet, is perfectly hardy in the orange-belt of Flarida, and a very noble and distinct species. The stem in full- 
grown specimens is about 10 to 20 feet high, and the leaves are from 4 to 5 feet long. It demands a rich soil, mixed with some clay. I had a fine specimen about 5 or 6 feet high which grew in full sun in a rather dry place. It withstood the severe cold of 1899, but was destroyed by a forest fire. I have not been able since to replace it or to obtain any other of the three remaining species. In its growth and entire aspect the Brahea I grew re¬ 
minded me very much of Erythea ar- 
mata. 

Bactris. Very thorny American palms 
—in fact, covered with such an armor

of spines that we have to handle them with care in order to avoid the serious injury that may be inflicted by them. 
Often they grow in tufts or big clumps, 
making it impossible to penetrate the forest. The genus consists of about a hundred species. Though many of them are ornamental and would form inter¬ 
esting objects in our sub-tropical gar¬ 
dens, they are little grown on account of their spines. They all have plume-like leaves. Many of the species are coarse in appearance and not worth growing, 
■others are extremely beautiful. They are found in all kinds of situations, wet and dry. Most of the species have their whip-like stems, as well as the leaves and flower-spathes, covered with spines. 
They are the terror of the naturalist who has to enter the undergrowth of the forest. I have only grown Badris 
Binoti, from South Brazil, and B. bacu- 
lifera, both seemingly horticultural names without botanical foundation. The most common species is B. horrida, Ocrst, 
from Nicaragua, a rather beautiful, 
small palm, growing in tufts about 6 to 8 
feet high. They have extremely spiny leaves, leaf-stalks, trunks and flower- 
spathes, and would make impenetrable live fences if it would prove hardy. 

I will close this chapter with one of the most beautiful and noble of palms, 
Areca Catechu Linn., the Areca or Betel- 
nut Palm, which has a lofty, straight and very slender stem. For this reason the 
Hindoo poets speak of it as “an arrow shot from Heaven.” 

“The flowers are deliciously fragrant; 


they are in request for all festive occa¬ 
sions and are also considered a necessary ingredient in the medicines and charms employed in the healing of the sick; their delightful perfume, together with a graceful, feathery foliage, borne on a slender and elegantly tapered stem, ren¬ 
ders this tree the universal favorite among the palm tribe.” (Hugh Low, “Sar¬ 
awak”). 

The fruit is about the size of a small hen’s egg, of an orange color, and hangs in large bunches below the dark green leaves. The outer part of the fruit is hard and fibrous, then comes the shell, 
enclosing the kernel of the betel-nut. It is for this that the palm is so extensively cultivated in the Malay Archipelago, and the practice of chewing it is universal amongst the natives. The nut is cut in¬ 
to narrow strips and rolled up with a lit¬ 
tle lime in the leaves of the betel pepper. 
The pellet, though acid to the taste, is aromatic and astringent and the mastica¬ 
tion is considered wholesome. The na¬ 
tives would rather forego meat and drink than their favorite Areca-nut. The commerce in the nut is enormous. 

I can only say that this glorious and celebrated palm may do well in extreme 
South Florida where the Royal Palm flourishes. I do not know whether or not an attempt has ever been made to introduce it to Florida, but is should be done. If it will succeed, it is an acquisi¬ 
tion of the greatest value, on account of its nobility and its extremely fragrant powers.

By Henry S. Pennock. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Most of the ornamentals used about 
Palm Beach are more or less of a trop¬ 
ical nature and so they suffer more or less when we have a freeze. The cocoa- 
nut palm which is used a great deal for avenue work and is a magnificent thing for such, suffers badly and so some people are planting the date palm in its stead, the particular variety being the canariensis. And another thing in favor of the date palm is, it is a slower grower and so does not have the long spindly trunk the cocoanut would have in fifteen or twenty years. The royal palm is used for single specimens and among the smaller the sago palm holds first place and I do not think there is anything finer than a large, handsome one placed by itself on a well kept lawn. The borbonica is used somewhat. 

Among the trees that are used are the 
Australian pines and oaks, the latter were planted along most of the streets of West Palm Beach a few years ago, 
they are doing quite well. I am trying a few trees of the California beefwood, 
in the description I read of them it said they would make a good growth in the poorest kind of soil, I thought they ought to suit me pretty well and also they would grow where the salt spray was blown on them. I got them last summer and so far they are doing all right. The two va¬ 
rieties I have are Casuarina Stricta and 
C. Equisetifolia. The sapodilla, rose apple, rubber tree, banyan, mango, avoca¬ 
do, umbrella tree and royal poinciana are all used singly and they all make a 


very nice lawn tree. Some consider the royal poinciana the handsomest tree that grows, it certainly is fine when it is in bloom with its bunches of scarlet flowers. 

Of the bushes the oleander and hibis¬ 
cus are seen the most, they are both such fine bloomers, the hibiscus is especially so, blooming all year. The oleander is used a good deal for windbreaks, it grow¬ 
ing fifteen feet or more high. The phy- 
lanthus or snow bush is the prettiest shrub that we have and it is used a great deal for walk borders, its red and white variegated and green and white leaves make a very dainty, delicate effect. The red variegated acalypha is liked very well too, it grows higher getting six and eight feet high. Crape myrtle, bamboos, dwarf hydrangea, cattley guava, sisil, panda- 
nus utilis and veitchii, auricaria and ca- 
rissa arduina are used singly and in groups. We have a few plants of the carissa arduina and we like it very well for a hedge plant, it grows well in poor dry sand and its glossy green leaves look well all the year, at this time of the year it bears a star shaped white flower. 
I think if it was planted close enough it would turn cattle as it is quite thorny. 

There is nothing that quite equals the bougainvilla among the climbers, with its masses of purple flowers it makes a mag¬ 
nificent sight. I was told by a gentleman living in Eau Gallie that he had one Out¬ 
side and that it was doing very well, 
everybody should have one. A bougain¬ 
villa on one side of a pergola or an arbor with an allamanda on the other makes an effect that is hard to excel, 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


187 


the yellow flowers of the alamanda and the purple of the bougainvilla go so well together. The rosa de Montana makes a very pretty thing with its pink flowers most all the year. The clerodendron balfouri, I don’t know any other name for it, is another very nice vine, it is a strong grower and has red and white flowers. 

Of the bedding plants the crotons are the most important, and what a hand¬ 
some bed you can make with them, there is such a great variety of shapes and col¬ 
ors. A bed of crotons not planted too close together with some thing green be¬ 
tween, something that does not grow too high, like sprengerii or the Boston ferns makes a very pretty bed and one that will almost take care of itself. The sprengerii and ferns are used a great deal for house plants, for jardinieres, 
there is nothing better though for this purpose than the pandanus veitchii with its long striped green and white leaves. 
I have heard it stated that a pandanus will stand more tough treatment than a mule. The New Zealand wax, wander¬ 
ing jew, poinsettia, dwarf hydrangea and crinum are some more very nice small plants. Prof. Rolfs told me he had seen the crinum as far north as Mel¬ 
bourne on the East Coast. It certainly is a thing everyone should have, it is a bulbous plant and is not particular as to soil, it is fine when in flower, the flow¬ 
ers are large and white of an umbel for¬ 
mation and the leaves are long and green usually drooping to the ground. 

I want to say a few words about some¬ 
thing that can hardly be called an orna¬ 
mental and that is the Florida packing¬ 
house. I have often wondered of the hundreds of packing-houses in Florida 


how many of them are a pleasure to look at, and yet why not ? Let us figure a lit¬ 
tle on how much more it#would cost to make the packing-house look good instead of looking bum. The roof and floor would be about the same in any case, so what we have to consider are the sides and ends. The cheapest way of making the sides, by using upright boards with or without battens would cost three to four dollars per square, next, using sid¬ 
ing would make it four to five dollars per square and if it is to last more than ten or twelve years it will have to be paint¬ 
ed every three years which will be a dol¬ 
lar and a half per square more each time. 
Now if shingles are used, number threes will last about fifty years on the side of the building, the cost would be with a little extras, like better fixed windows, 
about six to seven dollars per square or the difference between a bum looking packing-house and a good looking pack¬ 
ing-house would be about three dollars and a half per square; in a house 25x50 
where there are about thirteen squares the total difference would be fifty dollars. 
But if you want to really make it in keep¬ 
ing with the orange grove make it of ce¬ 
ment, this would cost from about fifteen to twenty dollars per square. 

Prof. Rolfs—We have to be chary about planting the sago palm because it is quite susceptible to a certain fungus which attacks it and causes what is known as “sun scald” to the leaves. This has happened quite frequently and you must go very slow unless you have close and compact soil in which to plant the sago palm. Of course, we all know it is not really a sago palm, as it belongs to an entirely different family. For this fungus disease there is no remedy.

SECRETARY’S REPORT. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Your secretary regrets to report that the number of renewals of membership has not been as great at the present time as in previous years. Owing to the fact that last year there were not sufficient funds raised to meet the expenses and a deficiency of $264.67 was carried over, 
which, taken from the amount already received leaves only a small amount in the treasury.

Since the meeting in 1908 the Society is greatly indebted to Mr. E. H. Mote of 
Leesburg, who took special interest in the 


society and sent in over one hundred new names from Leesburg and vicinity and is still showing his interest in getting many to renew this season. 

Mr. Howard Y. Stillman, chairman of the local committee in Daytona, has also done splendid work and has turned in seventy-one new names, and I understand there are still more to come. If he keeps up his present good work he will soon lie on a par with Mr. Mote. 

Your Secretary also wishes to report that the newspapers have as a rule, been very liberal in publishing notices of meeting and I wish to especially mention the Times-Union, The Florida Fruit and 
Produce News and the Daytona Halifax 
Journal. 

We have also received donations to¬ 
wards expenses from Mrs. Jane Cadliff, 
$1: John Kendig, $2; C. M. Griffin, $5. 
All of which is respectfully submitted. 

E. O. Painter, Secretary.

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The Executive Committee met in the 
Secretary’s office on July 8. Messrs. 
Rolfs, Tabor, Hubbard, Stevens and 
Painter were present. The Secretary re¬ 
ported a collection of $179 since the last meeting. Moved that the proceedings of the meeting held' in Gainesville last May be printed in the usual form. Bills for stenographer, printing, etc., were audited and ordered paid. Moved that the mak¬ 
ing up of the standing committees be re¬ 
ferred to the president and secretary with power to act. Meeting adjourned. 

The Executive Committee meeting of tne Florida State Horticultural Society was held at the Secretary’s office on 
March 5, 1909. Members present were 
Messrs. Stevens, Tabor, Hubbard and 
Secretary Painter. It was moved and seconded that Mr. H. Y. Stillman, of 
Daytona, be appointed chairman of local committee with three local members to as¬ 
sist him. He was requested to secure special rates for members to attend the meeting at Daytona. 


It was moved that the committee on legislation be notified of the desire of the society to have a bill presented before the legislature to have sufficient funds ap¬ 
propriated to print the proceedings and bear some of the expenses that will bur¬ 
den the usefulness of the society. The meeting adjourned. 

The Executive Committee met in ses¬ 
sion at Daytona, May 20, 1909; present 
Messrs. Hubbard, Stevens, Hart and 
Painter. The treasurer’s and secretary’s accounts were audited and found correct. 

The committee appointed Mr. W. S. 
Hart a committee of one to telegraph 
Hon. F. W. Sams and Mr. Thos. Palmer at Tallahassee to use their best efforts in securing an appropriation of one thou¬ 
sand dollars instead of six hundred dol¬ 
lars as had been reported by the senate committee. 

As shown by the treasurer’s and secre¬ 
tary’s reports, the amount of cash on hand is small and inadequate to print and dis¬ 
tribute our proceedings, but it is not thought best to ask members to make do-

nations towards the printing until it is ascertained what is done with the bill that is now before the senate. If the bill does not appropriate sufficient funds to take care of the publication, it will be necessary for the members to increase 


their contributions in order to furnish funds for publication. 

All of which is respectfully submitted, 

E. S. Hubbard,

Necrology. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Your committee upon whom devolves the painful duty herewith furnished con¬ 
densed data in relation to esteemed mem¬ 


WM. H. 

Wm. H. Rankin was born in Spring- 
field, Ill., January 22, 1836. His early home was next door to that of the Lin¬ 
colns. He lived there until 1845 w h etl his family moved to Monmouth, Ill., 
where he gained his early education and later engaged in business, which he con¬ 
tinued until 1898, when he sold out and moved to Punta Gorda, Fla., where he 


bers who have passed away since last we met. There have been three deaths as follows: William H. Rankin, of Punta 
Gorda; Herman Lubrecht, of Island 
Grove, and W. T. Hildrup, of Welaka.

made his home until a few months prior to his death. He died in Chicago, on Feb¬ 
ruary 20, 1909, and was laid to rest in the cemetery at Monmouth, Ill. His wife, Mary T. Rankin, and four children survive him and this society joins with them in the sense of loss of an honorable, 
upright man. 


HERMAN LUBRECHT. 


Herman Lubrecht was born in Ger¬ 
many, 1847, an d died at Island Grove, 
Fla., in April, 1909. He came to Amer¬ 
ica in 1882 and was engaged in business in New York City. About 1890 he came to Island Grove, and with some New 
York parties started in the nursery busi¬ 
ness. He was much interested in citrus and other tropical fruits and carried out many experiments. He had started a 


fine citrus grove which was killed back by the cold during the winter of 1894 and 
1895. A s a means of protecting citrus trees against cold, he was the first to erect a shed over his grove. This shed covered four and one-half acres. 

Mr. Lubrecht was a fine type of Ger¬ 
man-American citizen and was highly es¬ 
teemed by all who knew him. He had never married.

WILLIAM THOMAS HILDRUP. 


William Thomas Hildrup was born 
January 6, 1822, at Middletown, Conn., 
where he spent the first 19 years of his life, and received his education. He started out in life as a carpenter, studied mechanics and rose rapidly from one po¬ 
sition to another. While still compar¬ 
atively young, he was made superintend¬ 
ent of the Bradley & Rice car works at 
Cape Cincent, N. Y. In 1852, he estab¬ 
lished a car wheel factory at Elmira, N. 
Y., and a year later, moved to Harris¬ 
burg, Pa., and organized a Harrisburg 
Car Manufacturing Company. During the war, he aided in supplying the govern¬ 
ment with horses. He also ran the first train over the Baltimore and Ohio Rail¬ 
road, after the battle of Antietam. He was active in the organization of the 
First National Bank and The Common¬ 


wealth Trust Company, of Harrisburg, 
and was a director in each of them. He was, for many years, a warden and ves¬ 
tryman of St. Stevens Episcopal Church, 
of Harrisburg. 

Mr. Hildrup had for some years past, 
a winter residence at Welaka, Fla., at which place he passed away on January 
21, 1909, at the ripe age of 87 years, 
and was interred in the family vault in 
Harrisburg, Pa. His wife Emma J. Hil¬ 
drup survives him. He was a man of un¬ 
usual ability and will be missed by a host of friends. 


All of which is respectfully submitted, 

G. L. Tabor,

By E. H. Mote. 


Hon.- 

Washington, D. C.: 

Dear Sir—As our representative in the councils o'f our government, we wish to call your serious attention to the following preambles and resolutions, assuring you it is a matter of the utmost importance to all growers of the Citrus fruits in Florida, 
which is one, if not the most important in¬ 
dustries in the district you represent in 
Congress: 

Whereas, The orange growers of 
Florida are annually suffering the loss of many thousands of dollars in the reduc¬ 
tion of their fruit crop and still more in the market value of their groves through a disease knows as orange tree blight, 
which usually selects the largest and most productive tree for the attack; and 
Whereas, Though the disease has been carefully studied for many years by very able department experts, it is not yet well enough known to allow of its posi¬ 
tive identification, in many cases, before the second or third year after its appear¬ 
ance, while investigations pretty surely prove that the disease is contagious, which mlakes eadh diseased tree a nucleus from: 
which it is carried to others when caring for or working the grove; and 

Whereas, Progress has been made that encourages the belief that if addition¬ 
al help with special fitness can be sent here and allowed to devote their whole time assisting in this select work, we have rea¬ 
son to hope that the cause may be found for it; therefore be it 

Resolved, That the secretary of this society be instructed to correspond with 


the Florida representatives in Washing¬ 
ton and earnestly request them to call upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon. 
Wilson, and urge upon him the impor¬ 
tance of this work and the pressing need that we feel for further assis¬ 
tance from his department be it further 

Resolved, That each member of this society exert his or her influence as an in¬ 
dividual to secure increased appropriation for this work and its more vigorous prose¬ 
cution.” 

We wish to say further, relative to above actions of the Florida State Horti¬ 
cultural Society that this society, being composed largely of people who are ex¬ 
clusively engaged in cultivating the cit¬ 
rus fruits, have become alarmed at the persistence with which this new menace to our groves, defies our individual efforts to find a remedy that will check its further spread into- new territory, and finally eradicate it entirely. We are of the be¬ 
lief that this cannot be done by individual effort, owing primarily, to* the lack of au¬ 
thority of die individuals to push inquiry on the premises of those whose groves are affected, which is apt to be resented as a probable loss of value in grove property. 
We feel that we should move cautiously in the matter, so as not to bring unneces¬ 
sary hardship on the unfortunate grower, 
unless it be absolutely necessary to do so in the interest of the State at large. This action should properly be taken up' by the department of agriculture, competent experts should be sent here with authority to investigate exhaustively, the origin of this disease, whether it is curable where 




194 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


it already exists, and 1 preventable in groves not yet attacked and especially to determine authoritatively, if it is contag¬ 
ious. 

When this preliminary work is _done so as to give definite and authoritative basis to work upon, we will then invoke, 
through this State to carry into effect any precautionary or suppressive mease r ' 
that the Department of Agriculture may suggest for the extermination of this dis¬ 
ease. 

It may be possible the Department of 
Agriculture cannot take up this much needed work without a specific appropria¬ 
tion for the purpose. If this is true, we urge you to use every legitimate effort to have such appropriation placed in some of the pending bills now before this Con¬ 
gress, so that this work may start at the earliest possible date. 

In urging the consideration of our ap¬ 
peal for aid in this difficulty ; we respect¬ 
fully call attention to' the fact that some fifteen years ago- the orange industry sus¬ 
tained a crushing calamity that for the time amounted to the total destruction, 
when it was generally believed that the orange industry in Florida was perman¬ 
ently destroyed and would never again become a paying enterprise. While this calamity was State-wide, falling on. the rich and poor alike, and deserved to be classed with other “visitations of God,” as floods, conflagrations and earthquakes, 
that invariably call forth the sympathy 


and bounteous contributions not only of the charitable individuals and societies, 
but the generous and substantial find c A 
aid of the Government at Washington, it is a matter of pride to the people of Flor¬ 
ida that they never appealed to the citi¬ 
zens nor the Government for anything but sympathy, and even that appeal was si¬ 
lent and unspoken. Thousands of men, 
who had been reduced from moderate fi- 
uanlcial independence to beggary in aj single night, by an overwhelming disaster that no effort or foresight on their part could avert or alleviate patiently and uncomplainingly went to work to renew again their groves and bring prosperity again to* an industry that is rapidly build¬ 
ing up the waste places and adding several millions of dollars, as well as many thou¬ 
sand's of settlers to the State; which is rapidly taking rank and influence among the States in the production of world-wide necessities, as well as the luxuries of life. 

Such moderate aid as we now ask has been generously extended to California in the propagation of the fig and orange in¬ 
dustry and other States in the protection of peach orchards from destruction through contagious diseases that could not be controlled by individual effort, 
which, when backed by the police p wer c these industries and added immensely to the taxable values, and also to the peace of these States, has brought prosperity to and prosperity of the State.
