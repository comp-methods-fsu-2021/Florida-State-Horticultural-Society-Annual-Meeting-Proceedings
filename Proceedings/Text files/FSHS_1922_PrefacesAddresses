To the Members of the Florida State Horticultural Society


We are -today mailing you your copy of the 1922 Pro¬
ceedings of the Florida State Horticultural Society. Read
it carefully. I believe you will agree with me and many
others, that it is worth a great deal more than the dollar
it has cost you.

As you will note in the editorial and in the resolu¬
tions passed at the Lakeland meeting, the annual member¬
ship fee has been increased from one dollar to two dollars,
beginning January 1, 1923. This increase has been made
necessary on account of the increased cost of printing and
of current expenses• This increase is going to make it
possible for the Executive Committee to put out a whole
lot better publication than it has in the past. More
pictures will be used; more articles will be included in
the book and better paper can be used. Every cent is
spent on the book, excepting a small amount that is used
foT postage, stenographic help and other expenses, inci¬
dental to the annual meeting.

You can save the Society much of this incidential
expense by sending in your membership fee for 1923 at once.
Fill out the following form and enclose it with your
check for $2.00 to Bayard F. Floyd, Sec., P. 0. Box 719,
Orlando, Florida.

Proceedings of the Thirty-Fifth Annual
Meeting of the Florida State
Horticultural Society


It was quite fitting that the Thirty-
fifth Annual Meeting of the Florida State
Horticultural Society should be held in
Lakeland because the society has long
been primarily interested in the produc¬
tion of citrus fruits, and that beautiful
little city—one of Polk county’s gems—
is the center of a thriving citrus region.
In addition to the large number of small
and large sized groves in this community,
it is also the home of the Lakeland High¬
lands Co-operative Association, a co-oper¬
ative association of near three hundred
grove owners, who have property in the
Lakeland Highlands. The total acreage
in this association is near four thousand
acres.

The spirit of co-operation pervades the
community. Every person and every or¬
ganization joined in welcoming the mem¬
bers of the society and gave every help
possible to make the meeting a pleasant
and profitable one. Secretary Appleyard
of the Chamber of Commerce, was every¬
where during the meeting, lending a help¬
ing hand. Wm. Gomme, the Agricultural
Agent of Polk county, was much in evi¬
dence and did more than his bit to make
every one happy. The society is much
indebted to Mrs. Geo. W. Peterkin for the


very active co-operation that she gave.
She was present early and late, helping to
secure new members and giving service
to see that everyone was made comfort¬
able.

Among the enter¬
tainments provided
by the people of
Lakeland and Polk county, was a motor¬
cade to points on the “Ridge.” At Lake
Wales a luncheon was provided at the
Club House on the lake by the Lake Wales
Chamber of Commerce, which was a hap¬
py culmination to a long morning drive
through Auburndale, Lake Alfred,
Haines City, Winter Haven, Dundee and
Mountain Lake. After seeing the miles
and miles of rolling hills covered with
beautiful groves laden with fruit, it is
thought that the “sour orange” members
went home with more respect in their
hearts for the “rough lemon” country
than their papers and discussions might
indicate.

One of the features
of the Lakeland
meeting was the re¬
union of the former workers of the State
Plant Board, who took part in the fight

against citrus canker. To show its appre¬
ciation of the good work they had done,
the Horticultural Society invited them to
attend the meeting as its guests. Fifty-
four of the men were present. On
Wednesday a banquet was given them by
the Horticultural Society and the Lake¬
land Chamber of Commerce.

During the meeting, the workers per¬
fected an organization known as the Can¬
ker Veterans’ Association. M. G. Camp¬
bell, of Lake Wales, was elected president,
and Frank Stirling, of Gainesville, secre¬
tary-treasurer. The purpose of the or¬
ganization is to hold together the men
who know citrus canker from a field point
of view and have had experience in the
eradication work. The meetings will be
social and will be held annually at the time
and place of meeting of the Horticultural
Society. That the citrus industry and the
State at large owe these men a debt of
gratitude goes without saying. The in¬
dustry enjoys its present prosperity to the
efficient work that these men of the State
Plant Board and their leader, Dr. Wilmon
Newell, did and are doing.

Another feature of
the meeting was
three exhibits. One
was of diseases and pests of citrus trees
that was prepared by the State Plant
Board; and another was an exhibit of cit¬
rus fruits. These exhibits were housed in
the lobby of the Thelma Hotel. Both at¬
tracted much attention and particularly
the exhibit of fruits. Some very fancy
fruit and packs were shown by the Amer¬
ican Fruit Growers Inc. and the Florida
Citrus Exchange.


The third exhibit was a floral exhibit
prepared by members of the Florida State
Florists’ Association. It was housed in
the parlors of the Elks Hotel and consist¬
ed of foliage plants and cut flowers.
Much credit is due to Messrs. Knull, Rea-
soner and Giddings for this beautiful dis¬
play that attracted the attention not only
of the members of the society, but also
of the people of Lakeland, many of whom
visited it.

Meeting with the
Horticultural Soci¬
ety, but holding sep¬
arate sessions, was the Florida State Flor¬
ists’ Association. This infant organiza¬
tion is really a child of the Horticultural
Society. Organized in Jacksonville on
November 17, 1921, and holding its First
Annual Meeting in Lakeland during the
Horticultural meeting, it has quickly ac¬
quired a membership of more than one
hundred. It promises to grow into an or¬
ganization of much strength and influ¬
ence. The officers for 1923 are C. Leslie
Whipp, of Jacksonville, president, and N.
A. Reasoner, of Oneco, secretary-treas¬
urer.

During the last sev¬
eral meetings of the
society, floral exhib¬
its have been a feature. These have been
prepared largely by the florists. There
has been a decided interest in the society
in flower gardens and landscape beautifi¬
cation. Many have thought that the time
was ripe for holding a State Flower
Show. Pursuant to a resolution intro¬
duced and adopted by the society calling
for a committee from the society to meet

with similar committees from the Florida
State Florists’ Association and the State
Federation of Women’s Clubs, to discuss
and decide concerning a State Flower
Show, a meeting of the combined com¬
mittees was held in Orlando. It was
unanimously decided to hold the show in
Orlando in April, 1923, during the week
the Horticultural Society and State Flor¬
ists are in session there. An organization
was perfected to have charge of the de¬
tails of the show, of which N. A. Rea-
soner, of Oneco, was elected chairman
and director-in-charge, with Mr. F. W.
Fletcher, of Orlando, as superintendent of
exhibits. A number of other organiza¬
tions will be asked to co-operate and the
show will doubtless attract State-wide in¬
terest.

For several years the
Horticultural Socie¬
ty has had difficulty
in meeting the expense of the publication
of its proceedings and meeting its other
current expenses with its income from the
annual membership fee of one dollar.
During 1920, owing to the great increase
in cost of printing, the cost of printing a
copy of the Proceedings was in excess of
one dollar, leaving the society a consider¬
able deficit to meet. Thanks to the gen¬
erosity of several members of the society,
this deficit has been made up. In fairness
to those who have always contributed lib¬
erally to meet deficits in the past, and be¬
cause lack of funds was curtailing some
of the activities of the society, it was de¬
cided best to increase the annual member¬
ship fee. A resolution was introduced
and adopted to increase this fee to two


dollars, beginning January 1, 1923. No
increase was made in the life membership
fee, which remains at twenty-five dollars.

The total member¬
ship at time of going
to press is 1,763,
made up as follows:


Honorary members _ 9

Patron members _ 36

Perennial members_ 13

Life members_ 133

Annual members_1,572


Total____1,763

I


This is more than two hundred less than
the total of last year, which was even
2,000. The society is indebted to Mrs.
Geo. W. Peterkin and to Mr. S. L. Mc-
Clanahan and his associates for their ef¬
forts in maintaining the membership of
the society. The work is arduous and
deserves much credit.

Four honorary mem¬
bers were elected at
this meeting. These
were Dr. David Fairchild, of Coconut
Grove, Florida and Washington, D. C.,
who is agricultural explorer in charge of
Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of
the United States Department of Agri¬
culture, and who, with his co-workers, is
doing much to develop the avocado and
sub-tropical fruit industry in Florida; E.
S. Hubbard, of Federal Point, who, while
not a charter member of the society,
joined soon afterward and was a member
of the Executive Committee from 1894 to
1921, and a wheel horse in the society for

these many years; J. B. Anderson, of San
Mateo, and L. W. Lipsey, of Blanton,
who with G. L. Taber, of Glen St. Mary,
are the only living charter members of the
society. Mr. Anderson was the first
treasurer of the society and held office un¬
til 1896, when he was succeeded by Mr.
W. S. Hart, who in turn has held office
until this year.


It is with much re¬

sary to announce the
retirement of two of the older officers of
the society—H. Harold Hume, president
of the society since 1910, and W. S. Hart,
treasurer of the society since 1896. The
least we can say is that we will miss them.

OPENING

Pres. H. Harold Hume: The Thirty- H. H. Hume: On the occasion of the
fifth Annual Meeting of the Florida State opening meeting it is usual for us to have
Horticultural Society will now come to an address of welcome, which is to be
. order and we will have the invocation by given this evening by Major H. C. Pette-
Rev. J. M. Gross, D. D. way, of Lakeland.

Prayer.




Address of Welcome


H. C. Petteway, Lakeland


Ladies and Gentlemen :

We will eliminate the address part of it
but we do not want to eliminate the wel¬
come part. I want to assure you that you
are welcome. Lakeland lies in the heart
of the citrus belt and is heartily interested
in the work which you are gathered here
to discuss and which your society is devel¬
oping. Therefore, Lakeland is interested
in those men who are giving their time
to this wonderful industry.

Lakeland is glad to have you meet here.
First, she is glad to have you as individ¬
uals; and second, she is glad to have you
become acquainted with her people and let


them learn to know you, in order that we
may all come in closer fellowship and se¬
cure better co-operation and better fruit
in the work, of which Lakeland is a fac¬
tor. I wish to expressly welcome you to
the city of Lakeland and I hope you will
have a very pleasant time while with us.
I assure you that if any of the citizens or
any of the city officials can do anything
to make your stay successful or more
pleasant you have only to name it and" we
will do our best to see that it is done.

Again, in the name of Lakeland, I wel¬
come you to our city.


Response


Dr. J. H. Ross, Winter Haven


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :

It is certainly very gratifying to come
to so good a town as Lakeland and to be
assured of the welcome that the Mayor
has so gratifyingly expressed to us.
Lakeland is the great city in Polk county
and Polk county is the banner citrus coun¬
ty of Florida, and therefore it is quite fit¬
ting that this society should be welcomed


to this city. This society may be called
the pioneer influence which has had more
to do with the establishing of the citrus
industry in Florida and in its growth and
expansion than any one influence which
has been expressed in this State. This so¬
ciety is respectable enough to be welcomed
to any city—respectable because of its
agents, respectable because its purpose has






2


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


been very good, respectable also because it
adheres to its purpose. No matter about
the cross currents of opinions in the State,
this society fixes and corrects. This so¬
ciety can be termed a clearing house of
citrus opinions in Florida. In fact, I
think if we were speaking chemically we
might say that this society is the melting
pot of the citrus opinions in Florida, the
pot in which your opinions are tested.
This society has done everything possible
in a collective way to increase the quan¬
tity of crops. It has done much to im¬
prove the quality of fruit products. It is
a lamentable fact that with all we have
done it appears true that of all fruit that
we produce and send out of Florida, 60%
will class as second and third grade and
only 40% as first. I don’t know if it is
possible to overcome that. It might be
possible. It may be a climatic condition.
We look back, some of us possibly over a
long time, and we see that the years we
put in makes comparatively short time.
It takes a longer time than we have been
at this job to make horticulture complete.
Just how to improve the quality of citrus


fruit is a question that should seriously
engage this society in the future. We
have a great deal of help from our own
schools and also from the Federal agents,
but after all, we need not deceive ourselves
into the fact that we do not have second
and third grade fruit.

Now, referring to the cordial welcome
to which I am supposed to respond, I think
we are honored to be invited to meet in
Lakeland. We are here, we are going to
behave ourselves, we want to leave as
good an impression when we leave as we
come, and if we obey the Federal laws
we shall probably be able to leave a good
impression. We feel that we are as wel¬
come as when Emerson entertained his
guest. When his guest was to arrive, he
told his daughter, “Now, of course, we
will have fresh linen and a little more to
eat.” He said, “We will endeavor to
make our guest feel that he is welcome,
not by the linen, but by the spirit of cor¬
diality that we may extend.” That is
what we shall do, we will conduct our¬
selves so that Lakeland will feel proud of
us.



President’s Annual Address


H. Harold Hume


Mr. Chairman , Members of the Florida
State Horticultural Society, Ladies
and Gentlemen :

Florida! A State of vast woodlands
and open savannahs, a State of mirrored
lakes and smoothly flowing rivers, all
walled in by the restless sea! A State of
ample rainfall and genial climate! A
State of oak and bay, of palm and pine!
A State where nature from her bountiful
hand scattered far and wide trees and
shrubs and lowly flowering things, strik¬
ing in their beauty, wondrous in their va¬
riety, a fair and goodly land. Such was
this State where the Indian lived and
roamed its vast expanse of park-like for¬
ests, hunted beside its rivers, fished its
limpid lakes. Then the white man came
and named it, because he saw it was a
pleasant place—Florida.

And the Florida that you and I know is
much the same Florida. The lakes and
rivers are the same, and the same sea still
washes our vast extent of sea coast. Here
and there the palm adorns our landscape
as of old, beauteous flowers still grow in
the waste places. The climate is still
genial and the rains have not entirely for¬
saken us.

But change is over all!

Gone are the Indians from our trackless
forests, gone their gleaming paddles from


our inland waters, gone are their village
fires from which the smoke curled
through the giant oaks that o’ershadowed
them, gone are the virgin forests through
whose vastness they wandered, gone is the
majesty of those vast timberlands whose
somber greatness made sober the lives of
their aboriginal inhabitants, gone are all
these and with them much of Florida’s
immeasurable natural wealth and primeval
beauty.

In their place? The white man’s cities,
towns and villages. In their place? The
white man’s groves, farms and gardens.
In their place endless miles of roads of
steel and rock. In their place man de¬
stroyed and fire consumed open acres
where once the Indians held sway beneath
shadowing branches. He has done much,
has the white man; built much, made great
material gain, destroyed much and in
many places left this Florida of ours a less
lovely place, a less worth-while place, in
some ways, than in the ancient days.

Now the first point to which I desire to
lead up is, that one of these days the re¬
forestation of Florida must be under¬
taken in earnest. That the replanting of
forest areas will add greatly to the beauty
of our State goes without saying, but out
and beyond that is the fact staring us in
the face that our supplies of lumber are all


3

but exhausted. There is no other way-
out; why should it be longer delayed?
Reforestration must be undertaken, not in
a half-hearted way, but on a large scale,
a scale commensurate with our former
condition and in line with our direct and
pressing needs. This work will have to
be undertaken by the State both on its own
initiative and in co-operation in many
ways with individuals. There is no great¬
er problem before us than this. When it
comes up for solution, as it must come be¬
fore many days, let me urge upon the
membership of this society that they lend
every possible assistance in carrying
through a constructive program even as
they have given assistance along other
lines in the past. It is in line with our
duty, our privilege and our avowed course
of action.

To restore Florida to its former beauty
and the glory which it had when the white
man named it Florida, is another work
to which the members of this society
should lend their every help. A broad
state-wide movement should be inaugu¬
rated for a “more beautiful Florida.” To
such an undertaking there are so many
angles that to cover them all in a brief
address is quite impossible. It is a work
in which every inhabitant of the State,
yea, every sojourner therein, may have a
part.

To clean the trash and refuse and un¬
sightly things from the surface of Florida
would be an enormous undertaking.
Cotild it be done? Yes, if every citizen
did his part. This alone would make our
State a more pleasant place in which to
live.


Old signs should be removed from our
roadways. Some of them are poor testi¬
mony of the value of things that are long
since out of use or out of fashion. New
ones should be prohibited along our road¬
ways. Why decorate our landscape and
road side views with the merits of some¬
body’s ketchup or the particular value of
certain brands of cigarettes?

Roadways should be planted both to

add to their beautv and to the comfort of

*

travel. Trees and flowering shrubs placed
there would replace those which in our
haste to clear land have been destroyed.

The planting along the Memorial Road
leading from Tampa toward Pinellas
county is a commendable piece of work.
We should have more of it. Would it not
be worth while for instance, if the road
from Lakeland to Bartow were planted
throughout its entire length on both sides
with Oleanders, or the road leading from
Lakeland to Tampa with Bauhinia Pur¬
purea? Why should not the roads of
North Florida be lined with Magnolias,
or Live Oaks, or Crape Myrtle? We can
so plant our roadways as to make them
never-to-be-forgotten stretches of beauty
to him who travels over them. In our
cities, towns and villages we need the same
sort of planting, the carrying out of one
predominating line of planting, whether
in yard or street. Gainesville will be fa¬
mous within a few seasons for her palm-
lined avenues. The Poinsettias of Bartow
in their season of bloom are worth going
far to see. They need more of them.
Why shouldn’t Lakeland be famous for its
Hibiscus and other towns for other lines
of planting? If it is advertising that our





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY

towns want, and many of them do want
it, there is no way in which the right sort
of publicity can be secured so well as by
doing these things in the right way.

And do not forget that every home
owner by roadside or on city street has his
large opportunity in helping to build a
more beautiful state. What is it that
makes a beautiful street? Is it not houses
of fitting design and well planted, well
cared for lawns and yards? Certainly
these are the things that make beautiful
our home surroundings, which make them
better places in which to live, these arc the


things that make beautiful pictures to lin¬
ger longer in the memories of those so
fortunate as to see them.

With you as members of this society, let
me leave this thought, that to make more
beautiful the State in which we live, is at
once a high privilege and a duty. Let us
make up for many plants and trees that
have been destroyed by planting others in
the places where we live and work, and
along the roads we travel and so bring a
more surpassing beauty to this Land of
Flowers—our Florida.




Address of Welcome to Former Workers of

Florida State Plant Board


B. L. Hamner, Tampa


H. H. Hume: A good many years ago
Florida found herself in a very peculiar
and very dangerous position, I am refer¬
ring to the time when citrus canker first
began to interest us, about ten years ago.
Very many men took an active part in
crowding out that very dangerous disease
and at this meeting we deem it fit and
proper to try to have a reunion of those
who first worked in that battle. They are
veterans of one of the most unique wars
that has ever been waged. I am going to
ask B. L. Hamner, of Tampa, to say a
word of welcome to these men.

B. L. Hamner: Ladies and Gentle¬
men—In behalf of the workers in citrus
products, to you men who worked against
the citrus canker, I offer my most sincere
welcome. I will say that we welcome you
with gratification in our hearts. Our
president has well said that you waged a
war and it is not alone in war that we
have heroes in our daily life. There are
many who are living the lives of heroes
and I know that all those growers of cit¬
rus fruit in this State who took part in the
fight against the danger that was at hand
are real heroes. Your victory as warriors
was a remarkable one. I think it is true
that it is the first time in the history where


a disease has started that it has been so
nearly eradicated. Therefore, as warriors
you have won a great victory. Think
what damage the cotton grower in this
country had with the boll weevil. We had
to go to Washington to secure funds to
carry on some of our battles. We had
men of purpose and men of determination
and real warriors and real heroes. You
men fought on and on and fought through
discouragement and I will say that you
were careful warriors. You fought every¬
thing that looked serious on the tree and
you gave the benefit of the doubt to the
citrus fruit and you decided it and by your
careful work there, you became, in the
eyes who know, real heroes. I will say
that we owe to you a debt of gratitude.
Practically, we owe our industry to your
efforts. If citrus canker should have been
allowed to go on and damaged, there
would have been no citrus industry.
Those who come now to raise oranges and
grapefruit owe you a debt of gratitude
whether or not they know it. We realize
that your pay was small, that your labor
was great. I have never yet heard a man
who carried on that work or helped to car¬
ry it on, make a claim for compensation for
the job that he did. What he had accom-


6

plishcd was a satisfaction to him and a
compensation.

Now I want to say one word to those
who carried on that fight. You are the
men who know citrus canker and are the
ones who can detect it should it break out
again. You are our Home Guards, you
are our National Guards, you are our Re¬
serve Corps. I know that through the
service you have rendered the State that
you love Florida and that should the oc¬
casion arise, you will come to the rescue


and therefore we can sleep well at night
and live on in peace because we have con¬
fidence in our Reserve Corps. By your
actions you have proven yourselves to be
dependable and I express in the name of
the Horticultural Society our love for you
and that love is a sincere one. We have
confidence in you because you have prov¬
en yourselves worthy of our love and our
gratification and in the name of the so¬
ciety and all the citrus growers of Florida,
I welcome you.


Response


Hon. Frank Jennings, Jacksonville


Mr. Hume, Members of the Society, La¬
dies and Gentlemen:

I assure you that I received a few days
ago the invitation to make this address
with both surprise and pleasure, but that I
accepted it with some considerable trep¬
idation. I recognize full well the fact that
this is one of the largest organizations of
its kind in the world, overwhelmingly out¬
ranking any similar society in this section
of the country, and I know that among
your members are men whose learning,
abilities and achievements have received
merited note and recognition, not alone
throughout this great State, but through¬
out every clime wherein horticulture is of
considerable importance.

Had you met merely for the purpose of
discussing and re-living your problems
and your achievements of the past, your
convention would be a happy and a profit¬


able one. For while your trials and trib¬
ulations of the past have been varied and,
in some instances, extremely serious, they
have in the main been met and overcome
with such clear vision, supreme courage
and dependable co-operation that your so¬
ciety today can look back over a most in¬
spiring record of growth, progress and
achievement, a result, be it said, in which
not your members alone are interested, but
one which has redounded to the better¬
ment, the growth, the wealth and the up¬
building of the entire commonwealth.

As it is impossible for an individual to
grow physically strong without exercise,
or to grow in character without meeting
and overcoming the problems of daily life,
just as truly is it impossible for any or¬
ganization of this character to live and
grow and continuously increase in
strength and influence without grappling

with and battling with the conditions and
circumstances which retard or endanger
the growth or the existence of your indus¬
try. Men will not, at no small expense of
both time and money, attend these meet¬
ings year after year merely for the pur¬
pose of tossing bouquets at each other.

You have seen the resources from the
industries with which you are directly
identified grow from an unclassified and
almost negligible amount to a system¬
atized, stabilized, wealth-producer of the
first magnitude in this State, and you
know that you have hardly more than
scratched the surface of your possibilities.
Think for a moment of the condition of
this wonderful country immediately sur¬
rounding where we now stand, a third of
a century ago and as it is today, and the
growth of the past, being, as it is, but an
index of the possibilities and probabilities
of the future, is little less than staggering.
One reads that our citrus output increased
almost two hundred per cent from 1910-
11 to 1920-21, and doubts. One sees
Florida today, and believes. I am told
that last year alone there were planted in
the State over a million, six hundred thou¬
sand citrus trees. I do not know the num¬
ber of pecan trees planted last year, but I
do know that that industry is throughout
favored sections in the State growing
by leaps and bounds. Our orange packing
houses represent an investment of well
over six million dollars, and our citrus
crop alone is now sufficient to load a solid
train of freight cars reaching from St.
Petersburg to Jacksonville.

But this enterprising and aggressive
membership does not live in the past.


Your shadows still fall far to the west
and your past will be used, not as a place
in which to live, but as a place in which to
learn. Wise men make mistakes. Fools
make the same mistake twice. And so I
take it you have met again in this your
thirty-fifth gathering, not only to learn
how best to meet and solve your various
ever-present problems, but to take calm
counsel among yourselves concerning the
problems that must be met in the future.

And let it not be forgotten that to a
very considerable degree the problems of
the horticulturist have become the prob¬
lems of the entire State, not alone because
of the immense revenues in the form of
taxes upon your properties, in which the
entire State participates, but also because
your improved properties are situated
throughout the entire State. In your suc¬
cesses the entire State benefits. In your
reverses, the entire State suffers. It is,
therefore, the just province and duty of
the State as a part of its governmental
functions to reasonably aid and assist you
in the continued upbuilding of the re¬
sources in which you are as citizens and
individuals so vitally interested and in
which you are so heavily involved. I
think you will agree with me when I say
that within the last eight or ten years there
has been a wonderful awakening on the
part of the State in this regard, and that
while, no doubt, much remains yet to be
done, the “breeze comes from the proper
quarter,” and that you are justified in be¬
lieving that it will continue so to do.

The careful consideration of your inti¬
mate problems of successful cultivation,
fertilization and care of your diversified


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY p

fruits, plants and shrubs in this great
State of unparalleled diversities of soil
and climate, make these meetings of your
experts and leaders imperative. But there
are also many problems and conditions
with which you are, in the large, vitally
interested.

You are, of course, directly interested
in your extensive nurseries, and in their
inspection and certification. Nothing can
be of more concern to the grower than to
have every assurance, which reasonable
care and foresight can assure, that when
he pays his good money for bread, he shall
not receive a stone; that his labor and ef¬
forts upon a tree shall cause it to produce
that variety which he was told he bought.
And it is axiomatic that a square deal for
the grower is a square deal for the nur¬
seryman. It is the province and it must-
ever be the purpose of your inspecting of¬
ficials to do as nearly as possible exact
justice to both nurseryman and grower.
But a few years ago, you had practically
no such department in the State. For lack
of it, as is well known, the State and the
citrus industry paid most dearly. To help
this department efficiently perform its
functions, whether such help be the sug¬
gestion of new or different plans or prac¬
tices, or whether it be of friendly criticism
of some plan, or any other just sugges¬
tion, is a subject in which you are directly
interested, and I am sure this department
of our State activity does and will wel¬
come and value your judgment and your
advice.

What I have said concerning the nur¬
sery inspection department of our State
applies with equal force to the importance


of upbuilding, maintaining and assisting
our port quarantine inspections. No man
has less sympathy with the creation of
useless public positions than do I. But
such is not this case. No State of the
Union has such diversified actualities and
possibilities as has this State, and it is
nothing* less than common sense to safe¬
guard and protect them against disease
or depredation coming from without.
This department, inadequate though it is,
has many times paid for itself. Every
grove property in this State is worth much
more money, as an investment, because of
this safeguard. And the same statement
is as applicable, and as true, to every farm.

Another direct problem, which is under
our present law more of a private, as dis¬
tinguished from a public, nature, is one of
advertising your products. Personally I
know very little about it, but as I ride over
this State and see the thousands upon
thousands of acres of groves, both citrus
and pecans, soon to come into bearing, I
am impressed with the fact that greater
effort to bring before the consuming
world the actual merits of our citrus prod¬
ucts must necessarily follow. The old slo¬
gan, “If the- world but knew,” is directly
applicable. In this, however, your effort
will be a happy and gratifying and easy
one, for I care not whom you may select
nor how fertile his imagination may be,
nor how adept a painter with printer’s ink
he may be, you can retire to your slumbers
at night with the calm assurance that he
cannot over-describe the excellencies of
the Florida orange.

And then, your problems come in con¬
tact with those affecting persons not di-

rectly or primarily engaged in horticul¬
ture. Our lumber and naval stores indus¬
tries cannot forever last. From the math¬
ematics of the situation we know this to
be true. He is not an alarmist who tells
us that at the present rapid rate of lum¬
ber depletion, both by cutting and by fire,
and the present slow rate of lumber propa¬
gation, the time is rapidly approaching
when not only will our export lumber
trade be no more, but when we will not
have sufficient to provide for our housing
problems and our crate materials. It is
most sobering to contemplate the fact that
our new plantings of fruit, and our exten¬
sive and growing truck industry, will in¬
crease the demand for crates several hun¬
dred-fold in the near future, and that the
supply is decreasing with equal rapidity.
And thus we have a vital problem, affect¬
ing directly our horticulturist, and also
our mill man, our farmer and our cattle¬
man. Personally, there is nothing that
appeals to me of more vital interest to the
future welfare of all the people of this
State than the formulation and positive
promulgation of some plan of timber con¬
servation and re-forestration. I believe,
too, that this can be brought about not
without some inconvenience to the indus¬
tries directly or indirectly affected, and
not without some modifications of the
old-time ways, but most certainly without
destruction to these industries and, in the
end, for their permanent good, and for the
ultimate welfare of the people as a whole.

Nature has not endowed us with depos¬
its of gold, silver, copper, iron or coal, and
the great factories depending on any of
them will in the main continue to be found


near the source of raw supply. Proud
though we are of all our varied resources,
zealous as we must always be of their pro¬
tection, yet, my friends, as we see much of
our natural wealth being rapidly depleted;
as we see our immigration continuing, as
in the past, second to no Eastern or South¬
ern state; as we contemplate that in the
year of 1920-21 our people did more than
25% of the entire building done in the
entire United States; as we thus see our
State becoming one of permanent happy
homes we are, my friends, impressed with
the fact that the great handmaiden of hor¬
ticulture, linked with her by indissoluble
bonds of mutual needs, mutual ambitions
and mutual opportunities, will be agricul¬
ture. Over 70% of our farmers own
their own homes, and over 85% of our
white farmers operate their own farms.
But in no state in the Union is scientific
and expert knowledge more necessary for
success. And hence every agency of our
government, both state and national,
whose business it is to accurately acquire
and intelligently distribute such knowl¬
edge, must be encouraged, supported and
enlarged.

But I must not continue longer. No
one need endeavor to discuss all the prob¬
lems which confront an ambitious people
in a State of such positive possibilities as
ours. They are a ringing challenge for
closer co-operation, renewed energy, and
aggressive action, but in meeting them the
achievements of this society in the past
are, I predict, but a dim prophesy of what
they will be in the future.

On a bright October forenoon in 1918
a young American lieutenant had with his


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY


11


company reached the objective which in
the scheme of battle he was directed to
reach, and await further orders. He de¬
ployed his command beneath the trees and
bushes of the hillside and waited. No
runner came, and no signal was given
him. Everyone knows how soldiers dread
the ordeal of standing still, especially un¬
der fire, as they then were. Finally he
left his command, went to the rear to ob¬
tain further orders, and as he was return¬
ing a fragment of a bursting shell tore its
jagged path through his brave young
heart. Rising to his feet he rushed for¬


ward to his men and cried out: “Ser¬
geant, the command is ‘Forward,’ ” and
sank lifeless. There is no spoken word
which insures better morale, inspires more
bravery, or generates more heroism than
that command. Thus it is in war. Equal¬
ly true it is in peace. Under this com¬
mand, guided as you are by the best of
trained minds, actuated as you are by no¬
ble and unselfish purposes, you will con¬
tinue to be in the future, as you have been
in the past, a moulder of public sentiment,
a stronghold of mutual helpfulness, and a
positive upbuilder of this great State.
