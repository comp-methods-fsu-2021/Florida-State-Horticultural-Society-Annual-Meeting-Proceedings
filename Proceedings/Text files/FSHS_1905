Address of Welcome.
BY MAYOR G. M. NOLAN.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In looking over this large audience I see a great many familiar faces, emphasizing the fact that you are not sojourners in our beautiful State nor strangers in its metro-
polis, but one of the oldest organizations in the State and one of its staunchest pil-
lars of prosperity. I am glad also to see so many ladies, fair daughters of Florida,
present, and congratulate you and the Florida State Horticultural Society upon the large attendance at the opening of your eighteenth annual session.
Mr. President, the city of Jacksonville as you know has now become one of the greatest convention and assembly meeting places in the country. I may tell you in advance, that the gentleman who will fol-
low me in an address of welcome on be-
half of the Board of Trade of this city,
Captain C. E. Garner, will inform you that these annual meetings of societies and conventions keep the mayor almost con-
stantly on his feet delivering welcoming addresses, and that I have a cut and dried speech which I deliver to every one of them. While it is true that it is one of the most important functions of the mayor-
alty, these privileges are a great pleas-
ure to me, and these annual meetings of the various societies are a great beneﬁt not only to the city of Jacksonville, but to the State at large as well. I am not here to give you a cut and dried or second hand address of welcome, for of all the socie-
ties that hold their annual sessions in this city, none of them are, I wish now and here to assure you, more heartily welcome than the Florida State Horticultural So-
ciety, whose great work, past and future,
for the interests of the great State of Florida, has been basic, and it is and will continue to remain one of the staunchest foundation-stones of the prosperity of this State.
Mr. President, I must confess that I am not sufﬁciently versed in the nomenclature ‘
of Horticulture to know or deﬁne its limitations. My idea, however, is that horticulture embraces everything at least that would not properly come under the generic term of agriculture, and of neces-
sity it must include some of the arts of agriculture, I therefore conclude that it is esthetic agriculture, it gives us the fruits and ﬂowers of the gardens and orchards of the homes, rather than the products of the broad acres, and as the State of Florida is destined to become the garden and orchard of this country, the great work of your society is of the greatest in-
terest to the prosperity of the State of Florida. Indeed Mr. President I have perceived and do perceive, as must every onewith common knowledge of your great work, that upon your endeavor and achievement rests in a great degree the name and the fame of the great State of Florida.
Now, Mr. President, should I attempt to catalogue the vast collections and varieties of the fruit of the orchard, the ornamen-
tals of the garden, tropical and semi-
tropical, with which every active member

of your society is doubtless familiar, I should become bewildered. The greatest ancient achievement in horticulture was perhaps the hanging gardens of Babylon,
from whence transplanted from Persia we know came the rose, apple, pear, quince,
pomegranate and the peach—there, Mr.
President, at the mention of the luscious peach. I can proceed no further. I do not say this with any disparagement against any of the other of our great family of citrus fruit, the orange, the grapefruit, the plum, the apple, but the vision and aroma of peaches and cream makes oratory suc-
cumb to appetite, and I must stop. (Ap-
plause.)
Mr. President, in conclusion, I have the great honor to tender to you the keys of the city, and to extend to you and each of you a double, thrice welcome to the City of Jacksonville, the Metropolis of your State,
and bespeak for you a session of great beneﬁt to the State as well as of pleaSure and proﬁt to each of you individually, and as a society.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.
BYCAPT.C.E.GARNER.
M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
On behalf of the Board of Trade as its president, and as representative of the business interests of the City of Jackson-
ville, I desire to extend to you, to the Florida State Horticultural Society and to each of you individually and collective-
ly a most hearty, cordial welcome to our City. I wish to reiterate what has been said by the Honorable Mayor who has just preceded me, that Jacksonville has become one of the greatest convention and assembly meeting places in this country.
There are at the present moment several other organizations and societies holding their annual sessions in the city, moreover these conventions and gatherings are not conﬁned to those of the State, they come here from all over the country to hold their annual meetings. Many of these dates being arranged for during the win-
ter months in order that they may enjoy the balmy climate of our fair State for their deliveratioﬂs, Mr. President, I wish here to assure you that, of all of these societies, none of them are more welcome than the Florida State Horticultural So-
ciety, indeed we claim you as one of us, to you, to your great work, is due in a great measure the renown of our fair State.
Mr. President, I wish at this time to invite the attention of your society to a movement in this State which in my judg-
ment, if properly handled, will prove of much beneﬁt to the State and to the Horti-
cultural interests of this State. I refer to the effort now being made to the trans-
planting of a Japanese Colony in Florida.
The Japanese. Mr. President,as you know,
are essentially a horticultural people, and'
I believe if this movement receives the encouragement it merits that the State will be greatly beneﬁtted, especially the horticultural interests of the State.
Now, Mr. President, after you have lis-
tened to the eloquent address of the Hon_
orable Mayor, you will perhaps be inclined to expect me to soar into similar ﬂights of

oratory, this I am unable to do, it has always been my portion to follow the Honorable Mayor, and he has the happy faculty of covering the very points on which I would address you. This he does with. so much grace and elegance that it would be folly for me to undertake to improve upon it, therefore I crave your indulgence in that direction, but when it comes to the cordiality of the welcome that I am commissioned to extend to you, that is peculiarly my province, and where I may fail in eloquence, I hope to come up to the measure of a counterbalance in the fullness and completeness of this privilege.
In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish to announce that the Board of Trade has planned and arranged for a portion of your entertainment, a trip up0n the beauti-
ful St. Johns river on the good Steamer May Garner, which is duly announced upon your program.
Trusting that the deliberations of this your eighteenth annual session, will prove to be of much pleasure to the society and of beneﬁt to the State, and with as-
surances of .that welcome which is yours as of right as your home, I bid you again a most hearty, cordial welcome.
Response for the Society.

~I BY C. T. McCAR'I'Y.
Mr. Mayor and Mr. President of the Board of Trade, and Mr. President of the Florida S late Horticultural Society,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It affords me inﬁnite pleasure to be given the opportunity to reply to the glow-
ing and cordial words of welcome to which we havelistened with so much pleas-
ure, uttered by his Honor, the Mayor of the City of Jacksonville, on behalf of its citizens and the President of the Board of
'Trade, representing the great commercial interests of this Metropolis of the great State of Florida. The address of we]-
come of modern times has become an ora-
tion—a poem, and it has been made the occasion for the display of wit and wis-
dom, oratory and rhetoric of some of the most brilliant and far-seeing of our fellow-
countrymen. The responses to the ad-
dresses of welcome have necessarily had to keep pace with the character of the ad-
dresses themselves. This has imposed some hardship upon those who are called upon to respond to these eloquent ad-
dresses of welcome.
Jacksonville is to—day pre-eminently the Convention City of the State. Within her portals she has harbored and entertained during the last year the various Conven-
tions that have represented the great Busi-
ness, Commercial, Horticultural and Agricultural enterprises of the State. In the progress of these Conventions you have developed some trained Orators, in the persons of your magnetic and eloquent Mayor, and your sound and far-sighted President of the Board of Trade. Among the splendid efforts that. they have made in the past, none, we think, exceeds those

glowing speeches to which we have to-
night listened.
Th_e lover, whose eloquent words of en-
dearrnent and encouragement are breath-
ed into the ear of his beloved, tells but little that is new. He repeats the same old,
old story, but it is always fraught with magnetism and poetry for the loved one who hears it. This shall always continue to be the case so long as Humanity shall continue to remain true to those high and holy instincts that have characterized it in the past.
The mother standing on the threshold of the Home, who receives to her bosom the long-absent son, speaks a few broken words of welcome and receives in re-
sponse a few words of gladness and com—
fort, only an interchange of expressions of welcome of the mother and the response from the glowing heart oithe son. In both of these cases the phrases spoken were reduced to the plain, “Thou art wel-
come” and the response that the welcome
“is appreciated and reciprocated,” what-
ever is said means the same.
But in_ the evolution of these civic and fraternal gatherings these addresses of welcome and responses have grown to things of beauty and things of great pro-
portion, and among the various illustra-
tions of such beautiful addresses, those we have listened to to-night stand pre-
eminent. I do not hope to be able to give
ﬁt utterance to the feelings that well up within me in attempting to-night to re-
spond to these eloquent addresses. I can only assure you, Mr. Mayor, and Mr.
President of the Board of Trade, that what my words shall lack in oratory and logic they shall amply make up in sinceri-
ty and cordiality.
This Society in its travels about the State, has visited nearly all of the prin-
cipal cities and towns. We have been to far-off Pensacola; we have been down to beautiful Tampa; we have enjoyed the hospitality of the young and lusty Miami by the Bay of Biscayne; we have dreamed in the historic old St. Augustine, and en-
joyed its hospitality, we have enjoyed our visit to Ocala and Ormond and to many other places and at all of these towns and cities we have listened to glowing words of welcome by their distinguished sons,
and the Mayors of those proud munici-
palities. Our best efforts have been called in play to reply to these words of wel-
comeand show our appreciation of the hospitality extended to us everywhere we have gone. O'n none of these occasions have the words of welcome spoken. been sweeter to us, or more ﬁttingly expressed than at this hour. Your eloquent Mayor is famous throughout the State for his witticisms, his profundity and his elo-
quence. The President of your Board of Trade has in his analytical and business-
like way nobly presented the sentiments of the business element of this fair city who have greeted us to-night.
A few years ago we accepted your hos-
pitality and before the meeting time the
ﬁery demon ran riot through your fair city. The Fire-King added to his trophies the destruction of beautiful Jacksonville.
He added your ﬁre to the history of cele-
brated ﬁres, those of Moscow, Boston and Chicago. In your hour of fallen splendor and buried glory we accepted the hurried invitation of your sister City, St. Augus-
tine. We came as close to Jacksonville as we could _well come and be entertained.
As soon as your recovery permitted, we again accepted your cordial invitation to hold our meeting in your midst. \Nc came—and behold! a new city had arisen.
The spires of your churches and school

houses again pointed heavenward. Mam-
moth business blocks had arisen, adding to your commercial prosperity and your noble river was crowded with the com-
merce of the State, bound for the nations of the earth. Your magniﬁcent railway systems were taxed to their fullest capacity in carrying t0 and from your busy marts the commerce that was to glad-
den you and build up the entire state. We enjoypd on that occasion, and on every other when we accepted your hospitality,
sessions of the greatest success, marking the greatest prosperity in the history of our Society. Your sons and daughters entertained us with excursions, with music, with receptions, with everything that became them and was worthy of the City they represent. We are again your guests. We see all around us new evidences of that prosperity which not only at this time characterizes Jackson-
ville, but the whole State of Florida and the entire South.
Mr. President: In viewing the pros-
perity of this country at large we are prone to forget its real importance. We are likely to overlook the main things that are bringing to pass this commercial and business prosperity. To-day there are two great industrial enterprises on foot that shall stamp their impress upon this country, that shall give it new' impetus. 1
refere to the great Panama enterprise and the extension of the East Coast system of railroad to the distant island of Key West. Of the latter I wish especially to speak and ~in speaking of it I feel that I represent not only the people of the South and the people of the State of Florida, but in a special way,¢he business of the Florida State Horticultural Socie-
ty. It has been well said that, “The his—
tory of a country is the biography of her great men.” In dealing with this im—
m-ensebusinessenterprisetheextensionof railroad facilities to the Island of Key West, we must necessarily consider the part played in it by the Friend and Patron in the development of what was but a few years ago the wilderness known as the East Coast of Florida. That wilderness became the object of attention of one of the great Captains of Industry of the twentieth century. In it he beheld vast possibilities. Actively and indomitably he pushed forward step by step south-
ward until the shores' of the Indian River were reached. Onward, still on-
ward, until beautiful Lake Worth was bound to Jacksonville by ribs of steel.
Here a pause was made until the beauties of the Bay of Biscayne were brought to light by this indomitable developer. Then he pushed forward into the country of the Seminoles, the country of the everglades the faraway tropics of the State. Every-
where palaces of beauty arose. The vari-
ousindustriesofthe sections touchedwere developed. Splendid facilities for trade and commerce were afforded and the East Coast became the Shibboleth of the Home-
seeker, the Tourist for pleasure and those in search of health. And to-day the stu-
pendous announcement is made that this Captain of Industry is determined to link the isolated Key West with the balance of the state and of the nation. At what cost of energy and of capital I dare scarcely guess. That it is one of the most stu-
pendous enterprises of modern times 15
admitted by all, and yet the Wizard of the East Coast, with vision sharpened by experience and with the courage of the man of affairs, and above all with the love for his State which has strengthened with the passing years, is eager to under-
take this great enterprise. A glance at the

map of the State will show the splendid geographical situation of Key West as entrepot of the commerce of the West In-
dies, of South and Central America, and the far-off Paciﬁc Coast via the Panama Canal. It requires no prophet to foresee the prosperity and the development that will follow the completion of this enter-
prise, and that it will be completed, and within the lifetime of its great originator I have no doubt. Where has that brain expended itself for the betterment of a locality, for the accomplishment of a great purpose—and ever failed? On that progressive escutcheon only the word
“SUCCESS” is engraved. In that great heart only sentiments of generosity ﬁnd a lodgment, That ample purse is always open for the development of new 'enter-
prises and the addition of new resources to the commerce and industries and en-
lightenment of the age.
Mr. Chairman: I know not what the generous people of Jacksonville have pro-
vided in the way of entertainmentfor this society, but if the experience of the past is to be the prophecy of the future that entertainment will be ample, delightful and worthy of the guests and of the hosts.
On behalf of the Society I extend to the people of Jacksonville a cordial invita-
tion to attend our sessions,to partake with us in the deliberations that shall come be-
fore our Society. We are here, not alone for entertainment, and pleasure, but for work. In the every-day experiences of the Horticulturist there are problems to solve, questions to answer, that call for the wisdom of all of our members and in the solution of these problems will be found the key to our success. It will afford us extreme pleasure to see as many of the ladies and gentlemen of Jackson-
ville present at our meetings as can con-
veniently attend.
Mr. President, in conclusion I desire to thank most cordially the people of Jack-
sonville through their_ distinguished Mayor, and the business interests of Jack-
sonville, through the President of the Board of Trade, for the cordial welcome they have given us; the words of cheer they have spoken, the high and noble pur-
poses to which they have called us, and when the Session of 1905 shall have pass-
ed into history, we trust that the work done in this meeting. its joys and its pleas-
ures will endure as a memento of the Pros ent and a prophecy of the Future.

it President’s Annual Address.
BY G. L. TABER. \
Members of the Florida State Horticul-
tural Society; Ladies and Gentlemen:
The message that I bring you to-day is of the woods. It is written in the midst of what is, to me, a most interesting thicket, covering an area of some thirty acres, which for seventeen years has been protected from ﬁre. The particular trees under which my impromptu seat is placed are Liquidambars; seventy-ﬁve to ninety feet tall and from eighteen to twenty-four inches in diameter, The four trees that remain of this older generation are the survivors of many protracted and unequal battles. At the ground, their still open wounds bear mute evidence of the ter—
rible onslaught of ﬁre that destroyed their comrades. Higher up, their trunks are covered, for the distance a boy can reach, with healed-over scars, where youngsters of twenty years ago had made incisions for the liquid amber to collect and harden into the prized chewing, or sweetgum—from which the common name of the tree is derived.
Everywhere, individually and in clus-
ters, throughout the basic pines of the thirty acre thicket, is a younger progeny of lusty trees of many species. As is ﬁt-
ting the giant Liquidambars, the largest deciduous tree in this particular thicket,
are rearing up a younger brood and their light green, starry, maple-shaped foliage,
as it glints in the sunshine against the darker background of the pinesy presents an effect no less pleasing than that of the tops of the giant parents as outlined against the sky.
Less than ﬁfty feet from the large Liquidambars, stands another gum but of a different genus—the so-called black or sour gum, Nyssa sylvatica. This is also a stately tree but of a very different habit of growth from the Liquidambars; for while the former send out their branches at an oblique angle and are inclined to climb skyward, the latter sends out branches more nearly at a right angle,
and often clustered, in such a way as to offer the fantastic suggestion that one might cut from the trunk a succession of naturally grown wagon hubs in which the spokes are already set.
A few feet farther on stands an Ameri-
can Holly, the shiny broacl-leaved, spiny-
toothed Ilex opaca. At all seasons of the year, this is a most beautiful tree but par-
ticularly striking during the winter months when its smooth, light colored bark, bright green foliage and abundance of scarlet berries accentuate the fact that the most rigorous winters we ever get in the Southland possess no terrors for it.
In speaking of hollies, this is the species that we naturally associate with the name,
and yet it is much less frequently seen than other species of Ilex—many of which we pass by with but little thought other than that they are graceful shrubs or trees as the case may be. In this thick-
et. there are at least six different species of Ilex, as follows: llex opaca_ as above

pointed, smooth foliage, and which also bears an abundance of yellowish red berries, Ilex verticillata, with smooth but darker colored bark, foliage somewhat serrate, and, as its name indicates, of slen-
der, upright growth. Ilex cassine, found in abundance in this section, around the edges of shallow pondsor bay heads ;rang-
ing in height from three to twenty feet,
and, during the winter, covered with ber-
ries of a color varying from scarlet to red-
dish-yellow. This is the very small-leav-
ed species sometimes called “Yaupon”
and “Ilex vormitoria.” Its leaves are supposed to have a medicinal quality as in-
dicated by the latter not particularly at-
tractive name—or at least attractive, in its signiﬁcance, only to one who might be possessed of a feeling that his stomach was overloaded. Equally in evidence,
handsome shrubs when growing in clumps in congenial situations, are Ilex lucida and Ilex glabra. Some of you may think that nothing possessing the com-
mon name of gall-berry should be men-
tioned among desirable plants; and yet varieties which carry this distasteful name and that come under the above named species are, with their lustrous dark, ever-
green foliage and shining black persistent berries, more attractive as a part of Na-
ture’s handiwork than some of the less thirfty exotics—even if possessed of more euphonious names—with which the average horticultural gardener might be inclined to supplant them.
In further reference to names, I would say that it is not the purpose of this ad-
dress to pick a bone with the champion of either botanical or common names; nor to air any slight amount of knowledge the writer may possess. Common names may be however, in some cases. very inade-
‘
Ilex dahoon with oblong,
quate. For instance, Small gives “Win-
terberry” as the ernacular for three dif-
ferent species of Ilex; the smallest of which, Ilex glabra, reaches a maximum height of about ﬁve feet and the largest,
Ilex verticillata, a maximum height of about twenty feet. We therefore see that in gathering “Winterberries” we may either go to the woods empty handed, or carry along a twenty-foot ladder, accord-
ing to our own interpretation of the name.
On the other hand, gall-berry is not men-
tioned, as a common name, in any botani-
cal description I can ﬁnd although it is a name commonly enough applied to several species of Ilex, including Ilex glabra and Ilex lucida. If we could forever disassociate the name of gall-ber-
ry from the handsomer varieties of some of these species of Ilex it would be equally
' desirable with that of striking the com-
mon, deprecatory name of stinking cedar from the beautiful Torreya taxifolia of the Apalachicola River, or the inappropri-
ate and entirely unauthoritative name of Judas tree from the handsome Cercis canadensis, or Red Bud.
In speaking of shrubs, we must not overlook the cornus or dogwood which,
in its several varieties, is one of the ﬁrst harbingers of spring. Its numeroust clustered small ﬂowers—which present the appearance of one large one—put in their appearance in advance of the foli-
age; as do also those of the handsome pink azalea or wild honeysuckle, the b0—
tanical name of which is Rhododendron nudiﬁorum. Dogwood and pink azaleas are very much in evidence in this par-
ticular thicket and it might be said that the pink azaleas were establishing sub-
thickets of their own.
But if the handsome pink azaleas are colonizing, our beautiful native yellow

jessamine, Gelsimium sempervirens, has .
already colonized; for,'~ running into the fringe of the woodland, it has blanketed the smaller trees without respect to genera or species, and farther on, ﬁnding a com-
paratively open glade, has covered it as with a carpet; although a carpet, it must be confessed, that is badly frayed at the edges and that displays a surprising ten-
dency to climb up anything that would an-
swer for chair or table legs.
Equally at home with the yellow jessa-
mine are the cat briars or sweet briars,
one of which, Smilax Walteri,produces an abundance of coral red berries which, in winter, as they hang from the then in-
conspicuous, leaﬂess vines, give to the trees over which they run, the peculiar effect of having formed a trust and settled amongst their respective genera and species, upon one particular fruit that they will bear. The smilax, of which there are many species, together with wild grapes of the muscadine type, contest with each other and with the yellow jessamine for the honor of most quickly covering up de-
caying or decayed matter as well as the height to which they will climb on any natural growth of trellis-like formation.
I see I have wandered from large trees down to shrubs and vines. Let us return in the same way and, in passing, consider the haws. Of these, the botanists list no less than forty-seven species found grow-
ing wild in this' state, many of which are decidedly worth cultivating, either as in-
dividual specimens or for hedges. In my thicket, I have at least three species, all handsome in ﬂower and leaf. They be-
long to the genus crataegus. It is one of the same family as pyruséto which ap-
ples and pears belong.
Wild huckleberries, or vacciniums, are also very much in evidence and one species of these which assumes large,
shrub-like proportions—often reaching a height of twelve feet—is very beautiful.
This is particularly true when in early spring its delicate pink and white blos-
soms, on slender branchlets, are putting in their appearance in advance of the foli-
age.
The bare mention of early spring brings us back to two different species of prunus. One Prunus angustifolia, our common wild Chickasaw plum, with its abundance of snowy white blossoms; the other, Prunus serotina, our common wild cherry, with its smooth, dark glossy bark and beautiful, shining dark green leaves.
Both of these are amongst the earliest trees to notify us that spring is at hand—-
the wild plum with its blossoms, the wild cherry with its foliage. '
Almost, in the same breath, as far as season of growth is concerned, we notice
ﬂames of scarlet, both isolated and in clusters throughout our woodland.
These are the tiny young leaves and blos-
soms of the scarlet maple, Acer rubrum,
which furnishes a wealth of color during its season of initial spring growth; con-
tinues it during the ripening of its keys, or samaras, and grandly accentuates it again later in the season when it begins to think of disrobing for its winter nap.
Although the sweet gum does not have the gorgeous spring coloring of the scar-
let maple, it vies with it in the fall and both are surpassed, if such a thing is pos-
sible. by the black or sour gum. One writer has said that if the leaves of sweet gum and scarlet maple are ﬁery in their fall redness those of black gum are a con-
ﬂagration. Of this, I have abundant proof for standing by itself just outside this thicket, and in plain sight of my ofﬁce window, a magniﬁcent black gum has, for i.

many successive years, impressed all be-
holders with the magniﬁcence and per-
sistence of its autumn color.
And here I wish to insert a word as to character of growth—and this applies not only to the Nyssas, or gums, but to many other genera—which is that one must bear in mind very closely the environment when he is trying to identify a tree for his own satisfaction or to describe it to the satisfaction of others. The particular black gum just referred to has, for in-
stance, a wide, spreading, well-rounded top with branches that would sweep the ground if, unfortunately, these lower branches did not have to be trimmed, an-
nually, to keep open the road that runs be-
neath it. The gums in the river swamp close at hand send up a sturdy hole for many feet before signs of the ﬁrst decay-
ing or decayed branches give intimation that the foliage,necessary to the tree’slife,
has had to climb higher and still higher after air and sunshine. The crowding of many trees into a space where but one can fulﬁll its allotment of years offers an in-
teresting study in the survival of the ﬁt-
test, as well as the scope allowed by Na,-
ture in the form of growth the surviving species may assume in the struggle.
If through dimness of vision, or ex-
treme height of our supposed black gum,
we are unable to differentiate the foliage from that of the neighboring species, that interlace it, let us use the convenient hatchet we have brought along and cut out a small section of root. This, in the deep mold where alone our tree would have grown tall enough to require such proce-
dure. will not materially injure it and, if we have been correct in our guess, we can take home a section of root so light and corky in character as to be a handy substi-
tute for the bottle stoppers of commerce-
which are made from the bark of a par-
ticular species of oak. If, on the other hand, we should happen to run across a black gum in the open, its branches will be so close to the ground that no hatchet or root will be necessary to identify it; but,
if our quest has been made in the fall, we may then carry home a few quarts of the bluish-black, cherry-like drupe, that is its fruit, and make it into a most excellent jelly. '
But I have strayed from my thicket into the clearing on the one side and into the river swamp on the other. Let us re-
turn and for a few minutes examine the genus to which so many complimen-
tary adjectives have been applied,—
grand. sturdy, time-defying—Quercus,
the oaks. They are here in abundance and, like the Liquidambars, preempting ground in the most lavish. way. The outlines of their respective staked claims are but dimly marked; and here again it will be a case of “might is right” unless some friendly hand decides in favor of one over the other.
\Vhich shall it be; shall we interfere or let them rustle for themselves? And again, if we do interfere, shall we do so without respect to families? Shall we tell Quercus aquatica that he is, and should recognize that he is_ a water oak,
and that it is both indecorous and ungai-
lant to ﬂaunt his ﬂaming spring habili-
ments in the face of his more sedate and more permanently clothed relative, the live oak, Quercus virens, from Virginia?
If we do tell him anything of this sort, let us do it in a kindly way and impress upon him that if he will take time to think it over, he will at least look cooler.
However, perhaps it is best to say noth-
ing but just lie low and await develop-
ments. Our water oak will undoubtedly

I show a hectic ﬂush again in the fall but this may be one of either shame or choler at having to disrobe for the winter. At all events, his choler, if choler it is, will be surpassed by both the sweet gum and the scarlet maple, and all three of them out-
classed in this respect by the black gum‘.
But as even the dwarf, illy-developed sumach seems to vie with its o’ertopping neighbors in this direction, we will as-
sume that they have all merely eaten and drunk to repletion and that the plethora of fullness, as sometimes observed in their two-legged neighbors, shows in their faces,
In this connection, I would say that the formerly accepted theory that highly colored autumn foliage is due to the action of frosts, has of late been widely disputed. Careful investigation seems to show that richness of tint in fall foliage is dependent, to quite a considerable extent at least, on the character of the preceding summer. If the summer and fall have been very dry, only low tints will be shown in the foliage. If wet, high tints will de-
velop.
Still, I know one man, at least, who will dispute the latter theory; the editor of a paper very properly called “Above the Clouds,” printed on top of Mount Wash-
ington, New Hampshire. I had the good fortune to spend an evening with this editor, last summer, in his rocky eyrie,
and he told me that the fall foliage was much more resplendent as seen from the top of the mountain than when viewed from the valley. As his point of vision was from an altitude of considerably over a mile above sea level, and he was there-
fore above the trees, as well as, often,
above the clouds, he was necessarily look-
ing down into the tops of the trees instead of looking up into them like ordinary mortals. It may be that this inverted angle of vision may have a bearing on the subject. I did not think to ask his views on this point. At any rate, he would have seen more of the upper, and more highly colored, side of the foliage than the most of us, and with less intervening shadow to dim its splendor,
But to go back to our thicket and our oaks. Here are not only water oaks and live oaks but the post oak, Quercus minor,
with its beautiful large ﬁve-lobed leaf, and several other species besides, all of which show more difference in individual speci-
mens than a casual observer would give them credit for. And indeed it is an in-,
teresting study to pick out varieties of these or in fact, any species of trees and note the latitude of form that Nature gives to her offspring. We must remem-
ber that botany stops, for the most part,
with species and that beyond these are in-
dividual characteristics as varied in dif-
ferent species of our forest trees as are those in any species of fruit trees like the orange and peach. If these forest species produced edible, merchantable fruit, there would be the same necessity for varietiz~
ing them as there is with the kinds we cul-
tivate in groves and orchards; but as they do not, we simply pass them by with the general remark that such a tree is a live oak, the next a maple,'and so on. without ever really becoming acquainted with. the varietal characteristics of any particular individual of a species.
Here, for instance, is a young sweet gum with comparatively smooth. light colored bark resembling a maple, and with foliage too that, at a little distance, might easily be confounded with that of the maple. The lighter tint of green of the sweet gum’s foliage might, however,
strike us at once and lead us to identify

it as a sweet gum. A little farther on,
we come to another tree, the trunk of which is covered with peculiar, ridged,
corky bark and the smaller limbs and twigs possessed of fantastically winged appendages—the bark apparently fasten-
ed on edgewise—and we immediately know it for a sweet gum.
Take also Ilex opaca, the spiny toothed one known as American holly, and close examination will show well accentuated varietal characteristics in individual speci—
mens, some trees possessing much broad-
er leaves than others and the leaves hav-
ing much longer spines. I have mentioned this particular species not that it is distinct from others in the number of its varietal changes but that the species itself is so distinct as to be, we think, unmistakable.
We had best handle this word unmistak-
able with gloves, however, for its too free and careless use has, before now, gotten many a man into trouble. Indeed it is strange how lacking in astuteneSs some of us can be at times—0r at least I know I can—and following is a case in point;
There is a half acre of comparatively open ground in this thicket where tree growth is much more sparse than any-
where else, and I have wondered, a dozen times, why it (lid not grow up as fast as the rest. But one day, all of a sudden, it
ﬂashed over me that, a few years ago, the man with the mowing machine had been there, appropriating bedding for the mules. Any succulent new tree growth that was mingled with the heavy crop of wire grass was not suﬁicient to make it-
self apparent or to interfere with the mower, and the mowing machine and horse rake had denuded this particu-
lar half-acre of several successive years’ accumulation, which would have,
by this time, turned into a heaVy mold and been recognized as a ready seed bed by the thousands of seeds that wait on proper conditions to develop.
Just now, I am as interested as a boy,
watching development on-that particular half acre. What particular species will
ﬁrst assert itself? The black gums and sweet gums are pushing in from either side. The pink azaleas have thrown out skirmishers. A few scattering pines are holding up their unlighted candles as if awaiting instructions to proceed; and the scarlet maple, which holds its growing tips afiame all summer, in readiness for its fall conﬁagration, is apparently proclaim?
ing “Come on, there is good footing here,
I will lead the way.”
I have not mentioned all the species to be found in my thicket and those named are not necessarily the same as would be produced in other portions of the state.
Nature does not make exact reproduc-
tions of herself over any large given area.
Latitude, longitude, altitude, isothermal lines, soil formations, proximity to bodies of water, large or small, fresh or salt, run-
ning or stagnant; all of these things have a bearing on what we may expect. The point however is that we may not only expect, but look forward with absolute certainty to a reforestation of our denud-
ed lands if we will but keep ﬁre out; and not only to reforestation of the land but enrichment of the soil; for Nature’s forc-
es work continually toward conserving and building up, instead of dissipating,
whenever they are allowed to do so.
This is one application of my thicket story but by no means the only one; and to more fully illustrate the next one, I should like to take you with me, if we had time, just over the fence, across the road and into the borders of the fast run-
ning creek that during the rainy season.

rises to its full river dignity. By follow-
ing the crooks and turns of this creek and up a conﬂuent that runs out of the ham-
mock a few miles away, we should see the most of the species that we left in the thicket and many more besides; innumer-
ably more than the upland pines and low-
land cypress which the traveler over our public highways gives us credit for. Here we should ﬁnd chestnut oaks, with most magniﬁcent, broad, and as their name in-
dicates, chestnut-like foliage; ash of several different species; the magnolia family including both grandiﬂora and the several varieties of bays; horn-beam or iron wood; poplar, myrtle, laurel, birch,
alder, virburnum, farkleberry or sparkle-
berry, elm, several species of gums,includ-
ing the so-called ogeche lime; red cedar,
cabbage palmetto, and other species of trees, shrubs and plants, which in wealth of numbers or beauty of individuality might easily divert us from our search for those named.
And herein lies the broader applica-
tion of my thicket: Notwithstanding its attractions I did not keep myself within its conﬁnes, anymore than you will or can keep yourselves within the conﬁnes of a similar one, after you have become really interested in it. Once one becomes inter-
ested in studying the various tree and plant growths, in all their wonderful varietal characteristics, he will not be con-
tent with any stipulated boundaries, but will wander, as I have, over the fence, into the river swamp and nearby hammock.
The more he investigates the more he will wonder why he himself, or his native town or village, has not drawn more free-
ly on home-grown plants for the purposes of shade and embellishment—plants that are growing at his very door and a hundred times better adapted and more satisfactory than many of the high-priced exotics.
Once having become really interested in the magniﬁcent growths about us, the larger applications follow in rapid,
natural sequence. We will transplant specimens that show natural advantages for the purpose wanted to our own home grounds. We will commence lining the streets that lead by our homes with other equally ﬁne specimens. A little effort will induce others to becOme interested with us and our home village will have its streets lined with trees, and a village improve-
ment association whose ﬁrst thought will be for their welfare. The trees thus planted will themselves exert a salutary and benign inﬂuence, which will show it-
self in many ways. Tin cans and other extraneous, undesirable village adorn-
ments will be relegated to less conspicuous places than formerly and even the profes-
sional village loafer with his perennial jack-knife and dry goods box, will be brought into line with those who have a higher conception of life’s duties—or
_ pleasures.
Civic pride is not hard to enlist and par-
ticularly when that pride reaches out in a direction that is of equal beneﬁt to all;
but one must ﬁrst become enthused him-
self before he starts to enthuse others.
This is a rule that applies to progress in any direction, And I speak from actual experience when I say that if in our re-
spective localities, we demonstrate our tree-planting enthusiasm on our own grounds, we will not ﬁnd it hard to in-
terest others in the same direction. In our own little village, a few of us got to-
gether this year and planted out over 400
shade trees. I_ say few of us because the town itself is small. Not a single man but became immediately interested or soon fell

into line. The trees we used were water oaks, live oaks, maples, sweet gums and wild cherry—all growing wild in this im-
mediate neighborhood. Each street planted was set solid to one or the other of these species. Later on, other streets will be opened up and either set out with these or other species—plenty of which yet remain to be drawn on. In other sec-
tions of the state, other species than those we have used might be preferable. We have them—all of us—in our respective localities. If we are interested we will
ﬁnd out what theygare and, in ﬁnding out surprise ourselves with the quantity and suitableness of the material at hand.
When we have come into contact with Nature’s plants and shrubs and vines in all their lavishness of form and color, and her native trees in all their stateliness and grandeur, and have become not merely superﬁcially acquainted but have, so to speak, established friendly relations with them, as individuals—instead of meeting them as a collection of perfunctorily-in-
troduced and soon-forgotten strangers—
we shall experience a sense of loss in not sooner having come into direct fellowship with them; in not having earlier accepted their proffered, standing invitation of companionship.
Some years ago, I had the good for-
tune to drive through one of the most ma-
jestic avenues of live oaks in this coun-
try—situated at Audubon Park, New Or-
leans. The remembrance of their gran-
deur led me, a short time since, to obtain authentic information in relation to these Oaks. I ﬁnd that there are one hundred of them in the park and that they are now approximately sixty feet high and have an approximate spread of one hundred feet,
with a trunk diameter of four feet or over.
These trees were planted in 1813 by Judge Gayerre and his grandfather, Etienne de Bore. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know anything more about Judge Gayerre and Etienne de Bore than the in-
formation I have conveyed to you. They may have done other deeds for which they should be remembered but I submit to you that for this one deed they deserved, and in its accomplishment unwittingly erected to themselves, monuments, not one but a hundred of them, that will keep their memories green and their names revered.
long after worthy expressions of their vir-
tues in costly stone or marble would have been forgotten,
And so, to summarize, I would say to you, get acquainted with the trees. In doing so, you will derive pleasure and beneﬁt. Protect them from ﬁre; in pro-
tecting them, you will serve your own interests, together with those of the state.
Plant them around your houses and along your highways; throughout the streets of your respective towns and villages. From a purely investment basis it will pay you in enhanced value of property. From the point of personal comfort, they will soon repay you in shade, beauty and compan-
ionship. From a higher, beneﬁcent,
philanthropic standpoint, you will leave an inheritance for which future gene-
rations will bless you.

Reminiscent Remarks.

By Major George K Fairbanks.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I thought it might be of interest to some of you to hear a few reminiscences of one of the oldest citizens of Florida. I came to Florida in r842. At that time there was no settlement on the east coast south of Palatka or south of Micanopy in the central portion of the State. The travel in those days was by stage coach from St.
Augustine through Middle Florida to Pensacola. The stage coach ride to Tal-
lahassee in those days was long and tedi-
ous, and only accomplished by relays, and ,
the best time that could be made was about thirty miles a day, quite a difference in the palatial travel now at thirty miles per hour as a maximum. I remember the I ﬁrst time I ever saw the city of Jackson-
ville, it was a very small place, with four or ﬁve docks on the river front. The mail was brought by boat from St. Augustine by way of Picolata or brought over to St.
Augustine on horseback, twice a week,
and the arrival of the boat was the signal for every man in town to go down to the docks and get the news.
Tampa was in those days a mere ﬁshing village, and Tallahassee a small town.
The principal industry in other than what is known as Middle Florida was the get-
ting out of timber; in Middle Florida the chief crop was cotton. Commerce was carried on by schooner lines to and from New York in the east and New Orleans in the west. In those days the entire popula-
tion of the State did not much exceed the population now claimed for the city 0f Jacksonville. This remarkable develop-
ment of the State within the life-history of one of her citizens is a very impressive matter to reﬂect upon, and I doubt not but that some young citizen now within my hearing will ﬁnd the same degree of de-
velopment shall he live in the State as long as I have, for in my judgment we are to have one of the greatest and most densely populated States in the Union. The question has often been asked, why is it that the State of Florida has developed with such rapidity, especially the city of Jacksonville, with no extensive back coun-
try to support it. This question is easily answered. If_y0u will take your globe or atlas and look the world over, ascertain the peninsulas, you ﬁnd without ex-
ception that the peninsulas contain the most dense populations on the earth, this you will ﬁnd to be true without exception,
take the peninsula of Italy as a notable ex-
ample, and all other peninsulas. The State of Florida you will ﬁnd is a very narrow peninsula compared to a great many of them, and it is my prediction that within the life of many of my hear-

ers they will ﬁnd Jacksonville grown to be a very'large city and the State of F lori-
da to be the most densely populated State in the Union. I say this because we have everything here necessary to sustain a large and dense population, besides the State has now come to be known as the world’s sanitarium.
By George W. Wilson.
After listening to the eloquent address-
es that have been delivered you this even-
ing, I feel unable to add thereto. I hope however to always be able to respond to anything that will be of interest to the'
Florida State Horticultural Society. I congratulate the society upon the large at-
tendance at the opening of this it’s eigh-
teenth annual session. I am not only in sympathy with the great work of this so-
ciety, but I was once an ardent horticul-
turist myself, until varying vicissitudes of life cast my lot in another direction,
that of journalism, during all of which time I have never failed to take advantage of every opportunity to foster and en-
courage your every welfare. I consider the history of the development of this State largely the history of the horticul-
turist; that it is largely due to the en-
deavor and achievement of the Horticul-
tural Society that has given the great State of Florida the renown she to-day enjoys, and as it has justly been said, in your future endeavor and achievement rests in a great degree the name and fame of our State. When I speak in these terms I speak with a great deal of signiﬁ-
cance, for I am informed that nearly 85
per cent of the horticulturists are .college men, you are therefore prepared by ex-
perience, education, and training to cope with the greatest interests for the welfare of the State unhampered by political afﬁliations or hurtful partisan motives.

Report of Committee on Diseases of Citrus.
By P. H. Rolfs.
Wither Tip.
This disease, which manifests itself in so many different ways on citrus fruits,
continued to be exceedingly virulent dur-
ing the past year. The total amount of damage done by this disease was, un-
doubtedly, greater during the last season than any season heretofore.
Work upon it has been prosecuted quite vigorously during the past year, and some new and interesting facts have been brought out. Considerable difﬁculty is encountered from time to time because this trouble is frequently complicated with other disturbances. Any condition of the orchard or of the fruit that low-
ers the vitality renders it more sus-
ceptible to attack from this fungus
(Colletotrichum gloeosporoides), so that many trees and much fruit is found infect-
ed. Though this disease must be con-
sidered a secondary difﬁculty. in many cases, the primary difﬁculty would not have been sufﬁcient to cause the destruc-
tion of the plant or fruit.
Late Rant.
It is a well-known fact that the rust mite causes very considerable russeting of fruit. This may occur either during the early portion of the mid-season, or when the fruit has nearly matured. As a rule.
when the fruit has passed 'mid-season there is very little danger of russeting.
This year, however, many orchards have russeted severely after the fruit had reach-
ed its full size, and in many cases after the fruit had begun to color. Vigorous spraying with the usual remedies for pre-
venting russeting proved of no avail.
This occurred on account of the presence of the wither tip fungus, which produced a form of russeting that in general ap-
pearance resembles the rust mite russeting to a considerable extent, and in many cases is mistaken for it,
This form of russeting can, however, be readily detected by rubbing the hand over
'rthe fruit. When it is due to the rust mite the fruit feels smooth, while when it is due to the wither tip fungus the surface will usually be rough, something like rub-
bing the hand over sandpaper. Not in-
frequently the two forms of disease occur on the same fruit.
Tear 81:51:11.
This peculiar form of russeting mani-
fests itself by streaks running over the fruit from the side that hangs uppermost to the point which is nearest the ground.
The cause of this peculiar form of 1'th-
seting is that somewhere above the fruit a twig occurs which has been infested by the fungus, and which contains the hold-over spores. Whenever sufﬁcient rain or dew occurs to cause a dripping from this disease infected twig onto the fruit, the disseminating spores are liberated from the twig and carried with the rain or dew over the epidermis of the fruit. Many of
‘the spores are left along in diﬁerent places and these produce sufﬁcient irrita-
tion to the epidermis to cause russeting

along in streaks, hence we have the peculiar form of tear staining or tear streaks.
All of the fruits of the citrus family are more or less subject to this trouble. Bit-
ter sweet, sour oranges, sweet seedlings,
kumquats and lemons have been found affected in this way.
Frequently this peculiar form of in-
fection does not injure the keeping quali-
ties of the fruit. Of course this fruit must go to market as russets, and consequently a very material loss in its selling quality is encountered.
Kmquate.
Heretofore it was thought that kum-
quats were quite free from the destructive attack of this disease, but during the pastr year many trees were discovered that had lost as high as 40 per cent. of the fruit.
They were carried off by drops, directly or indirectly induced by this disease. In addition to a number of drops occasioned by the presence of this fungus, a very con-
siderable number of the fruits themselves were infested with the characteristic spot.
This has been described a number of times in various publications, and has been il-
lustrated by photographs before the Horticultural Society, so it will not be taken up again at this point.
Remedy.
All of these investigations, of course,
have for their aim the determination of some practicable remedy. Different lines of treatment were started immediately upon commencing the investigations.
The ﬁrst line that suggested itself was of thoroughly spraying with Bordeaux mix-
ture. This, however, proved to be insuﬂi‘
cient. The most thorough work possible was done upon an orchard of about four-
teen acres in extent, and continued throughout the entire year of 1902. At the end of this time the fungus seemed to have as strong a foothold in the orchard as it had in the beginning of the work.
This seemed to indicate that spraying with Bordeaux mixture was merely sufﬁ-
cient to hold it in check, and not suﬂicient to reduce the diﬂiculty in the orchard.
In 1903 the work of cutting out the diseased twigs was begun. During that season this same orchard was submitted to the treatment with Bordeaux mixture,
and a thorough pruning out of the twigs which had become leaﬂess and had lost their vitality. Before the end of the year this remedy showed itself to be thorcmgh-
ly successful. A more successful treat-
ment could scarcely be expected to be found in any particular line. During the summer of 1904 still further investiga-
tions were made as to the best time for cutting out the diseased twigs by divid-
ing the orchard of some twenty acres in extent, into six different plots. These dif-
ferent plots were subjected to treatment at different seasons of the year. From the experiments here we deduced the follow-
ing facts: That the ﬁrst time of the year for pruning is during the winter, just be-
fore the spring growth occurs, which is some time before the ﬁrst of February,
and a second pruning is usually necessary.
In the grove under experimentation it was found that the plot N0. 4, which was -
pruned during July, that the remedy was as successful as where pruning had occurred earlier. In plot No. 6, where the pruning had not occurred until August, the increase in the amount of the wither tip disease was so severely marked that the point to which the pruning had been carried in July could be seen to the row.
As a general rule we would say then

that the proper line of treatment would be: First prune out all dead wood, or wood of low vitality, during January and then again during July. Second, spray thoroughly with Bordeaux mixture im-
mediately after each pruning.
This will, in a great measure, reduce the amount of fungus in the grove, and so very materially reduce the danger of infection.
It may, however, be found necessary in the fall, when the fruit begins to ripen, to protect this against the characteristic Anthracnosc spot. This has been done repeatedly last year in orchards of vary-
ing size, from a few acres to twelve acres in extent. These characteristic spots do not occur until the fruit has practically matured, then they make their appearance,
ﬁrst about the size of a pinhead, from this they gradually enlarge until a consider-
able portion of the fruit is involved. At the ﬁrst appearance of the spots the fruit should be sprayed thoroughly with an ammoniacal solution of copper carbonate.
If treatment has been delayed until the fruit has begun to drop off severely, it will take about two or three weeks to notice any perceptible diminution of the drop-
ping. From that time. however, the sprayed trees show from 25 to 75 per cent reduction in the amount of the drops, and also show a similar amount of diminution in the spread of this spotting.
Foot Rot.
The past year, for some reason, seems to have been one in which this disease has been making its presence felt in many groves that previously had not been at all troubled by it., Just why this condition should occur is difﬁcult to explain. We know, however, that many people whose groves have heretofore enjoyed freedom from this trouble have this year found themselves in a position to enquire diligently for the best remedies. The remedy for this given by Mr. Waite a year ago is about the best that can be used.
On page 53, of Report for 1904, Mr.
Waite gives his formula for making the antiseptic wash, as one part sulphur and -
two parts of land plaster, or air slacked lime. Then this is made into a thick bat-
ter by addition of water, and then painted on the tree, the soil having been removed from around the crown so as to permit a ready application of the remedy. Other remedies are also successful in keeping down this trouble. The one essential feat-
ure in all remedies is that of removing the soil from around the crown and exposing the diseased area to the sun if possible, or where the limbs shade the trees too much,
exposing it to the air. In some cases it has been found sufﬁcient to expose the crown of the roots to the air. However, it is better not to take any chance, but to apply some antiseptic treatment, either that suggested by Mr. Waite, or a solu_
tion of one part of crude carbolic acid to two parts of water, then cutting away the diseased patch and applying the antiseptic wash to the area exposed.
Blight.
!'
This old disease is still with us, and will probably stay with us as long as citrus growing is carriedon in Florida. The studies upon it, and investigations in con-
nection with it have been pushed as rapidly and as extensively as possible.
The members of the Horticultural Society will realize that an immense amount of work has to be done on the study of this disease, and that observations conﬁned to one section or one grove would scarcely be sufﬁcient, When we remember that blight rarely, or

never, occurs on trees under six years of age, and that the possibility of infection occurs at the time of setting the tree out,
it is readily seen that to prove any particu-
lar theory in regard to the matter will re-
quire years of awiting. I am, however,
more hopeful of ﬁnding a practicable remedy for thisdisease than I have been at any time previous to this. Just what the line of treatment may be, and just what precautionary measures must be taken, I am yet unprepared to say. I may,
however, be permitted to say that the in-
vestigations inprogress are indicative of
ﬁnally securing a favorable and practic-
able remedy.
Scaly Bark of Orange Trees.
This diseasegf the orange tree has been reported quite a number of times in the last three or four years, and specimens have been sent a time or two very recently.
The name describes the disease fairly well. An attack of this disease causes the bark to peel off and look very shaggy and Report by Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
My ﬁrst recollection of the war between man and the insect enemies of the orange was about twenty-ﬁve years ago. My father came to Florida from Pennsylvania in June 1878 and set the ﬁrst tree the fol-
lowing winter and a very short time after that the ﬁght commenced. I recall seeing.
boxes of \Vhale Oil Soap in the barn and seeing the wash-boiler full of water and tobacco stems boiling on the kitchen stove.
Don’t you know, friends, that my mother was a good-natured woman to stand that?
scaly. This, of course, is very unusual for citrus trees, and consequently is noticed at once. When anything of this kind occurs on the young-
er limbs the disease causes round-
ish or oblong brownish blotches,
varying in size from one-fourth of an inch long to sometimes three or four inches long. Mrs. Flora W. Patterson,
Mycologist in the Department of Agricul-
ture, has identiﬁed the fungus as belong—
ing to the genus Hysterog'raphium.
As yet we know no convenient and practicable remedy, consequently where it occurs on the small twigs of the tree the orange grower will ﬁnd it prudent to cut out the disease and burn it.
Mention is made of this disease in this place to keep people on the lookout for the trouble, and so cut oFf its ravages in its incipiency. It very frequently occurs that a most innocent looking species causes a very considerable damage. As yet no serious consequences have fol-
lowed an attack of this disease.
J. J.Beers.
When the stock solution was ready, a jug full was taken to the grove and, while a boy carried water from a nearby pond or lake, my father added a little of the stock from the jug and on his knees with a scrubbing brush washed the bodies and even the faces and hands of the little trees.
He soon discovered,however, that thebark on the trees was getting hard and the trees stunted and in casting about for a better method, found a brass syringe, holding about a quart, with ﬁne holes for an out-
let, with which the trees were sprayed.

J Next came a little hand spray pump.
With these pumps half a dozen men sprayed the trees from pails, while a horse hauled barrels of water from some con-
venient lake. What was used for an in-
secticide at this time, I do not know, but I remember seeing them churn “kerosene butter” with these little pumps and it was made of kerosene oil and “Eagle Brand”
condensed milk.
All this ﬁghting appeared to do no good and the scale was still there. although I am not prepared to say that the spraying was properly done, or done at the proper time, for spraying orange trees was a comparatively new thing at that time.
In 1884 I was sent away to school and when I returned three years later, I found that father had gotten up the rig which I am now using. This is a four—wheeled wagon, with a three barrel tank and a force pump geared to one hind wheel of the wagon. This throws a strong spray and I spray from ﬁve to twenty-ﬁve acres per day with one hose.
Our main ﬁght is against the rust mite and we use the sulphur solution. but when we spray regularly for that we have never been troubled with scale, except one of the wax scales which cause “smut” and this is always killed with one- application of double strength.
We start spraying the ﬁrst of May and spray the ﬁrst of every month for ﬁve months and the result, until last season,
has been clean, healthy trees and bright fruit. Last spring we had purple mite enough to damage the trees and drop a large part of the fruit, therefore about the ﬁrst of January of this year, seeing the mite starting again, we sprayed once and intended to continue it to keep them in check, but have found it unnecessary.
The spraying destroyed a large per cent of the mites and this, followed by the cold of January 25th and later by an unusual amount of rain, has almost destroyed the mite.
One of the ﬁnest groves in our section,
well known as the “Pet Grove,” property of Mr. J. P. Felt, is greatly damaged by what appears to be “foot-rot.” We have many groves here which, like this one, are budded on sweet stock. In this grove a part of the bank was allowed to remain for two or three years, so that the earth close to the tree was six to ten inches above the natural collar even through the sum-
mer and I have no doubt that this was the cause of the “foot-rot.” Mr. Felt is hav-
ing this earth removed now and the trees will probably not be banked next winter to give them a chance to hEal.
Grape fruit trees have been damaged some by scab and the fruit made unﬁt for market. Spraying with Bordeaux Mix-
ture appears to entirely prevent this, as trees badly affected two years ago were sprayed last spring and last season pro-
duced ﬁne fruit and the new growth was free from disease.
My idea of combating diseases of trees is, ﬁrst to prevent it if possible; then, if it appears, cure it if you can. Study the re-
quirements of the trees and make the con-
ditions suitable as far as possible and above all give them plenty of food of the very best quality, then watch your trees closely and be ready to meet trouble when it comes.

34 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Report of A. B. Harrington.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I conﬁne myself to my ‘own locality and citrus trees only.
There has been nothing new to develop during the last year, therefore shall have to go to our subject in a way that many of us are already familiar with.
We are beyond the worry of the com-
mon scale, as this is easily kept under by use of fertilizer and an occasional spray-
ing with Hammonds Thrip Juice. This is the best, cheapest, and most convenient to use of anything in my experience for scale. '-
It is usual to have a visit of the Red Spider during the Spring months.
The Rust Mite is nearly ever present.
For these insects I use the Sulphur spray. I have used the sulphur and Thrip Juice mixed and the combination seems to give equal results as when used separate-
ly.
The rust mite is the worst of all our troubles, causing more expense and time than all other insects and diseases com-
bined,
I do not believe it is possible to have ten percent bright fruit without spraying;
but by being presistent, observing care—
fully the conditions and following it up each year,we' have about ninety percent bright fruit. As proof of this, trees, that have never been sprayed, (a few miles distant and all other conditions apparent-
ly similar,) have scarcely any bright fruit,
so little that no attempt is made to classi-
fy or grade it and it is marketed from the trees without grading. These groves that are badly infested with Rust Mite seem to produce fruit one or two sizes smaller than do the groves thoroughly sprayed. The White Fly, I am thankful to say, has not appeared here.
As to disease, we have none. While we have some insects that cause us trouble, I do not think there is as yet a disease‘ of any description in our locality,
Die back shows up occasionally but this is a condition rather than a disease, as I took upon it. There seemed to be some confusion on this subject of die back last year. My own experience is such that I am conﬁdent it is not so very easy to overcome. I have read where treatment showed an improvement in a few days and a cure in a few weeks or months. Trees can be helped in a year but I say three years is required for a cure if the case is anything bad.
My views are to thoroughly under-
stand your soil and fertilizer, as this is where the complete recovery is to start from. Much beneﬁt is obtained by the use of Bordeaux.
I have not tried the insertion of Blue Stone myself but have observed good re-
sults where others have used this method of treatment. An orange tree will exist under the most adverse circumstances yet to grow and produce well, paying a proﬁt each year to the owner, requires care,
cultivation, and fertilizer.
I use for applying spray, a good hand power pump, a double line of hose, requir-
ing, three men and a pair of mules to run

the outﬁt. It depends very much on the size of the grove as to what the investment in machinery should be. Begin with a bag of fertilizer and a hoe increasing with the number of trees.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, it seems that some legislation is at present pending at Tallahassee on the white ﬂy and insects.
A copy of the pending bill has been called for but it appears that none of the mem-
bers have it, nor have many of them seen what the measure is. I am not personally interested in the white ﬂy, as it has not yet appeared with us, but I am deeply inter-
ested in behalf of the society in this pest and believe that if something is not done to stop its ravage the state will be over-
run. However, we should be careful as to what character of measure is enacted.
We should see that it shall be a measure as will not work a burden or hardship upon the growers. Yet, I conceive it to be essential that some measure be enacted that will control the ravages of the white
ﬂy.
Dr. Richardson—I heartily concur in the remarks of Mr. Blackman. The white
ﬂy is a most destructive, pernicious pest,
still we should carefully watch any meas-
ure of legislation that is proposed, and should not endorse here any measure to be enacted unless we know what that measure is. It has been said that the the measure purports to provide that if the grower does not com—
ply with the law that his proper-
ty shall be taken in charge by the county commissioners and the ex-
pense 0f dislodging the white ﬂy taxed upon it by the county. This would in my judgment be very unwise and would work a hardship in many instances to a groer who was ﬁnancially unable to protect his property and who was wholly irresponsi-
ble for the introduction of the pest upon his property. It is well known that the white ﬂy infests not only grove trees, but other trees, and shrubbery as well,
especially hammock growths, and if we are going to legislate we ought ﬁrst to legislate them out of the swamp before we tax the property of the grower for dis-
lodging it from the grove property. I think this matter should go to our legis-
lative committee with power to act in the premises, and with plenty of time to look into remedial measures of legislation.
This is a very important matter and should receive the very best consideration,
in all of its phases and in its operation after enactment, before we give it an endorsement upon the ﬂoor of this so-
ciety. .
Dr. Kerr—This is a very important matter touching the interest of every grower in the State. It should in my judgment go to our legislative committee,
who should be g‘Yanted plenty of time in the premises, bringing in its repo'rt to this society for further consideration.
Mr. Gillett—Mr. President, as a mem-
ber of the legislative committee I agree with the gentlemen who have preceded me on this subject. I think the matter should go to the legislative committee and that it should have plenty of time to act in the premises. I have had some experience in formulating measures for enactment into laws and it requires time to 190k carer”
into proposed measures of this kind. to calculate the eFfect of the operation of the law upon its enactment, comparing and weighing similar measures in other States,
so as to get the greatest good to the great-
est number as far as we can.
The President—The matter of this

preventative measure against the ravages of the white fly will go to the legislative committee with power to act. If any enactment is to be had at the present ses-
sion of the legislature, no doubt the special legislative committee, which has been heretofore appointed at this session, will be of service to the committee in this re-
gard.
COTTON BUG.
Dr. Richardson—I have been very much interested in these papers. I desire to call the attention of the society to an insect that I have so far been unable to
ﬁnd in any of our society literature,
scientiﬁc or otherwise. He is a bug and is, I have lately learned,
known to the cotton planter as the cotton bug—and if any of you have never met him, I hope you never may.
In markings and color he is beautiful,
brown, green,red and gold with a diamond in the center of his back, his shape is some—
thing like a common pumpkin bug but not so large. In numbers and rapacity he is a devastator. His appearance is sudden. I
ﬁrst met him in about 1892 I think it was,
with very disastrous results as I lost some
10,000 or 12,000boxes of oranges through his depredations in the course of a few days’ time. I thought, as he had not ap-
peared again, that I was free from his kind, and had nearly forgotten all about him until last fall, when my manager tele-
phoned me he had found a strange bug on my tangerines. I went over and found the ground. the fruit and trees literally cover-
ed with the bugs so thickly in fact that you could scarcely see the fruit—there were millions of them—and I lost probably
40 or 50 boxes of tangerines. Having met him before, I determined upon heroic ef-
forts to get rid . of him. After trying almost every insecticide known without success, I ﬁnally made a carbolinium whale oil soap mixture, rather as an experiment than anything else, knowing the virtue of the carbolinium on account of the percent-
age of carbolic acid it contains. The mix-
ture or emulsion was made of one quart of carbolinium to seven pounds of whale oil soap boiled and stirred into three gallons of water, pouring the same into about
ﬁfty gallons of water, making a solution with which I sprayed the fruit and leaves.
To my agreeable surprise this completely routed and destroyed Mr. Cotton Bug. I mention this for what it may be worth.
Mr. McCarty.—The gentleman’s expe-
rience is very interesting and valuable.
The bug he has described, is what is known as “the common cotton stainer.
They are a very proliﬁc pest, but I think Dr. Richardson might modify his numbers to myriads instead of millions. The thanks of the society are due the doctor for his solution, the component parts of which the society will in all probability proﬁt by remembering.
Dr. Richardson—Myriads may be all right, but anyone having experience with cotton bugs will agree to millions. Mod-
ern scientists tell us that microbes repro-
duce by binary division at the rate of sixteeen or more millions from a single specimen in twenty-four hours. The cot-
ton bug will in the old-fashioned way of egg and hatching, it almost seems, do pretty nearly as well. I have a neighbor who examined his grove in the morning and found not a bug, but at four o’clock in the afternoon his large seedling trees were covered with them, and by the next day he had lost some four or ﬁve thousand boxes. This was Mr. Rogers, of Suther-
lad.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. Boggs—The discussion in regard to insects reminds me of an experience I had a year or so ago with grasshoppers.
It is well known that the grasshopper or locust in numbers is very voracious and on occasions he will attack a fruit tree as quickly as he will grass. Finding myself menaced by grasshoppers in such numbers as to cause some alarm, I wrote to Wash-
ington for a culture which had been ex-
perimented with for the extermination of the hopper. Receiving the same, I took an old darkey out with me to catch some of the hoppers, dip them and let them go on this way of self-destruction,
as well as that of their ilk. After this per-
formance was over, and we had dipped I suppose some 200 hoppers, I noticed the darkey in deep meditation. Finally he said to me:
“Boss. is yer after killing dem hop-
pers ?”
I assured him that was the desired end,
he then said:
"\Vell, boss, why didn’t yer mash dem we kotched instead of dippin em and turn-
in’ ’em loose? (Laughten)
I was never annoyed to such great extent after the experiment, and think it was of some beneﬁt. I am informed that the Department at \Vashington has several cultures and that this was not what is con-
sidered by the department the best. I do not think the experiments, however, have proved entirely satisfactory. though to some degree helpful. I will here also say that the Department of Agriculture is also extensively engaged in the study of insect extermination by fungus. These fungus experiments have proved very satisfactory in a great many instances. While it is not claimed for the fungus process that it is a total eradicator br exterminator, it has proved to be of positive beneﬁt. ‘
, 37
Mr. McCarty—I have followed the ex-
perimentation reports of the fungus pro-
cess of extermination of insects for several years with a great deal of interest, and I am always glad to hear anything concern-
ing it. It seems to me that it has already proven to be of great assistance, and I trust scientiﬁc research and experiment will further demonstrate its value as against spraying, which is always ac-
companied with more or less deleterious effects, unless the utmost precaution is ob-
served and followed. I believe there are many instances in which great harm has been done by ill advised spraying, which occurs both ways. sometimes through the strength and character of the solution,
as well as the age and condition of the tree and fruit at times of application.
Mr. Hampton—I have been very much interested in these discussions upon insect extermination and especially with refer-
ence to the cotton stainer. I ﬁrst met the cotton stainer in 1897 and for the past several years I have seen him occasionally.
In numbers he is. voracious and devastat-
ing, he is a sucker, and usually when you
ﬁnd him you have got to do something so quick that he has gotten through with his business before you get your solution mixed. I have never been able to ﬁnd anything to kill him, and my previous ef-
forts to get a preparation which would kill him were ineffectual for the reason that not knowing anything myself that would kill him off, I had to write to some one for information, and by the time I could get a reply to my inquiry he had ﬁnished up his business and gone. I am sure the society is much indebted to Dr. Richardson for his experiment in this direction and that they will proﬁt by it should this pest show up upon their premises.
Mr, Hart—I do not think sufﬁcient at-

tention has been paid to blight, I am very much interested in the solution of the question of blight. Being desirous of see-
ing an effective remedy for this tree disease, I offer the following resolutions which I trust the society may see ﬁt to adopt The resolutions were adopted and are as follows:
, WHEREAS, The orange growers of Florida are annually suffering the loss of many thousands of dollars in the reduc-
tion of their fruit crop and still more in the market value of their groves'thropgh a disease known as orange tree blight,
which usually selects the largest and most productive trees for attack; and WHEREAS, Though the desease has been carefully studied for'many years by very able Department experts. it is not yet well enough known to allow of its positive identiﬁcation, in many cases, before the second or third year after its appearance,
while investigations pretty surely prove that the disease is contagious, which makes each diseased tree a nucleus from which it is carried to others when caring for or working the grove; and WHEREAS, Progress has been made that encourages the belief that if ad-
ditional help with special ﬁtness can be sent here and allowed to devote their whole time to assisting in this select work,
we have reason to hope that the cause may be found for it; therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the Secretary of this society be instructed to correspond with the Florida Representatives in Washing-
ton and earnestly request them to call upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon.
Wilson. and urge upon him the import—
ance of this work and the pressing need that we feel for further assitance from his Department. Be it further RESOLVED, That each member of this society exert his or her influence as an in-
dividual to secure increased appropriation for this work and its more vigorous prose-
cution.
Member—If I am correctly in-
formed, and I believe I am, the Department of Agriculture at Wash-
ington has always been able, ready and willing to lend any assistance within the power of the government to promote the interests of like societies in the various States, in never-ceasing scien-
tiﬁc experiments to exterminate insects and eradicate disease from useful plant life. I think it all comes under the generic head of forestry preservation. However that may be, I know that the National Government has always met the various States half way in the matter of expense in this direction, that wherever the State will spend a dollar the Government will spend one in intelligent effort to this end,
it therefore seems to me, Mr, President,
that we should have the beneﬁt of this National aid in this State, in order that the horticulturist of this State may have the beneﬁt of all blight preventatives, the
. culture spore and fungus processes, scien-
tiﬁc spraying as well as all known scien-
tiﬁc research to sto the ravages of these diseases and insects of whatever kind. I trust that our legislative committee will hold this matter in mind and use their best endeavor to secure for the State her pro-
rata share of this experimental scientiﬁc work.
The President—The remarks of the member are timelypthe chair has no doubt the special legislative committee will take the matter in charge and secure for the State these considerations.

A Steam Boiling Plant for Insecticides.
ByPLAGosear-d.
Where the lime-salt-sulphur wash, bi-
sulphide of lime, resin spray, or any in-
secticide requiring prolonged cooking is needed the most economical method of preparation is by boiling with steam. I prepared the accompanying diagram by combining the best features of two or three different Ohio boiling plants. By courtesy of the Ohio Experiment Sta-
tion I give it to the Florida horticultur-
ists before having used it in our own pub-
lications.
A is a water tank into which water is raised by wind or steam power. In the plant from which the diagram was taken it is a I , 500 gallon tank of galvanized iron, sitting on the up-
per or haymow ﬂoor of the barn,
and water is pumped into it through the water pipe x by means of a windmill.
The stopcock b is closed when the tank is full. A is a faucet from which cold water is drawn at will to meet the miscellaneous needs of farm and household. D is the boiler reservoir and, being connected with A by means of the water-pipe X is kept ﬁlled. In the plant represented, the boiler reservoir was a galvanized iron cylinder, perhaps eight feet high and one foot in diameter. having a capacity of nearly 50 gallons. It was a discarded gas chamber, having once beerupart of a gas supply plant. Its bottom end sets just a few inches behind the boiler so that the water is kept moderately warm and can be safety turned into the boiler without ad-
ditional heating. H is the boiler, the pipes w leading from it, being steam pipes. The stopcock v opens and closes a pipe leading from the reservoir D into the boiler H.
When it is desired to ﬁll the boiler with water, the stopcocks v and u are both opened; the steam, passing through u into the top of the reservoir D, forces the water through v into the boiler H, doing away with the need of an injector. The steam in D soon condenses and water is drawn into the reservoir through x to ﬁll the vacuum which would otherwise be pro-
duced. V is a platform upon which sets the hot water tank B and the boiling cask X. B may be of either iron or wood, like-
wise X. In the plant diagramed, X rep-
resents a 50 gallon barrel and B a 100 gal-
lon galvanized iron- tank. Opening the faucet c ﬁlls the tank B with water; open-
ing the stopcock d lets steam into the water, which escapes through the three openings at m. On the opposite side of the arm at r. are three openings, letting out steam in an opposite direction, thus set-
ting the water in a whirl. l is a faucet from which warm water may be drawn at pleasure. h is a stopcock letting the water into the diluting tank 0, which sets on the platform I. By opening the stopcock e,
steam is conducted into the boiling cask X where it escapes through three openings at n and three on the opposite side of the other arm at 0. This arrangement gives constant agitation or whirling during the cooking process. g is a stopcock to let the boiled product into the diluting tank O.
g must be located as close as possible to

the boiling cask G, otherwise the pipe will be sure to clog with sediment in cooking lime and sulphur together. The pipe or hose on which g is located should not be less than one and one-half inches in diam-
eter. The stopcock k closes the pipe conducting the diluted spray into the tank on the spray-wagon. f is a stopcock ad-
mitting steam to the diluting tank for the purpose of keeping it warm. y and t are the oriﬁces through which steam escapes and are arranged like thOSe in the other tanks.
The diluting tank 0 is not an absolute necessity, since B may be used for the same purpose.
Report of Committee on Citrus.
E. E. Hubbard, Chairman.
Previous reports of this standing Com-
mittee have pretty well threshed out the questions of commercial varieties, prop-
agation, fertilization and culture, but there is still room for improvement in varieties, especially of early oranges, and I have thought it well on this occasion to review the work and conclusions of some of the foremost plant propagators of the country, with the view of stimulating ob-
servation, selection and improvement of varieties by every intelligent fruit grower.
As all know, the U. S. Department of Ag-
riculture is working to develop early,
hardy, oranges from hybrids and in this connection I will quote from Luther Bur-
bank the foremost living authority on hybrids and crosses:
“The main object of crossing genera,
species or varieties is to combine various individual tendencies, thus producing a state of perturbation or partial antagonism by which these tendencies are, in later generations, dissociated and recombined in new proportions, which gives the breed-
er a wider ﬁeld for selection; but this opens a much more difﬁcult one—the selection and ﬁxing of the desired new types from the mass of heterogeneous tendencies produced, for by crossing, bad traits as well as good are always brought forth. The results now secured by the breeder will be in proportion to the ac-
curacy and intensity of selection, and the length of time they are applied. By this means the best of fruits, grains, nuts and
ﬂowers are capable of still further im-
provements in ways which to the thought-
less often seem unnecessary, irrelevant or impossible.”
“The plant breeder before making com-
binations should with greatcare select the individual plants which seem best adapted to his purpose, as by this course many years of experiment and much needless expense will be avoided. The difference in the individuals which the plant breeder has to work upon are sometimes extremely slight. The ordinary unpracticed person cannot by any possibility discover the ex-

ceedingly minute variations in form, size color, fragrance, precocity and a thousand other characters which the practiced breeder perceives by a lightning like glance. The work is not easy, requiring an exceedingly keen perception of minute differences, great practice, and extreme care in treating the organisms operated upon, and even with all the naturally acquired variations added to those secured -
by scientiﬁc crossing and numerous other .
means the careful accumulation of slight individual differences through many generations is imperative after which sev-
eral generations are often but not always necessary to thoroughly “ﬁx” the desired type for all practical purposes.
The above applies to Annuals. or those plants reproduced by seed. The breeder of plants which can be reproduced by div-
ision has great advantage, for any valuable individual variation can be multiplied to any extent desired without the extreme care necessary in ﬁxing by linear breeding the one which must be reproduced by seed.
But even in breeding perennials the ﬁrst deviations from the original form are often unappreciable to the perception, but by accumulating the most minute dif-
ferences through many generations the deviation from the original form is often astounding.”
“By crossing different species we can form more variations and mutations in half a dozen generations than will be de-
veloped by ordinary variation in a hun-
dred or even a thousand generations.
The evolution of species is largely depend-
ent on crossing the variations contained within it. Forms too closely bred soon run out, because generally only by cross-
ing does variation appear.
It is of great advantage to have the parents a certain distance apart in their hereditary tendencies. If too close to-
gether, there is not range enough of varie-
ty. If too far apart the developed forms are unﬁtted for existence because too un-
stable. Radical changes of environment for a series of generations will produce a tendency to sport, but hybridization will bring it about far more abruptly and for practical plant or animal breeding or for scientiﬁc study of all these variations. far more satisfactorily.”
Mr. Burbank asserts there is a close analogy between hybridization and graft-
ing. An instance is cited ill which Prlmus myrobalana Var. Pissardi was imported from France and grafted on the Kelsey plum, a variety of Prunus Triflom. The graft did not bloom, but its presence on the tree brought about a cross between the two species. Many hundred descendants of this cross are now living, .
These remarks of Mr. Burbank's on other plants show how slow and difﬁcult will be the processeof developing early and hardy oranges from hybrids and crosses. The chances are very small of anything of market merit in the ﬁrst seed-
lings and selective crosses of the improved hybrids and testing of hundreds and even thousands of their Successive offspring may be necessary before the object is achieved.
I therefore turn to the work of another Californian whose work was described some time ago in the “Citrograph” in part as follows;
“It has long been the popular feeling that the Washington navel orange is
“good enough." Consequently when Mr.
A. C. Thomson, of Duarte, announced his Improved Navel there were many who doubted such a possibility. And when he told the modus operandi of its origin the doubters said “Oh, be!" To produce a

new hybrid by splitting buds and inserting a half bud each of two varieties in the slit sounds implausible; and yet that is just what this ingenious Scotchman says he did.
There is a diversity of opinion as to the merits of Thomson’s Improved Navel, but all who are acquainted with it frankly con-
cede that it is a distinct variety. The manner of its coming is immaterial,
although there is no good reason for doubt-
ing the narrative of its sponsor. Having placed the new orange in the race with its progenitors, both as regards earliness and quality, it occurred to Mr. Thomson that the next thing to be desired Was a late navel—one which should lengthen the navel season even unto the coming of the Valencia. With this important possibility in mind our Scotchman again split buds taking them from the Improved Navel and the Late Valenicia. During a visit to his place recently he told me of the pro-
cess and the diﬁiculﬁes involved. In the majority of cases the buds live and start,
each half sends out an independent shoot,
and not simultaneously. In other instances, even when starting at the same time, they fail to unite properly in a perfect shoot or stem. As proof that even a perfect union is not necessarily produc-
tive of an improved fruit, Mr. Thomson showed me a freak tree, with long curved leaves in which olive green and white seemed struggling for control. The few oranges on it were ribbed from stem to blossom end and were scarcely edible. Out of the many buds inserted in conjugal fashion from the Improved Navel and Late Valencia there came one tree which,
as it stood in the nursery row, showed dis-
tinct characteristics and habits of growth.
Mr. Thomson relates that Alexander Craw visited his place at this time, and,
being told that there was a tree of a new variety in the nursery, he went in and pointed it out. In due season it was set out in the orchard, where it now stands in one of two rows of its kind, these two rows of Navelencia extending through an orchard of Thomson’s Improved Na-
vels of the same age. The Navelencia trees average about a foot higher than the Im-
proved Navels. In the half-dozen years since it ﬁrst fruited, it has become the par-
ent of many trees, its progeny including the two rows in which it stands, as well as orchards and individual trees in nearly every orange growing section throughout the world.” -“As regards lateness, it should be stated that the conditions of the fruit on the young trees about Highland and Redlands indicates that in this climate it promises to partially make good Mr.
Thomson’s original claim and to length-
en the navel season by at least a few weeks.” As further evidence of the feasibility of split bud grafting I will quote from an address delivered by Pro—
fessor N. F. Murray before the annual meeting of the Kansas Horticultural So-
ciety:
“Several years ago we began to experi-
ment in hybrid grafting. \Ne worked on apple, pear, and plum, root-grafting in the usual manner, except we cut out all the buds from the scion to be grafted, then split from end to end and with a sharp knife cut through the center of the top bud. Then taking two half scions of two different varieties we spliced them to-
gether, knowing full well that the desired union or cross of the two varieties must be accomplished by a union of the two buds.
In part of our work we simply split the buds, always using a very sharp knife and a magnifying glass, and taking great care and pains, wrapping with ﬁne thread and

then waxing. We operated on in this way, making quite a number of apple,
pear, and plum. In the apple we used Ben Davis as a foundation and to this variety we united Johnathan, Wine sap and Grime’s Golden, our object being to infuse better quality into the Ben Davis. We planted all with care and watched results,
eight per cent grew, and from the ap-
pearance of the leaves we think we have at least three crosses out of 100 in the apple and we are awaiting their fruiting with interest. We are much encouraged from the fact that one plum tree out of twenty, crossed with Wild Goose and Abundance, fruited last year and shows a hybrid, or cross between the two.
We shall continue our experiment. feel-
ing conﬁdent that in hybrid grafting and budding we have the means to greatly im-
prove our ﬁne fruits, ﬂowers, and shrubs.
we shall select our scions and buds only from the most healthy and vigorous trees and plants and those that produce the larg-
est and best fruit. Our ﬁne American herds have been brought up to their pres-
ent high standard by the most careful selecting and breeding for generations.
We believe that in a similar manner our American horticulture must be improved.”
I think it will also be of interest to con-
sider the experience of Mr. O. W. Black-
nall of Kittrell, N. C., with natural varia-
tions of fruits. He says: “I will give my experience as to variation during the past forty years of three well known fruits,
those are the Winesap apple. the Scupper-
nong grape, and the Wilson’s Albany strawberry. Forty years ago the‘Wine-
sap apples grown in this neighborhood were comparatively uniform in size and'
color. Since then a great many trees have been brought in and planted from widely separated nurseries in ditferentparts of the United States. The result has been a wide variation in the size and color of the fruit;
probably this variation has extended to the ﬂavor and also to the shape of the ap-
ple. But of this I am not sure. I am only stating what I know to be positively true. Then as to the Scuppernong grape:
A very few if any Scuppernong grape vines have ever been brought into this neighborhood. It is fairly certain that nearly if not all, of the many vines now fruiting have originated from a few old vines growing in the neighborhood time out of mind, many of them certainly a cen-
tury old. Still there is a variation in the size, quality, and time of ripening of the fruit of different vines which is most strik_
ing. Some bear fruit fully twice as large as others and that when growing side by side, some have thick hulls, and some thin,
some ripen at the beginning of September and some not till the last of October. Now it is barely possible, that the most dis-
similar vines may be seedlings. But this is extremely improbable, as according to my experience when the Scuppernong seed is planted it reverts to the black grape similar to the Muscadine or Bullace, the wild parent of the Scuppernong. But even admitting that the widest variation is the result of vines grown from seed, there is still such a wide variation in the fruit of vines known to be grown from cuttings that it fully establishes the case in point."
In order to give a comprehensive view of the ﬁeld, opportunities and principles of fruit improvement I have given these brief extracts from the writings and ut—
terances of men who are acknowledged to be authorities and experts in their several lines of effort. In the Citrus it seems to me there is great range for variations, and I would call attention in particular to one

phase of probable variety variation that cannot occur in deciduous fruits.
The graft of deciduous fruit trees must be taken and put in when dormant, though buds of the peach for instance like the orange are put in during the growing sea-
son. Before blooming in the spring or late in the fall when the summer growth is used, for budding oranges, I think we may expect the new trees to be true to the parent. but budwood taken just after blooming in the spring is liable to show variations if taken from twigs on which the bloom has been cross pollenated from other varieties. Rev. Lyman Phelps work-
ed on this line before the ’95 freeze with artiﬁcial pollenation and produced several modiﬁed oranges of which all were lost so far as I know except Tephi, a Jaﬂa im-
proved with Malta Blood. The ﬁrst ex-
ample of this kind I discovered was Botelha navel, a bud sport from May bud-
ding about 1885, a round, nearly seedless,
midseason navel that overbore so persist-
ently as to be undesirable. It was lost in
1895. I think most orange growers have noticed variations in standard varieties and I think if these could be traced they would be found to result from effects of cross pollenation on bud wood used just after blooming,
All will concede that the foreign pollen cells are the only cause of hybrids and crosses in the seeds of fruits. The pollen cells are the only motile cells in the higher orders of plants. A single grain attached to the pistil of an orange ﬂower for in-
stance sends its Icells down that pistil into the ovary or embryo fruit and the mature seeds of that fruit make trees with fruits differing from the parent tree.
Mr. Phelps contended that the inﬂuence of these motile pollen cells not only af-
fected the embryo fruit and seeds, but for a short time, at least, aﬂ’ected a leaf axil bud or two adjacent to the ﬂower.
For any person who has the time and patience the method of taking a bud next an artiﬁcially pollenated bloom offers a short cut to variety improvement. I am also of opinion that the split bud and cross pollenation bud methods offer quicker and snrer means of obtaining thin skinned, ﬁne grained, seedless or nearly seedless fruits of high quality, by combining varieties that are already high bred or superior,
than the growing of crosses from seed.-
In conclusion I would call attention to a difﬁculty in producing high grade, early,
hardy oranges. The hardy trait must be derived from the Citrus Trifoliata while the sweetness of juice and tissue with ﬁne
ﬂavor must be derived from fruits that have derived these qualities from the ten-
der citron. In my experience the Tan-
gerona and Early Oblong, for instance,
are not so resistant to cold as the Satsuma and Mandarin which clearly show traces of Trifoliata ancestry. The Citrus prob-
ably more than any other fruits have the predisposition to throw to excess in cross_
ing, some one characteristic of form.
structure, color or ﬂavor, with the odds enormously in favor of monstrosities, and a happy combination of desirable qualities will be as much a matter of chance as of scientiﬁc management.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 45
By 0. W. Conner, Tangerine.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
There are so many subjects that must be taken up, in making a report on “Citrus Fruits” that I hardly know where to be-
gin, but I trust you will be patient with me, and that what I have to say will be of some beneﬁt, to the beginners, if not to those older in experience. The cultivation of Citrus Fruits in Florida has, within the past few years, advanced to ﬁrst place, of all Horticultural pursuits, and vast amounts of capital have been invested in large. and small groves all over the state,
but most particularly, in the central and southern portions. And where ten or twelve years ago, a grove of ﬁfty, or one hundred acres was considered a big thing,
we now have many groves planted, that cover anywhere from one hundred to ﬁve hundred acres, and more going out every year, so I feel well assured, that in a very short time, we will enjoy the distinction of having the largest acreage of citrus groves, of any state in the Union and per-
haps of any area of equal size in the world,
and as the success of citrus fruits depends largely on these new groves, I trust you will pardon me for giving them so much attention in this paper.
With the increase in acreage. it becomes a necessity to so distribute the varieties planted as to reduce to a minimum the chances of overproduction, in any one class of fruit. And by reviewing the Grapefruit situation, we can surely learn the disadvantage of even partial overpro-
duction, There is no question in my mind, but that there have been too many Grapefruit trees budded, and planted in Florida in proportion to the fruits of other varieties, and we have seen excellent fruit drop from almost fabulous prices three years ago, to about cost of production, the past. season, and it was chiefly due to the fact that the demand was not sufﬁcient to clean up at any time, the excess of fruit shipped. It is true that in some cases, good prices were realized, but this was not a rule, and the average was far below what the leading growers ex-
pected to receive. The demand is cer—
tainly limited. If the Pomelo was such a fruit as it is customary to eat out of hand,
it would be different. But its uses are almost entirely limited to table, or dessert purposes, while the round oranges are eaten by almost everyone, on all occaSions,
from one end of the world to the other.
And even when making up the lunch for outing parties, this delicious fruit almost invariably ﬁnds its way into the hamper.
It is true that the demand is in a small way increasing, for Grapefruit, but not rapidly enough. to keep up with the in-
creasing output of Florida, California,
Cuba. Jamaica, and Porto Rico, all of which, except California, produce nearly the same quality of fruit that we do.
I have no way of determining the ex-
act proportion of Pomelo, that are already plantul, but believe that fully one third of the whole number of Citrus fruit trees now growing in this state, are Grapefruit, and as the majority of these trees have not as yet come into bearing the results of over;
production have not as yet been felt, and I feel perfectly safe in saying that ten years hence (if all the Grapefruit now planted come into bearing, and barring freezes)

that the price will be so low, that it will be a diﬂicult matter to ﬁnd a market for this fruit that will pay for production, and packing, to say nothing about transporta-
tion charges, to market.
Citrus fruit groves, if properly arrang-
ed as to variety, and intelligently cultiva-
ted, and fertilized, and in other ways scientiﬁcally, and methodically managed.
are now, and will continue to be a good in-
vestment in Florida, and I do not want to say anything, that will haye a tendency to discourage anyone from making such an investment, for I believe that the future holds many gratuitous results to reward intelligent labor in this vocation, but Hor-
ticultural progress has made many rapid strides during the past few years, in the way of determining the best thing to have for good results, and getting it, and to those who are beginning, I would most earnestly urge the necessity of getting the right thing, particularly in the way of variety, as a starter, and then to be sure to take good care of it.
There is no question but that in all sec-
tions where citrus fruits are grown, there are some varieties. that do better than others, and in planting new groves in any of these localities it would invariably, be the better to consult those who have already planted and fruited budded trees,
before deciding on what you will plant,
and not depend on something that you knew as a ﬁne fruit which was grown a hundred or more miles distant.
I believe one of the results of “The Freeze” was to weed out many varieties that had been propagated extensively in the early days of citrus fruit growing in Florida, because they were not proﬁtable,
and we now have in our list of good varieties as compiled by our committee,
and published in last year’s yearbook, a catalogue of Citrus fruits, each with its distinctive marks, and so arranged, that even a novice can pick out the winners,
with a little local aid, and research, as to adapability to location, etc. and I believe every variety listed, is a goo-l one for some locality, and among the best of them,
for universal use, I believe the following are entirely safe: Early Boones, Parson Brown (Carney) Satsuma; Midseason:
Pineapple, Homosassa, Majorca, Ruby;
Late: Hart’s (Tardiﬂ') Valencia Late;
Very Late: Lamb’s Summer. Novelties:
Dancy (Tangierine;) King, Mandarin,
Kumquats. I prefer the Parson Brown,
to all others on the list of early varieties.
The Boone will color up eariler in the season, but its appearance is against it, and it is inclined to roughness, and a thick rind, and is of a very uninviting color,
even when fully ripe.
For midseason varieties, there is noth-
ing on the list, that quite equals the Pine-
apple, and it differs from other varieties,
inasmuch that it can safely be" depended on, in any, and all localities. where any kind, or varieties of citrus can be grown It is the most proﬁtable sort for high pine lands, and is perfection on hammock and other rich, or heavy soils. This variety,
like the Parson Brown, has made a reputa-
tion for itself, on the different markets,
and I believe I am perfectly safe in saying that it has netted the growers fully a dol—
lar a box more than any other variety, the past season. Next to the Pineapple, is the Homosassa, and as a midseason, to medium late variety, I believe there is a good chance for the Ruby. Ruby should always be classiﬁed, and shipped as a Blood and it should be put up in as attract-
ive a manner as possible. The Hart’s and Valencia Late, I have found to be of about equal merits as to quality of fruit.

However, if there is any variation, it is in favor of the Valencia Late in evenly coloring up, and smoothness, and texture of peel. The Tardiff will hang on the trees a little later in the season, but I am not sure that the quality of the fruit improves as it is apt, especially so on lemon stock,
to get greener after rainy season com-
mences. I have noted the past winter,
that late varieties, owing to their im-
mature condition probably recover from the effect of cold weather better than any of the midseason, or early varieties. A neighbor shipped in good condition April I 5th Tardiﬂ oranges that were seeming-
ly ruined by a temperature of 22 degrees,
two nights about January 20th.
I believe, too, that there is a good mar-
ket waiting for a good navel orange. This variety, when of good quality, has always brought good prices, and as there have been some improvements made on the old Washington Navel during the past ﬁve or six years, there is good reason to believe that we will yet be able to produce the best navels to be had anywhere, and if the new varieties prove to be proliﬁc bearers on sour, and sweet stock, and of good quality on lemon, and generally successful in most sections of the state, instead of cer-
tain restricted localities, as heretofore,
they will be a most proﬁtable variety to plant, and propagate.
By planting the varieties as listed above,
or others of equal merit, and so dividing the different classes of fruit, as to give early, midseason, late, and novelties, about .
an equal share, or area in the new groves,
one could pretty well cover the entire ship-
ping, or marketing season, and in this way get an average of season’s prices,
which ought to bring the account out on the right side of the ledger.
The subject, Stocks, was pretty well covered by Prof. Rolfs, in his paper “Re-
lation of Science to Horticulture” See pages 56 to 66 last year’s year book; but,
I want to say that there is probably no other state in the Union that shows such a diversity of soil, as Florida, and while I agree with most others here, that the sour orange is the best stock to use and that it is this stock that has been used to produce most of the prize winners at vari-
ous exhibitions etc., there are soils upon which it would hardly produce a leaf, on account of their extremely light, sandy composition. If we, in the larger portion
~ of Orange county, on our high sandy,hilly lands depended altogether on the sour stock,- we would not have a very good show for the money invested, and a large portion of our groves are on sweet, and rough lemon stock. The sour stock is a favorite in all localities, where a good quality of soil is to be had, and there can be no doubt, that fruit will carry longer, in good condition, on this stock than on any other, but on light, or high thirsty pine lands, it would be cultivated chieﬂy, at a loss. The Citrus Trifoliata stock has been tried, and proven an absolute failure, and the pomelo, or grapefruit stock grows off well until it has been budded to some variety of round oranges, and after that it usually loses its thrift, and does not do any better than the sour stock. There-
fore, about all that we have to depend on is the rough lemon as a stock.
This stock is a very rank feeder, and rarely suffers from the effects of dry weather, as other stocks do. It is healthy,
and will thrive with us, under most ad-
verse circumstances, and can always be counted on to produce a good crop of fruit, when treated fairly, and' properly

fertilized. It is folly to expect that trees worked on this stock over-supplied with nitrogen, will produce good fruit, and especially is this true, if organic materials are used, with an excess of nitrogen, and a deﬁciency of phosphoric acid, and pot-
=ash. This is not only true of lemon stock,
but it has been my observation, that every grove so treated will produce a poor grade of fruit, and sooner or later, develop that most trying disease, “dieback,” which might truly be called indigestion of the orange tree. There are many growers who have ﬁne looking groves, that are bearing large quantities of a poor quality of fruit, who blame it all to the stock,
when they might by taking into considera-
tion the fact that this stock is an immense feeder, and does not require the same amount of nitrogen that the sour stock does, nor the same methods of cultivation as other stocks, and cultivating, and fer-
tilizing them accordingly, produce a good quality of fruit.
I do not advocate the use of this stock on any but light soils. and by those who have had experience in cultivating citrus fruits, and who understand the require-
ments of their soils but those who have this stock already planted, and developed to a bearing stage, can do much to im-
prove the quality of their fruit by regulat-
ing their formula of fertilizer in such a way as to most accurately meet the re-
quirements of their soils as, well as their methods of cultivation, etc.
I would like to add that the late D. W.
Adams, who was for many years president of this Society, and during his residencein this state one of our most practical Hor-
ticulturists, and one who was noted for his success with citrus fruits, had before his death, decided in favor of the lemon stock for all his new groves, not because it was the best stock for universal use of course, but because he had solved the problem of its successful cultivation, and fertilization. His methods of cultivation are too well known to make mention of here, except to say that they mainly con-
sisted of very light working with hoes, and plenty of mulching. I think his plan of mulching might have been improved upon,
but the fact remains, that he produced the best fruit grown in the state, and it was seldom that a box of his Navels, or Tar-
diFfs went out of his packing house. that he did not get back from $5 to $10 for it. No matter where the lemon stock is used, it cannot be cultivated, and fertilized in same manner that other stocks can, with-
out producing coarse ungainly fruit, and if kept highly cultivated, and fertilized with a formula containing over 4 per cent ammonia, and less than 7 to 8 per cent Phosphoric Acid, and 10 to I2 per cent potash it will naturally follow, that the fruit will be insipid, ﬂavorless, coarse,
and of light weight.
In localities where sour stock thrives,
no other stock is to be considered, and the less fertilizerrequired, the moregratifying will be the success of the grower, but in all cases I would warn you to beware of, and
ﬁght shy of a fertilizer formula. consist-
ing of any but pure chemicals, and if once you are tempted, and fall into the use of a cheap source of the different requisite elements, or an organic form of fertilizer,
you at the same time put yourself into a position to regret it later on. when your trees begin to bear, if not before. I am sorry to have to say that in many portions of Florida the balance will show up on the wrong side of the account this year, for with the condition of our markets, and the general falling off in quality of fruit pro-
duced, the net earnings of our groves have

fallen many thousands of dollars behind what most of us conﬁdently expected to receive for our fruits, and in the main, I fear it is the growers’ fault this time in many ways. First, in quality of fruit pro-
duced, Second, in poor packing, Third,
in rushing green fruit to the market very early in the season, with the resultof hope-
lessly glutting the markets with slow sell-
ing fruit, and so demoralizing the market,
that there was no settling to real values, at any time during the season; and added to all this, was the effects of the cold of Jan-
uary and the consequent loss of large quantities of fruit, waiting to be shipped,
when the market once got settled. Such good fruit as was left on the trees in many localities has brought very low prices, in consequence of frozen, or partially in—
jured fruit having been shipped, usually at a loss, but I trust all these hard luck ex-
periences, have carried with them their lit-
tle lessons, relative to properly sorting,
and packing fruit, etc., as well as bringing to the minds of all. growers, the necessity of producing a good article to offer to the consumer if good prices are expected in return.
I trust I will not be encroaching on the privileges of some other committee, if I say a word or so about insects, and spray—
ing, for I believe a great deal depends on spraying, that is essential to producing good fruit, for good fruit must have a good appearance, as well as a sweet, aro—
matic interior. From the time the bloom drops off the young fruit in the spring,
there are enemies lying in wait to prey upon it, during every stage of its develop-
ment, and while there are many locations,
where soil, and atmospheric conditions are at enmity with these insects, and fungus diseases, and work wonders as prevent-
ives of damage to the fruit and trees by their effects on them, I believe the rule is that these insects, and fungus diseases do a great deal of damage, and spraying be-
comes a necessity, in order that a good quality of fruit may be produced, not-
withstanding opinions held to the con-
trary. However, I have learned of cases.
during the past season where beginners
(at spraying I mean) had done as much damage, with their spraying ,or more per-
haps, than the insects sprayed for would have done, if left alone. This was because they did not use the spray at the right time, or used it too strong, or too often.
\Vhile I believe that it is absolutely neces-
sary at allinterior points, to spray,I would caution those who do it, to be sure they are right, before they go ahead. Use the right thing, at the right time etc. As there are numerous, bulletins to be had for the asking, from the Experiment Station at Lake City, besides which advice will be gladly furnished by the Station director,-
Dr. Sellards. I would recommend that growers avail themselves of all the knowl-
edge these sources afford and thus equip themselves with perfect knowledge of their enemy before entering the arena.
White Ply.
I believe the mention of this little in-
sect is sufﬁcient cause to make every grower, who has the well being of his grove nearest his heart, look himself over,
and brush his clothes well before thinking of entering his grove again, and if we were all as careful as this assertion would indicate, I believe it would be a simple matter to keep the insect in check. During the past two or three years we have all be-
gun to realize what a serious menace this insect is to our orange groves, and man plans have been suggested, for ﬁghting t successfully, and keeping it in check, and

we cannot afford to get careless. If you would keep free of their damage, keep free of them. Never go near them and then into your own grove, without ﬁrst making sure that you carry none with you on your clothes, in your carriage, etc., and in-
kist on the same consideration of anyone else who enters your grounds. The beneﬁts to be derived from local protective organizations are too manifest to need more than a passing remark here, and those neighborhoods that can do so, would be more beneﬁtted by this method of pro-
tection than by any other. It is cheaper to keep this insect out of a community than it is to ﬁght it after it has gained a foot-
hold. We have kept it out of our neigh-
borhood for several years by spraying it at the nearest points, and cutting down all food plants in its path, and now the ﬂy is not as near us. as it Was at the beginning of our ﬁght to keep it out.
There is not much danger of getting the
ﬂy from any of the leading nurserymen,
for I believe they have a scruple in the direction of spreading so damaging a pest,
but there is danger of shipping nursery stock through. the country, either by ex-
press, or freight when the fly is on the wing, unless it is packed very tight. and no chance for the insect to get to the con-
tents of the package. The express and freight cars gather them up. when passing through infested places, and often carry them many miles from their original breeding places. I have seen ﬂies at Wild-
wood, which came all the way from Or-
lando, in the express car. a distance of ﬁfty miles. You can imagine what would have occurred if there had been an open top case of citrus trees in that car.
And now in conclusion, I want to say that if we bend all our energiesto the point of breaking, and strive'to keep our pro-
duct up to its known standard of excel-
lence I can see no reason why we cannot succeed in keeping the reputation of Flori-
da oranges at the head of the list, believ-
ing that there is only one thing that we can do, one that will be of lasting beneﬁt to our organization, and that is, to strive every way possible to make our product better each year, until we have well earned the reputation that we now enjoy, that of producing the best citrus fruit grown in the world and then by untiring effort keep its reputation right there. Regretting that I cannot give you anything better in the way of a report, as an aid in that direction, I am,
Yours respect fully,

M.r. President—I have a letter that was intended to have reached me in time to have been incorporated in my report, but it did not do so and I beg to have the same received and attached as a part of report of the Committee on Citrus Fruits.
On motion duly seconded and carried,
the following paper referred to by Mr.
Conner was received as a part of the report on citrus fruits:
May 9th, 1905.
O. W. Conner,
Jacksonville, Fla.,
Dear Sir;
I have your letter of recent date stating that you are preparing a paper on citrus fruits, and thatyou would like me to write you something regarding the situa-
tion in Cuba, knowing that I am entirely familiar with it while you are not. You also say that you would like to have a gen-

eral statement from me as to my opinion as to the future of the citrus and nursery business. I fear very much that it will not be possible for me to attend the meeting at Jacksonville much as I would like to do so.
I had expected to be in Cuba, but was able to get away somewhat sooner than usual, but ﬁnd that I must go to New York at once, which will prevent my at-
tendance at the meeting. I do not suppose you will have much time for a lengthy statement from me, and will therefore en-
deavor to make it brief.
Orange growing in Cuba, up to com-
paratively recent date, was merely inciden-
tal. None of the groves had ever been planted with the idea of shipping fruit to market, but such fruit as was grown came from trees which happened to be planted in one place or another by accident. These trees are found growing all over the Island, and have never received any care worth mentioning. In many parts of the Island there are many wild trees growing in the forest, just about as they did in the hammocks around Orange Lake, except-
ing that they are not quite as plentiful.
There are also a great many bitter sweet trees growing throughout the Island, and the fruit on these trees, as well as that on the sour trees, seems to be identical with the fruit grown in Florida. In regard to the quality of the sweet orange I will say that there is as wide a range as there is in Florida, and while I have eaten oranges in Cuba which I consider to be as good as any I have ever tasted, I have also eaten many which were very poor. There is nothing very surprising about this, how-
ever, when the circumstances under which they were grown are taken into con-
sideration. The trees are generally stand-
ing where there is no chance whatever to cultivate them. and in many instances the entire ground surrounding the trees is choked with a dense growth of other trees and plants. Many of the trees are grow-
ing in what is called Guinea grass land,
and this grass grows very rank. and often attains the height of eight to ten feet.
During the many wars which have pre-
vailed on the island, either one army or the other persisted in setting ﬁre to anything that would burn, in order to burn out or smoke out the enemy. This was, of course, pretty tough on the orange trees,
as many of them were burned to the ground, while others were badly injured.
A great many people who have been to the Island have told me that they never saw a large orange tree, but had the trees in Florida been burned as they have in Cuba, the same statement might truthfully be made here. If we were to have a freeze which cut our trees to the ground about every four years I doubt if anyone would ever see a large orange tree in Florida. There has been practically no shipment of oranges from the Island of Cuba for many years. The entire product of these scattering trees being consumed at home. Within the last two or three years,
however, several American Syndicates have planted large groves of oranges and grapefruit in Cuba, and the prospect is _
that within a very few years Cuba will be known as a factor in the citrus fruit busi-
ness. While it is true that oranges will grow in any part of the Island it is also true that a great deal of the soil of Cuba is not well adapted to citrus fruit culture.
owing to the fact that it is very heavy and almost impossible to cultivate. Such land will produce magniﬁcent sugar cane. as during the rainy season they do not ex-
‘1Ject nor is it necessary to cultivate sugar cane, and at such. time as I have described it is impossible to work a horse for the

reason that it would soon sink out of sight.
The lands with which I am most familiar are located at Ceballos in Porto Principe,
Province. Here I found the soil very similar to that in our best Florida Ham-
mocks, except that it is red instead of black. The land is covered with a dense growth of hardwood timber, and it stands so thick that a cat can hardly crawl into it. \Vhen I went to inspect this land for the Development Company of Cuba I found that where wells had been dug the soil was twenty-six feet deep before they struck sub-soil, and it seems to be just as good at the bottom as it is at the top.
There is 29 per cent of silica in the soil and this makes it porous enough so that when a heavy rain falls it soon soaks through it. I have seen it rain steadily for nearly twenty-four hours, and within two hours after it stopped I could ride a horse all over the well-cultivated ﬁeld with out any discomfort whatever, and the ploughs and cultivators could be operated next day. I think all things considered this is the ﬁnest soil for orange growing that I have ever seen. The time may come when we will have to fertilize, but I think it is a long way off. The Development Company of Cuba. of which I am the General Manager, determined to plant or-
anges on an extensive scale, and we be-
gan operations there two years ago. Our
ﬁrst planting was about 10,000 trees and we ﬁnished on the ﬁfteenth of February.
1903. To anyone who has not visited Cuba, it would seem almost incredible if they were told that trees planted at that time are now, many of them, 12 feet high_
and the stocks three to four inches in diameter with a corresponding spread of branches, that they bloomed in March, and“
that many of them are now carrying three to four boxes of fruit. Whether this will shed or not I cannot say, but I never saw healthier looking fruit in all my life. Thus it was when I left there a week ago. I do not wish to convey the idea that every tree is twelve feet high, or that every tree has three to four boxes of fruit, but I believe the grove will average nine feet in height,
and unless they drop very badly. the pres-
ent indications are that we will have more than an average of one ' box per tree. It must be taken into con-
sideration, howeverv that these trees grow the entire season. and there is never a day in the year but what you can go into the grove and ﬁnd plenty of new growth on them. In Florida, you are all aware that there trees generally rest for three or four months each year,
and then if they have been fortunate enough to escape Jack Frost, they con-
tinue to increase in size. but you can readily see that this is a much slower pro-
cess than when the growth is continuous,
and where the land is so rich that they never lack for a square meal. The De-
velopment Company in connection with the colonists who have settled there have now planted about 2.000 acres to citrus fruits, and these will probably be increased from ﬁve to eight hundred acres per year for several years, as it is'the intention of the Company to plant at least 3.000 acres.
I never saw trees anywhere that seemed to be in any more healthy condition. and I can see no reason why the production of citrus fruits in Cuba should not be car-
ried on successfully, and on an enormous scale. We have had some little trouble with gumming, but this has entirely yield-
ed to treatment and the affected trees seem to be in perfect con-
dition at the present time. We have also had more or less scale to con-
tend with, but I do not anticipate much

53
trouble on this score. We were never troubled much on the rich Hammock lands here in Florida for the reason that the trees grew so rapidly that the scale could not seem to do much damage. I had several hammock land groves be—
fore the freeze, and do not recollect ever having sprayed one for insects, but on the pine lands we always had troubles of our own. The soil in Cuba being so very much richer than any in Florida, I do not apprehend much trouble from scale in—
sects for the reasons above given. We have not, as yet, had any white ﬂy to con-
tend with, and I sincerely hope that we will be able to keep them out. Judging from the growth the trees already plant-
ed have made, and by the prospect we have for fruit this year, I think I am safe in saying that the present planting at Ceballos in the course of ﬁve or six years ought to yield easily one and a half mil-
lions of boxes. We are located on the line of the Cuba Railroad, and this Com-
pany is building enormous docks at its terminus at Nipe Bay, which will be our shipping port, and we expect to deliver fruit from our packing house to the wharf in New York in ﬁve days or less.
There is one great advantage in ship—
ping from Cuba, and that is, after the fruit is loaded onto the vessels, there are no way stations or side tracks, but it goes direct to its destination without stopping. I am satisﬁed that thousands of trees will be planted in unfavorable lo-
cations in Cuba, and do not believe such trees will ever amount to anything. I have seen trees grown on heavy black lands which produced beautiful fruit,
but upon examination I found them bad-
ly creased and would not stand shipment.
This land is very similar to some I own at Silver Springs Run, and while my fruit was very handsome to look at it was al-
ways badly creased, and it put me to lots of trouble to market it, as I could never sell the crop to the same man twice, for the reasons above stated. There are bound to be failures in Cuba just as there have been in Florida and Califor-
nia, but in my opinion where careful and intelligent selection of land and location has been made there ought to be no trou-
ble to succeed in growing as good citrus fruit in Cuba, as in any other place in the world, and I believe when our im-
proved budded varieties begin to fruit there will be no question about its quality.
Many people in Florida have an erroneous idea that good oranges can not be grown anywhere else. I think, however, that you will all agree with me that there are some mighty poor oranges grownin Flor-
ida, especially on lands which are not well adapted and which are not properly fertilized. It is doubtful if any better fruit than is grown in some parts of Flor-
ida will ever be produced anywhere, and it would be an unreasonable man who would ask for anything better, but with the experience I have already had in Cuba I feel perfectly satisﬁed that we will produce a great deal of good fruit that will compete with the best in Flor-
ida and California.
In regard to the nursery business I do not suppose this will interest your hearers, but Will say brieﬂy that I have never yet seen any trees grown in Cuba which compared to those produced in the sandy lands of Florida. Any one who is:
at all familiar with the propagation of trees or plants knows very well that a light sandy soil is much more desirable for the reason that it will produce a much better root system. In the rich lands of A Cuba there is so much plant food always present in the soil that the young plant does not ﬁnd it necessarytothrow out any

large quantity of roots as a comparative-
ly few seem to sufﬁce for its needs, while in the sandy lands of Florida the young plant must hustle for food as soon as the seed sprouts, and this continual hustling gives our trees the magniﬁcent root system for which they are so justly not-
ed. In planting our trees if proper care is taken by the nurserymen in digging and by the planters when setting there should not be a loss of one per cent, and I have known. several instances where several thousands of trees were planted without the loss of a single one. On the other hand with the Cuban grown tree, if the same precautions are used as in the other case there is often a loss of from twenty-ﬁve to ﬁfty per cent, ow-
ing undoubtedly to the lack of roots on the tree grown in the rich soil. I have seen nursery stock grown in California,
Jamaica and Cuba, but have never seen anything that could “hold a candle” to the tree grown in the sandy soil of Flor-
ida. A great many of my friends have talked with me on this subject of orange growing in Cuba, and seem to fear that Cuba would soon put Florida out of business. I do not think we need to have any fears on this score, as there will be but little competition. I have always advocated the planting of late varieties in Cuba, claiming that we should take advantageof the climatic'conditions there and grow something that could not be grown in Florida. About 90 per cent of the orange trees I have sold in Cuba are of the late varieties, and will not get into the market until after the ﬁrst of Feb-
ruary, at which time practically everyl thing has left Florida. I have advised against planting the early varieties for the reason that we can not get them in-
to the, market any earlier than can be done from Florida, and as our growers have a bad habit of rushing their fruit into the market regardless of the fact that it is green and unﬁt for use, and without any reference to the demands of the market, I thought it would be bad policy to get our fruit in at the same time, as we would all go down together.
There will of course be some fruit ship-
ped during December and January, but I do not think these shipments will have much effect on the market, as the bulk of the fruit will come later.
There is much more that might be said, but I have already made this letter much longer than I intended.
Trusting that it may be of some inter-
est to your hearers, I remain,
Yours very truly,
M E. GILLETT.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Boggs—Mr. President, there is es-
pecially one important point in my judg-
ment contained in the committee report that should be fully discussed by the so-
ciety. That point is the question of overproduction of grapefruit. There has been a great deal of complaint this sea-
son of the prevailing low price of grape~
fruit and it behooves us to inquire into the cause. \Vhile I must admit that I have myself seen but a small portion of the state and am not entirely familiar with the acreage or output of grapefruit,
I have gained the impression. from the press throughout the state that it is now large and still growing; in fact, it seems that everybody is planting grapefruit.
Mr.‘ President, this is a very important subject to this society and to the citrus fruit industry of this state. The market conditions on this crop are decidedlybad.
There seems to be no let up in the plant-
ing of grapefruit trees and there scemsto

be no let up in depression of prices, so far as my observation goes and I would like very much indeed to have the views of other members of the society upon this very important matter.
Mr. Carroll—Mr. President, before I could entirely agree with the gentleman I think we should ﬁrst look to the mar-
ketable condition of the fruit, picking handling, packing and shipping and the proper distribution before we come to the conclusion that we are approaching an overproduction in this handsome new fruit. Grapefruit, Mr. President, is a new fruit, a comparatively new citrus prod-
uct. There are thousands of people in this country who do not know what grapefruit is. They never saw the fruit,
and when they see it they have to be edu-
cated how to eat it. Further than this my observation is that the condition of the marketable crop up to this time has been positively bad. The handling and packing has been bad, shipment and dis-
tribution has not been the best. I be-
lieve I can safely say, Mr. President, that fully one-third of the fruit shipped out-
of the state this season has been shipped out in a green. immature and decidedly unmarketable condition. Such condi-
tions as-these will make the market slump on anything. Another thing, Mr.
President, the hue and cry was raised some years ago that we were on the verge of overproduction in oranges.
We do not hear any more about it now. The proper handling, picking, pack-
ing and shipment of the orange crop se-
cures good prices on the market. I believe it will be the same with grapefruit. Let its rather make improvement ﬁrst in these important conditions, Mr. President, and give the great markets of this country a taste of the delicious grapefruit before we indulge in the pessimistic views of over-
production. I am an. optimist in the matter of the grapefruit industry, as I am with regard to almost the entire fam-
ily of Florida citrus fruits. Give us some legislation if it is needed in the matter of crateage and package and rates. Let us send our fruit to market in prime con-
dition and I believe the low prices will abate and vanish.
Mr. Connor—I think you will ﬁnd, Mr.
President, that attention is called in my paper to marketable conditions. These conditions must be bettered before we can expect to realize better prices. The matter is a very serious one and we must seek the cause. I am inclined to believe myself that there is now a partial over-
production of grapefruit, or to put it transversely, under-consumption. The conditions exist and they should be met if it is possible to meet them or suffer disastrous consequences.
Mr. Blackman -- Mr. President. I heartin concur in the remarks of Mr.
Carroll. During my travels last summer I came across scores of people who had never heard of grapefruit and did not know what it was, and didn’t know how to eat it when they saw it, but who were all delighted with the fruit when it was offered them and they had once tasted it. If this be true, and it most assuredly is true. how can we apprehend overpro—
duction in this comparntnely new citrus fruit? The great majority of the people of this country as yet do not know what grapefruit is. They have never seen it.
It has never been offered to them. It has never been placed upon their market.
In my judgment, Mr. President, we cer-
tainly should not apprehend overproduc-
tion until we have at least put the fruit

properly upon the market in good con-
dition. I found this state of things at the St. Louis Exposition. There wasn’t
-a man in ten who had ever heard of grapefruit. I had some of the fruit with me. I induced a commission merchant to take a shipment of it, and exhibiting the fruit there, I told the people where it could be procured. The consequence was. the merchant sold out his entire shipment in a few days. Mr. President,
we have not overproduction of grape—
fruit at all in my judgment. It is rather a lack of 'systematic marketing. I do not fear overproduction. I have always been able to dispose of my fruit on the trees in many instances at good prices, and I believe with proper systematic manage-
ment, the same good results can be had now from the fruit of every grapefruit tree in the state. You can not get good prices for an inferior, green, immature,
badly handled, packed or shipped fruit on a glutted market. The grapefruit in my judgment has as bright a future be fore it as the orange. I therefore can not believe that there are any grounds of apprehension or fear of overproduc-
tion of this delicious, comparatively new fruit, which as yet has barely been .in-
troduced to the markets of this coun-
try.
Mr. Boggs—I feel unwilling to leave the subject without another word or two.
The comparison has been made here be-
tween the grapefruit and the orange.
There is no comparison. Mr. President, in my opinion, between the two fruits—at least so far as market results are con-
cerned. In the ﬁrst place, the grapefruit has to be eaten at the table after prepara-
tion in the culinary deartment. It there-
fore requires too much handling before it reaches the point of consumption. It is a large fruit and can not be handled in the same manner as the orange. There-
fore, it will never have a very large sale,
as a notable instance on trains, which aloneis an important channel of consump-
tion. It is well known, or if it is not it is time it was becoming known, that the average patron of the fruitstand, where the two fruits are displayed, the orange and the grapefruit, will buy ten oranges to one grapefruit. He can eat the one on the spot. if he chooses; the other he has to take home with him and have it prepared before he eats it. I want to say here and now, Mr. Presi—
dent, that those of us, and I believe there are many, who indulge the delusion that the grapefruit is ever to rival the orange on the market,are doomed to disappoint-
ment and despair. That can, in the very nature of the two fruits, never be. It is,
in my opinion, the utmost folly to en-
tertain such a thought. The gentleman from Miami. Mr. Blackman, is the only person that I have heard of who has this season received what he thought he ought to have gotten for his grapefruit.
Let us, for a single moment, consider his-conditions. The grove of which he speaks is within a short distance of the Royal Palm Hotel, and situated upon a favorite driveway for tourists. The owner sells entirely to this CIHSS of trade. and gets twice as much per box in his grove as the fruit could be bought for in New York City. How many of us have a grapefruit orchard in the shadow of a palatial winter resort hotel, where the fruit may be picked from the trees for the break-
fast table? The gentleman is to be con-
gratulated upon his situation and upon the fancy prices he has obtained for his fruit,
but that situation, Mr. President, is a very different one from the average grape-

fruit grower in this state. In conclusion,
‘ I must reiterate that my observation is,
that we have even. now, or we soon shall have in this state, a very large overproduc-
tion of grapefruit. I would not be un-
derstood as discouraging its culture en—
tirely, but it should certainly be made _
subservient to the real condition of things
. as regards its scope and its market.
Tropical Fruits.
By Mrs. E. E. Ankeney, Eldrcd, Fla.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gcntlvmcn:
In the recent reports of this committee I ﬁnd that those reporting gave y0u a wide outlook upon the pineapple industry,
its history, increase and desirability as an investment. One committeeman says:
“To go into the details of pineapple cul-
ture would be entirely foreign to this re-
port,” and another says “I should hate very much to feel called upon to relate
* * * the details * * * and I take it that people generally care little for such information.” As I have neither a wide experience nor extended observation,
I must necessarily conﬁne myself to my smaller knowledge which covers only the methods of culture employed by myself and some others in my own vicinity.
I have been a member of this society and read its reports for six years past, but have never had the pleasure of attending a meeting where I could ask questions:
so that when I read that Mr. Porcher has found a new bug on his orange trees,
which he got rid of by spraying, I am glad if he describes it so that I may know it should it come down our way; or when Mr. Hart says there is a fungus which will take care of that bug just as well, and does not tell what, that fungus looks like,
whether green, brown, or yellow, or where it grows, how shall I know that I have the panacea on hand when the dread enemy appears? I-am sure the facts and minute details are what make the Annual Reports of this society valuable.
PINEAPPLES.
Pineapples have as yet only one great enemy and he is the, hitherto, unconqucr-
able Jack Frost. He has laid them low several times but, like Truth, though crushed to earth they rise again and grow and grow. In the hope of making my paper practical, therefore. to those newly starting in the business, I will tell you how some of us grow Red Spanish pineapples out of doors at Eldred on the East Coast.
Our land is spruce pine and high ham-
mock. It is cleared, grubbed deeply and raked as for a garden. The slips which form around the base of the apple are allowed to grow after the fruit is picked until mature, and are considered the most desirable to plant, although suckers usual-
ly bring a higher price per thousand.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Good plants should be eight inches or more in length. These are cut otf slightly at the base and enough of the leaves or boot peeled off to expose the root system and planted with a dibble or trowel,
twenty inches each way and in beds twenty to forty feet wide being found most satisfactory. At this distance it will require about twelve thousand per acre,
more or less, according to the space given to paths. Some, immediately after plant-
ing, put a pinch of cottonseed meal, or cottonseed meal and tobacco into the heart of each plant. but generally this is not done until the plant begins to root. From this time till the plants bloom, the scuﬁ'le-
hoe is the grower’s best friend, and its constant use without fertilizer will make better plants than the fertilizer without the scuffle-hoe. Neither should be used sparingly if the best results are to be se-
cured. When well rooted an application of ﬁve hundred pounds to the acre of cot-
tonseed meal and tobacco or of high grade blood and bone will keep them growing nicely. If the weather does not become cold enough to check growth, still another application of the same kind. say one thousand pounds per acre, may be applied in the late fall or winter though this may be delayed till February or March.
By mid-summer the plants should be nearly full grown and stocky at the base.
Until recently it has been usual to apply at this stage simply an ammoniated fer-
tilizer and if they are at all backward that will be best, but otherwise I prefer to add a slight percentage of phosphoric acid and potash to the ammoniate. One hundred pounds of fertilizer to each one thousand plants is sufﬁcient. The plants will then need nothing further until they are ready to fruit and this is applied any time be-
tween September and March, owing to the
1
condition of the ﬁelds, the weather or the ideas of the individual grower. A for-
mula for this last application often used is
3 to 4 per cent of ammonia, 7 to 8 per cent phosphoric acid and 10 to 12 per cent pot-
ash.
I have thus outlined as brieﬂy as pos-
sible one system of cultivation which has given good results, but of course there are many variations from this, both in the amount of fertilizer, proportions, and time of application. The pineapple is tenacious of life and lives to' fruit so it does its level best with whatever comes to it, but repays richly for good feeding and care. An acre well cared for will, if the plants were vigorous and all conditions favorable. produce 90 per cent or from
300 to 400 crates the ﬁrst crop, but as neither slips nor suckers are uniformly good and some years are all below par,
the average yield is not so high. After plants cover the ground. cultivation ceases and fertilizer is applied broadcast, two applications a year being considered suFﬁ-
cient in our locality. Formerly cotton—
seed meal and tobacco dust was the uni—
versal summer fertilizer, but recently a more or less cOmplete one of high grade materials is growing in favor, especially when there is much fall fruit.
Believing that those who have never seen» a pineapple ﬁeld or seen the fruit handled would be interested, the writer takes pleasure in showing some pineap—
ple views taken in the East Coast pineap-
ple belt in St. Lucie county. The pack-
ing of the fruit will be of especial inter-
est to many.
The growing of pineapples is no longer an experiment. The problems remaining to be solved are largely' economical and commercial. Increased production means smaller proﬁts and must induce better

business methods by the growers; less waste and the obtaining by combination or otherwise, wholesale prices on needed supplies. We need a wider distribution and cheaper rates, particularly to near-by markets; and above all quicker transpor-
tation and more careful handling. Six days to New York, and eight to Boston,
will never enable us to compete with Havana fruit should our seasons be iden-
tical.
The freeze of January 25 to 26 left our
ﬁelds brown as stubble ﬁelds in Autumn.
But the wonderful vitality and recupera-
tive power of the pineapple plant has again been demonstrated and our ﬁelds are rapidly renewing themselves. The yield from the older ﬁelds will be cut down 60 to 70 per cent but those coming into bearing for the ﬁrst time will produce almost as many pines, but unless weather conditions are perfect, they will average much smaller than if they had not been frozen. A strange characteristic of this freeze was, that the newly planted ﬁelds were practically uninjured. A white frost has often done more damage to young plants than did those two nights of freez-
ing weather,
We have no sheds in Eldred so I cannot‘
report upon their efﬁciency, but suppose that now, if ever, their owners will realize upon their investment.
At your last meeting the question most persistently pressed was: “Do pineapples pay?” To which I answer, “If they do not, why do we grow them ?” For pine-
apple ﬁelds unlike an orange grove do not appeal to the sentimental side of one’s na-
ture. When I look over their green slopes I involuntarily begin to ﬁgure on the number of crates and probable proﬁts, but when I turn from these and walk down through our small and not very produc-
tive orange grove, which has cost much pains and money, and has never brought a dollar of proﬁt, there is a fascination and a compensating satisfaction in the beauty of the trees alone, and a certain charm of mystery and expectancy, as well.
The late Mr. Joseph Jefferson is reported to have remarked to a caller at his Palm Beach home that one of the disadvantages of old people was that they had nothing to expect, so this winter he has been garden-
ing. In the spirit of this bit of philosophy I grow orange trees, that I may cherish expectation and so keep ever the enthusi-
asm of youth, but I grow pineapples be-
cause they are proﬁtable.

The Government Viticultural Experiment Station.
By H. von Lutichau.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Two seasons have passed since my last report on Viticultural Experiment Sta-
tion in my charge at Earleton. The time allotted to this experiment has now passed and we are in a position to recom-
mend a few successful varieties of this class of ﬁnest table grapes. Not much difﬁculty will be experienced by a care-
ful grower to get a good supply of excel-
lent fruit, superior to any native kind.
Varieties recommendable are:
\Vihite Grapes.—Admirable de Cour-
tiller, Chasselas Besson, Florence, Mon-
tauban, Dore, Parc de Versailles, Satin Blane, Muscat Saint Laurent.
Black Grapes. — Black Alicante,
Frankenthal prexose.
Red Grapes.—Chasselas rouge, Rose de Fallowx, Tsien-Tsien, and Chasselas rose.
By application I think the United States Department of Agriculture, Mr.
Husmann in charge of grape investiga-
tions, will supply a few scions of these varieties for grafting. For stock, our wild blue bunch grape is likely as good as any and easy to get; otherwise Ru-
pestris in different forms. Personally, I like the Taylor, a small cultivated grape Riparia X.
It is not advisable to plant these grapes on a large scale for distant mar-
kets; but for home use. for the lover of beautiful fruit, they will prove most satisfactory and a great enjoyment.
I have raised the best crops in the third, fourth and ﬁfth year—after that a decline is noted—but this may yet be prevented by dif’ferent forms of prun-
ing, governed by variety, as well as soil and locality. A good plan would be to graft and plant new young vines every six or seven years and the old vines may be kept or discarded accordingly. After planting, let vine grow at will ﬁrst year—
by winter cut back to two eyes—permit but one to grow—the strongest—pinch leader when about 3t04 feet high—let all laterals grow and next winter trim to two eyes spur system. I say “two eyes" for I have found this preferable to the short one eye spur trimming. Too close trim-
ming should be avoided, as well as the growing of long spurless canes—and short ones as well, which would at best only bear fruit on the end, even when a hundred feet long. Summer pruning must not be done,except shortening in a very strong and long growing cane.
For fertilizer blood, bone and potash is best applied March or April; if possible nothing but the cultivator should be used: if plowed, then very shallow, keep clean culture all the time.
Guard against overbearing. This will ruin a vine quicker than anything else.
The wonder stories I used to hear occa-
sionally at our meetings testify but to the ignorance of the grower. It is bet-
ter for the grower and especiallv better for the vine to have a reasonable number of ﬁne large bunches, than a display of a great number of “berries.” Localities where Anthracnose, rot or mildew is

found, Bordeaux spraying hasto be done;
begin early, as soon as bloom is over,
not forgetting one spray just before buds are swelling. Preventive is better than cure.
Bagging the bunches is necessary Birds and wasps prefer such sweet grapes to all others, and if done as soon as ber-
ries are formed, will almost prevent rot and mildew on the fruit. Common pa-
per bags are used, large enough to hold the full grown bunch, and fastened with copper wire. A small hole or slit is to be cut at the bottom.
Of insects, the steel blue beetle will do the most harm, their destructive work comes in when buds are ﬁrst swelling,
even before, and should be picked off by hand.
I have often- seen growers cut their grapes when they should have remained two weeks or longer on the vine;
let fruit hang as long as possible. Sweet-
ness and aroma will then come to per-
fection.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Painter—I would like to know if any member of the society has any in-
formation he can offer on what is known as the St. Augustine Grape. I know of one or two vines, one of which has been bearing for the last twenty years. I know of but the two vines. The grapes are small, something like the Delaware, though not quite so large, and grow in very large clusters. I think it a good grape to get better acquainted with.
Mr. Hampton—I have seen this grape quite frequently in St. Augustine. It is a proliﬁc grape, growing in large clus—
ters, somewhat smaller than the Dela-
ware,which it resembles. It is ahardyvine long lived and a good bearer. It is a nice table grape and is a grape that ought to be and could be without trouble grown anywhere in the state. I agree with Mr.
Painter that it is a grape that we should get better acquainted with.
Mr. Hart—I should like to ask the gentleman what measures, if any, are taken to prevent the depredations of birds, or if they are subject to such depradations in his experience.
Mr. Hampton—I suppose they are to some extent, but depredations of birds are very easily remedied. I have been bothered by birds in times gone by, but am not any more. I have found that an easy matter to remedy. Simply take a small looking glass, tie a string to. the edge of it and fasten it up in the top of the tree or vine where it can have some room to whirl or turn, and I can guaran-
tee that that particular vine or tree will never be troubled with birds.
Member—I would like to ask if that applies also to lady birds? (laughter).
Mr. Hampton—I regret to have to in-
form the member that it does not. This will be found to be a cheap but most effec-
tive remedy against depredations by birds.

Report on Figs and Kaki.
By J. H. Wylie.
Mr. President and Members of the S tatc Horticultural Society:
Having been made one of the commit-
tee on Grapes, Figs and Kaki, I feel it my duty to contribute what I can. The other two members of this committee are well known to this society, and their practical experience in the past has been of an instructive character in this state.
Hence my little report will be conﬁned to our section and county. In grapes we have fruited several varieties of the Mus-
cadine class quite successfully, and be-
lieve them perfectly at home in any part of this state. We consider the following kinds the best, viz.: Thomas, Scupper-
nong, James and Flowers. We ﬁnd that the James at two years old will begin fruiting at the same time not retarding the growth, the fruit holds on until late in the season. We have also succeeded in getting very ﬁne specimen bunches of some of the trellis varieties, such as Niagara, Concord, Moore’s Early and Delaware.
H‘s.
My experience with ﬁgs has been mostly with the native varieties of Ce-
lestial, Lemon and Brunswick. These seem to be the leading kinds. While these all do well in our section I consider the Celestial the most valuable, as the-
tree seems to be hardier and is the most proliﬁc and regular bearer. The fruit,
though not so large, is very sweet and excellent for preserves.
One of my neighbors, Mr. Charles Francis, has succeeded in working up quite a trade on ﬁg preserves. About two years ago he began in a small way putting them up in fancy glass jars, and sending to friends in the North. The re-
sult is that his business has increased so until now he is unable to ﬁll his orders;
he ﬁnds it proﬁtable and is thinking of '
going into the business on a larger scale.
If we can succeed in producing an abundance of ﬁne fruit I believe there will be great possibilities in canning; al-
so in fresh fruit for nearby markets. I feel sure that if we would give the ﬁg culture as much attention as we do oth-
er fruit trees, the time will not be far distant when we will have as good ﬁgs in our market here as any that we can import from any other part of the world.
Kaki.
The Kaki or Japan persimmon is cer-
tainly a ﬁne fruit for home use, and also has considerable market value, as they are found in all our large fruit markets in their season, and practically all of these are raised in Florida.
In conversation with a man not long ago, who has been the means of estab-
lishing a colony in Putnam county, he remarked that the different varieties of the Japan persimmon were grand, and after testing the different kinds as to
ﬂavor, quality, etc., has become so in-
terested in the matter that now he in-
tends to plant quite an orchard, at least
40 acres to begin with, and in. the future work up a special trade on the fruit.
The right soil for persimmons is quite an important thing to consider, for while

the native persimmon seems to thrive well in almost any place, we have noticed that the Japanese varieties on sandy soil last much better.
For home use there is no better va-
riety than Zengi, the most of its fruit is good, while hard, and improves as it gets soft, it makes the best tree and is the most proliﬁc, and regular bearer.
The Hyakume, Hachia, Tane-Nashi,
Yemon, and Okame, are the favorite market sorts; they must be thoroughly ripe and soft before they are good to eat.
We must all agree that the Kaki is most delicious fruit, beautiful in coloring and shape, has ﬁne keeping and curing qualities and is sure to become a favorite in this country when our people become educated up to its peculiar characteris-
ties.
The Kaki.
By Mr. Wm. Macklin, Dinsmorc, Fla.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Mark Twain tells of himself that he was once suddenly and unexpectedly, in-
troduced to President Grant, and the only thing he could ﬁnd to say was, “Mr.
President, I am embarrassed, are you P”
_ That describes my case exactly, as it is only a month since I sent your secretary my initial subscription to the Florida Horticultural Society, and, before I could get my breath, he launched upon me the news that I must prepare a paper on the Japanese persimmon. I wilted im-
mediately and wondered if there was any way by which I could get that dollar back,
but decided it was gone beyond recall, and that I must do my best with regard to the paper, so I hope my immature effort will taste better than an immature persimmon.
The Japan” Persimmon.
From all the information I have been able to gather I believe that I have the largest orchardof Japanese persimmonsin America. It consists of about 2,500 trees,
planted in the years 1899, 1900. 1901, and
1902 and the remarks that follow are con-
ﬁned to observations of my own trees.
I have found the persimmon a very interesting study, as it has qualities not common to any other fruit tree with which I have had experience, and a knowledge of its habits is not widely dis-
seminated, or very easy to obtain, as in the case of the more familiar fruits.
To begin with the matter of culti-
vation: I have long ago come to the con-
clusion that the persimmon is better with-
out what is generally understood by that term. For the ﬁrst two years after I started planting I kept my trees clean cul-
tivated, but as they grew I found that the entire surface of the ground was literally full of very ﬁne hair-like roots, and that no matter how lightly the ground was scratched quantities of these were torn up

64 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
so I abandoned tillage altogether and for several years past merely run the mower through the orchards during the late sum-
mer and again in the fall, using the cut-
grass weeds to mulch the trees. During the ﬁrst season or two there was not sufﬁ-
- cient grass to make a heavy enough mulch, and I had to cut over some twenty acres or so of old ﬁelds and haul in sufﬁ-
cient to make up a coating about six in-
ches deep and cover an area as large as the limbs of the tree. I found this more ex-
pensive than cultivation, while it lasted,
but now that the sod in the orchard has become older and produces heavier grass-
es, such as broom grass, there is enough to mulch heavily. The ground under this mulch is looser and more friable than it could be made by any system of cultiva-
tion, being protected continually from the packing effect of rains, while at the same time the ﬁbrous roots remain undisturbed.
The trees are vigorous and healthy and make a good growth each season. No other fertilizer except this rotting mass of vegetation is given, and its slow and con-
tinuous effect as a fertilizer seems more suitable to bearing persimmon trees than any other I have tried, for reasons which I will explain later.
In large quantities for commercial pur-
poses I have only three varieties. The
“Hyakume,” “Tane-nashi.” and “Hache-
ya,” though I have also a few trees of
“Yemon” and “Taber’s N0. 129.” Of these “Tane-nashi” is the best market kind; of good size and appearance; nearly always seedless and holding its fruit better than the others.
The “Hyakume” produces larger fruit,
is more juicy and of a better ﬂavor than
“Tane-nashi” but not so clean and bright in appearance, and sheds its fruit badly.
“Hacheya” is also very large, with a ﬁne
ﬂavor, but must be kept till very ripe, as the astringency common to nearly all un-
ripe persimmons is more marked in this variety than the others.
The persimmon seems very free from diseases and insect pests. I started plant-
ing my ﬁrst trees in peach orchards that were badly infested with “San Jose” scale and although the persimmon tree is class-
ed among those on which this scale can exist, I could never ﬁnd the slightest trace of any attack by the “San jose” from the surrounding peach trees. Twig girdlers and borers give them some attention but I have not had suﬁicient trouble from them to make treatment necessary. My orchards are on pine land. In hammock districts where there are probably larger quantities of these insects they would per-
haps work more injury. The greatest evil that the persimmon grower has to contend with is the extraordinary propen-
sity that most varieties have for shedding their fruit. The cause is unexplained in any existing literature on persimmons that I have seen, but I have formed my own conclusions on this subject and whether. correct or not they may be of in-
terest. The varieties having a very deep cavity at the stem and a hard stiff calyx,
such as “Hyakume” shed much more than those with shallow cavity and thin more pliable calyx like “Tane-nashi.” I fre-
quently have “Hyakume” trees which after setting thousands of fruits, shed them all, while the “Tane-nashi” bears a fair crop. The preliminary shedding just after the fruit is formed is common to most deciduous trees that habitually set more fruit than they could possibly bear.
It is not to this that I refer, but to the con-
tinuous dropping that takes place after-
wards during the growing season right up to .the time the fruit is mature. After

b shedding it will be found that the stem and calyx is always left on the tree, 01
in other words; separation takes place only between the fruit and calyx. In the deep cavitied kinds the calyx will always be seen to be dragged down into the cavity before the shedding occurs, My theory therefore, is, that the strain produced by the resistance of a very hard calyx against being dragged into the narrow, deep cavity, tears the fruit off. Whether this solution of the mystery is correct or not, I am not prepared to say, but after several years of close observation, it is the only one I have been able to arrive at and it is borne out by the following reasons:
I. The deep cavitied and hard calyx-
ed kinds shed most. '
2. Any sudden stimulus, such as a heavy rain, or an application of com-
mercial fertilizers, causing a rapid ex-
pansion of the fruit is immediately fol-
lowed by greatly increased shedding, and
3. A sickly or unhealthy tree on which the fruit makes slow growth will in_
variably hold a full crop and vice-versa a very vigorous tree will strip itself of every specimen.
It is for the above reasons that I aban-
doned the use of fertilizers on my trees.
If applied at all it should only be done during the winter, so as to give the stimu-
lus time to abate before the fruit is set.
The Hyakume has a peculiarity—a good one too-—that I have never seen in any other fruit tree. The larger the crop on the tree, the greater the size of the fruit,
and, on the other hand, where a tree has only one or two specimens, they are usual-
ly under the average size.
Regarding picking, packing‘and mark-
eting fruit must be clipped from the tree like oranges, and should be fairly well colored but stillquite hard .A suitable pack-
age is hard to ﬁnd, as the fruit varies so much in size. When possible, the SIX basket carriers should be used, and are best liked by the trade, but some of the fruit runs so large that more than two or three cannot be packed in the four quart basket used in these crates. For fruit of that size I use the crate without the baskets or sometimes the square cucumber crate.
Fruit should be wrapped and in each crate I always put about a dozen copies of plainly printed instructions as to using the fruit only when perfectly ripe. These in-
structions ,I now have printed on paper bags, which the retailer can use in de-
liyering the fruit to his customers.
Japanese persimmons are slowly mak-
ing headway in Northern markets, New York taking them a little more freely than other places, but the demand is still very limited and large plantings would easily glut the markets. In London, England they are coming into considerable favor and one small shipment I made there by express, sold well, but the express rate was prohibitive. The following season I shipped ﬁfty crates, in two lots, by freight, and they arrived in bad or-
der which can only have been due to bad handling on the Atlantic steamships as I kept samples of both lots here, till two weeks after the bulk had arrived in Lon-
don, and they were still in perfect condi-
tion, though packed the same as the others and kept in our ordinary September tem-
perature. I can see no reason why per-
simmons, should require refrigeration,
even on such a long trip. Moderater good ventilation would probably be far better. Specimens will keep for several weeks while the temperature is still in the seventies and eighties. -
A point in favor of the Japanese per-
simmon is, that it will exist and thrive on

ﬂat-woods land underlaid with hard-pan,
where other fruit trees fail.
Their handsome appearance is another great recommendation. An orchard when in full leaf, outshines in beauty, even the far-famed orange grove.
I believe I have covered most of the points necessary to a grower, but I will be pleased to answer questions, or give any information in my possession either now or by correspondence with anyone who is interested.
Report of Committee on Vegetables.
By C. G. White.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Hastings is in the last quarter of ship-
ping a one-hundred thousand barrel crop of potatoes. The biggest day's shipment reached over thirty-nine cars, all heavily loaded.
It has been a season of big yields and low prices. Prices have been kept no worse than they are by the distribution of our association. The potato crop in this state is too large to be dumped into the North hit or miss fashion. Every barrel that leaves the state should have its proper destination and must have if the grower is to have the full reward of his labor and risk.
It takes a big yield to pay expenses when New York prices are under four _
dollars a barrel. Two days last week the quotations touched three dollars. This price means a net return of about one dollar and a half per barrel as the crop runs, and requires a yield of sixty barrels to the acre to make ﬁve dollars proﬁt.
However, prices have so far run better than this,-and the majority of the grow-
ers will probably clear up even or better.
There are many yields of ﬁfty barrels and some of seventy and eighty. These are ﬁeld runs, not favored corners, and are unusual with us.
The railroad service has been bad.
Day after day, when there were empty cars on an inaccessible track, hauling has had to stop to the demoralization of our working forces, and barrels have been piled up on the platform because all the cars on the switch were overloaded al-
ready. Finally, these ears have gone forward at irregular times, and it was a lucky shipper that got his car out of Jacksonville short of twenty-four hours later than the time taken last year. The railway “shares our prosperity” as the of-
ﬁcials put it, at the rate of sixteen cents per barrel to Jacksonville.
The potato methods are much the same as of old. An effective machine dig-
ger is much needed. And another rail-
road.
Late blight made its general appear-
ance too late to be of material damage to the yield. and the resulting rot has not set in because weather conditions have have not been suitable for its develop-
ment in that way.

So there are many people claiming that it is useless to spray. Some that have sprayed will spray more efﬁciently next year than this.
Prof. Conner has just dug some suc-
cessful experiments with fertilizers and varieties. Prof. Rolfs is conducting for the government a test of ﬁfty-one for-
eign varieties, hoping to ﬁnd a disease resistant variety on which to build a new and healthy sort. The foliage on some of these varieties is immense and peculiar.
One or two varieties cost large sums.
None of us wanted the responsibility of knowing which these are, for fear it would get out and the patches be raided.
It is interesting to know that the Eu-
ropean taste is for a yellow-ﬂeshed po-
tato. /
Concerning other vegetables I am not conversant, having but lately returned to the state.
This is my busy time, or I should ap-
pear with you at the meeting.
Celery and Egg Plant Report.
By F. C. Armstrong.
As the Florida State Horticultural So-
ciety has placed me on the Standing Committee to make a report on vegeta-
bles, I will conﬁne my remarks to the growth, culture and marketing of celery and egg plants, only, thinking that my brother committeeman, Mr. C. G.
White, of Hastings, would tell us how to cultivate, grow and dispose of the Irish totato to the best advantage and that Mr. E. V. Blackman of Miami,
would give us the methods used on the East coast.
Now, in Manatee county, we have thousands of acres of land well adapted to the culture of celery, it requiring a rich, moist loam for the best results.
The culture of this crop bids fair to become one of the leading and staple crops in the county. We have been es-
pecially favored by having had not enough cold to injure our crop or in marketing it.
The seed of the celery is very small and delicate, requiring, when young and tender, to be protected by a framework to keep the young plants from being scorched by the hot rays of the sun.
Seeds must be planted very shallow,
beds must be kept wet daily, and other-
wise properly cared for, that they may develop early and be good and thrifty plants.
In setting plants we put about forty thousand plants to the acre, double rows,
four or ﬁve feet apart, using from one to two tons of best fertilizer to the acre according to the nature of the soil, which necessitates moist, well drained land. To insure a good crop we must have irri—
gation, which can be had at a very small cost from artesian wells.
The average crop per acre is about


## p. 68 (#84) ##############################################

68 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
from ﬁve hundred to one thousand crates per acre; some instances going much higher.
The plants must be boarded at a cer-
tain growth and kept there till well bleached, and ready for market. It re-
quires about thirty-two thousand feet of lumber per acre to board it properly. Af-
ter the celery crop is marketed, the land is then followed by egg plant. In the meantime the seed of the egg plant has been placed in the hot beds and is now ready for transplanting. Here again ir-
rigation is very desirable, although not absolutely necessary. The cultivation of the egg plant is much like the cultivation of any ordinary plant, move the soil fre-
quently, and keep clear of grass and weeds.
Under ordinary circumstances and con-
ditions by May 15th the fruit is ready for shipment and continues till up to July,
when the Jersy crop comes in.
From six hundred to one thousand crates of egg plants are produced per acre with us. _
\Vhat we need most is a uniform pack-
age for celery. As it stands now, we have three diﬁerent sizes, one 12x18x22, and the Sandford 8x20x27 and one on20x2 5,
this last. we think, should be the state standard.
California uses standard barrel crates,
and of course it is regulated through the association of that state, and they have secured a rate which is equal to ours, we having the small poney crate.
I therefore, recommend that this as-
sociation take some action looking to the procuring of a standard crat:, and that a better and more equal freight rate be obtained. -
Vegetable Report from East Coast.

By Mr. Blackman.
Mr. President, as amemberofthecom-
mittee on vegetables, I will submit an in-
formal verbal report from my section of the state, the lower East Coast. Taking it all in all, we have had a most success-
ful season in our section of the state, the truck growers in better condition gen-
erally, and have gotten more for their truck than ever before in the history of the lower East Coast section. Mr.
President, I desire to emphasize this great and important subject, the import-
ance of the vegetable trafﬁc in this state It is, or it ought to be, a matter of com-
mon knowledge that the truck industry of Florida is the greatest industry in the state. It is, or ought to be, a matter of common knowledge that the truck in-
dustry of Florida amounts to a great deal more than all of the citrus fruit crops combined. Vegetables are the staple products of Florida, and an industry that should receive at all times the highest consideration and attention. I could, Mr.
President, give' you instances of enor-
mous yields and fancy prices for this sea-

son’s vegetable and truck crop from our section of the state. This trafﬁc is taken from our section of the state by the train-
load, to say nothing of_ the other sec-
tions. The tomato crop this season has been the best in the history of that sec-
tion and tomato growers as a rule have made lots and cords of money. There has also been good money made in Irish '
potatoes. I recall one notable instance where a trucker made nearly $2,000 from his Irish potato patch. Altogether, the lower East Coast country has enjoyed an unprecedented season in the vegeta-
ble business. Of course, the early cold snap set'some of the truckers back but replanting soon recuperated them and they got their crops to market ahead of everything else, and sold at good prices.
I would particularly call the attention of the society and the truck growers of the state to the Bermuda onion. It was at one time thought that this onion could not be grown successfully in Florida.
This is a great fallacy, as has been de-
monstrated by later experimentswith this crop, especially with last season’s crop.
It was also contended that it would com-
pete with the Bermuda crop and this has also been dispelled. The onion thrives well on the lower East Coast. It gets to market before the Bermuda crop of the Bermuda Island and is a big money maker.
Report of Committee on Ornamentals.
By Mrs. C. T. McCarty.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In our school days, long ago—so long ago that I dread counting the years which have since passed—we learned that one proof of man’s superiority over all other animals lies in his ability to rise above the limitations of locality. To the far ends of the earth, north, south,
east and west, he reaches out, and brings unto himself, what is called for, either by his fancy or by his complex needs. Look-
ing about with a critical eye he grasps the suggested possibilities of nature and turns the knowledge to his own account;
he sees on one hand a scarcity which he makes abundance; on the other a su—
perﬂuity which he modiﬁes. He, of course, puts forth the greater effort for material return, but at the same time la-
bors, faithfully and continuously to.ex-
press, in an alliance with Nature, the artist love, in-born in human hearts; that desire to create “a fairer creation than we know,”
to omit the pros; the details of nature and produce the spirit and splendor.
It has been truly said that “he who knows the most, he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the waters, the plants, * * and how to come at these enchantments—is the rich and royal man. Only so far as the masters of the world have called in Nature to

their aid, can they reach the height of magniﬁcence. This is the meaning of their hanging gardens, villas, garden—
houses, islands, parks.”
Before us in this fair southland, lie stretched out upon all sides, materials for attaining easily to a degree of that mag-
niﬁcence, for which these masters have struggled. It is my privilege to speak to you concerning certain of these materi-
als, and to lay before you such facts as a non—professional can glean from the ups and downs of several years’ experi-
ence with ornamentals. What I have to offer may not be new to you, neither may it seem of value, but if such be the case I can only comfort myself with the say-
ing of Daniel Webster, that “What is valuable is not new, and what is new is not valuable.” The territory concern-
ing which I speak lies on the west side of Indian River from Wabasso on- the north, to Palm Beach on the south. Oth-
er localities will be covered by other pa-
pers. and moreover I wish to be quite certain of my statements, that my words may carry conviction, as did those of the old German who invariably clinched every argument with the emphatic re-
mark: “I knows vot I knows, und dats vot_I knows.”
I shall also call things by their good.
common, every-day names, not. of course, that I may be the more readily understood, but that I may save myself some embarrassment? The foundation for all successful ornamentation is, of course, grass, and it is a very difﬁcult foundation to lay. For the grass goes,
“creeping, creeping, everywhere,” ex-
cept in Florida. Here it must be coaxed,
pushed. and carefully nurtured. and then perhaps it may not creep far. I can with the clearest conscience. recommend St.
Augustine grass. It grows readily in shade as well as sun, is a brilliant green all the year, and makes a velvety sod when close—cropped. Can be cut with a lawn-mower. St. Lucie grass is a ﬁner bladed grass, but is much shorter lived.
Of Bermuda grass I will not speak, be-
cause I am peaceably inclined, and know full well the war-like possibilities of the Bermuda grass question. No doubt there are some among you who fully catch my meaning when I say that there is always doubt, when you plant Ber-
muda grass, as to whether you have the grass or the grass has you.
Passing on to the fencing-in of the grass covered lawn, nothing is prettier than a well-kept hedge. If you want a low. thick, square-trimmed hedge, you will ﬁnd satisfaction in the Amoor River Privet. It stands, untouched, a tem-
perature of 24 degrees above zero, is evergreen and grows rapidly. It can be planted in single or double rows,
plants being from 12 to 18 inches apart.
The time for planting is between Ne-
vember Ist and February 1st. The hedge must be worked in spring and fall,
and orange tree manure used for fer—
tilizing. Some good results have been obtained with Arborvitae, but it is of slow growth. and while, according to Longfellow. “patience is powerful," it is not equal to an arborvitae hedge in Florida.
A row of Philanthus, bright-hued and graceful. is good to look upon, but it is with you today and gone tomorrow, if the thermometer takes a tumble in the night. Bignonia. sometimes despised be-

background of dark green leaves, all the year round.
‘ For windbreak, or tall hedge pur-
poses, the camphor tree is a friend in-
deed, while, grown apart, and trimmed to tree shape, it is a joy forever, because it is a thing of great beauty. The ocean winds can not blast it, nor the cold, such as we have, shrivel it. It grows in poor soil, not even disdaining our white sand,
which some say is no soil at all. It is neither a great eater nor a great drinker,
and is graceful, glossy, and evergreen and moreover can more than pay its way by furnishing the camphor of com-
merce.
Mango and avocado pear trees can be made to please the eye as well as tempt the palate. Both can be raised from seed,
provided you plant the proper end of the seed down, the pear preferring to stand where planted, the mango yielding more gracefully to change of location.
Both can get along without fertilizer,
but they do eat when they are able to dine with friends, the mango preferring to eat with the pineapples, the pear lik-
ing better the fare of the orange trees.
Neither tree can stand our cold weather,
so when your thermometerhas registered
24 degrees and the “eager and nipping air" has been “biting shrewdly" take your little saw and go out and saw off your mangoes and “alligator” pear trees
—short-—-if you ever want to see them again.
' Judging from the frequentrecurrence of the name Royal Poinciana in Florida geography and literature generally, the outsider might reasonably expect to ﬁnd this famous tree as plentiful as golden rod. But the fact is, that while many are planted. but few are seen, in the gorgeous perfection possible to the tree.
The Royal Poinciana is hedged about with enemies. The cold is fatal to it. In
1895 I saw a tree having a trunk twelve inches in diameter and a spread of six-
ty feet, go down in a temperature of 28
degrees; and while a temperature of 28
degrees is rare, the winds we have al—
ways with us, and a strong wind makes a Royal Poinciana tree look like “Polly”
after her celebrated tussle with the monkey. The Dwarf Poinciana is less of atrial than its Royal kinsman, yet carries much of the family beauty. It reaches the height of twelve feet, and,
planted in a hedge or in a circle, with the red and yellow alternating, produces a truly gorgeous effect. An every-day acquaintance which can be used with tell-
ing results is the Kumquat. It is hardy and grows rapidly, and in two years’
time its glossy foliage will be dotted here and there with those miniature oranges which never fail to elicit admiration and arouse curiosity.
Palms, of course, are the distinctive and characteristic glory of this section,
and the natural impulse is, to plant them in profusion regardless of everything but the dictates of fancy. This is es-
pecially the case among those who are fresh from the land where a palm is a possibility only to the millionaire or the
ﬂorist. My advice to palm enthusiasts who are just starting on their mad ca-
reer is this: “Stick to palmettoes, date palms and sago palms.” If, in this latitude you rely upon cocoanuts, royal palms,
and other fancy varieties, for yard ef-
fects, some real cold, wintry day will leave you with nothing of beauty where—
on to rest your eye, after it tires of con-
templating the frozen emptiness of your pocketbook.
In order to enhance the tropical charm of your home be sure to leave a corner for the giant bamboo; a corner where the gracefully waving outlines may be

seen, in true Japanese relief, against a clear green-blue, western, evening sky.
Toward this comer your glance will of-
ten stray. The bamboo can be rooted from cuttings, buried about two inches beneath the surface of the ground, in the month of January. But, as you value your bamboo corner, don’t let it have one dry 'moment for two years.
Like the children, I have kept for the last the best of all the game, and .in closing will say a few words concern-
ing my favorite ornamental—the rose.
Queen of the garden, she is yet with-
in reach of all, for any one who has a pump can have at least half a dozen vigorous, ﬂowering rose bushes. That is, provided the pump is united with muscle, patience and a high resolve to rise above- the pleasantries of an unbe-
lieving family. I have had roses on my breakfast table for ﬁfteen years, dur-
ing the greater part of which time they were the result of the aforesaid combina-
tion of pump and patience.
'A rose bed 9x14 feet will hold ten bushes and do well. In preparing the bed, ﬁrst dig out the earth to a depth of from 2 1-2 to 3 feet. Over the bot-
tom of this excavation lay a floor of old boards; ﬁll in above this, for two-
thirds of the depth, a mixture of old chips and leaf mold; then ﬁnish with about one foot of well rotted stable ma-
nure and sand mixed. Soak down thor-
oughly.
The best time for planting is Decem—
ber. I have never lost a plant set out in this month.
Never let the rose bed get dry and hard, yet do not keep too wet. Re-
member that one soaking-is better than a dozen sprinkles, and, when bushes are well established, one weekly soaking is better than seven soakings.
I always set out two-year-old budded roses. Some of my friends prefer roses grown on their own roots. We do not argue the question—I just keep on pick-
ing roses!
Once a month I give my 9x14 foot bed eight quarts of hard wood ashes.
Once every month I also give two tablespoonfuls of Painter’s Special Rose fertilizer, to each bush, working it care-
fiully into the soil and wetting down well. Once a year, in the fall, I cover the bed with a 3-inch mulching of to-
bacco stems, bought by the bale. In picking the ﬂowers cut every rose stem so as to leave one leaf next the parent stem from which the ﬂower stalk has sprung. Leave one leaf, not more and not less. Then the new growth comes quickly, and new growth, with roses,
means ﬂowers. There are no pests, in particular, to be feared, but there is no harm in an annual spraying with either water and whale oil soap, or water and pearline. using one package of pearline to ten gallons of water. Generally speak-
ing, tea-roses give the best satisfaction;
that is, they bloom most continuously,
in this climate, though certain others,
such as Chromatella and Clothilde Soupert can always be depended upon.
The following list comprises the names of those roses which I hold as “tried and true :”
Chromatella, a climber which can be cut back.
Clothilde Soupert.
Marie Van Houtte.
Bon Silene.
Catherine Mermet.
Souvenir of Malmaison Helen Gould.

er can summer’s heat nor winter’s frost deprive you of that sweet solace.
"God might have made the earth bring forth Enough for great and small,
The oak tree and the cedar tree,
Without a ﬂower at all.
We might have had enough, enough,
For every want of ours,
For luxury, medicine and toil,
And yet have had no ﬂowers.
Then wherefore, wherefore, were they made,
All dyed with rainbow light,
All fashioned with supremest grace,
Upspringing day and night.
Springing in valleys green and low,
And on the mountain high,
And in the silent wilderness Where no man passes by.
Our outward life requires them not—
Then wherefore had they birth?
To minister delight to man,
To beautify the earth,
To comfort man—to whisper hope,
Whene'er his faith is dim,
For whoso careth for the flowers,
\Vill care as much for him."
Report of Mrs. P. H. Rolfs.
M 1‘. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In selecting a subject, for the paper in hand I have not been as partial to the East Coast of Florida as were the gentle-
men who made up the program for this meeting when they selected the entire committee on ornamentals from among the East Coast members, but will brieﬂy mention a few plants that can be success~
fully grown in any part of the state.
Angelou“. Gudneﬂ, Book.
This plant is generally, but incorrectly,
known_in the trade catalogues as An-
gelonia grandiﬂora. Although there is a species, Angelonia grandiﬂora, this is quite rare. 'I‘he plant has been in cultiva-
tion for many years in the green-houses of the North, and has, to a limited extent,
been introduced to the South, especially in Florida. Its original home is in South America. In the green-houses of the North it is planted out in pots and then placed on benches~ where it blooms con-
tinuously and profusely.
I wish, however, to speak of this plant more especially as a border plant, and bed-
ding plant for outdoor work in our state.
It is one of the hardy and very promising recent acquisitions that will come into general favor very rapidly. It is unusual-
ly free from disease and stands all diﬁi-
culties which ordinarily surround decora-
tive plants remarkably well. The color of the ﬂower is dark purple with white spots in the throat. This makes it a very hand-
some, attractive bedder. It blooms pro-
fusely, and rarely attains a size higher than a foot or eighteen inches. It is bet-
ter, h0wever,'to keep it cut back so as to have it from eight inches to a foot high.
Side shoots are constantly being pro-
duced, from which new ﬂower spikes are thrown in.

Propaglﬂon.
Where plants can be secured from some other bed or by purchase, it is better to get them in this way. If this is not practica-
ble, seed may be obtained from reliable seedsmen at about twenty-ﬁve cents a package. The difﬁculty in securing plants in this way is that which usually befalls seedlings, especially when planted in a small way. If one has merely a package of seed, these are often placed in flower pots, carefully attended and watered for a few days, and possibly before one knows they are over watered. and the soil be-
comes water-logged. Then again, in the busy rush of the ordinary day, with fruit growers, there will be sonYe days when the seed are forgotten. By the time one re-
turns, the seed bed will be found as dry as sawdust. Even if the seed should not really be overlooked or forgotten, when the seedlings come up there is always the constant danger of damping off. All of these difﬁculties are avoided by securing large plants, which can be set directly into the bed.
By taking cuttings from a hardened wood, they may be struck and grown from cuttings. A much more preferable way, however, is to divide the old plants.
In this way little difficulty is experienced in securing a good start.
Planting In Bedl- '
In preparing a bed it should be thoroughly worked over and a generous supply of compost spaded in. There is really no danger of getting too much of it, or too much vegetable matter into the bed. After this has been thoroughly in-
corporated into the soil. it is well to wet it down, so that every particle of it is thoroughly soaked. The ground may then be ﬁrmed down by treading over the bed, and left for some time, possibly ten days to two weeks. This will give the fertilizer in the compost an opportunity to become thoroughly incorporated with the soil, and avoid the danger of scalding the roots. The top of the bed at the end of this time can be worked over with a garden rake or small tool, and the plants set into place. If abundance of plants are on hand they may be set in rows six to ten inches apart. If one has but few plants,
they may be set a foot, or even two feet,
apart. Then as the bushes grow large they may be divided and the spaces be-
tween ﬁlled in,
During extremely dry weather it is de~
sirable to give them an application of water once a week. or at intervals as the bed becomes somewhat dry.
Protection of the Bed.
This plant is of unusual interest to us because it will stand slight cold weather.
It has been known to pass, practically un-
injured, through thirty degrees Fahren-
heit. \Vhere there is danger of the cold becoming more severe than this it is necessary to provide some protection.
This would be especially so in northern,
middle, and western Florida. The pro-
tection can be given by banking the soil about the plants to a considerable height,
so that a large number of the lower buds are underground. Then during severe cold weather, a covering of straw mat or with straw will tide them over the severe weather. In central and south Florida the plants will need protection, only rarely if at all.
This plant begins blooming very early,
even when only a few inches high, and from that time on it continues without in-
termission until the beds are exhausted which may be a year, or even longer. For

this reason a bed of Angelonia Gardneri is always a beautiful sight.
Hibiscus (Hibiscus Rona Sinenlh Linn).
There are a number of varieties belong-
ing to this species, the single flowered,
double ﬂowered, pink, magenta, salmon-
colored, and even nearly white. In some cases the foliage is variously mottled, in others the corolla is of varied shapes. To the average fruit growers in Florida only a few of these varieties are known. They are all, however, equally decorative and equally easily grown. Cuttings of ma-
ture wood strike very readily so that they may be propagated in endless numbers.
I wish particularly to call attention to one fact that is very generally overlooked by people who live north of South Florida,
and that is that it is quite as easy to have these beautiful blooming plants in the dooryard during the summer months as many of the other forms, such as geraniums, fuchsias, etc. The difﬁculty has been that they have not been consider-
ed pot plants, consequently after growing during the summer, they have been allow-
ed to freeze in fall. On the other hand,
those who have considered them pot plants have not been aware of the fact that they may be set out of doors during the summer time, and then taken back to cover for protection during the winter. This is a point I wish to bring out especially. The Hibiscus plants should be grown in large pots, say about eight or ten inch ones.
These pots are then set out in summer,
“plunged,” as the gardeners say, and the pots covered with garden soil so as to pro-
tect them from being broken. and to hide their unsightliness. The Hibiscus will then grow and bloom profusely during the summer. It will do no particular harm for the roots to run through the bot-
75
tom or over the sides of the pots. In the fall when there is danger of frost or freez-
ing weather, the pots with the plants in them should be lifted and the plants cut back to within a foot or two, and then placed in a moderately dry house. Here the plants need but little protection. They should be watered sparingly, but not per-
mitted to dry out. Then as soon as the danger of freezing is past, the pots can be plunged again in the bed, and the plants will go merrily on blooming as before.
When the next winter comes the same operation may be repeated. ~
The Hibiscus which is usually called the Chinese Hibiscus, that is Hibiscus Schizopetelousjs grown to a very large extent in pots throughout northern and central Florida. It requires a great deal of petting and many times as much care as the common Hibiscus, and does not give one-tenth of the return in bloom and pleasure,
I would not be loyal to my home place,
Palmhurst, did I not include palms in this paper.
Palms.
Biologically speaking, the palm trees are among the highest of the plant crea-
tions. They are, likewise, the most beau-
tiful and aesthetic of plants. A ﬁne palm adds more value to the selling price of a place than any other single tree, not ex-
cepting the fruit-bearing ones. Of course we should not expect a grove of palm trees to sell for the same price as a grove of grape fruit trees. A reasonable number of palm trees, however. distributed at the proper locations about the home place,
adds immensely to the desirability of the location. In fact, very few palms come to _
their grandest stature before twenty-ﬁve to ﬁfty years of age. They, however.

show off remarkably well at four or ﬁve years old, and at ten or ﬁfteen years of age they will cause many a passer-by to wish that he “owned that tree.”
The difﬁculty heretofore experienced in planting palm trees has been that we have not known just what to select, nor how to set them out after they have been selected. We are apt to treat a palm tree very much as we would a jardiniere of ferns, that is, sticking it in some house corner where it can get only a peep of sun-
light now and then. The palms about which I wish to speak later are such as can stand the full glare of the sun without injury; they can be left out in the most tempestuous winds that we have; they can stand months of neglect, and come out smiling from this course of treatment.
Like every other cultivated specimen,
they, however, take very good naturedly to kind treatment. They differ from most trees in that the position of their leaves permits the free circulation of air, and the broad leaved, fan palms afford a good and cool shade.
With all theSe good qualities they have the still further excellent ones of being remarkably free from fungus and insect attacks. In addition to this, they do not harbor that most annoying pest with which we have to deal at times, the Flori-
da mosquito. ‘
In setting out these trees due regard should be had for the landscape effect.
One of these trees when once set out is almost never transplanted. Not that they are so exceedingly difﬁcult to transplant.
but their beauty being once realized, they are so valued that no one has the courage to hazard the chance of losing a ﬁne speci-
men. If the trees are planted with a view of avenue setting, they should be placed far enough back from the road to allow a full development of the leaves without the necessity of cutting back. For planting about the door yard or open lawn due re-
gard should be had for the point of view,
so that when these have grown to be tall trees the view may not be obstructed. The contour of a piece of land should also be had in mind, and the general character of the trees and other ornamentals about the door yard,
In discussing these trees I have conﬁned myself to a very limited number, and have taken those that will be perfectly hardy in all parts of the State. A few nice plants of hardy species, well selected,
will be found.more pleasing than a great variety jumbled together in a sort of horticultural museum. '
The three palms that I wish to consider are able to withstand freezing tempera-
tures, and live out of doors on the Atlantic coast as far north as Charleston, and on the Gulf coast to New Orleans. Conse-
quently, every land owner in the state of Florida should have one or more of each of these palms in his possession.
In general it may be said that palms need an abundance of sunshine, and an abundance of fertile soil although they will thrive remarkably well on sandy soils that have been moderately fertilized.
Cabbage Palmetto (Saba! Palmetto.)
—I mention this one ﬁrst because it is a native. And here I may be permitted to digress a moment and preach a curtain lecture on the fact that we do not ap-
preciate our native decorative plants sufﬁ-
ciently. We have in our ﬂora many speci-
mens which make the handsomest of decorative specimens, but simply over-
look them and cast about us for something that has been imported from distant and little known lands. I see that illustrated constantly at my own home, where many

native decorative plants grow in pro-
fusion, and our visitors pass these by without any particular attention or com-
mendatory remark. We are growing here, also, quite abundantly, a plant known as Australian pine, although it is not a pine at all. It, however, in a way resembles that group of trees. It is a straight, ugly, sprawling tree that scarce-
ly throws a shadow, and litters the ground with needles, and when it is done littering the ground with needles, it scat-
ters the cones or burrs all over the ground. This tree, because of its want of decorative qualities, intrudes upon our vision constantly, and because it happens to be from Australia, it elicits many com-
mendatory remarks.
The Cabbage Palmetto has been used to some extent, but not at all sufﬁciently, as a decorative plant for avenues and for the home grounds. Sometimes transplanting has not proved successful, in other cases the transplanting has been uniformly so.
It is one of the handsomest trees that can be used for avenue planting. It will stand an unusual amount of abuse after it has once been established, and has been put to all sorts of purposes, such as a hitching post for horses, stringing telephone and telegraph wires, and various other barbarisms that might be perpetrated upon it. Properly cared for it casts a very delightful shade and is always green.
Trees of this species can be obtained everywhere in the state of Florida. The most certain way of transplanting them is to prepare for transplanting six months or
_ a year in advance. The tree being chosen that is to be transplanted, the laborer is in-
structed to cut away all the roots on one side of it, so as to sever about one-half of them, permitting those on the other side to remain unharmed. In the course of six months numerous new roots will be formed on the side where the old ones have been cut. Those on the other side may then be cut, and the tree transplant-
ed. At the time of transplanting it is well to remove all of the foliage, leaving only the bud leaves.
The best size for setting out is one with a trunk only a few feet tall. A_great many cities and individuals make the mistake'of transplanting trees that have a trunk of twelve or fourteen feet. When this is done the tree has become pretty well set in its habits, and it fails to produce as ﬁne a top as a small tree would. When a small one is planted it adapts itself to the sur-
roundings much more quickly, and large leaves and longer petioles are produced.
In preparing the place for one of these trees it is well to use as much well rotted compost as your conscience will permit,
and then have some one else come and add as much more,
George Washington Palm (Neon/ash-
ingtom'a ﬁlifera.) —This palm is known by various common names other than the.
one given above. Among them are Cali-
fornia Thread Palm, Weeping Palm, etc.
Even scientiﬁcally it is not always call-
ed by the same name. In nurserymen’s catalogues it is usually listed as Prichardia
ﬁlifera. Bailey’s Cyclopedia calls it Washingtonia ﬁlifera. It is a native of California, where it is one of the most striking and characteristic of trees. In Florida it grows remarkably well for an introduced species. It is especially desir-
able from the fact that it will stand severe cold. Fine specimens of this species may be seen in Charleston, S. C., and in New Orleans, La. It, therefore, goes without questioning that it will survive any degree of cold which may be experienced in our state.

The photograph which I present here-
with is taken from young specimens that are about six years old. These have been grown under fairly favorable condi—
tions, but specimens fully as beautiful are produced in many other places. at the same age. From this it will be seen that this makes a very handsome ornamental very early in its history. When grown to full size its trunk reaches up to ﬁfty or more feet.
These plants can be obtained from nurserymen at so reasonable a cost that no one need be without several specimens.
Small seedlings can be had at ten cents each, while large plants, showing charac-
ter of leaves, cost only thirty-ﬁve cents each. It is, therefore, most desirable to secure the largest sized specimens and plant these out directly where they are to grow, so that they may become established and grow up with that portion of the door yard.
They should be planted in a rich, moist place, where the leaves can have a spread of at least twenty-ﬁve feet. In planting palms most of us are apt to be a little nig-
gardly about the space. This is probably due to the fact that we have been brought up to regard palms as conservatory plants,
where we see these specimens in a pot-
bound and dwarfed condition.
Before setting out, the place where the plant is to stand should be dug out and a liberal quantity of compost or rich soil placed in the holes unless, indeed, the soil is already very fertile, as occurs in a few of the hammocks and along our water courses.
When the plant has become thoroughly established, it should be regularly and lib-
erally fertilized with a brand of good nursery tree fertilizer. As the foliage of these plants is the desirable portion, the fertilizer formula should be high in am-
monia. Liberal applications of compost continue to be advantageous after the plant has become thoroughly, established,
and even after it has grown into a large tree.
Cull-y Date Palm.
This palm is technically known as Phoenix Canariensfs. I take the follow-
ing quotation from Bailey’s Cyclopedia of Horticulture: "P. C anan'ensis is the noblest of all Phoenixes, and one of the most majestic palms in cultivation. Its rate of growth is astonishing; a tree sup-
posed to be only ten years old had a trunk four feet high, three feet in diameter at the base, with about one hundred leaves,
forming a head twenty-ﬁve feet across.
Another specimen of about the same size bore eight bunches of fruit, each weighing about ﬁfty pounds.” This is one of the very best of the palm family for planting in the open lawn. When two or three feet high it begins to make a very pleasing and pleasant object, and never lessens in attractiveness. If the plant be well cared for and grown to its proper proportion it will increase in beauty from year to year,
and we need have very little or no fear of losing it from the incursion of occasional frost or cold weather.
This plant adapts itself remarkably well to the various locations in the state. Fine specimens of this species are growing on Cape Florida, open to the direct wind from the ocean, and only a few feet above the tide. In spite of the fact that the sea breezes constantly sweep across these plants they are always looking most heal-
thy and beautiful. It has been reported that during the recent hurricane the sea water was driven entirely around the roots of these trees, and yet they show no

signs of injury from the inundation. 1
learn also, from trustworthy sources, that President Taber has some ﬁne specimens growing on his lawn. As Mr. Taber knows a good thing when he sees it and
,always secures his share of the good things as they come along, we should take a hint from his example. Specimens of this species are growing also on high,
sandy land, which is ordinarily consider-
ed to be very low in the elements necessary to plant food. In the pineapple belt of Florida we ﬁnd these plants very frequent-
ly used. It is probable, therefore, that there is no portion of the state in which they cannot be grown successfully and beautifully.
Like all members of the palm family, it is particularly partial to locations with rich soil. When planted out it should be put in such a place that it can have a spread of at least thirty feet. Plants may be secured from nurserymen for twenty-
ﬁve to ﬁfty cents, each. These, when well treated, will soon be out of the way of the ordinary dangers that are apt to be met with on lawns or in front yards. The roots should be given plenty of room to spread, and if the soil is not already fer-
tile, an abundance of compost should be put in the hole before the tree is set out.
After it has become thoroughly estab-
lished, regular applications of a brand of good nursery fertilizer should be applied.
Report by George A. Purdy.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Having been requested to prepare a paper on Ornamentals for Florida, I have complied, though with some misgiv-
ing as to my adequacy for a subject so wide in its scope and one which has al-
ready been so ably treated in previous meetings.
My actual horticultural education in this state having extended over but a few years and in one location, I shall not attempt to give any general account of ornamentals, but will only describe my success or failure with a few shrubs and trees that I have experimented with on a very poor, sandy soil at Ormond Pe-
ninsula.
To you who have had years of experi-
ence and success on fertile lands, these notes will sound trite and commonplace,
but they may be suggestive to some who are wrestling with the problem of how to beautify their surroundings un-
der adverse conditions.
To begin with roses: To make these grow with any vigor in such a location,
I dig holes about four feet in diameter and two feet in depth. A ﬂoor of clayey,
marsh mud is put down, building up on the sides with the same, giving the bush what may be described as a large clayey bowl to grow in. This is ﬁlled with a mixture of surface soil, marsh mud and well rotted barn or stable manure when available, or with any good all around fertilizer, the surrounding bowl keep-
ing within reach of the roots much of what is apt to leach away on our light lands. Planted in this way and with

abundant water through droughty sea-
sons, the bushes grow strongly with vig-
orous foliage and bloom.
Besides the usual insects, powerful enemies are the roots of the Live and Water Oaks. With some labor these have been measurably kept out by an-
nually cutting a trench about the bowl,
but this is an onerous task and some careless year I fear the roots will break in and strangle the roses. Therefore,
plant roses many feet from any oak tree.
I wish to say a word here for one of the most beautiful garden roses, one rarely seen in our Florida gardens, Fortunes Yellow. There has been some confusion about its nomenclature. It is the fa-
mous rose of Pasadena, California, that has long been the admiration of tourists,
popularly, but erroneously called, Gold of Ophir, the true Gold of Ophir being the Old French rose, Ophirie, a more nearly perpetual bloomer but with com-
paratively insigniﬁcant ﬂowers.
Fortunes Yellow is perhaps better known in California by its synonym,
Beauty of Glazenwood, but by the law of priority the ﬁrst name is entitled to precedence, this rose having been found and sent home from China in 1845 by Robert Fortune. It is of a pale yellow,
shading into delicate salmon pink and quite unlike any other rose I am ac-
quainted with. Unfortunately it is al-
most deciduous in winter and it blossoms once a year, just as the Cherokee is go-
ing off, but it makes such a unique and lovely display of color—for it is a pro-
fuse bloomer—that it is worth taking any reasonable amount of pains to pos-
sess.
Speaking of the Cherokee Rose, one of its seedlings, originating in Europe a few years since, is said to be a worthy companion for it.
I only know of this novelty by hear-
say, but Rosa sinica Anemone is de-
scribed by the eminent rosarian, Edward Mawley, as promising to be even more beautiful than the Cherokee, being of a bright rose pink, unlike any other climb--
er and, like its parent, 3. profuse bloom-
' er, of clean, strong foliage and a good grower.
As to Conifers. We have had but lim-
ited experience with these. The Deodar Cedar is said to grow well about jack-
sonville and would probably succeed at Ormond on good soil, planted on the usual sand, a tree lived for a few years,
tried to look well, but ﬁnally starved to death.
Cupressus Knightiana, a Mexican evergreen Cypress of vigorous growth and elegant habit, with drooping, fern-
like, feathery branchlets and bluish-
green foliage, grew about twenty-ﬁve feet high in ten years and looked well for a long time, but when cut down to make room for a building, showed signs of starvation.
Cupressus excelsa, a Cypress native of the mountains of Guatemala, grew much the same way, but succumbed to the winter of ’94.
Cupressus torulosa, a Himalayan Cy-
press, grew rapidly but was ﬁnally starv-
ed out.
Cupressus funebris, an elegant, droop-
ing Cypress from China, promised well,
but gave out in a few years, probable cause, poor soil and perhaps cold snaps.
We need for landscape eﬁect in Flor-
ida, a tall fastigiate tree like a Lombardy Poplar but evergreen, possibly Cuprese sus sempervirens, the Cypress of the Orient may serve our purpose. Those who have visited Mediterranean regions.
or noticed pictures of Italian and oriental scenery will remember the stately effect

of these trees either isolated or in groves. A group of three, indifferently planted in poor soil at Ormond, only lived a few years, attaining a height of ten feet, but Prof. Nehrling of Gotha,
Florida, informs me that he has several beautiful young specimens, perfect col—
umns of dark green, the tallest of them at least twenty-ﬁve feet high. They re-
quire good fertilization.
Evidently a number of the evergreen cypress will grow well in Florida if plant-
in good ground or soil made good.
Retinosporas or Japan Cypress do not
ﬂourish, probably we are too far south.
Oriental Arborvitaes, of which hand-
some specimens may be seen in Jack-
sonville parks and elsewhere, have grown well at Ormond on well prepared soil, es-
pecially the variety known as Aurea Nana. Rosedale Arborvitae, said to be a hybrid of Retinospora and Oriental Arborvitae. Though planted in half shade, does no better with us than the Retinosporas. '
Some species of the genus Podocar-
pus may do well in Florida. They are evergreen trees and shrubs, yewlike in their appearance.
The late Edmund H. Hart, of Federal Point, had a ﬁne specimen of the broad leaved Podocarpus. With its dark green foliage it was strikingly ornamental. He reported it as very hardy against sun and frost. Podocarpus Japonica and Podocarpus Koraensis were planted N04
vember, 1903, at Ormond, in well pre-
pared soil and partial shade. They have grown slowly but thriftily and look healthy and happy.
Of evergreen shrubs, I have had ex—
perience with but few and those .quite well known.
Pittosporum Tobira—the dark green and the variegated varieties grow well Q with us as thoroughout the lower south,
making the air heavy with fragrance the latter part of March and early April.
A strong grower, the root area of a large bush extending ﬁfty feet from the plant.
It is perhaps our best exotic shrub,
growing rampantly on a rather poor soil with Oaks in close proximity.
Jasminum humile or revolutum from Northern India, puts forth its yellow fragrant blossoms early and often and grows well in spite of rabbits which gnaw the bark occasionally.
Rhaphiolepis ovata. This Chinese shrub, with almost circular coriaceous leaves and white blossoms—not fragrant
-—blooms in March and April. It grows slowly but surely and promises well.
Viburnum odoratissimum, makes a dense, compact bush, with leaves of a light, vivid green and white, fragrant
ﬂowers in April. A specimen growing here for many years was badly scorched in freezes of 94-5 but does not appear to have suffered since with plenty of clay in the soil it is one of our best ornamen-
tals.
Illicium anisatum or Anise Seed Tree,
native of Japan, makes a tall, stately shrub with fragrant leaves of sassafras odor, the small saffron-colored blooms are not conspicuous. This shrub threat-
ens to become naturalized, some speci-
ments more than holding their own in the midst of oak scrub.
Illicium Floridanum is mentioned in English publications as the ﬁnest and most showy of the Illiciums said to be a native of Florida, but I have never hap-
pened to meet any one who had seen it. Prof. Nehrling had a ﬁne specimen planted on the shore of Lake Audubon,
but it was destroyed a few years since by overﬂow from the lake.
Acacia Farnesiana, the well known

Popinac. As frequently seen this is a lanky, straggling little tree or bush, but if carefully pruned and stimulated with fertilizer, it may be made a very hand-
some small tree, suitable to overhang a footpath. Looking up from under the branches its delicate pinnate foliage, out-
lined against the blue of the sky, has a fairylike effect. This effect is enhanced by its yellow ﬂowerballs, which are not only very fragrant, but are put forth several times a year. In hard freezes the foliage will scorch, but it rapidly re-
covers. We should make the most of this tree as it is absolutely the only one of the Acacias that thrives here. The long list which appeared in Reasoner’s ﬁrst catalogue is now reduced to two or three. The famous Acacia dealbata of the South France, with masses of yellow bloom, will grow but poorly in Florida.
At Federal Point, the late Mr. E. H.
Hart had a specimen twenty-ﬁve feet high, but it never blossomed and nev-
er seemed satisﬁed with its environment.
It was ﬁnally lost. Acacias it is said will not grow in a calcareous soil. Lime seems to poison them.
This paper has about reached the time limit and yet I have only brieﬂy touched on a very few of the ornamentals for Florida. I have said nothing about the herbaceous perennials, annuals or bulbs,
having had but little experience with them. The subject of Palms and other tropical and sub-tropical plant-life is a large one. Something has been learned as to the most suitable species or varie-
ties since the time years ago when those earnest workers and pioneers in Florida ornamental horticulture, E. H. Hart and P. W. Reasoner, now passed on, and T.
L. Mead, still with us. gave those admira-
ble essays on Palms. Yuccas. Agaves and Bamboos.
The interesting “message of the woods," brought by President Taber,
emphasizes the potentiality for beauty of our native ﬂora. Prof. Nehrling on his estate at Gotha has demonstrated the value of indigenous shrubs and much mav yet be developed in this direction.
Home Grown Products for the Table.
By Mrs. H. H. Harvey.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
To one our state is a playground, to another a workshop, and again it is a haven of rest and recreation, where the soft winds, unlike any other on earth,
soothe the tired nerves and give one that feeling of—
“Nothing to do in this world of ours Where weeds spring up with fairest flowers."
that we all get after the proverbial ten years that entitles us to the name Crack-
er; but to the homemaker who must pre-
pare food three times a day for appetites whetted by the health-giving ozone of our fair state—Florida is a reality.
The tin can is sometimes a Godsend.
Let’s not condemn it entirely, but let us see how much of a variety we can grow here, that with some careful preparation

can be made food ﬁt for an American to eat. Milk, butter and eggs with all their accessories are to be had here in abundance and the best the world af-
fords. The sweet potato is at home with us; aside from the ordinary methods of preparation, we have the sweet potato pone and the sweet potato custard pie,
so nearly like the far-famed pumpkin pie, we scarce need raise that vegetable.
Cassava has many possibilities. Wash,
peel, grate, wash in much water,
use the coarse part for pudding, prepare the cassava the same way for griddle cakes, using only a small amount of ﬂour,
and it is a change to use one-half a cup of same in custard pie, using only two eggs instead of three.
Then the starch that settles in pan,
when it is washed, can be dried and used for starch and for ﬂour; for light bread,
one-third cassava flour and two-thirds wheat ﬂour make a nice bread.
Arrow root I am told can be used the same as cassava.
Both rye and oats raised in Florida are parched and ground and used in the place of coffee to the entire satisfaction of many.
The Yukon plant is raised and the leaves used for tea.
The Jamaica sorrel grows to perfec-
tion here. The calyx of the pods, when made into jelly, gives one of the ﬁnest products in this line.
The kumquat, after being soaked over night in soda water, makes a delicious preserve jelly and marmalade, and cry-
stallized it is much sought.
The orange, the still unsolved problem in our state, is never so ﬁne in any way as eaten fresh from the tree. Yet, there are a few months in the year when we can not have it fresh, hence we extract juice,
bring to a boil and can. Oranges are nice preserved and jellied, and a marma-
lade made of the juice and pulp is nice to eat with meats. A confection manufac-
tured from the peel of either orange or grapefruit is relished by all. We must not omit the orange short cake and the orange pudding so nice in the orange season. Slicedorangeswith pulpof grape-
fruit and sugar an hour before serving,
gives a toothsome sauce; then adding to this sauce sliced bananas and pineapples and grated cocoanut we have ambrosia that truly is a dish for an honest Ameri-
can. A cup of grapefruit juice in a cus-
tard for cake-ﬁlling is ﬁne. The grape-
fruit can be used in all ways we use the orange.
The loquats (if the freeze don’t take them) are a great addition to the table,
dried, preserved, canned with or without sugar they can- be used for sauce, pies,
short cake or jelly.
The peach is largely raised and all know its possibilities.
The Kelsey plums, peeled, halved and pitted can be canned so one can hardly tell them from peaches.
And the sweet, wild plum is used in many ways with us.
The ﬁg grows in luxuriance in certain spots in our state and is much used for canning and preserving and the ﬁnest vinegar is made from the ﬁg. Also yeast from the leaves.
Three months of the year we can have the Kaki or Japan persimmon, smother-
ed in sugar and cream for breakfast.
Pineapples, we can preserve.makeinto marmalade and with the aid of yellow cattley guava juice make ﬁne jelly: the peel washed and covered with slightly sweetened water will. in a day or two,
be a refreshing drink that soothes but does not inebriate. The guava is so com-

mon that we scarce need dwell upon its uses—jelly, paste, marmalade, etc.
The Avocado pear for salads and again cooked a little and made into marmalade is highly prized by the cultivated taste.
The citron we only preserve.
Surinam cherries we can and jelly.
The LeConte pear is canned, pre-
served‘and dried here to quite an ex-
tent.
The grape grows in most healthy luxuriance, and could we but extermi-
nate the mocking bird, bluejay and woodpecker we could grow the ﬁnest varieties such as Delaware, Concord,
Brighton, etc., but the thick skinned scuppernong in several varieties gives us a chance for preserves and jellies and the juice of the grape brought to a boiling and sealed will keep indeﬁnitely as a refreshing drink.
Honey is largely produced in the state.
Sugar and syrup from cane are manu-
factured extensively.
Bananas are raised to a limited extent
(it is jack frost who limits the extent)
but we have enough for a delicious ba-
nana pudding once in a while.
The raising of strawberries is quite an industry in our section and who does not enjoy a strawberry short cake?
Our subject as you see, is too far-
reaching—vegetables we have left for some one else to write about.
We are indebted to Mrs. Chas. Lewis,
of St. Petersburg, for suggestions re-
garding fruits raised in that delightful part of the state.
W'ith many misgivings have we pre-
pared these few notes. You know much that I have omitted, but if you kindly say ‘She hath done what she could,” we will feel repaid.
DISCUSSION.
(The discussion of Ornamentals was postponed to give way to the musicale tendered the society by the Ladies’ Fri-
day Musicale and was taken up Thursday morning—Secretary.)
Mr. Blackman—I was particularly pleased with the postponement at our last evening’s session, of the further re-
port and discussion of the report of the committee on ornamentals. The society is to be congratulated upon the able papers prepared with so much care and presented at this session on ornamentals.
“7 e have heard here a great deal on the strenuous side of the many questions and topics engaging our attention. It is just and ﬁtting now that we should turn for a moment to the amenities of life, and to the ornamentation of our homes. I have been around over the state a great deal, and I am impelled to say and it is with much regret, that there is not enough attention paid to ornamentals. This committe deserves the thanks of this society for their en-
deavor and work. It is a great work, a
_lovely, beautiful theme and a woman’s sphere. I am very much interested per-
sonally, I may be pardoned for saying,
for there is no greater pleasure at my own home than the morning’s stroll through my ornamental garden, where,
in company with my wife and daughter,
we gather morning after morning the lovely ﬂowers, the mignonette for the

lapel of my coat, as I go to the busy cares of the day at my ofﬁce, garlands for the vases of the festal hall and per-
_ haps to the- sick chamber of the invalid,
carrying with them a fragrance and sen-
timent that can not be expressed in words. It would be impossible for me to enumerate all of our lovely ﬂowers or the ones most dear to us. We love them all, as their sweet fragrance is wafted from waving branch or clinging vine. Personally, however, I do not con-
sider that the vine, at least in our sec-
tion, should be encouraged near the dwelling, as I have found them to be an harbor for the mosquito. For this rea-
son, I have set all of my vines at a dis-
tance, ornamenting some old stump or tree for instance, on the lawn or away from the dwelling. Again, Mr. Presi-
dent, permit me to say that the women of this committee are to be congratula-
ted by the society for their unceasing,
untiring work and achievement in or-
namental lawn and garden work.
Dr. Richardson—Mr. President, I can heartily second the sentiments of the gentleman for the lower East Coast. I do not think we pay half enough at-
tention to the ornamentation of the home; the home is the haven of rest. In there we seek and enjoy the sweet com-
panionship of wife, children and all of our loved ones. No time or money should be spared to make the home at-
tractive, and there is no surer way of doing this than_ the ornamentation of the garden and the lawn. The thanks of the society is due the women of this committee for their noble work.
Mr, Blackman—Mr. President, this is a topic I am extremely interested in. I do not arise again to make any extended remarks, merely to say that we would very much like to hear from some of the ladies present as this subject is one pe-
culiarly their own.
The President—The chair heartily en-
dorses the sentiments expressed on the subject of ornamentals, and begs to assure the committee on ornamentals that their noble work is most heartily appreciated and endorsed, not only by this society but by the state at largeas well.
Mrs. Geo. S. Gates—Mr. President, on behalf of'the women I can assure- the so-
ciety of our appreciation of the enconium on woman’s work as also at all times of your co-operation. I must say, how-
ever, Mr. President, that I can not agree with the gentleman from Miami, Mr.
Blackman, in regard to the ostracism of the vine. A vine is too near and dear to a woman’s heart as an ornamental, to be permitted to receive such treatment without a protest. (Applause and laughter.)
I ampresident ofa little villageimprove_
ment society \IVelaka, Putnam county,
and we have been for several years very much interested in the matter of shade trees. Our stand-by has been the Water Oak, but experience has shown that the Water Oak is a com-
paratively short-lived tree. It is, in my judgment, best to transplant the Live Oak and Water Oak alternately, the Wa-
ter Oak, which is the quickest growth, will give the quickest shade, later resigning in favor of the long-lived Live Oak which in 15 to 20 years will have become a thick spreading tree with a great gnarled future before it, under whose grateful shade and luxuriant foliage, festooned with great strands of waving Spanish moss, our great grandchildren may play upon the village green. The prere-
quisite of the lawn is grass and shade. It is here again that I would urge the trans-
planting of the Water Oak and the Live

Oak alternately, as suggested for the roadside and lane. Where there is a will there is a way. We have found the fol-
lowing wild plants to give joy and grati-
ﬁcation with small care. The Pawpaw a small bush, with greenish, poppy-like flowers transplanted in December and cared for and fed just a little will make a very showy plant especially in masses.
The coral plant (local name) a spike of coral blossoms with beautiful ivy leaf-like foliage.
A tall bush with blossoms like a lily of the valley sort of a huckleberry.
Wax myrtle beautiful for an evergreen.
Shrub or a mass of greenery to shut off some unsightly object,
The beautiful Koontie a fem-like ever- I green and many others with the treatment of the paw paw will at the expense of labor, make any abode a home.
To insure this atmosphere in our towns and villages we must urge women to take up this question of ornamentals. Men have never, as a man studied beauty—
it is a woman’s training to beautify and purify. You must have irrigation or you can not have ﬂowers, and this is partic-
ularly true of the thirsty, sandy soils of Florida, but it has truly been said that
“Where there is a will there is a way.”
Mrs. McCarty—Mr. President, I on-
ly desire to be permitted to offer a word or two further upon this important work.
I most heartily endorse the sentiments of the speakers who have preceded me.
This work is (as it has truly been said)
woman’s work. It is woman’s sphere,
and (while we appreciate the strenuous side of the question, as much as we ap-
preciate the full larder and wherewithal to buy things) yet it is but a matter of right that we should have an occasional half-day of the hired man’s time to help us in the great work of beautifying our homes. I wish also to endorse the pro-
test of Mrs. Gates against the banish-
ment of the vine. Mr. President, the home is not complete without a vine. As to the objection to the vine urged by the gentleman from Miami, Mr. Blackman,
that they harbor mosquitoes, I would say that I do not think the vine offers more of an abidin; place for mosquitoes than other shrubbery of the lawn or gar-
den. They certainly do not at our home,
for I have vines, and would not think of giving them up, and as for mosquitoes,
we have them too, plenty of them, all sorts, sizes and conditions. Why, Mr.
President, the mosquitoes we have are so large and so numerous that they “sit on a log and bark, and many of them weigh a pound." (Prolonged laughter and applause.)
Member—How many?
Mrs. McCarty—O, I don't know; never counted them. They are there though,
and all over the state for that matter,
but do not think they are any more par~
tial to a vine for an abiding place than other foliage. We could never think of giving up the vine as an ornamental.
Mr. Blackmail—Mr. President, I only desire a word—
Dr, Richardson—Mr. President, I rise to a point of order. The gentleman is out of order. It is the parliamentary right of the committee to close the debate.
Mr, Blackman—Mr. President, I only desired to capitulate and get as good terms as possible. The committee has entwined the vine around me, and I am ready to surrender. (Laughter.)

Peaches and Plums.
BY J. P. M Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I make this attempt with a feeling of inability to say anything new or worthy of record, after all that has been said here-'
tofore in these meetings and printed in the transactions of the society on the sub-
ject of Peaches, Pears and Plums.
My experience with pears and plums is very limited indeed and what little I may have to say will apply almost entirely to peaches. In our section pears and plums are very uncertain, making a crop about once in three years. The Excelsior plum occasionally will do fairly well. I hope other members of the committee can give you more light on these fruits than I am able to do.
Beginning away back in 1886, the year in which I set my ﬁrst three hundred peach trees, I have been growing and shipping peaches ever since these trees began fruit_
ing—some seasons quite proﬁtably, others a failure on account of severe freeze kill1
ing trees back to stump. or a late cold snap or heavy frost destroying the fruit.
Peach growers have their troubles as well as orange growers. In our section last season, severe drought through May and June greatly reduced the crop. Fruit small, cutting prices much below the usual
ﬁgures on this account. Root-knot, root-
gall, borers and San Jose scale we have had to contend with regularly for the past few years. This season’s crop is not regular with us—many trees full, others enough, some light, a few none, perhaps due to January freeze.
The warm month of March with good rains gave fruit a good send-off and at this writing (April 10th) prospects are excellent for ﬁne fruit. Young peach trees set in January of this year have start-
ed oﬂ’ remarkably well. I am of the opinion that wider planting than is us-
ually practiced is best. Most of my trees are set about 21x23 feet. The orchard set this winter I decided to try closer plant-
ing, setting them 18x22 feet, always planting the wide way of the rows, east and west. When possible to get them,
take standard sized trees, four to six feet,
cut back to about twelve inches. Cut off all lateral roots to not over two inches.
Set, if any change, a little deeper than grown in nursery in land well broken, if possible, sixty to ninety days before set-
ting time. _Frequent cultivation, with light applications of orange tree grade, or No. 2 Simon Pure Fertilizer from three—
fourths to one pound at a time every six to eight weeks, or say ﬁve times for the season. Keep all but three to ﬁve sprouts rubbed off and, if season is favorable, you will have trees six to eight feet high and spread in proportion by the last of Novem-
her and these will be capable of giving you some fruit the following summer. I usually cut these young trees back from

twelve to thirty inches the following win-
ter, deciding by character of growth and shape of tree how much to cut back. The second season I usually make two applica-
tions of fertilizer, in February and June.
Cultivate land until June or beginning of rainy season, when middles may be allow-
ed to grow beggarweed. keeping a good-
sized circle hoed clean around trees.
For the past two years I have been using pure kerosene oil for San Jose scale,
applying with small hand or mist pumps.
As I have only an occasional tree affected,
I ﬁnd this method effective.
ing or digging out borers, the men carry one of these pumps along with other tools
'and where a scaley tree or limb is found,
use it. So far I have seen no bad effects from use of pure oil.
Some trees affected with root-gall, I carefully cleaned out, cutting away badly affected parts, and sprayed with a very strong solution of Whale Oil Soap, just as heavy as it would work through the pumps, then put about two quarts un'
leached hardwood ashes right about base of trees, where earth had been removed.
This is an experiment. Present indica-
tions look favorable, but too soon to arrive at a conclusion.
\Vhen prun- '
I am growing principally Bidwell’s Early, Suber, Maggie and Jewels, all early varieties. Have lately put out about two thousand trees of the new yellow varieties,
such as Hall’s Yellow, Dorothy, Coope’s Golden Free and Hayward’s Rival, as an experiment for the Florida summer markets.
Up to this time I have shipped by ex-
press only. \‘V e hope to be able to try a few refrigerator cars this season. For best results much depends on careful han-
dling and packing. One of the problems is to get careful and intelligent help for pickers. A peach that should be picked to-day, if left on the tree until tomorrow will be too ripe for northern markets. Or we may err in the other direction and pick too green. Peaches arriving without color, tough and but little ﬂavor. go beg-
ging and the grower will be fortunate if he gets back expense of picking, packing and shipping, to say nothing of the ex-
penses of growing.
I believe peach growing in Florida. if carefully looked after, when orchards are planted in suitable location, will prove to be fairly proﬁtable. And I also have no doubt that new and better varieties will be developed in time.
Report of Mr. H. Fred Hole.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I approach the subject of Peaches,
Plums and Pears with a great deal of dif-
ﬁdence. So much has been written on them, and as the soil on which they are grown varies, so also vary the opinions as to their treatment. Therefore, before readingthis paper,I would like members to bear in mind that my remarks are not to be considered as an infallible guide for others in any respect, but are merely the results of observation taken from our own orchards and similar lands adjoining.
We began growing peaches at Fulton on the lower St. John’s river four miles from the sea-coast, in the spring of 1897
on moderately high Hammock land,

where the soil is of good sandy loam and rather dry, with a good proportion of humus, as the land was newly cleared for the purpose and trees were planted right away at a distance of 13 feet by 13 feet.
An old ﬁve acre ﬁeld was also planted in peaches—I5 feet by 15 feet, and we con-
sider this latter distance best, giving more room for cultivation and fruit picking than the former and still having a large number of trees to the acre. This seems desirable as the proﬁtable life of the peach tree does not often exceed seven years, if as long. \Ne would advocate pushing the young trees along the ﬁrst two years by thorough cultivation and careful. though liberal, fertilization. Varieties planted in our orchards were Jewel, Waldo, Angel,
Pallas, Oviedo and Dwarf Japan Blood.
Of these we have been most successful with the Jewel. \Valdo and Oviedo and,
in a lesser degree the Pallas. The Japan Blood and Angel varieties have draw-
backs which will eliminate them from any further planting on our part. The only recommendations to the Japan Blood are its late blooming and early ripening, in other respects it is unsatisfactory, being shy bearer, of to per cent ﬂavor and a. bad shipper. As to the Angel, it is an early bloomer, courting disaster, without the compensating quality of early ripen-
ing, of good ﬂavor, but rather too acid to be a favorite on markets.
With regard to cultivation of the bear-
ing tree. our practice has been shallow plowing during late fall and clean cultivation during spring, and especial-
ly during dry weather to conserve moisture, continued as long as pos-
sible without knocking off the fruit.
After that time orchards are allow-
ed to go to crab-grass for hay and the trees rest, after picking, till fall. Of later years we have put off fertilizing, till safety ‘of bloom has been assured, not be-
cause we consider this the best treatment for the tree, but because in growing peach-
es commercially one cannot afford to fer—
tilize trees which will be unproductive that year, nor does it seem very necessary, as the trees are relieved, for that season,
from the exhaustion consequent upon the production of a crop of fruit. The safety of the crop being reasonably certain, we have been accustomed to apply from ﬁve to ten pounds or more per tree of a well-
balanced fertilizer.
As to pruning, the young trees had a careful and somewhat heavy pruning of,
say a quarter of a season’s growth, for two or three years. After several bearing seasons, we found it advantage-
ous to cut back the trees heavily, forcing them to make almost an entire new head.
This temporarily reduces the crop of fruit,
but the following season a much ﬁner quality is produced and the proﬁtable life of the tree thereby lengthened.
The peach trele has about as many insect enemies and diseases as any fruit tree we know of and it unfortunately,
seems to have a less vigorous constitution to resist disease than most of our com—
mercial fruit, a peach tree succumbing en-
tirely, when the orange tree will exist for years in a more or less healthy condition.
Some of these diseases can be easily man-
aged, others are difﬁcult. I will only men-
tion three or four of the latter. San Jose Scale—In our case this was naturally ful-
ly controlled by the orange colored Spharostilbe Cocophila, so we did not have to treat the trees. The crude oil treatment was very successfully used by Mr. Wm. Macklin of Dinsmore, nine miles north of Jacksonville. His orchards were on pine land. An extended report

of that treatment will be found in Bulletin No. 61, Florida Experiment Station, Lake City.
Curculis—For this enemy we tried jarring—without much beneﬁt—then de-
stroyed all stung fruit for two years, but gave that up, as not a large proportion was stung and it did not appear to increase or diminish, though showing more on a light crop.,
Root knot—We have not been able to make much headway with this and so far it is only bad on land which has been crop—
ped for years before planting with peaches. We have tried several remedies,
but pruning and heavier fertilizing seem-
ed to do most good, though not always ef-
fective. '
Brown Rot is perhaps the most serious disease, interfering with commercial suc-
cess. While we have not yet treated our trees for this disease, beyond destroying all affected fruit, what opportunities we have had of observing the results of the Bordeaux Spray lead us to believe that good results are not always to be relied on.
A less commonly known fungus dis-
ease, called by Professor H. Harold Hume, Clitocybe Parasitica. is worse still,
as up to the present no cure for it is known. This disease is to be found in wild hammock, primarily on oaks of ma-
ture growth, especially water-oaks. It is much more rarely found in old cleared hammock land. Its ﬁrst appearance on peach trees might easily be mistaken for borers, as gum is seen exuding from the tree just above the ground. On examina-
tion no borer is to be found, but from this point downwards dead bark and wood are in evidence and lead to one or more roots which are discovered to be completely dead. The disease soon spreads to other roots and upwards into the trunk of the tree, the limbs being apparently the last to die. The tree appears to bleed to death from wounds caused by this disease. On our applying to the Lake City Experi-
ment Station for a remedy, Professor Hume kindly came down to investigate.
On examination of the roots of the diseas-
ed trees he found the fungus and pro-
nounced it to be Clitocybe Parasitica. He explained that it traveled from tree to tree underground, spreading from the ends of the roots of one to the root tips of an-
other. He gave us no hope of successfully
ﬁghting this disease, owing to the difﬁ-
culty of treating the roots. We found that taking the soil away from the infected part of the root-crown and removing dead roots, allowing the sun to dry it out, to-
gether with heavy top-pruning, was some-
times helpful, if it could be done in the fall and when the disease was not too far advanced. We have had instances of trees bearing some fruit after above treatment,
which generally fails to mature and the tree succumbs to the disease.
The peach requires very careful hand-
ling to put it on the market in good con-
dition, and too much care cannot be taken to avoid bruises. Good grading, neat packing and well ﬁlled crates are most es-
sential, but with these conditions fulﬁlled,
to get it to its destination in prime con-
dition, owing to its bad keeping qualities
(in some varieties more than others) also to picking season _being often hot and rainy. This is the time when Brown Rot gives proof of its presence, no sign of it showing when the crate is being packed,
yet twelve hours later under favorable conditions, most of the fruit will be found specked. The most careful handling of the crate is also most important and there is much to be desired in that respect after

the crate leaves the packing house. This however, is practically beyond the grow-
er’s control and about all he can do is 'to take his medicine cheerfully. We have tried both express and refrigerator and do not ﬁnd much difference to us. They both generally run a close race forthe lion’s share of the proceeds. Mr. Chas. Ed-
wards Russell’s article in the April num-
ber of “Everybody’s Magazine” gives some interesting information on shipping peaches in refrigerator cars, which is es-
pecially enlightening to the grower and is well worth his reading and considering.
It does not appear that the peach crop will be heavy in our neighborhood this season. We account for it by the large amount of fall bloom last year and the presence of Thrip in the bloom this spring.
In conclusion I would remark that the old idea of one crop of peaches in three years paying the grower is entirely ex—
ploded and further that unless he can put fruit on an early market and get the best prices, he will ﬁnd it a hard task to cover the expenses of growing and marketing them. Perhaps the latter is the worst to contend with, for then the fruit passes more or less out of the ordinary grower’s control and he must take what he can get. The fruit is moved very quick-
ly, a good market will often go to pieces in a few hours and the grower is lucky if this does not happen to his heaviest and
ﬁnest shipni'ents.
Fertilizers and Irrigation.
By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson.
O .
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject of fertilizers and irrigation are poss_ibl the two most important mat-
ters connected with horticultural pur-
suits in the State of Florida.
Some years since the writer made a visit to California and from observations of the ﬁeld there, reached the conclusion that
,the California grower had to pay as much for irrigation, which was an absolute necessity, as the Florida grower had topay for fertilizers. Since that time it has been found that for success and best results the California producer must fertilize, and the Florida producer must, in order to get the best returns, irrigate.
It seems that the merest tyro needs only to keep his eyes and ears open to learn all about the subject of fertilization. The ubiquitous fertilizer expert and agent is ever ready and anxious to impart all and even more than can possibly be known on the subject. The writer has no desire or intention to belittle or underestimate the fertilizer man who spends all of his time, and much of his money, to learn by study, experience and observation all that may be discoverable in his business, but at the same time it may be well to discount

his enthusiasm, as well as his bills, just a little. Any one who does not feel compe-
tent, after listening to the ever ready rep-
resentatives of the numerous fertilizing concerns, to make the proper selection has only to refer to the state bulletin, furnish-
ed free, and he will ﬁnd out all about it in the tables that have been published and republished from time immemorial, until they are, to some of us perhaps, more familiar than the writings brought down from Moses.
This committee cannot and will not undertake to lay down any rules 'of fer-
tilization: believing that every intelligent grower, after a study of his soil and a consideration of his stocks, can make a proper selection for his ow'n individual wants. It may be well, however, to say that the committee believes it is a well established fact that to fertilize abundant-
ly, and to fertilize frequently with the right kind of fertilizer and at the right time is essential to successful and proﬁta-
ble production. Fertilizers containing a high percentage of ammOnia during the wood and foliage growing seasons of Spring and Summer, and fertilizers hav-
ing a high percentage of potash and phos-
phoric acid during the fruit maturing seasons of Fall and \Vinter, are requisite to the fruitfulness of all kinds of trees and plants,
Some very successful growers cling to the plan of applying fertilizers only twice a year. but a large preponderance of evi-
dence is in favor of not less than three ap-
plications. By a judicious rotation and alternation of the ready-make mixtures offered by the various fertilizer concerns,
nearly all necessary requirements can be met. Sometimes, however, there are con-
ditions arising from environment, soil,
stocks, previous neglect, starvation or overfeeding etc., that may require special formulas, and in such cases the combined experience of the grower and chemical knowledge of the manufacturer are neces-
sary to produce the best results.
Irrigation.
The matter of irrigation is not a new one in Florida, and was practiced by many progressive growers prior to the dis-
astrous freezes of ten years ago.
\Vith modern, up-to-date improve-
ments in pumps and power, we can now irrigate successfully and economically.
Notwithstanding what has been done and is now being done, irrigation is still large-
ly in the experimental stage. Exactly what effect irrigation will have on insect plagues is not yet known to a certainty,
but it is believed that it will be beneﬁcial.
The over-cautious, or hesitating grower reasons that there are in Florida only six or eight weeks in the Spring when irriga-
tion is at all necessary, overlooking, or disregarding the fact that sometimes one or two rains during this period saves his crop. In the arid regions of the \Nest in-
telligent irrigation has removed all un-
certainty and the grower knows he can always year after year have uniform re-
sults. Plant growth and fruitfulness are so dependent on a proper supply of mois-
ture that no one can question the useful-
ness of irrigation, and the only question in the whole matter is—will it pay? We believe it will,

Report by Cyrus W. Butler.
In the line of irrigation my experience amounts to nothing, and I therefore have nothing to say.
Fertilizer: for Orange (hovel.
It is customary to approach this subject with the remark that we “know nothing of it,” which, though much nearer the truth than to say that we “know all about it," is still not in accordance with the just laws of Nature, who, we know, yields her secrets slowly but surely to all who seek her earnestly and faithfully. And who among us will deny that the orange grow-
ers of Florida have sought earnestly and faithfully for an answer to the question as to what my Lady Orange Tree will have for her breakfast this spring, her lunch this summer and dinner this fall ?——and who among the growers,of all thatportion of the world known to us, have been able to produce an orange so nearly perfect as the best of the products of our own sun-
ny skies, sandy soil and carefully blended food, Not that we would ascribe the peculiar excellence of our Florida oranges to fertilizer alone. for some of our best
‘ fruit has been produced entirely without artiﬁcial food; but to produce this fruit in abundance and, at the same time, maintain its quality is the question that has taxed the brains of our orange growers for the last ﬁfty years, with results that have placed the better class of our fruit upon the highest pinnacle of citrus fame. So,
theoretically, we conclude that the orange growers of Florida should know some-
thing of an orange tree’s food require-
ments, while, practically, the orange de-
monstrates the correctness of the con-
clusion.
Without going into the theoretically scientiﬁc, which is often more theoretical than scientiﬁc, I will give my present course, which is the result of twenty years of experience. involving some midnight oil reﬂection, but much more midday sun-
shine and observation—not to mention sweat and sandspurs; but the latter are forgotten as we recall the beautiful green trees, the sweet odor of the blossoms and the exquisite ﬂavor of the golden fruit.
While soil analysis may give us some partial pointers, practically we may con-
sider the average pine land of Florida as simply a lodging place for the tree, as its meals must be furnished from outside sources, that is, so far as the elements of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash are concerned; and, as these elements are generally considered the only ones neces—
sary to purchase, the question of composi-
tion resolves itself into the best sources and relative proportions of these elements.
Proportion.
However widely the different brands of fertilizers varied twenty years ago, to-day nearly all of them will run between two to four per cent. ammonia, with six to eight per cent. phosphoric acid and ten to twelve per cent. potash; and ita's probable that, within these limits, the necessities of the average grove, in normal 'condition,
can best be supplied; but it has long been a question with me as to whether the same proportions of these elements should pre-
vail in the three applications that most growers make during the year.
So I will 'give my present method,
even though it contains nothing new to most old growers.

Pint Application.
Just before or about the time that the
ﬁrst blossoms appear we make a light ap-
plication or not over one-half of the usual amount of fertilizer, containing about six per cent. each of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash—the nitrogen being from nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia,
the phosphoric acid from acid phosphate,
and the potash from a sulphate.
The object of this heavy percentage of nitrogen is that, while the trees need a maximum amount of this element dur-
_ ing the spring months, owing to our usual drought during these months, they as a rule get less than during any other warm months of the year; hence. I apply more and apply it in a shape that is available at once—the nitrate of soda ﬁrst and the sul-
phate of ammonia to last until the next application. I ﬁnd that trees so treated with this extra amount of nitrogen at this time will hold their fruit better and stand the drought better than if only the usual amount of nitrogen was used. Nor do I ﬁnd die-back to follow this plan, or fear it, provided that there is no excess of ammonia left in the ground when the rainy season sets in.
Ioooml Application.
During May we make a liberal applica-
tion analyzing from two and one—half to three and~ one-half per cent. ammonia,
seven to ten per cent. phosphoric acid and twelve per cent. potash, composed of sul-
phate of ammonia, steamed bone ﬂour and sulphate of potash. Whether the trees get the two and one-half or the three and one-half per cent. of ammonia depends upon their color—the lighter in color the more ammonia. and vice versa; also upon variety, as a tangerine will not only stand one-third more nitrogen than/r
‘/
round orange on the same stock, but really requires it, in order to produce the highly colored fruit necessary to command high prices.
Third Application.
If trees are heavily loaded with fruit,
by July we make a light application of equal parts of low grade potash and acid phosphate, but use no nitrogen unless leaves are light in color and fruit small,
and even then a very light per cent., as all ammoniates in the ground during the rainy season are by the heat and mois-
ture rapidly nitriﬁed and carried into the tree. In short, the rainy months are the die-back producing ones, and hence all excess of nitrogen should then be guard-
ed against. If trees do not have a heavy crop, omit this July application.
Fourth Application.
During November we use a liberal amount of fertilizer, running three per cent. ammonia, seven per cent phosphoric acid and twelve per cent. potash, compos-
ed of sulphate of ammonia, acid phos-
phate and sulphate of potash, which com-
pletes the bill of fare for the year. While the trees may not be able to use as high a percentage of nitrogen during November and December as during May and June,
on the other hand. owing to the cooler weather prevailing during the former months, nitriﬁcation of the ammoniates also proceeds less rapidly and, therefore,
the tree gets less, even though the same amount be applied.
Of course, the above is for healthy trees,
abnormal conditions requiring modiﬁed formulas, and for rough lemon stock one-
third less nitrogen than for sweet seedling stock. At all times we keep a close watch on the condition of the tree and vary the

percentage of nitrogen accordingly, using enough potash to combine with the nitro-
gen, which for the average of the year would be a little over three times the amount of the nitrogen, as all growers soon learn that. without the necessary percentage of potash, the wood is soft,
the orange lacks juice and what there is is insipid, to say nothing of the probable die-
back and possible gum disease and foot rot later on.
As to the indications for phosphoric acid, excepting so far as the thinness or plumpness of the seed are concerned, I must confess to being in the dark. Judg-
ing from analysis of tree and fruit, we are using more of this element than neces-
sary, but at least, in some cases, we have evidences to the effect that even larger percentages are applied with good results,
so far as amount of fruit is concerned;
and as yet we have not met with any evidence of injury, even from its ex-
cessive use. though we think that it hastens maturity. The good results attending the use of more of this element than analysis of fruit and tree would call for, may in part be accounted for by the fact, that much of the free phosphoric acid applied to our soil is probably soon com-
bined with lime, iron or aluminum, thus becoming, in the ﬁrst case, of questionable availability, and, in the second case, non-
available to the tree.
learn. of Nitrogen.
With the exception of what nitrogen is contained in the steamed bone and the small amount of nitrate of soda used in the early spring, sulphate of ammonia is almost our only source of nitrogen.
Guano, we ﬁnd from repeated experiences,
at least when applied during warm weath-
er, will cause fruit to drop badly. Blood and bone, cotton seed meal, etc., gives a thick bark with large pores into which the young scale easily get their sucking tubes and multiply rapidly; while later on comes die-back, to say nothing of the in-
ferior quality of fruit. The same ob-
jection holds good for stable manure; but,
as its possession has not been avoidable with us, and not wanting to waste it, we compost it with equal parts of low grade sulphate of potash and acid phosphate and allow it to thoroughly rot before using,
by which time the ammonia is probably nitriﬁed and combined with the potash,
forming a nitrate of potash, or combined directly with sulphur, giving a sulphate of ammonia. When so treated, we have used the small amount of four shovel-
fuls per tree, scattered outside of the branches, with good results only; but care should be exercised in its use and a watch kept for an increase of scale.
We use at least one hundred pounds each of the sulphate of potash and acid phosphate per ton of manure. -
The rotting process can be greatly hur-
ried by keeping the pile moist and making holes with a crowbar for admission of air,
As for gathering a part of the nitrogen from the air by growing leguminoid plants in grove, we have given it a thorough trial, resulting only in ﬁnancial loss and humiliation. Whenever we got a heavy growth of beggarweed, the rapid nitriﬁcation going on in the roots 'of the weed among the orange tree roots, has invariably caused the fruit to become ammoniated and split, regardless of our best efforts to balance the debt by use of potash and phosphoric acid.
Sources of Pete-h.
As the carbonates of potash are too ex-
pensive and the muriates contain so much

salt, we have conﬁned ourselves to the sulphates using either the high or low grade, as percentage was indicated in the desired mixture, but usually the low grade.
Sous-coo of Phosphoric Acid.
While we have not made any conclusive tests as to the relative merits of bone and acid phosphate as a source of phosphoric acid, we have been using and watching others who have been using both sources,
and so far ﬁnd no difference in value be-
tween the two when made available with acid. Moreover, we note that the preju-
dice against the use of acid phosphate is rapidly losing ground, especially with growers who are ﬁnding out that they have been using it for years under the name of “dissolved bone.”
The pretended point against acid phos-
phate made by some fertilizer catalogues,
to the effect that the sulphuric acid used in its manufacture sours the ground, is, we.
think, simply a matter of words, used to sell goods that contain just about the same amount of sulphur; the truth of which is easily demonstrated, but requires too much space to give here..
In conclusion, as the average Florida orange grower inﬂuences and largely governs by fertilization, not only the amount of oranges produced, but the size of fruit, thickness of peeling, amount of and character of juice, therefore, I repeat that he has learned at least a little of a desirable bill of fare for the orange tree;
and speed the day when he can say as much of his own stomach.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Pettigrew—Mr. President, in the matter of irrigation I have had consider-
able experience with artesian well water,
I had a good strong ﬂowing artesian well,
with a capacity at the well of I 50 gallons per minute. This would cover twelve acres an inch deep in twenty-four hours,
but upon practical application I could not get half of it. I do consider that for prac-
tical purposes I got an inch of water on four acres from my supply in twenty-four hours. I have about three thousand feet of cement irrigation pipe, with a hydrant at about every 200 feet. I also have 100
feet of hose and with the supply of water I can get the water tolerably quickly on the land. This artesian water is a sulphur water, but I consider it very good for irri-
gation purposes if you can get a sufﬁcient supply, but in the sandy soil of Florida you can not receive the beneﬁt of the water to anything like near the extent you could on hard lands, such- for instance as in Cali-
fornia. Iron piping is not best for irriga-
tion purposes in my judgment especially down where I am it is too near the salt water. They rust out too quickly. I have some Giant Bamboo which would make good irrigating pipes if I could get the joints bored out, so the water would run through them. My longest bamboo is forty-nine feet after cutting off the top to where the hole is one and one¢fourth inches in diameter. The question of irri—
gation is quite an important subject, and there is in some directions objections to it on account of the cost of a plant, yet there is no question but that a properly equipped irrigation plant will pay in the long run, for you are always thus sure of your water, and the water is what makes a sure crop. ‘

Secretary’ s Report.
I r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before reading my report, I wish to read (and I also wish to have printed in our minutes) the report of Mr. Aubrey Frink, who acted as Assistant Secretary last year and whose report was inadver-
tently omitted from last year’s Report.
which is as follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
As I had been appointed assistant secre-
tary to serve during the last meeting of our society, at Miami, in May, 1903, I of-
fered to assist Mr. Powers with the work in connection with the present meeting when he became ill a short time prior to his death. This I did by getting out a circular to members for last year. This circular was dated March 30th. On April
2nd, Mr. Powers died and I was then ap-
pointed by President Taber as secretary to serve until the present meeting. On April
14th, I sent out another circular to mem-
bers for last year and also to a number of other parties. President Taber had alsoap-
pointed Mr. E. O. Painter, of Jackson-
ville, assistant secretary.. This last cir-
cular was signed by both myself and Mr.
Painter. My account stands as follows:

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In making this my ﬁrst report I regret to have to state that the Society has again sustained a loss through its secretary.
We all remember what a lamentable loss the Society suffered when our worthy Secretary A. H. Manville ceased to meet with us as his service had been invaluable.
\Ve considered ourselves fortunate in se-
curing the help of Mr. Stephen Powers,
whose residence was unfortunate enough to be in the track of the resistless ﬁre which destroyed the greater part of Jacksonville four years ago. Part of the Society’s effects were burned during the
ﬁre at that time but this misfortune was small compared with the loss of Secretary Powers who passed to his reward on April
2nd, 1904.
Your present incumbent, on the 2 3d of last October, had the misfortune of los-
ing his oﬁice and its entire contents through ﬁre. taking all the Society eﬁ'ects then in my possession and leaving me without any record as to the memberships sent in after last year’s report had gone to press. My cash book. however. shows that I had to the credit of the Society $90.50 at that time.
I am glad to report that the library be-
longing to the Society is still in existence
' as it was in the oﬁ‘ice of the Times-Union at the time of the Jacksonville conﬂagra-
tion, and had not been removed at the time of my ﬁre. So though we have been un-
fortunate we have some things to be thankful for.
The membership of the Society has kept up very well although we are somewhat behind last year. I take pleasure in re-
porting as follows:

I would like to make a motion that the name of Mrs. A. H. Manville be added to the list of our Life Members. This is a small recognition of the services ren-
dered the Society by our former Secretary.
We all appreciate the work he did and I believe the Society will consider it a privilege to place the name of Mrs. Man-
ville on our Life Membership list,

Report of the Executive Committee.
Meeting held at the Aragon Hotel,
Jacksonville, June 2nd, 1904. There were present Mr. McCarty, Mr. Hubbard. Mr.
Painter and Mr. Taber, and Mr. Taber held the proxy for Mr. Phelps.
Report-of the Auditing Committee on settlement with Mr. Power’s heirs, was received and Secretary Painter instructed to make settlement with them.
The members and personnel of the Standing Committee were decided upon.
In making up the committees we had alphabetical lists and also county lists showing members, to work from. It was the idea in making up these Committees that we should not only put on the Com-
mittees members who were acquainted with the subjects with which they had to deal, but that the counties and divisions of the State should be properly represented.

Secretary Painter was authorized to prepare special features for the next meet-
ing. The number of reports authorized to be printed was one thousand, and Mr.
Painter was authorized to print them, pay for the same to be based on last year’s price per’page, number of pages not to ex-
ceed those ,in 1903 report.
President Taber was instructed to take up the Kerr resolution with the respective railroads, toward procuring transporta-
tion for oﬂicers connected with the Ex—
periment Station and Government in their work of Horticulture research.
President Taber took up this matter with the railroads of the State and was not successful in getting the desired annual transportation.
The Florida East Coast Railway had furnished Prof. P. H. Rolfs annual trans-
portation for these purposes. The L. &
N. Railway replied that they were pro-
hibited from issuing this transportation;
the G. S. & F., the A. C. L., and the S.
A. L. Ry., offered to issue a limited num-
ber of trip passes on the application of the President of the Society some days in advance of its issuance. These latter con-
ditions largely bar the usefulness of fur-
ther pursuing this subject.

pointed to take up this matter made out a statement as near as it could from the data obtained, which showed a balance of something over $80 due the Society, after allowing Mir. Powers’ expenses for post-
age, etc. This account was sent to Dr.
Powers at Ocala and a short time ago received $80.00 from him, which I receipted him for in full. The records which I had were all destroyed in the
ﬁre. The $80 check was turned over to our Treasurer, which closes up this mat-
ter.

Election of Ofﬁcers.

The President—The regular order be-
ing the election of ofﬁcers for the ensuing year, the chair will request Mr. F. D.
Waite, third vice—president, to preside.
Mr. Waite takes the chair.
Mr. Taber—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : The hour has arrived to make nominations for your presiding ofﬁcers for the ensuing year. I take this occasion to profoundly thank the Florida State Horticultural Society for the honor it has successively conferred upon me, in mak-
ing me your chief presiding ofﬁcer for nine years. I desire now to say that I believe the time has arrived when you should make another selection for your chief presiding ofﬁcer, I believe it will be of beneﬁt to the society to do so, and I de-
' sire to present to you, for your considera-
tion and for your unanimous support, a gentleman well known to you as one of the strongest and ablest members of this so-
ciety. I refer to Mr. C. T. McCarty of Eldred, Florida, and bespeak for him your hearty, royal support.
Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, this so-
ciety would most reluctantly, in my judg-
ment, consider the resignation of its presi-
dent Mr. G. L. Taber, under whose guid-
ance the societyhas prospered so long, and I desire to place in nomination the name of Mr. Taber for re-election to that ofﬁce.
Mr. Jones—Mr. President, I wish. most heartily to second the nomination of Mr.
Taber.
Mr. Taber—Mr. President. I beg the gentlemen who do me the kindness to pre-
sent my name, in the best interests of the society to withdraw it. It is my belief that the time has arrived when you should make another selection, and I would ask the unanimous consent of this society to consider the nomination of the gentleman I have just presented to you,
Mr. C. T. McCarty.
Mr. Blackman—It appears that Mr.
Taber desires and wishes that his name be withdrawn and in doing so I will also move that the nomination be closed and that the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for Mr.
C. T. McCarty of Eldred, for president.
Mr. Waite—-The nomination prevails,
the secretary will cast the vote.
Mr, Painter—The secretary casts the unanimous vote of the society for Mr.
C. T. McCarty for president.
Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a great honor you have conferred upon me to succeed our worthy president,
Mr. Taber, whom we have all learned to honor and to love for his untiring devo-
tion to the interests f this society. If there had been an intention to urge my- name be-
fore this society for any ofﬁce in opposi-
tion to the interests of this society. If there Mr. Taber, and you should entertain the opinion that I would have permitted it, I wish to assure you that it is a mistaken idea. I could never have allowed my name to have been presented had I not known that the determination of Mr.
Taber not to further accept this honor at your hands, was irrevocable. I shall en-
deavor to the best of my ability to make

you a fair and impartial presiding oﬂicer.
My chief aim shall at all times be the ad-
vancement of the interests of your wel-
fare and that of this society, at least for the year for which I have been elected for I wish now to assure you that I have no ambition to serve for such a great length of time as has been the case with our esteem-
ed ex-president. Again I thank you.
(Applause)
The names of Dr. C. W. Richardson,
G. W. Wilson and G. F. Kerr being placed in nomination, the secretary cast the unanimous vote of the society for their election.
The name of Mr. E. O. Painter was placed in nomination for secretary and the assistant secretary was instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for his election.
The name of W. S. Hart was placed in nomination for treasurer and the secretary was instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for his election.
The names of Rev. Lyman Phelps, E.
S. Hubbard and G. L. Taber were placed in nomination for the executive committee and the secretary instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for their election.
Next Place of Meeting.
Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, the next order of business must of necessity be the ﬁxing of the time and place of holding our next annual session. I wish to extend to the society a most cordial invitation to hold its next annual session on the lower east coast, in that magic little city Miami.
I am authorized and commissioned by the Mayor and Board of Trade of the city of Miami to urge upon your consideration this invitation. We want you to come down to Miami. We want to show you what we have been doing down there, and
(as a measure of what you may expect)
I stand here to assure you that your mem-
bership will be increased by this selection,
and you will have more money in your treasury than you ever did have. This was the case when you held your session in Miami once and it will be so again. I am here to promise you, in addition, the lowest railroad rates that you ever heard of to enable you to reach Miami, and to promise you one of the ﬁnest excursions on our bays and rivers, and through our deep sea channel out to the broad ex-
panse of the Atlantic, besides many other good things too numerous to mention in detail at this time. I want to say though,
Mr. President, that Miami wants this so—
ciety to hold its next annual session within her hospitable gates, and I sincerely hope you will accept her invitation.
Mr. Richardson (of Miami.)—Mr.
President, I rise to second the invitation of Mr. Blackman, we desire this society to hold its next annual session at Miami,
and will use our utmost endeavor to make your session a pleasurable and proﬁtable one.

The President—The chair would like to announce that we have with us Capt.
Garner president of the Jacksonville Board of Trade, who desires to oﬁer a few remarks upon the question before the so-
ciety.
Capt Garner—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen. On behalf of the Jack-
sonville Board of Trade and business in-
terests of the city of Jacksonville, I desire to extend to you a most cordial invitation to hold your next annual session in the city of Jacksonville, in the auditorium of the Board of Trade. Jacksonville has been in the past, as she will ever will be in the future, your sincere friend, a friend to your every interest. She appreciates the great work you are doing for our fair State, and we promise you the best and cheapest rates of transportation that can be offered. Jacksonville is the geographi-
cal center of the state; as in ancient days it was said that all roads led to Rome, so it is with Jacksonville; all roads of Florida lead to Jacksonville. It is the most central point you could select, we extend to you always a hearty welcome; Jacksonville is essentially a convention meeting city.
When the time arrives that you can con—
sider the adoption of a permanent place for your annual meetings we would gladly welcome you, and rejoice with you should you determine to erect 'for yourself a building in the city of Jacksonville and have your own permanent home with us.
However. Mr. President,I wish to say that your best interests should ﬁrst be consid-
ered. If (in the judgment of the society)
its interests would be enhanced by meeting at some other of our sister cities, we should have nought to say detrimental to such a course, for we do not wish to ap-
pear selﬁsh. All that we desire is for you to know and feel that we want you to meet with us, and we will at all times use our best endeavor to make your sojourn with us of proﬁt as well as pleasure. Of one thing be assured; that the latch string of the folding doors of the auditorium hangs on the outside, and you are always welcome.
The President—The society begs to ex-
press its appreciation of the kind invita-
tions extended for the holding of its next annual session. There are two candidates before you, Jacksonville and Miami, a mo-
tion to close the nomination prevails. You will prepare your ballots.
Mr. Painter—Mr. President, the ballots have been prepared, cast and counted.
Jacksonville receives 41 and Miami 24.
The President—It has been decided by ballot that our next annual session will be held in Jacksonville. The date will be
ﬁxed by the executive committee.

Report of Committee on Transportation.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your committee begs to submit the fol-
lowing report: '
First—Owing to absence from the state of one of -the committee, and the inability to locate the other, there was no advisory action.
Second—We took up the matter of transportation by asking all the several roads centering here for a rate of one cent per mile each way for actual miles traveled. These several requests were all referred to the General Committee on Transportation at Atlanta and was, replied to by Mr. Jos. Richardson, secretary.
\Ve spent two months trying to get some concessions to the members of our so—
ciety, but all to no effect. We asked ﬁnal-
ly to make the rate available only to the members holding certiﬁcates of 1905, but this too was rejected. \Ve are sorry that our efforts have not brought better re-
sults.
All of which is respectfully submitted,

ciety’s affairs, his uniform courtesy and aimess when presiding, his earnest labor for the advancement of the society’s in-
terests at all times, believing that the high position attained by the Florida Horticul-
tural Society among similar societies un-
der his administration, has been largely, if not mainly, due to his constant efforts in its behalf.
The resolution was adopted unanimous-
ly by a rising vote of the members of the society,
Dr. Kerr, chairman of the Committee of Legislation introduced the following resolution which was adopted:
WHEREAS: The attention of the Flori-
da State Horticultural Society has been called to the serious menace to the citrus interests of the State by the unchecked ravages of the White Fly in some locali-
ties and the danger of its introduction throughout the State; Therefore, be it RESOLVED; that the Florida State Horticultural Society heartily endorses all reasonable measures for the eradication of the White Fly.
GEo. KERR,

C. T. MCCARTY.
Mr. Connor—I move that the Secre-
tary be empowered to secure a copy of the pending law in regard to the White Fly and incorporate in his annual report of the proceedings so that we may know something of what this- measure is.
Carried. This law will be found printed in full in the last pages of this report.
Mr. C. T. McCarty—Mr. President, I have here a resolution which. I have been requested to offer which I hope the So-
ciety will see perfectly right and proper to adopt. The following resolutions were then adopted;
\VHEREAs, The Cuban Reciprocity has had the effect of increasing the price of sugar to the American Consumer, and and not increased the price paid the Cuban Producer,—and WHEREAS, The reciprocal treaty hashad the same effect upon fruits and vege-
tables produced in Cuba, and sold in America, and \
WHEREAs, Florida is largely engaged in the production of similar fruits and vegetables, and believing the Reciprocal treaty reduces the price to the producer of American or Cuban Agricultural or Horticultural products, and increases the cost of same to the American Consumer,
THEREFORE, Be it resolved: That we request our Representatives in Congress to use their best efforts and inﬂuence to repeal the Cuban reciprocal treaty.
BE IT FURTHER REsoLVEn: That a copy of these resolutions be sent to each of our Representatives and Sena-
tors.

For the Preservation of Our Forests.
Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, I would like to ask the unanimous consent of the society for permission to present out of the regular order, a matter now in the hands of Mr. G. W. \Vilson, our second vice-president, pertaining to the important matter of forestry preservation. This is a matter that very properly comes before this society. It is an important matter upon which every State is seeking needed legislation,
The President—There is no objection,
by unanimous consent the rules are waived. The society will hear Mr, Wil-
son.
Mr. \Vilson—Mr. President. The mat-
ter of legislation upon forest preservation has been before the various legislatures of the several States for several years.
The time has arrived when it is almost im-
perative that some needful legislation shall be enacted if possible in our State.
The reason that I have asked permission to appear before you in this behalf at this time, is because the Florida legislature is now in session, there remaining only about three more weeks of the session, and it is important that this matter be pressed as urgently as may be to the enactment of some measure into a forestry law.
This matter is urgently pressed by the Ag-
ricultural Department at Washington in all States where there has not been a for-
estry law enacted. Some good measure is also called for in our State by the lumber-
man, the cattleman and the naval stores people. I will now read you this com-
munication and proposed measure and ask for such endorsement by the society as the same merits.
Titusville, Fla., May 9, 1905.
Pres. Fla. Horticultural Society,
Jacksonville, Fla.
Dear Sir:
It seems to me that steps should be taken to urge the present State Legislature to pass laws to protect the pine trees and other trees from foolish destruction. It seems foolish to allow the turpentine men from other states, who have little real in-
terests in the welfare of Florida. to come here and put more than one box in a tree and to box trees under 5 or 6 inches in diameter. \Ve criticise other countries for allowing destruction of the rubber and

chincona trees, and at the same time we allow the destruction of our useful pines by turpentine and lumber men who are looking only to their present gains. All organizations interested in the prosperity of the state should combine in efforts to regulate these matters and protect the trees.
Very sincerely,
Lours A. LYMAN.
Address; -
Melbourne, Fla.
The President—Upon discussion of this matter, it appears to be the sense of of the society that the matter should be referred to a special committee on legisla-
tion, to be composed of the present legis-
lative committee with two members added thereto, with power to act. The chair will therefore name as those additional mem-
bers, Mr. G. W. Wilson and Mr. C. T.
McCarty. The chair believes that this special committee of ﬁve, as now con-
stituted, with Mr. Wilson as its chair-
man be able, not only to handle this meas-
ure, but any other effecting the interests of the Florida State Horticultural Society now before'the legislature to the best in-
terests of the society and State as well,
Grove Protection at Time of Cold Waves.
By W. S. Hart.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Can we protect our groves, crop and trees, from injury when, as some one has put it, “a cold wave a thousand miles wide and ten miles deep sweeps down on us from the far Dakotas?” Can we do this proﬁtably?
If so, how?
Nearly every orange grower of this state, except in the extreme southern por-
tion, has asked himself and others these questions yet, until well within the present decade, the answer has been uncertain and accompanied with many “if’s.”
I believe it is now possible to cite a suf-
ﬁcient number of successful cases, under widely varying conditions, to warrant the assertion that the ﬁrst two can be an-
swered with a single aﬂirmative.
The third may be answered differently by different people but I feel sure that the method I shall advocate, though- not per-
fect, may still be made to answer our needs until a better one is discovered. As evi-
dence best known to me I will cite some of my own experience in support of the ﬁrst two propositions.
During the winter of 1901-2 I saved
$2,000 worth of fruit at an expense of not over $65.00 and during the past win-
ter, ﬁghting four nights in succession with mercury ranging as low as 18 degrees above, and a gale of wind from the north all the ﬁrst night, a heavy wind from the south much of the second night and light

IIO FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
northwest winds the other two, I saved much of the fruit that still remained on the trees in a perfectly sound condition,
to a still greater value at an expense of about $160 as nearly as I can ﬁgure it.
Nor is this all as my trees were fully protected from injury and now bearing heavy crops of fruit while the unprotected trees lost all their foliage and some of their wood and are now but scantily cov-
ered and carying but light crops, many trees no fruit at all.
I am satisﬁed that by ﬁring my groves I have saved more of value in the coming crop than in that of the past season.
But, ﬁguring on what has already been realized, I can safely say that after all pro-
tective measures up to date have been al-
lowed for, and I still have fuel to last a week in case of cold spells, I have cleared at least several thousand dollars on ripe fruit alone.
Just bear in mind that comparatively few people save a surplus of even one or two thousand dollars in a whole lifetime of struggle and hardships, that the cost of protection is no more than any energetic man can easily wt in one, two or three years and he may do the work of prepara-
tion himself, bear in mind that the orange tree retains its leaves three years under normal conditions and that even if the wood and fruit could escape injury the loss of all this foliage at one time is a heavy shock that means less proﬁt for the coming year, don’t forget the peace of mind that comes of being prepared and the assurance that you may safely hold at least a portion of your fruit for the high prices late in the season rather than take desperate chances between the Devil of a cold wave and the deep sea of glutted markets that may rob the improvident of their season’s income, or even the rewards of years of strenuous effort, by killing their trees to the ground while they mean but proﬁt to you if you but act your part vigorously at the right time. Bear in mind that in most parts of the orange belt of this state years may intervene between the seasons calling for protection, even for the fruit, giving a chance to spread the expense of preparation over a considerable time.
Bear in mind that the ablest and most successful business men of the world deem it good business prudence to take liberal advantage of insurance opportunities both on person and property. Bear in mind the chagrin as well as hardship, that comes to him who fails. while others with like opportunities succeed about him. Bear in mind that realty values, the prosperity of the state and every interest in it are deeply involved.
Yes, let us carefully consider all these things and the many more that will sug—
gest themselves to us and then ask our-
selves if it does not promise fair returns in any case and splendid proﬁt in Some to prepare for the cold waves that are sure to come sooner or later and when they do come be ready and on the spot to put up a good ﬁght for our own?
Twenty acres protected means a whole lot if others lose their trees, ten acres of good bearing trees when Florida’s crop is mostly cut off means a good income, an acre, or even a half acre, means much to the man too poor or feeble to protect more.
How shall we do it?
I will not stop to describe the many more or less effective plans that have been tried throughout this state and California,
as even the best of them, with the ex-
ception of that of building small ﬁres in
.and about the groves possess drawbacks that must yet be overcome to bring either

ers.
Let us then consider this plan of prepar-
ing to build a small ﬁre' to each tree so as to warm all the air in the groves as the,
in my opinion, only effective one with large trees within the reach of all growers,
though small trees I would bank with clean earth and leave them to take their chances without ﬁres.
At our meeting here in Jacksonville in
1896 Rev. D. 0. Davies enthusiastically rep0rted a very good measure of success in saving a portion of his grove at Micanopy from destruction in the winter of 1894-95 by building a “conﬂagration”
on the north and west sides and smaller
ﬁres here and there through it.
He named his plan “The plan of the three P’s, Preparation, Promptness,
Perseverance.” Mr. Kinney of Pierson carried some of his trees and fruit through the same winter in sound condition though the state lost ﬁfty to eighty mil-
lions of dollars’ worth of property value in citrus groves by the cold of a few hours.
Mr. Kinney’s plan was far more economi-
cal than that of Rev. Davies as he used smaller ﬁres but more of them. By his request his success at that time, and dur-
ing the two following seasons, were re-
ported to this society at its meeting in
1898 they being the most notable ever attained in this country in that line of effort up to that date.
Both of these lamented friends and fel-
low members have passed on to their re-
ward but their work lives after them.
Prof. J. G. McKinney gave us a very valuable paper on grove protection at our meeting here in Jacksonville in 1900 in which, among other good things, he gave us his experiments with small ﬁres to the leeward of each tree with a windbreak on the other side so constructed as to cause wind eddies that drew the heat through i the tree and upward to its top.
Mr. S. C. Warner, whom I hope is here present, has this plan in effective operation and with marked success during the cold spell of January last.
California has given us much of value through her work and careful reports in thisline and therethese small ﬁres, in what-
ever way they may be made, have proven most effective in warding off injury from cold.
Through results obtained from the practice of this method of protection has come new courage and new conﬁdence to those who realize that only by effective protective measures could we hope to put orange growing on a basis of safety that would more surely warrant theinvestment of capital than at any time in the‘- past,
throughout the section of the old “Orange Belt” of this state that has heretofore produced the highest quality and the major portion of its crop.
Through it the worthy and energetic president of this society is making orange culture proﬁtable within eight or ten miles of the Georgia line.
Now, as otherwise this paper promises to become much too long, I will give, as brieﬂy as possible, a few suggestions on the practical working of this method of protection that my experience tells me are of value, and also offer some that, though not yet sufﬁciently tested, may on further study, prove to be of value.
The key note of Messrs-Kinney and Davies’ teaching was, to use the former’s words, “Be ready when the cold comes.”
Have your fuel in place, kindlings laid,
men engaged, plan of lighting all worked out, a surplus of fuel near by to replenish from and as soon as this is used up rush

in more before you rest, even though the mercury is rising, otherwise you may have worked in vain.
If practicable it is best to have a large supply stored in the groves iwhere it is easily accessible.
If wood is used make it four feet long and leave it coarse. This is a saving in several ways. Part should be lightwood to start with. Lay it right so that it will not waste by burning too rapidly.
The right way is in the form of a capitol V with its point towards the tree to the southeast and resting on the middle of a stick at right angles with its axis. Place the kindlings in the acute angle of the top sticks and cover with a dry palmetto leaf if such is handy.
\Vhere ﬁres are to be built'banking is not necessary and the holes are a nuisance in the night, where it is done.
To save oranges start ﬁres when the mercury gets down to 27 degrees above zero. For the trees up to time of starting growth, 25 degrees. After growth has started make it 29 or 30 degrees.
Don’t trust to long distance weather predictions or to the ringing of electric bells attached to thermometers outside.
Don't trust to high—priced thermometers after the ﬁrst year of their service.
Get a dozen or two of the 15 to 25 cent ones, test them and mark the variations and they will be the most reliable that you are likely to ﬁnd. Put them about in the groves, as far from the effects of the ﬁres as possible, and go to them often. Put one or two way outside to windward.
Watch the \Veather Bureau reports closely. It seldom fails to give notice of the worst that is likely to come, and to do it well ahead of the arrival of the cold wave, but don’t trust absolutely even to it as it is possible for cold to come from a point outside its range of observation.
When it predicts a degree of cold below the danger point have some one watching the mercury even after it may have gone up a little because of the dew point hav-
ing been reached. It may go down later.
Call out the men in good time and start a ﬁre here and there even before real dan-
ger has arrived, if mercury is steadily fall-
mg.
Pay them good wages for night work,
more than for day work unless their em-
ployment depends upon success so that they are interested as well as their em-
ployer in preserving your property.
Hire by the hour and give them plenty of hot coffee and a good lunch in the mid-
dle of the night.
Trees do not burn 'easily in a cold night but better put the ﬁres in the middles as the heat is radiated in all directions.
Be sure that mulching is kept out from under the trees and away from the ﬁres.
Have help enough and have the ﬁres looked to often.
Call on your friends if short of help.
You will be surprised to ﬁnd how ready even wealthy tourists are to help a man who shows energy and foresight in caring for his property.
Watch the ﬁres closely on a windy night. On calm nights the job is a de-
lightful one after you once get at it.
Windbreaks, if such there be, should not be tight ones except they be of the Prof.
McKinney kind.
Smoke and the hot sand under the ﬁres,
both help to protect in the morning and if the sun comes up bright throw the wood apart so as to make all the smoke possible if you think any of the fruit is frosted.
Chunks that have been partly burned make good kindlings for next time or they

start up easily if left whole when the char-
red ends are put together. Don't leave the groves alone, if there be any combustible material in or about it, until every ﬁre has been extinguished. Then you may go to rest with a satisﬁed mind, so far as your own interests are concerned; but with a deep feeling of sympathy for those who have trusted to luck and hoping against hope have lost wholly or in part,
for, I know of no more vexing experience than that of rebuilding a grove that has been killed to the ground or even the ef-
fort to realize some return from a partly frozen crop of fruit.
Though wood is comparativelyplentiful in this state at present it will not always be available in sufﬁcient quantities to allow of its use to the extent of our needs and considering the amount of work to pre-
pare it, place it, keep up the ﬁres, replace it with more when that in the groves is used up, the difﬁculty of hauling it among closely planted, large trees and the neces-
sity of getting it out and covering it when danger of cold is past, the difﬁculty of getting the needed help to do all this just when it is needed, it is,well for us to care-
fully consider the matter of the use of other fuels that will soon be, if they are not now, more economical for our pur-
pose.
It may be that the use of some kind of stove would give us more economical pro-
tection, even with the use of wood, after their ﬁrst cost was met, as they give out more lateral heat with less upward waste.
The use of coal or coke in stoves or baskets should be tried until we learn more fully their protective worth.
The Grifﬁths, Munson Briquettes are giving good results in California but there they do not have as low extremes of tem-
perature as we experience, ~
While in that state last year I talked with Mr. James Mills of Riverside who has had 200 tons of them, and other users.
I met Mr. M. L. Wicks of Los Angeles president of the company, was shown through the works where they are made and I am encouraged to believe that they will answer our needs better than any-
thing else on the market if they can be made in this state as cheaply as there and I see no reason why this may not be done.
The plant need not be an expensive one,
the materials are not costly, the briquettes can be moved on a low freight rate, they are exceedingly convenient to handle, take little room_in the grove, can be stored there under the trees where most handy for years with but little, if any, loss of value, need no stove or basket when in use and each replenishing will last from ﬁve to six hours, so I am told by those who have used them. ‘ 1
In size they are there made 12x6x5 in-
ches for grove use but much smallerfor household purposes. In France where wood is scarce, briquettes are in common use ﬁx all heating purposes and may be seen in great piles about the railroad sta-
tions almost as plentiful as coal in this country.
There are yet, and always will be,
problems to work out in successful'citrus culture and the most effective and ~
economical protection from injury by cold is one of them. I am inclined to believe it to be best, in the future setting of or-
ange groves, to plant the rows running north and south far enough apart to allow of the easy hauling of fuel and fruit and the building of ﬁres after the trees get large without danger of injury to them or their crop. All this means work but nature demands that man shall work, hap-
pily. and in afﬂuence if he will, unhappy

and in poverty if he attempts to shirk, but by working up to Dr. Davies’ rule of the three P’s we may never now assure our-
selves that we have gotten grove protec-
tion down to a plan of proﬁtable practice that makes orange growing here as safe and proﬁtable an investment of money,

Agriculture.
ByT'.A.Can-oll.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Agriculture, the original, natural,
necessary, and almost universal business of man,-was planted in the Garden of Eden with mankind, and from this one line of industry come all others. Every art, trade or profession whatsoever is secondary to this parent industry, and de-.
pendent upon it,—and is useful only when and in such a degree as may contr'ﬁiute to the one great universal business—agricul-
ture.
Agriculture in its great volume is the social, political and economic salvation of the world.
There are too many young men brought to look upon Horticulture and Agricul-
ture as being only an earthly (or earthy)
existence, with the result that the ﬂower of our farmers are ﬂocking to the towns and cities—where the professions are already overcrowded, thus creating a social as well as economic menace. What is to be done to obviate this? There is no single remedy, but I do believe that much can and may be done in a more scientiﬁc agriculture, whereby this most necessary calling might be made more attractive to our young men, whose ambitions now carry them to the univer-
sities of art and letters.
The life of theagriculturist is not so dull as many suppose. It will not compare with that of the clerk in the store or bank for ennui.
He has a chance in season and out of season for recreation, and for enjoy-
ment in the work of his own hands-—
whereas the clerk and r'nechanic are only the human handle in the pick through which others perform a task. What more can he hope for but existence? What per cent of the suicides occur upon the farm?’
(not two per cent.) What per cent from those who left the farm for other call-
ings? (more than eighty per cent). Is it necessary to further comment upon this point? -
With advanced Agriculture and Horti-
culture we cannot see why they should not be as attractive to the intelligent man as Law or Physics, or any of the other pro~
fessions.
We have only to turn to any one of our

many Horticulturists and Agriculturists today to prove that it is not only as proﬁ-
table but equally elevating and independ-
ent, besides more genteel. I want to make the prediction that ﬁfty years hence will' see more independent farme‘rs than merchants, doctors and lawyers combined in Florida, or in this whole South-land Of ours.-
Someone said recently; ,
“What we need now is men of well trained brains, who will organize and diversify agricultural industry,” and it is true. We have greater need of men than plowmen.
One need only to watch the real estate transfers to learn that all the most de-
sirable properties are being taken by the
“New Comer.” Men who know a good thing when they see it, yet our young men are daily leaving these identical farms seeking to better their positions socially morally andﬁnanciaily, with what results?
How soon do they realize their mistake,
some soon enough to get back before the Old Home passes into new hands. Then watch with what tenacity they cling to that Home and farm. But then there are those who cannot see the mistake in time,-
md to him there is nothing left but to drift with the tide of Human Pick Hands until his days are no more.
Then what shall we do?
There ought to be and there is a remedy,
and that remedy is at hand—teach the Agriculturist Agriculture. Require every public school to teach agriculture,
not only the rudiments of agriculture, but horticulture, forestry, and all its other kindred subjects. Let it be one of the es-
tablished studies'in all public schools, and if necessary make the study attractive by offering premiums for a complete course.
But do not understand me to cast a single straw or deprecating word against the work of our present established institu-
tions. They are doing all they can, be-
ing handicapped as they are, but they cannot reach the element we want, we want_the farmers’ sons. To be “like father like son/j and we can only have this so by making the farm life interesting to our young men and boys, get their hearts interested in this work, teach them the science of horticulture, the business of agriculture. Show them the independ-
ence, the comfort, the proﬁt, of the life of agricultural science and you have won a crown of glory for the noblest calling of man,

The Diseases of the Irish Potato.

By Professor F. M. Rolfs.
(The following paper was lavishly il-
lustrated with stereopticon views of the different forms of fungus growth and we very much regret our inability to re-
produce these views in this report.—Sec-
retary.)
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Our potato industry frequently suffers severely from the invasions of various plant organisms which are more or less common to the potato ﬁelds of this State.
The object of this paper is to describe the most destructive diseases, and suggest such methods of treatment as have been successfully employed in holding these diseases in check. It is often difﬁcult to distinguish some of these diseases without the aid of a miscroscope, still it is well to know the symptoms of the principal ones so as to be able to use rational methods of treatment. Doubtful cases may be referred to the Experiment Station.
Altenarla eolani (E. and M.) Boron.
Early Blight—This is a wide-spread disease. It attacks both leaves and stems.
Plants usually show no signs of the dis-
ease until they are’ six inches high. The
ﬁrst indication of its presence is the ap-
pearance of small circular, brown spots on the older leaves. The spots gradually ex-
tend and form large areas of dead tissue.
The younger leaves soon show signs of invasion, and unless the plants are spray-
ed at once the entire foliage soon becomes involved. In the advance stage the tips and margin of the leaves roll up. The large spots frequently show concentric markings. Because of its slow progress it is usually mistaken for the natural ripen-
ing of the plants. The development of the tubers stop as soon as the leaves become thoroughly involved, and the yield is often cut short as much as 20 barrels per acre.
Plants which are weakened from any cause are liable to be invaded by this fun-
gus. Bordeaux mixture will hold this disease in check. Applications of this mix_
ture should be made when the plants are four inches high, and repeated at inter-
vals of about ten days until six applica-
tions have been made.
Phytophthora Melton; (De By.)
Late Blight—This disease invades all parts of the plants and tubers. The ﬁrst sign of its presence is the appearance of small brownish or black areas on the leav-
es. These areas which rapidly increase in size followed by the curling of the leaves.
If a spell of warm, moist weather follows,
the leaves and stems turn black and decay within a few days, giving off a disagree-
able odor. Badly infected plants have only small tufts of green leaves at tips of stalks.
Many of the leaves hang shriveled as if scorched by ﬁre. The under surface of the diseased leaves are covered with mildew.
This mildew is composed of minute, tree-
like, branching structures which support a

minute, egg-shaped spore (seed) at the tip of each branch. ' When a spore falls on the moist surface of a leaf it pushes out a slender, colorless thread which soon enters the leaf, and if the weather conditions are favorable, it soon completely penetrates and kills the leaf. It usually takes about ﬁve days from the time the spores germinate untila new cropof spores are formed. This explains why the disease spreads so rapid-
ly. The tubers of infected ﬁelds may, or may not, rot. This depends largely upon soil and weather conditions. This rot is
' worst on heavy soils. The fungus has no winter spores. It is believed to pass the winter in the tissue of the tubers, con-
sequently too much care cannot be ex-
ercised in selecting clean, healthy seed.
Thorough-1y sprayng the plants with Bor-
deaux mixture will hold the disease in check.
Mum Oz-ylporinm (Sehlechtendal).
Dry Rot—Attacks all parts of the po-
tato plant below ground. The ﬁrst in-
dication of the disease is a change in the appearance of the leaves, which take on a lighter green color and roll up, followed by a gradual drying up and premature death of the plant. However, if the plants are not attacked until they have about com-
pleted their growth these early symptoms are often lacking. The upper part of the shoots become _ﬁabby, droop and die,
usually taking on a dark brown color.
When infected tubers are ﬁrst dug they appear sound, but while they are stored the fungus gradually works inward, fol—
lowing the vascular ring. (This ring soon takes on a brown or black color).
The fungus usually gains entrance at the stem end. Black streaks extending from the stem into the ﬂesh is a reliable symptom of this disease. Infected ends rot and shrivel, and because of this pecu-
liarity the disease is often spoken of as dry end rot. The hyphae (feeding threads)
which occur abundantly in the diseased tissue, often appear on\ the surface of the tubers in dense, white tufts. These soon bear small oval spores (seeds) and later a larger, curved, septate form. If these spores fall on the moist, injured sur-
face of tubers and plants, they germinate and develop new points of infection.
This is a wide-spread and destructive disease. It is a difﬁcult matter to ﬁnd a lot of seed which is not more or less in-
fected with it, and it is not uncommon to
ﬁnd as high as 2 5 per cent of our seedcom-
pletely rotted by it. Frequently tubers which are healthy when they are cut, are completely rotted by this fungus beforethe plants reach the surface of the ground.
This is especially noticeable when the ger-
mination of the seed is checked by un-
favorable weather conditions. In such cases the fungus gains entrance through the cut surface. The rotting of the seed in various sections of the State during the past winter was due largely to the work of this organism. In a number of ﬁelds which came under our observation, as much as
60 per cent of the seed was rotted by this fungus after it had been cut for planting.
The infection in most cases was largely due to carelessness in mixing diseased seed pieces with healthy ones. The spores falling on the cut, moist surface soon ger-
minated and invaded the tuber. The planting was followed by a spell of cold weather which retarded the germination of the seed, thus enabling the fungus to consume the tuber before the young plants reached the surface of the ground. In
ﬁelds where the planting was followed by more favorable weather conditions, the stand was much better, still many of the

seed tubers were sooner or later complete-
ly destroyed by the fungus. but the plants were fairly well established before the destruction of the seed. \Vhen the diseaSe is once introduced in the ﬁeld it is apt to remain in the soil for a number of years,
hence it is desirable to practice a syste-
matic rotation of crops.
Carefully selecting clear smooth seed and rejecting from time to time all tubers showingany sign of rot, also aidsmaterial-
ly in checking the spread of the disease.
Exposing the seed to the light from four to ﬁve weeks before planting is an ex-
cellent practice. Ths treatment tends to hasten the germination of the tubers after planting and enables the plant to become established before the seed tuber is en-
tirely destroyed.
Bacillus Sollnacernm (Smith)
Bacterial Wilt—A very common and destructive disease. This disease causes the foliage to wilt, and later, the stems and branches become discolored and die. In-
fection may occur either above or below the ground. The disease also produces a brown or black rot of the tubers. This organism also attacks egg plants and to-
matoes.
Select clean, smooth seed, rejecting all those showing black end vascular bundles.
Expose the seed to the light four or ﬁve weeks before planting.
Corticlum Vagum Var. Solani (Burt).
Rhisoclouia—A wide-spread disease.
It is usually most troublesome on low lands but during excessive wet weather it also causes more or less loss on the higher lands. The young plants suffer most, and many of the young shoots are completely cut off before they reach the surface of the ground. This disease also frequently produces injuries which bring about an abnormal development of small tubers. It is also injurious to the surface of growing tubers and freguently produces a rough surface known as scab.
This fungus forms a white felt-like fruiting membrane on the green stems just above the surface of the ground, often covering the stems for a distance of three inches. This membrane is composed of a network of hyphae which produce many short, club-shaped branches (basidae) on which small stalks (strigmata) develop.
At the end of each strigmata a single,
brown spore (seed) develops. These spores fall as soon as they mature. If they fall on a moist surface they ger-
minate in a few hours and thus may start new areas of infection. It is also pro-
pagated by black scale-like bodies called sclerotia. These form freely on the stems and tubers below the surface of the ground. The sclerotia are composed of large, closely packed cells. When dry,
the sclerotia are hard to detect, but when wet, they are dark brown and easily seen.
Tubers which are more or less covered with these bodies ought not to be used for seed. since the cells of these sclerotia de-
velop into long, feeding threads, which,
under favorable conditions, soon invade and frequently destroy the young shoots.
A diseased tuber in a sack of clean ones under favorable conditions of heat and moisture, may spread the disease to ad-
joining tubers and in time infect the entire lot. Carefully selecting clean, smooth tubers and exposing them to the light from four to ﬁve weeks before planting,
gives excellent results. When the fungus is once introduced into a ﬁeld it remains in the soil a number of years. Good drainage and careful cultivation aids ma-

terially in checking the progress of the disease. Burning all old stems and tubers,
after the harvest, is an excellent practice.
A systematic rotation of crops is strongly recommended.
Oolporl scabies (Thuter).
Scab—Attacks only the tubers. The skin of the tubers becomes pitted and fre-
quently cracks. These injuries form a gateway for an invasion of various fungi and insects, which in many cases extend the injury. Beets are also attacked by this organism. Infected tubers are the principal means of spreading this disease.
When once introduced into a ﬁeld it re-
mains in the soil for years.
Treating infested-seed with a solution of one ounce of corrosive sublimate to eight gallons of water for one and one-
half hours, and one week before planting,
gives good results, provided the treated seed are planted in soil free from the organism. A systematic rotation of crops gives good results,
Vomlculnrin.
Anthracnose—Quite destructive to our summer crop. The ﬁrst account.of this fungus ,was given by Dr. Halstead. It attacks the stems and may cause pre-
mature death of the plant. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture would probably hold this disease in check. Burning all of the diseased vines as soon as the crop is har-
vested is strongly recommended.
Bordeaux M inure—Has proved the most efﬁcient spray for both Early and Late. Blight, but it is simply a preventive,
and not a cure for these diseases. It is yery essential that the spraying be done at the right time. If the treatment is de-
layed until signs of damage appear, very little good will result. Spraying, to be ef-
fective must be done before any signs of disease appear, and it must be done thoroughly, for unless the entire surface of the plant is covered by the mixture some of the spores of the fungus will fall on the unprotected spots and gain entrance to the plants. Frequent applications are necessary, especially if sufﬁcient rain falls to wash off the mixture. The following is the standard formula for Bordeaux mixture:
Copper Sulphate .. .. .. .. .. 6 lbs.
FreshLime.... .....4lbs.
Water .. .. . ..50 gals.
Potato vines require from 2 to 6 barrels of this mixture per acre, according to the size of the plants. When spraying is done on an extensive scale it is usually convenient to make up a stock solution of copper sulphate. Suspend a coarse sack containing 45 pounds of copper sulphate into a barrel containing 45 gallons of water. The copper sulphate should be plac-
ed near the surface of the water a day or two before it is to be used. Stir this solu-
tion thoroughly before using, and one gal-
lon of it will contain one pound of copper sulphate.
A quantity of fresh lime may also be slackened and placed in a barrel, and if it is covered with a few inches of water it can be kept in an excellent condition for some time.
To prepare a mixture from these solu-
tions, take six gallons of copper sulphate and place it in the spray barrel, and add 19
gallons of water, From the slackened lime take four pounds of the paste, dilute it with 2 5 gallonsof water and addit to the copper sulphate solution. All the ma-
terials ought to be passed throhgh a sieve so as to exclude the particles which might clog the nozzles.

If the “bugs” are plentiful add one pound of Paris Green to 50 gallons of the above mixture. A paste should be made of the Paris Green by mixing it with a small amount of water before putting it into the sprayer.
Potassium farm-cyanide, is used to de-
termine if enough lime has been added to combine with all the copper sulphate. It is a yellow poisonous salt which dissolves readily in water. Ten cents‘ worth dis-
solved in about ten times its bulk of water will ordinarily be enough for one season.
In using this test, pour into your spray barrel 25 gallons of the milk of lime. Stir the mixture thoroughly and add a drop of the potassium ferro—cyanide. If enough lime has been added the drop will not change color when it strikes the mixture;
however, if sufﬁcient lime has not been added it will immediately change to a dark reddish brown color and more lime must be added. Even after the test shows no color it is best to add a little more lime.
Corrosive Sublimatc Treatment for Scab—Corrosive Sublimate or bichloride of mercury is sold in form of white crys-
tals. It may be bought at any drug store for about ﬁfteen cents an ounce. The cost of material for treating the seed for an acre will not exceed ﬁfty cents. The solution is made by placing one ounce of this chemical in an earthern or wooden dish containing one gallon of hot water.
As soon as it is_ all dissolved pour the con-
tents of the dish into a wooden vessel con-
taining seven gallons of water. Put the potatoes into this solution, and let them remain an hour and a half. The solution may be used a number of times. The disinfection may be done at any time. Ex-
periments indicate, however, that treating the tubers about a week before planting,
and spreading them on the ﬂoor or ground where they will be fully exposed to the light, greatly facilitates their growth after planting. Corrosive sublimate is a deadly poison to both man and animal when tak-
en internally. but the solution and treated potatoes may be handled freely without experiencing any ill results.

Commercial Stock Food Law.

By R. E. Rose.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The necessity for a “Commercial Stock Food Law” similar to our fertilizer law in this State, has been recognized by re-
tail dealers and consumers for years.
The fact that other States have enacted such laws, requiring the analysis, inspec-
tion, and guarantee, of commercial feed stuffs, while Florida has not,4has caused this State to become the dumping ground of large quantities of material which could not ﬁnd a market in other States.
During the past four years, while I have had the honor to serve the State as State Chemist, numerous samples of feed stuff,
good, bad, and indiﬂ‘ierent, have been sent to the State Laboratory for examination.
My predecessor informs me. and the rec-
ords of the ofﬁce show, that for years,
complaints have been made as to the quality of commercial feed stuﬁ sold in the State; while at all times the informa-
tion required, as to quality and value of samples sent in has been given. it has been simply as personal information. no relief could be given ofﬁcially, and the party defrauded had no resource, except a suit at common law for damages. Ad-
ulterated or inferior commercial feed not being prohibited, no penalty for false statements or misrepresentations be-
ing provided, the retail dealer and con-
sumer were at the mercy of the manufac-
turers, brokers, importers. or wholesale dealers. To such an extent had this evil grown. that a general protest fr0m the retail dealer and consumer, created a de-
mand for a law regulating the sale of com-
mercial feeding stuffs in this State. While the State chemist has received and ex-
amined numerous samples of inferior feeding stqu from various parts of the State, there has also been analyzed by the chemist of the State Experiment Station,
a number of samples taken from various parts of the State, with results conﬁrming those made by the State Chemist, showing the general inferiority of the stock feed sold throughout the State. This inves-
tigation made the State Experimental Sta-
tion, and the State Agricultural Depart-
ment, while along the same lines, and caused by the same general protest and popular demand, was entirely independ—
ent; in fact, neither Department knew of the other’s work, until the bill now before the Legislature had been presented. I It is gratifying to myself, and certainly must also be to Prof. A. \V. Blair. to know that the labors of each, for the beneﬁt of the feeder and other citizen of the State, has lead to a concerted effort to remedy the evil, borne long and patiently by the peo-
ple of the State.
Special Bulletin number 30, of the Florida Experiment Station, by A. W.
Blair, M. A., Assistant Chemist. “The composition aof some of the concentrated feeding stuffs on sale in Florida,” so ably and logically states the general conditions,
and so fully conﬁrms my opinion. and

position, on this most important subject,
that I take the liberty of quoting largely therefrom, and suggest to all consumers of feeding stuffs in the State, to send to the Experiment Station at Lake City, for a copy of this “Special Bulletin, No. 30.”
Professor Blair says, “The fact that Florida is largely a vegetable and fruit growing State, has seemed to render necessary the importation, from other States, of large quantities of concentrated feeding stuffs. I have no means of veri-
fying the statement, but I believe that I am safe in saying that in proportion to the population and the number of farm ani-
mals, no other State in the Union imports such large quantities of these materials for home consumption.
The Necessity for I Feeding Stnﬂl Imp”-
tlon Law.
The question as to the quality of these goods seems never to have troubled us seriously. We have been content to take what the manufacturer is pleased to send us, and if the quality has been poor, either the animals have suffered or we have been compelled to buy an additional quantity to compensate for the inferior quality, or both, On the other hand we have not been content thus to accept what the manu-
facturers of fertilizers were sending us,
but have required them to state the in-
gredients used in the manufacture of the goods, and guarantee that they will, on analysis, show a certain percentage of the fertilizing constituents—plant food; and we have further clothed the State Chemist with power to collect and analyse samples and publish. to the State the results of his work, in order that the farmer and fruit-
grower may be protected from the sale of adulterated goods.
But a large quantity of commercial fer-
tilizers used in the State is manufactured here, and to say to the fertilizer manufac-
turers of this State, “You must make your fertilizers, which you furnish us for grow-
ing our crops, come up to a deﬁnite guarantee,” while we say to the manufac-
turers of concentrated feeding stuffs in other States (for practically all the ground products on the market come from other States.) “You may send to us for feeding our stock whatever grade of goods you choose,” does not seem en-
tirely just to the manufacturers of fer-
tilizers.
It is perhaps, true that greater loss would result from the use of inferior fer-
tilizers than from the use of inferior feed-
ing stuffs, and that it is easier to practice deception with the former than with the latter, still this does not make it less im-F portant that he who buys feeding stuffs should be protected from inferior and fraudulent goods. The great variety of mixed feeds, and proprietary feeds makes it comparatively easy to deceive even those who have had considerable ex-
perience in handling such goods. How many of those who buy feeding stuffs can say that they do not contain ground corn cobs, rice hulls, corn bran, etc., any more than the farmer can say that his fertilizers do not contain low grade materials worth but little more than half the price asked for them? The fact that the following State viz.: Maine Vermont, Massa-
ch-usetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut.
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Maryland, Tennessee, Indiana, W iscon-
sin, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Ohio,
now have feeding stuff laws in operation,
would seem to indicate pretty clearly that there is need to guard against adulteration and fraudulent practice. This fact in it-
self ought to be sufficient to bring us to

our senses; for we need not think for one moment that the manufacturers will stop placing upon the market inferior goods,
so long as there are places like South Carolina, Gegrgia, Florida and Alabama to be used as dumping grounds for what more than half the States east of the Mis-
sissippi will not have.
Believing that this condition existed,
the Chemical Department of the Experi-
ment Station began, last November, an in-
vestigation with a view to ascertaining the exact extent to which low grade and adul-
terated feeding stuffs are being placed up-
on the market.
Samples were secured from the various sections of the State, largely through students of the University who went to their homes at the Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations.
They were instructed to secure samples of the different concentrated feeds, which should, so far as possible, represent the whole lot from which they were taken,
and also to secure the trade name, name and location of the manufacturer, and the selling price per sack of 100 pounds, or per ton, in the case of wholesale dealers.
The names of dealers are reserved, since it is not intended to work any hardship to the wholesaler or retailer, so long as there is no law requiring them to maintain a certain standard.
As a result of this, forty-three samples,
representing a considerable variety of feeding stuffs, and collected from differ-
ent parts of the State, have been analyzed.
It would have been much better could the number of samples and localities rep-
resented been greater, but the limited time and pressure of other work did not permit this.
It is believed, however, that the work represents, fairly well, the feeding stuffs
123
on sale throughout the State.
Taking up ﬁrst the brans and compar-
ing their protein and fat content with the standard we ﬁnd that all of the samples examined fail to come up to the minimum standard requith in pro-
tein—IS per cent.
Number I 799 is very low in protein and fat, while the ﬁbre—indigestible part—is over I 7 per cent, whereas, in good wheat bran it should not much exceed 9 per cent. This sample was highly adulterated with ground corn cobs and screenings.
Number 1714 contained wheat chaff,
corn bran, and various pieces of foreign matter, indicating mill sweepings. Num-
bers I726, I730, and 1731 contained corn bran; 1807, dirt and oat chaff, and 1831,
chaff, corn bran, and other foreign matter,
probably mill sweepings. The average '
retail price for eight of the twelve samples is $1.38 per sack of 100 pounds, (27.60
per ton,) which is undoubtedly excessive when it is remembered that not one of the samples comes up to the minimum stand-
ard for pure wheat bran.
Six samples of Purina, four of Victor and one each of Boss, Parcell and Mack’s Mule Feed, are com and oat feeds, and are composed of cracked corn, ground or crushed oats and oat hulls, the oat hulls in most cases predominating. These are no doubt, the product of cereal food mills,
and furnish a means of disposing of the oat hull at a good proﬁt. They have a fair feeding value, though in most cases this is not in proportion to the price asked for them. Certainly this can be said of those obtained at Dania and Hallandale.
The average protein content of the four samples of Victor Feed is only 7.62 per cent, while the fat is 3.05 per cent. and in this connection it is interesting to note that ﬁve samples of Victor Corn and oats

feed manufactured by the American Cereal Company and analyzed at the New Jersey Station, have an average of 8.64
per cent of protein and 4.50 per cent offat,
and ﬁve samples analyzed at the Con-
necticut Station gave 8.26 per cent protein and 3.93 per cent of fat, and sold at an average price of $25.40 per ton. Both New Jersey and Connecticut have inspec-
tion laws.
The sample of Mack’s Mule Feed is very low in protein and fat, and high in crude ﬁber and ash, indicating clearly the predominance of oat hulls. ‘
Number 1805, sold under the name of Yellow Meal, is cotton seed meal adulter-
ated with hulls, making the protein con-
tent about 13 per cent lower than it should be, for the price asked—$27.00 per ton.
Atlas Dairy Feed, number 1738, is a product of the sugar factories, and is made by drying and grinding the bagasse,
soaking in molasses, and again drying.
Its value as a feeding material, is probably not yet well established in this State.
Marsden Food, number 1829, is ground straw, probably oat straw, and has about the feeding value of oat straw.
The wiregrass hay which grows abun-
dantly in the pine woods of Florida. con-
tains more protein, and more than twice as much fat. as does this material, and would no doubt be about as easily digest-
ed. But either beggarweed, cow pea, or velvet bean hay contains anywhere from two to ﬁve times as much protein, and would certainly not cost any more, if as much, as does this high-sounding “Mars-
den Food.” Judged by the samples ex-
amined, a large proportion of the concen-
trated feeling stuffs on the Florida market is of an inferior quality.
All of the samples of wheat bran ex-
amined are below the minimum standard for good wheat bran.
Some materials, as “Marsden Food,”
are sold at unreasonably high prices.
The adulterants found were rice chaff,
wheat chaff, oat hulls, ground corn cobs,
corn bran, screenings, weed seeds, dirt and other foreign matter, indicating mill sweepings.
Practically all the concentrated feed-
ing stuffs used in this State are imported,
and this constitutes a constant drain upon the wealth of the State.
Florida can and should produce much more of her feeding materials than she is producing, and thus save to the State thousands of dollars, \Vhere the farm crops furnish sufﬁcient carbohydrates,
only feed stuffs rich in protein should be purchased. The mixtures of corn and oats, containing as they do, large quanti-
ties of oat bulls are not economical pro-
tein feeds.
There is so much proﬁt in selling ground corn cobs, wheat chaff, oat hulls,
corn bran, rice hulls, etc., and at the price of wheat bran, that the consumer must ever be on the watch. A careful examina-
tion with the eye or with the help of a small magnifying glass will often reveal these adulterants.
Those who buy feeding stuffs should have the same protection as those who buy fertilizers. Such protection would pro-
mote the interests of the honest manufac-
turer and dealer, diminish the sale of worthless materials, and instruct the peo-
ple in regard to the composition of feed-
ing stuﬂs and their comparative value.”
While Professor Blair’s samples were average samples, those examined by the State Chemist were generally inferior samples, naturally the purchaser ﬁnding an unusually poor result, or evident adul-

teration, sends his sample to the State Chemist; which he would not do were the goods at all satisfactory. The conse-
quence has been that all the samples ex-
amined by the State Chemist have been of inferior value'as compared to those taken generally throughout the State.
As an example. I quote the analysis of a popular feed sent for examination by a Jacksonville wholesale dealer. whose cus-
tomers had complained of the quality of the feed, and suspecting it of causing the death of his live stock, which is possibly did, an account of the large amount of in-
digestible ﬁbre:
“Number 332 Stock Feed Protein .. .. . ..Io.5o per cent.
Fats .. .. .. .. .. .. 1.31 per cent.
Starch and Sugar .. ..31 .95 per cent.
Fibre .. . .. .. ..53.25 per cent.”
More than half this feed was ﬁbre,
largely indigestible. The commercial value of this sample compared to standard feeds is not to exceed $17.15 per ton, while it is quoted in Jacksonville to-day at $26.-
00 per ton.
[The law advocated above was passed by the last legislature. A law similar to and with same provisions as to guarantee of valuable ingredients, as our fertilizer law, with similar penalty and method of execution, drawing of samples and analy-

Some Invitations.

The Florida State Horticultural Society is always the recipient of numerous invi-
tations, some of which it cannot accept on account of time, and others are accepted because time is so arranged that the meet-
ings are not interfered with, and the in-
terest, instruction and social functions of the society are thus broadened and en-
joyed by all.
H. O. Painter Fertilizer CO." Invitation.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Knowing that many of the horticultur-
ists have never had the opportunity of inspecting an acid-making plant, and be-

lieving it would be of interest to them, I,
therefore, invite your honorable body to visit our plant, in South Jacksonville, on Wednesday, May Ioth, at noon. I have arranged with the ferryboat, which leaves at the foot of Main street at 12 o’clock sharp, to take over all members. It will be necessary for the meeting to adjourn at ten or ﬁfteen minutes to 12 o’clock to give the members ample time to reach the ferry-
boat, which will take them across to the plant. -
_ I will add, that somewhere on the route a lunch will be served so that the members can return in plenty of time to open the

afternoon session at 2 o’clock. Ladies are especially invited.
Yours respectfully,
E. O. PAINTER,
President E. O. Painter Fertilizer Co.
Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, I move that the society accept Mr. Painter’s kind
' invitation, under the provision, however,
that he fumigate the acid chambers, throw a tarpaulin over his blood and bone, and will agree not to give us any dissertations upon fertilizers, for we should all I am sure like to visit this large establishment,
and see for ourselves where and how the fertilizer manufacturers get such euphon-
ions and sweet-sounding if not fragrant names as “Simon Pure,” “Gem” and
“Ideal” as applied to some of these goods we pay the handsome price of $40 to $45
per ton for.
Mr. E. O. Painter—Mr. President, I can assure Mr. McCarty that the bad odors will be kept under subjection, and the most fastidious will have no cause for offense,
but whether he will enjoy the ammonia,
potash and phosphoric acid that he will partake of during the lunch remains to be seen.
The invitation was unanimously ac-
cepted.

Captain Gmer’l Invitation.
The President—The chair desires to an-
nounce to the society that Captain C. E.
Garner is with us, and desires to extend personally an invitation for some enter-
tainment of the society. _
Captain Garner—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Jacksonville Board of Trade has arranged, as a portion of your entertainment during your delibera-
tions, an ,excursion on the St. Johns river on the Steamer May Garner. The steamer will leave her docks at 10:30 A. M., and I wish to attend to you one and all a cordial invitation to go on this little river trip,
which I trust 'you will ﬁnd pleasant and refresh you for your afternoon’s session.
The President—The chair, for the so-
ciety, extends to Captain Garner and the Jacksonville Board of Trade the heartfelt thanks of the society for his kind invita-
tion, which is accepted.

Wilson k Toomor’l Invitation.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The excursion planned by the Board of Trade to-morrow on the St. Johns river does not provide for any objective point,
and if it should meet your pleasure we should like very much indeed to have you stop at “Idealia,” and look over our new modern fertilizer factory, which we believe would prove instructive as well as interest-
ing to a great many members. And while you are in that locality you would also see the new improvements being made along the river front, the large export yards of the Atlantic Coast Line and also the Flor-
ida Naval Stores Co., as well as other industries that are being started in that section.
Trusting we may have the pleasure of showing you through our factory, we are,
Yours respectfully,
LORENZO A. WILSON.
President Wilson & Toomer Fertilizer Co.
Mr. Painter—As the excursion has no objective point to which to take the mem-
bers, I move that the society accept Mr.
Wilson’s invitation so that the members can see the improvements made in that section.

From the Elks.
The President—The chair desires to anounce that we have with us his Honor Mayor Nolan, who wishes to extend to the society an invitation.
Mayor Nolan—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Jacksonville Elks Lodge has arranged for an illustrated lec-l ture to-night at the Windsor Hotel Audi-
torium, and I am commissioned by the Jacksonville Lodge of B. O. E. to extend to you one and all an invitation to attend the lecture. Mr. President, should I not have the pleasure of meeting with you again during the deliberations of this ses-
sion, I trust I may have that pleasure at your next annual session. Jacksonville, as she has always in the past, desires to ex-
tend to you at all times a most cordial invitation to hold your annual sessions in this city, the metropolis of your State.
Mayor Nolan’s remarks and invitations were received with applause.
The President—The Florida State Hor-
ticultural Society, through its Presidenf'
and presiding ofﬁcer, desires to tender the heartfelt thanks of the society for the kind invitations just extended, and particularly to the invitation touching the holding of the next annual session of this society in the city of Jacksonville.
For Betterment of Report.
Mr. Hart—Mr. President, before we proceed to the reading and discussion of papers, I desire to call the attention of the society to the unsatisfactory steno-
graphic report of the proceedings of the last annual meeting of the society.
I assume it is unsatisfactory, it is very much so to myself, as I have been very incorrectly reported, and will not stand for anything in the last report under my name except the Treasurer’s account.
I note similar complaints from other mem-
bers. I have been an ofﬁcer of the society for a good many years, and was Secre-
tary, either by election or as assistant, for seven years, and know that a stenogra-
pher’s report is a strange and wonderful thing to deal with. I have always found it very difﬁcult to get a satisfactory report of our proceedings, and one that is mis-
leading .I consider very hurtful to the society. I would like to have some sug-
gestion from other members as to the bet-
terment of the service we have heretofore had in this very important matter.
Sending proof to each one for correc-
tion who takes part in the discussions seems to be the surest means of improve-
ment, and I‘would recommend it.
The President—The chair concurs in the remarks of Mr. Hart; it is the opinion of the chair, however, that the Secretary has had the matter of betterment of this very important service under consideration for some time. It seems to be a very dif-
ﬁcult matter to secure competent service.
While I believe the society has at all times availed itself of the very best assistance in

~FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
this direction that could be secured for the money we have paid for it, I believe proper steps have been taken by the Secretary in conjunction with the Executive Committee to secure the future betterment of this very important work. At a later hour during the session, the Secretary will bring the matter of his action in the premises before the society, which the chair believes will meet with the approval of the society.
Mr. Painter—Reverting to the matter of reports of our annual meeting, I believe I have been able to arrange for a report that will be satisfactory to the society. I
ﬁnd it to be a hard matter to get anyone to take these proceedings at any price,
or at least at a price the society could af-
ford to pay. The gentleman, Mr. \V. G.
Powell, now with us, who undertakes this important work for the society, at .this session was reported to me to be one of the most experienced men in the State,
and upon careful investigation I was con-
vinced that if he would undertake the report for the society he was able to give us a good, comprehensive report. Mr.
Powell at ﬁrst declined to accept this work,
knowing, as he put it, what he would be up against, but reconsidered and accepted it. I am assured that this report of our annual proceedings will be the best that can be had. I would therefore move that the Secretary be empowered to pay for this service as per contract agreed upon with him by and with the approval of the Executive Committee.
The President—The society would be pleased to have any suggestion that Mr.
Powell may be able to offer for the better-
ment of this important service.
Mr. Powell—Mr. President, I have had a long experience in reporting the proceed-
ings of deliberative bodies and assemblies in this State, during which time I have handled the annual proceedings and report of a great many deliberative societies, in-
cluding our legislative proceedings from time to time, and I beg to assure you that the most arduous duties devolving upon any member of your society is the work of your secretaries and scribes. It has ever been and ever will be from the notes of the scribe that history is written. An old Egyptian proverb says: “The scribe gets everything.” He does, but he can't use it, (and an afterthought also reminds me that recent investigations reveal a literal translation from ancient cuniform tables that “scape-goat” could easily be rendered
“scribe!") Seriously, though, Mr. Presi-
dent, it is impossible for a reporter single-
handed to make a verbatim report of a large deliberative body. Such a service would cost a great deal of money. It would take a corps of three reporters and three scribes, therefore the best that can be done is to take as full note of the pro-
ceedings as may be. From such. full data a competent scribe may with facility tran-
scribe and compile a very comprehensive and satisfactory report. Indeed this is the way the history of all deliberative bodies is written. To be able to do this even the reporter must have at his ﬁngers’ ends a fund of general encyclopedic knowledge.
To be able to perfectly report the proceed-
ings of a society of this character he should know the faintest sound of every technical term in Bailey’s work; he should be a botanist, a chemist, and know Cush-
ing by heart. If he would report the pro-
ceedings of a medical society, he must know medical jurisprudence and the gen-
eral history of hygiene. If he would report legislative proceedings. he must know political economy and the history of the world. If he would report a bankers'
association, he ought to be the composite

of a John Law, a Lawson and a national bank examiner. As a rule, Mr. President,
he is rarely, if ever, any of them. If he were he would not be a scribe, but he must at least have some intuition of what he is to report, some general knowledge of the work undertaken. This alone, Mr. Presi-
dent, is all th'at I possess, which, with my long experience and the assistance of the ofﬁcers of your societies, has enabled us to write the history of many of the delibera-
tive bodies of our great and growing State,
and gives me the assurance to say that the report of this session of your society will be one of the best it has ever had.
129
The President—The society has had considerable trouble in the matter of its reports, but the chair believes that the ar-
rangement now made by the Secretary and Executive Committee has been for the bet-
terment of that service, and that the report of the present session will be all that could be desired. The question comes upon the motion of the Secretary that he be em-
powered to pay .for this service as per contract for same made by and with the consent of the Executive Committee. All in favor of the motion will say aye; those opposed, no; the ayes have it. It is so ordered.
Legal Six of the Orange Box.

The following law relating to the size of the orange box was passed by our last legislature:
Chapter 5485—(No. 114).

The White Fly Act.

The following act was passed by the last legislature relative to groves, orchards and fruit trees in Orange county:
Chapter 5551—(No. 180).
AN ACT for the Protection of the Groves,
Orchards and Fruit Trees of Orange County from Injurious Insects. and Providing for a Horticultural Commis-
sion for Said County for that Purpose.
Be it Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:
SECTION 1. That if there shall be pre-
sented to the Board of County Commis-
sioners of Orange county a petition signed by at least twenty-ﬁve freeholders of citrus grove property situate in said county, and setting forth that citrus groves, orchards,
nursery stock, or fruit trees in said county are infested with white ﬂy, and praying for the appointment of a horticultural commission, the Board of County Com-
missioners, if it has reason to believe the allegations of the petition to be true, shall appoint a horticultural commission for said county within thirty days after the presenting of the petition.
The horticultural commission shall con-
sist of three commissioners who shall be citizens of the State, resident in Orange county, and men well skilled and expe-
rienced in the care and management of orange and other citrus fruit groves.
They shall hold ofﬁce for the term of two years from the date of their appointment unless the Board of County Commission-
ers shall determine that no reason exists for the further continuance of the com-
mission. The Board of County Commis-
sioners may ﬁll any vacancy of the com-
mission by appointment for the unexpired term, and may remove any commissioner if good cause is shown.
SEc. 2. Each horticultural commis-
sioner shall before entering on the duties of his ofﬁce give a bond to the county in the sum of one thousand dollars condi-
tional for the faithful performance of his duty as such commissioner, with sureties to be provided by the Board of County Commissioners and shall also ﬁle with the clerk of the Board of County Commis-
sioners an oath that he will faithfully dis-
charge his duties as horticultural commis-
sioner of Orange county.

struction of the white ﬁy. It shall, as soon as possible, with the approval of the proper ofﬁcials in charge of the Agricul-
tural Experiment Station in the Univer-
sity of Florida and of the Board of County Commissioners of Orange county, make rules prescribing formulas and methods for the treatment of citrus groves, or-
chards, yards, nursery stock, trees of any kind, shrubs, plants or fruit infested with the white ﬂy, and also prescribing the methods, time and frequency of applica-
tion, and shall have said rules published for free distribution.
SEC. 4. The commission or any one of its members shall have power to examine any citrus grove, orchard, yard, nursery stock trees of any kind, shrubs, plants or fruit for the purpose of determining whether the white ﬂy exists therein or thereon, and if the same shall be found infested, the commission shall notify the owner, agent or person in charge, in writ-
ing that the same is infested, and shall serve him with a copy of the said rules and shall require him to treat the same according to said rules beginning at a speciﬁed time, which notice may be signed by any member of the commission and shall be served by any commissioner or by any person appointed by the commis-
sion for that purpose in the manner di-
rected for the service of a writ of sum-
mons. The commission shall keep a record of all such notices and of the name of the person upon whom and by whom and when the notice was served. If any owner or agent of any vacant property cannot be found in the county, the com-
mission may enter for the purpose herein-
after provided without such notice. If the owner, agent or person in charge neglects or refuses to comply with the notice for one week after the expiration of the time named therein, the commission or any commissioner may enter the property de~
scribed in the notice and proceed to make treatment at actual cost for the white ﬂy according to the commission’s published rules. In such case the commission shall,
when the treatment at that time is com-
pleted, render to the owner, agent or per-
son in charge an itemized bill of the actual cost of the treatment aforesaid, including the necessary per diem of one commis-
sioner and a statement of the time when the said bill will be presented to the Board of County Commissioners. At the speci-
ﬁed time a duplicate of the bill veriﬁed by afﬁdavit of at least one of the horticultural commissioners shall be presented to the Board of County Commissioners, and upon a hearing the Board of County Com-
missioners shall allow the said bill or such part of it as shall appear to them to be proper and just, and if the said bill be not paid by the owner, agent or person in charge, it shall be paid out of the general revenue fund of the county, and such pay—
ment by the county shall be a lien upon the property treated, and notice of such lien shall be ﬁled and recorded in the ofﬁce of the clerk of the Circuit Court of Orange county within sixty days after the warrant for the payment aforesaid has been drawn in like manner as notices of lien of me-
chanics and material men are ﬁled. Such lien may be foreclosed in chancery, but no bill for foreclosure shallbe ﬁled until one year has elapsed from the recording of the lien.

said, and upon the request of any owner,
agent or person in charge of any infested place as aforesaid, shall treat same as aforesaid at actual cost: Provided, That the cost, if required, be ﬁrst paid or se-
cured. Whenever the horticultural com-
mission shall report to the board that any wild or uncultivated land is infested with the white ﬂy, the said board may order the same treated at the expense of the county.
SEC. 6. The members of the horticul-
tural commission shall be paid $2.50 for each day they are actually engaged in the discharge of the work of the commission,
and this compensation shall be paid by the Board of County Commissioners out of the general revenue fund: Provided, That the per diem of one commissioner shall be included as part of the amount for which any lien is ﬁled. The Board of County Commissioners is hereby authorized and directed to pay such sums as may be neces-
sary out of the general revenue fund to carry out the provisions of this act.
SEC. 7, The horticultural commission shall make full quarterly reports to the Board of County Commissioners showing what work, if any, has been done, and the character and kind of insect pests found and the remedies applied and the result of such remedies. In case any San Jose scale is found within the county the proceedings shall be the same as hereinbefore provided for the white ﬂy, except that only one board of horticultural commissioners shall at any one time exist in Orange county.
If the Board of County Commissioners should at any time abolish the horticul-
tural commission as hereinbefore provided,
and a new petition as prescribed by Section I shall be presented, the Board of County Commissioners may appoint another hor-

CATALOGUE OF FRUITS.
ADOPTED BY THE SOCIETY AT THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING.
In making a complete Catalogue of the Fruits of Florida, indicating intelligi-
bly, in summarized and tabular form, the relative value of varieties for different sections, the wide-stretching territory, diversity of soil and climate, and the lim-
ited range of each of the numerous fruits, render it essential that the State be divid-
ed, so that regions allied throughout in their adaptability to fruits may be desig-
nated and referrred to. _
To this end, four districts have been formed, as described below. Geographi-
cal lines cannot be made to indicate pomological conditions with accuracy. More than approximate correctness could not be expected from an arbitrary division of this kind, especially where local conditions vary so greatly as in Florida. Work-
ing by general averages, some sections are unavoidably left in the wrong districts,
judging by the standard of local conditions. The divisions, however, will be found to answer their purpose better, than any that could be made without fur-
ther sub-divisions, which would be impracticable. ,
WESTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State west of the Au-
eilla river.
EASTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State between the Au-
eilla river and a straight line drawn across the State from the mouth of the St.
Johns river to Cedar Keys.
CENTRAL FLORIDA—That part of the State between the line above re—
ferred to and the counties constituting South Florida.
SOUTH FLORIDA—The counties of Brevard, Dade, Monroe, Lee, De-
Soto and Manatee.

CITRUS FRUITS.
SWEET ORA HG ES—Citrus aurantium.

Norm—The development of orange culture in this State has given rise to a multiplicity of varieties. man of which, while meritorious, have no distinctive qualities. or superiority. as compared with others. It has been deemed advisable to omit the names of many varieties which have disap-
peared from cultivation. The list, however, is still large.
The names in heavy type are designed to constitute a complete list for the State. embracing varieties of the highest excellence in all the desired characteristics of season, quality. distinctiveness,
productiveness. etc The names in light type are those whose characteristics are possessed in an equal or superior degree by other varieties which appear in heavy type. Some varieties in light type equal others in heavy type having the same characteristics but where there is a. difference it is in favor of the varieties in heavy type. In cases of equal excellence, the best known has the preference.'
Sothat the varieties in heavy type, as a whole, and without disparagement to other excellent sorts,
may be said to embrace the leading kinds for general culture New. or comparatively unknown varieties also appear in light type; but for this distinction see
"Adaptability" column.

Norm—In referring to the time of ripeningv in the column headed "Season", “very early" ap-
plies to varieties marketed in September and October; “earl ”. to October and November varieties;
“early medium", November and December; "medium", ecember. January and February; “late medium", February and March; "late". March and April; “very late". April, May and later.

Nona—The region of orange production proper extends southward from Central Florida.
overlapping the upper portion of Southern Florida. Therefore. under “Adaptability” below theva-
rietics have been starred for “Southern Florida"; here. however, the starring applies more particu-
larly to the upper portion of the district.

and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts.

Rhianna—The Peach is successfully grown in localities throughout the ﬁreater part of the State, and in some districts is extensively produced for shipment to orthern mar-
Kets. As a rule, for this purpose, only those varieties are grown which are marked “earl ” and
“very early” in the above table, and which come in before the general crop farther north. 0 this there are some exceptions, notabl in Western North Florida, where some mid-season varieties, like Elberta, are successfully grown or shipment.
While the list of peaches grown in the State embraces many varieties, the various sections,
covering a wide range of latitude and longitude,diﬂer to such an extent in soil,climate and conditions of local environment, that the varieties adapted to a particular region are comparatively limited in number. A ﬁrst and vital essential to successful peach production is the adaptability of variety to llolcality; in general this is true of peaches to a greater extent than other fruits, and especially so in orida. ‘
No. 21 is of peculiar shape, being elongated, with deep suture, and sharp recurved point. It is very sweet as its name “Honey” indicates: This variety comes from China and is the progenitor of a race of peaches well suited to the central and northern sections'of the State. No. 38, the Peen-to, is also possessed of marked individual characteristics; its shape being ﬂat like a tomato. and unless grown with fertilizers rich in phosphoric acid and potash is apt to he possessed of a bitter almond or noyau ﬂavor. It comes from Southern China or Java and the varieties that have originated from it have given us a sub-tropical race of peaches well adapted to Southern and Central Florida. It is safe to say that nine-tenths of the commercial peach culture of peninsular Florida is conﬁned to the varieties that have been originated from the above two introductions from the Orient. It should be mentioned, however, that neither the varieties that have originated from the Honey or from the Pew-
to retain to such amarked extent the shape of the parent. Those that have originated from the Honey show a tendency to the recurved point but in a less marked degree. Those that have originated from the Peen-to are of regular peach shape. ‘

Ghana's—In many locations throughout the State varieties (as indicated by the starring above)
succeed well, and are grown for shipment to Northern markets as well as for local consumption and the manufacture of wine.
Fon Marmara—Delaware, Niagara, and lves (only) have proved a success as shipping grapes for distant markets (when properly packed). Diamond, on account of its compactness and tendency to crack, does not stand long shipment.
Fon Ran an.—Cynthiana, Norton and Ives are the red-wine grapes of Florida, as they are the red-wine grapes of the United States. Especially is this true of the ﬁrst two named; their juice is dark and rich in saccharine matter, and the wine made from these two grapes is said to possess great medicinal properties, owing to its large percentage of tannin.
F01! Wm]; Wm.—Elvira, Delaware and Niagara are, among the varieties above named, the best grapes for white wine—especially dry wine. It is from Elvira that the famous San Luis Sau-
ternes are made, which have established the reputation of Florida wines. Delaware is better adapted to the manufacture of sweet wine, and from Niagara a good dr wine can be made—much superior to the article made from Northern grown Niagaras, our Florida iagaras being almost entirely free from that foxy taste so prominent in all Northern Labruscas.
Ennornan Vanm'rms (V. vinifera.)—The U. 8. Department of Agriculture, Division of Pomo-

While new markets are often reluctant to take hold of it, wherever known it~sells well.
Nomenclature—While there has been much confusion in regard to the names of vari-
eties, the above kinds are now as well known as the leading varieties of other fruit; they embrace the most valuable kinds, and the names as given are correctly applied.
Characteristics—Some of the varieties have dark ﬂesh, others light ﬂesh, still others a mixture of the two. The light and dark ﬂesh differ radically in texture and consistency as well as appearance, and when found in the same fruit are never blended, but always dis-
tinct. The dark ﬂesh is never astringent; the light ﬂesh is astringent until it softens. The dark-ﬂeshed fruit is crisp and meaty, like an apple, and ls edible before it matures. Some of the entirely dark-ﬂeshed kinds improve as they soften, like Hyakume and Yeddolchi; oth-
ers are best when still hard, like Zengi and Tab ers No. 129. As they are good to eat before they are ripe, it is not so important that the dark-ﬂeshed kinds be allowed to reach a certain stage before being offered to consumers unfamiliar with the fruit. The light‘ﬂeshed kinds,
and those with mixed light and dark ﬂesh, are very delicious when they reach the custard-
like consistency of full ripeness. In some the stringency disappears as the fruit begins to soften, as the Yemon, and in a less degree with Okame and Tanenashi; in others it persists until the fruit is full ripe, as with Tsuru. The light-ﬂeshed kinds should not be otfered to con-
sumers unacqualnted with the fruit until in condition to be eaten. A person who has attempted to eat one of them when green and “puckery” will not be quick to repeat the experiment.
Seeds accompany the dark ﬂesh. The light-ﬂeshed kinds are seedless. The kind with mixed
ﬂesh have seeds in proportion to the quantity of dark ﬂesh. Hyakume, Zengi and Hachiya are usually overspread at the blossom end with penciling or net-work of dark lines, and this sometimes occurs in other kinds. , -
Varieties.—Tanenashi, Okame, Yemon and Yeddoichi excel in quality, perhaps in the order named. Okame (on account of the dliﬂculty of getting the fruits all in the same stage of ripeness) and Hachiya are not as good shippers as the others; the latter is valued for its immense size and showiness. Okame, on account of its long season, exquisite beauty, and superior quality, is the best for home use and local market Zengi and Tabers No. 129 are val-
ued for their earllness, as are Tsuru and Costata for their lateness. Oostata is very distinct and handsome in both tree and fruit. Hyakume is most generally grown of the dark-
ﬂeshed kinds. Tanenashi is, perhaps, most highly esteemedin the market Stock—The Kaki should be grafted on the native persimmon, on which it is much more satisfactory than upon its own or imported stocks.

COMMERCIAL BANANA CULTURE is conﬁned to the extreme lower portion of the peninsula.
Vanrs'rms.—The Baracoa is the ordinary Red Banana of commerce The Cavendish (M.
Cavendishii) is a dwarf species, also known as “Dwarf,” “Dwarf Jamaica," "Chinese."
Except the Orinoco, Hart's Choice has a more northern range than the other sorts. The Orinoco matures further north than any other variety, it is an ordinary plantain (M. paradisaica sapientumi as distinguished from the Banana or Sweet Plantain (of which Baracoa and Golden' are varieties); when allowed to ripen on the plant, it is of good quality, and desirable for home use, in sections too far north for other kinds.

Nuta.—The pecan has long been grown in the State in a small way; it ﬂourishes in many localities and its culture is proﬁtable. In addition to the four varieties above listed, other good varieties as yet only of local repute, will undoubtedly become prominent in the near future. The Japan chestnut, ot comparativer recent introduction, has proved fairly well adapted, but hardly worthy of extensive commercial culture. The Japan walnut, 01' still more recent introduction, bears well and makes a remarkably handaome tree, but is not up to the standard or the beat English walnuts in quality.
Extensive Cocoanut plantations are to be found on the southern coast. Little or no attention has been paid to varieties.

Bananas—Since 1895 strawberry culture has been largely extended, especially on the Western slope-of the peninsula. The Newnan has been allowed to degenerate and the fruit is now rather small for shipment. The Hoffman does better on clay than on sandy lands and needs high fertilizing.
The Cloud is vigorous in North Florida and stands drouth well; proliﬁc early in the season. Not liked so well in South Florida. Rising is very vigorous and proliﬁc. a ﬁrm berry and an ex-
cellent shipper. Its foliage, however, grows rather open and it does not protect its fruit well against a frost The Phenomenal seems to be almost identical with the Hoﬁman in physical characteristics.
but it has a longer season in South Florida. In Bradford county Aroma and Middleton's Early have been tested by individuals and reported on favorably. Glen Mary, Hood River, Dollar. Warﬁeld, Star,
Robbins Early, Splendid, Pride of Cumberland and Gandy have been tested and condemned. Klon-
dike is a recent introduction of great promise, and has been given a place in the list of desirable va-
rieties.
