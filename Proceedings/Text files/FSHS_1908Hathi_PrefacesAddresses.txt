PROCEEDINGS OF THE Twenty-First Annual Meeting OF THE Florida State Horticultural Society The Florida State Horticultural Society celebrated its twenty-ﬁrst an-
nual meeting in the beautiful and his-
toric city of Gainesville. It can be said of this meeting that it opened with the largest attendance of any meeting in the history of the Society. There have been other meetings when the total number in attendance was larger,
but at no time was the hall so ﬁlled with horticulturists from all over the state, and with townspeople, as greeted the fall of the President’s gavel at the opening session of this meeting. The attendance through the entire session was large and the whole time allotted for the program was taken up. None of the sessions were cut out or cur-
tailed, but the full time put in.
The members enjoyed the afternoon session at the State University and Experimental Grounds. They spent the time very proﬁtably in going over the ﬁeld and seeing what was being done and at the same time seeing what was needed to carry on the State work.
Many a member went home deter-
mined to appeal to his member of the Legislature to give the Experiment Station more consideration and a larger appropriation for its work, at the next meeting of the Legislature.
One address we are not able to give in our report was the lecture by Prof.
H, Harold Hume on “Adorning the Home Place," which was given com-
plimentary to the people of Gainesville.
This was a stereopticon lecture illus-
trating the good and bad effects of different planting of shrubs and trees.
The printing of the address without the illustrations would take away half of its value. As we are unable to print these this year, the members who did not attend will have to lose the pleas-
ure and proﬁt of Prof. Hume’s lecture.
\Vhen the time for the next place of meeting was brought up, Daytona, De-
Land, Orlando and Jacksonville were in the race. On the ﬁrst ballot it was left to DeLand and Daytona. and the latter won out by a few votes, con-
sequently the next annual meeting will be held at one of the prettiest towns

Address of Welcome.
By Col. Horatio Davis.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gmtlcmcn:
As mayor of this city, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Gainesville,
and in the words of Shakespeare’s charac-
ter, “I say to thee and to thy company,
I bid a hearty welcome.” Horticulture,
as the dictionaries say, is that department of agriculture which relates to the culti-
vation of ﬂowers, fruits and vegetables,
and where can such cultivation be more important than in a state with twelve hundred miles of sea coast, over seven hundred miles long, and every acre of land within that state tempered by sea breezes?
The Bible tells us that one of the ﬁrst commands given by God after He had created the earth, was for it to bring forth fruit, every tree after its own kind.
As soon as He had created man, He said to him, “I give you the fruit from these trees for your food.”
posed that when the trees came forth from the hand of God, it and its fruit were perfect, but as time passed, neglect worked its inevitable result, and the tree with its fruit deteriorated. As I under-
stand it, one of the endeavors of this so-
ciety is to learn how to bring back to that tree and its fruit, its pristine per-
fection.
It has been said that Florida has eight It is to be sup-.
months summer and four months warm weather. we who live in Florida know that this is not so. We know that we have four months summer and eight months pleasant weather, and there are but few days in which the horticulturist or agriculturist cannot work. “'here else in the world have you such a ﬁeld for your labor? Where else are such flow-
ers, fruits and vegetables awaiting scien-
tiﬁc research facing him as in Florida?
It is a public benefactor who causes two blades of grass to grow where one grew before. Is he not a public benefactor who tells us how to make our fruit and vegetables perfect, and how to adorn our homes with beautiful ﬂowers, and that.
I understand. is one of the objects of your association, and here, during thiﬁ
meeting, we will be told by a number of gentlemen how that object is to be ac-
complished.
\Vith such objects in view by your society. is it surprising that there is 110
city that is not proud to entertain you and feel honored by your presence?
It is customary on occasions of this kind for the speaker to present to the guests. the key of the city, but as Gaines-
ville is hospitable, she keeps no keys. Our doors are wide open. and I say to you a5
mayor of the city, “\Valk in and take p05-
session.”

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 21
THE RELATION OF THE UNIVERSITY TO THE HORTICUL-
TURAL SOCIETY.
Dr. Andrew Sledd.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlmncn:
I wish respectfully to endorse and sec—
ond the words of welcome which the Mayor has extended to your body, in behalf of your State University. We are very glad indeed to have you in our city, and esteem it a privilege and honor,
and trust you will feel that whatever we have out there; whatever of buildings,
or faculty, or service, is entirely at your disposal. \Ve hope to have the privi-
lege of having you out an afternoon and evening. On that occasion we wish you to take possession of the buildings and grounds, and we would like for you to go to and fro and see what is there so that you may know what we are trying to do in the cause of education.
I shall probably not be able to enjoy the Association on that occasion, by rea~
son of the fact that I have had an en-
gagement out of the city for some months,
but Prof. Rolfs will show you every cour-
tesy and more than take my place, I am sure.
Now, like the Irishman who wanted to make a few remarks before he said any-
thing, I address myself directly to the matter of The Relation of the University to the Horticultural Society. I will not presume in the preSence of these experts who are versed in technical knowledge,
to enter into any arguments or discus-
sions of a technical nature. I know very little about technical horticulture; but I address myself to you as citizens of the State, feeling that you are citizens before you are horticulturists. I feel that you are horticulturists as an incident, but that your citizenship is your chief work and one of the highest interests in your life.
Therefore, I think I can speak to you as citizens ﬁrst and then horticulturists.
Agricultural interests, including in them horticultural interests, are the great-
est single interests in the nation. Re-
cently I have been looking over some of our agricultural statistics, and ﬁnd that the amount of money that we get out of the ground through crops and fruits will amount to the amazing sum of over $6,-
5oo.ooo,ooo.oo; that our corn crop for one year would more than pay the na-
tional debt, and would sustain the na-
tional government for two years or more,
paying all of its expenses. The vast ma-
jority of our people are directly or indi-
rectly dependent upon agricultural inter-
ests. Not counting the non-productive elements of the population, such as chil-
dren under ten years of age and matrons in the home, there are 30,000,000 of peo-
ple in the United States engaged in gain-
ful occupations. Of that number, nearly forty per cent. are engaged in horticul-
tural and agricultural pursuits. This does not include their dependents. In our own state, forty-four per cent. of our working population is engaged in agricul-
tural pursuits; by far the largest propor-
tion engaged in any one line or calling in the state.
Gigantic as are the interests involved,


## p. 22 (#564) #############################################

22 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
enormous as are the numbers engaged in those interests, but little attention has been paid to reducing these interests to a scientiﬁc basis, or equipping those en-
gaged in this occupation for perfection in their work.
You will ﬁnd that the ﬁrst agricultural society was started in Philadelphia in
178 5, and had the names of George Wash-
ington, Benjamin Franklin and others as prominent on its lists. The ﬁrst profes-
sorship of agriculture was established at Columbia University at about the same time, in 1795. George \Vashington,
Benjamin Franklin and the others of whom I might speak took an active inter-
est in scientiﬁc learning in this line. The present interest, however, can be dated from about the time of the Civil War.
The passage of the Land Grant Act in ’62,
may be said to institute the ﬁrst concrete movement which still bears fruit for those people engaged in this tremendous and important work. It seems surprising that school men should have so long neg-
lected the practical application of the principles of education in this ﬁeld and that this mass of our population should not have had the beneﬁt of scientiﬁc study and research. The schools did, however,
under the attractions of the Rennaissance,
devote the main part of their time to the study of the classics, especially Latin, and to the development of a type of educa-
tion which is known even today as “cul-
tural”—a part of which is a certain dis-
regard, amounting almost to contempt,
for the practical. For a long time there has been, and is today in many commun-
ities a feeling that it is unworthy to spend one’s time in the study of practi-
cal things, and a corresponding respect for the man who is educated and trained along the lines of so-called “culture, don't you know.” This movement has not yet expended itself, and there are more pu-
pils in the schools of the United States today studying Latin than any other one subject, with the possible exception of al-
gebra. Fifty per cent. of the pupils of the United States still study Latin, and Latin isrequired in nearly all college en-
trance examinations and in most curricula of the colleges throughout the Union. 1
cannot quite appreciate the necessity for a superﬁcial knowledge of Latin, when a man’s life work is to be the growing of tobacco or corn or cotton; and it seems to me it would be far more beneﬁcial to the individual and to society at large it such a student would spend the time which he devotes to “culture” in the scientiﬁc study of the growing and curing of to-
bacco, or corn, or cotton; the prevention of diseases and the cure for same, and the wonders of germination and growth and maturity.
My education has been a classical one,
if you will pardon a personal allusion,
so that it represents a mighty revolution for me to say that in my judgment our educational ideas are fundamentally wrong, and whereas the majority devote themselves to the study of the classics and the small minority to the agricultural studies. the majority should devote themselves to a practical education, leav-
ing to the minority the dilettante pur-
suits of the so-called “culture.”
Since I862. there has grown up a num-
ber of institutions based upon that act of Mr. Morrill whose duty it is to instruct the mass of people in the practical affairs of life. These institutions now number
50. one of which is your own State Uni-
versity. There are ﬁfty institutions aet-
ing under the Morrill Act, the Land Grant Act. and other Acts supplementary thereto. Of the students attending these colleges, a large per cent. is women, and

there are altogether 44,000 men, a little over 10,000 being engaged in non-tech-
nical, non-agricultural work. There is a very large proportion, about 25
per cent. who are not engaged in the strict lines of work for which these institutions were established.
5,500 are engaged in some other course,
now and then taking a course in animal husbandry or some such branch. 6,000
are in the preparatory department, 21,000
only are engaged in the practical agri-
cultural and mechanical pursuits for which the institutions are intended. Now,
let us go a little further into the matter and take this 21,000 engaged in the prac-
tical agricultural and mechanical pursuits.
Out of this number we ﬁnd less than 3,000
engaged in the special work of agri-
culture and horticulture at this time, after forty years of effort in that direction. I mention this to show the persistent tenac-
ity of the old academic ideas, the per-
sistence of the notion that the only edu-
cation worth having involved the study of literature, especially the study of the classics. It is a very hard matter to con-
vince the school men in the ﬁrst place and the population at large, after the school men have been convinced, of the advis-
ability of a change in any educational sys-
tem,
Now, as I said, the bulk of the popula-
tion is engaged in agricultural and hor-
ticultural pursuits. It seems to me that the educational system should be laid out upon those lines in which the bulk of the population is interested. Less than four per cent. are engaged in professional pur-
suits, and yet our school system in the State of Florida, with the exception of the State University, is designed with reference to the four per cent, with al-
most total disregard of the remaining Population. In other words, in none of the schools of the State, except the State University, will you ﬁnd any instruction in horticultural and agricultural pursuits.
I wish to bring it to your attention that igis high time some action is taken with reference to changing this situation. The State University, your University, is the only institution offering instruction along these lines, but there should be many oth-
ers. The main part of our current ex-
penses is provided by the Federal Gov-
ernment, and provided with reference to the practical instruction of the young men of the State, the vast forty-four per cent. of the young men of the State, who will be interested in agri-
cultural pursuits.
Our ideal out here is to serve the peo-
ple according to the people’s needs; and these needs are not, as we understand it,
to be found mainly in the realm of cul-
ture, but the people’s needs begin with the need to eat. We begin with this funda-
mental need, and go up, up with the needs of the people, up and up to the needs of the intellect and into the needs of the spirit manifested in right living. But ﬁrst and foremost is the all-dominant need, the need to eat. I hold that it is a proper function of the schools to raise the stand-
ard of living; and to do this, it is neces-
sary to improve the workman. Your in-
stitution is organized on that basis. The farmer must be equipped with knowledge of the whys and wherefores, he must know the principles of causes and effects and have a certain amount of scientiﬁc knowledge with which to combat the evils which are the enemies to successful agri-
culture or horticulture. Of the 15 of this faculty, II are engaged under this general head: to equip the worker with the proper knowledge. I include the Professor of Physics, the Professor of Botany. and except only the Professors

of Modern Languages, History, Philos-
ophy, and Ancient Languages. We offer four year courses in Horticulture, Agri-
culture, Mechanical, Civil and Electrical Engineering in addition to four year courses in General Science and four year course in Literature, Philosophy, and Pedagogy, which do not belong under this head. \Ve also offer a two year course in Agriculture, and a two year course in the Mechanical Arts.
Under the Buckman Bill we are re quired to maintain certain entrance re-
quirements which may be modiﬁed by the Board of Control. They have been so modiﬁed, and we now admit students who have completed the eleventh grade of the public schools. We accept actual farmer boys in the department of Agri-
culture without their coming up to those requirements. The young farmer boys throughout the State who really want to learn the scientiﬁc elements of agricul-
ture and horticulture and the elements of mechanical arts have an open door and a hearty welcome into the institution.
We hold, with the possible exception of a few of our men who are still joined to their idols of “culture,” that our ﬁrst duty is to the largest body of our citizens,
'and the last duty to the smallest body,
and we have done all that we can to ac—
complish that result. .
Now I want to tell you some of the results. I said it was a hard matter to convince the people after you convince school men. W e are convinced that the methods of education which we represent are the proper methods; we are howling dervishes in our conviction. You can hear us howl. If you listen you can hear Prof, Rolfs and myself howl clear down on the Gulf Coast and on the East Coast and down in the Everglades. We are convinced. The next proposition is to convince the people that this proposi-
tion is true and that we are prepared to serve them. Let me give you a few
*facts and ﬁgures. Before I give you these, let me illustrate from the situation in the State of Missouri. There are 555
high schools in that State which are re-
quired to give instruction in agriculture.
In these schools, how many do you think were taking Latin and how many do you think were taking the course in agricul-
ture? Out of the students in 555 high schools which were required by the law to have a course in agriculture, 28,000
students, who had the opportunity brought to them in the schools to take agriculture and at the same time the op-
portunity to take Latin, 14,000 were tak-
ing Latin and 1,180 taking agriculture!
Now, in our own State Institution, we have an enrollment under the Agricul-
tural and Mechanical College Acts, of college students amounting to ﬁfty-two.
That does not count two or three grad-
uate students or some 25 or 26 students who are taking the literary course. The total enrollment for the year just close-l has been IO3—very small, but still the largest college enrollment in the State.
\Ne include in this 31 preparatory and some graduate students, but of those tak-
ing the regular Agricultural and Mechan-
ical College courses, there were 52.
Now, gentlemen, the doors are open for a scientiﬁc education along the lines in which you are most interested. Prof.
Rolfs and myself are going up and down the State trying to convince the people that what they want and need is educa-
tion along the practical lines of agricul-
ture and horticulture. There is no tui-
tion fee, no laboratory fee; board, fuel and lights at $15.00 per month; and yet we have under the agriculture college professors, 52 students in agriculture and

the kindred subjects. This state of af-
fairs ought not to be.
It seems to me there are three reasons for this condition. In the ﬁrst place, the farmers of the State do not realize the necessity for a technical education. They do not realize that agriculture is a science and that horticulture is a science. They think if their grandfather plowed with '1
rope line over a lop-eared mule they should not show disrespect to his mem-
ory by endeavoring to improve on his methods. His antiquated methods were agriculture, and agriculture is just simply agriculture. Another difﬁculty is that the rural population does not realize the possibility of technical education in those lines. It is a new idea. Agriculture used to be regarded as a business which did not need much, if any, apprenticeship.
It was simply a matter of “being brung up to it.” The average farmer or fruit-
grower thought the “book—farmer” a fool,
——and perhaps they were sometimes right.
There is a general prejudice against the
“book treatment” of the subject. You have undoubtedly observed this in your own community. The average farmer will say, “Oh, he is just a book farmer and can’t teach me nothing.” Of course,
“the book farmer” in the early stages of his career made mistakes, and is still mak-
ing them, perhaps; but, as a whole, the fair-minded man is willing to concede that he has more than made good. The third difﬁculty that is observed is that there is no movement in the State except this one struggling enterprise looking to this end. There is no high school in the State representing this idea. There is no school in the State teaching these things.
As a consequence, there is no stimulus towards the University, and it is really remarkable that we get more than ﬁve or six to come up here to study.
This Society, in my judgment, might be extremely effective in facilitating a general movement in the State for carry-
ing horticultural and agricultural educa-
tion down into the graded schools. I do not know anything more pitiful than to see a little country boy going up to read
“Gallia est divisa in partes tres,” or some-
thing like that, and learning nothing and caring nothing about the wonderful branch of industry which he is to make the work of his future life, knowing noth-
ing and caring nothing about the planting and germinating and growth of a grain of corn or wheat,—devoting a quarter of his precious time to a study which will not do him the remotest good which had far better be spent in studying the science of plant and vegetable life. Now, he could at least learn that it is a science and that it is to his interest and is his bus-
iness to study that science; and if he be-
gins the study he will follow it up through the University,
Now, as I have before said, the run-
ning expenses of the University are met mainly through the Federal Government.
In nearly sixty per cent. of the states in the Union, the State is appropriating more for its agricultural and mechanical colleges than the Federal Government.
In some states they have practically as-
sumed the entire support of these institu-
tions. In our own State, the State gives about one-third of the current income.
The institution could not be run three months on the State appropriation for current expenses. We are anxious to serve the farmer boy. We are convinced,
and we want to convince the people and we trust that this meeting of the Horti-
cultural Society may contribute to that end. We believe that sooner or later we will succeed; we know we must succeed,
because practical training is the only

training for a practical man living a prac-
tical life in a practical age. I do not mean to depreciate true culture, but what we need ﬁrst in this and every other State,
is an education which gets right down to the practical phases of everyday life; and the gentlemen of this distinguished So-
ciety can be of the utmost service in car-
rying forward that idea. We need more practical education introduced into our common schools, into our high schools;
and this University, your University,
gentlemen, needs and should receive the co-operation and liberal support of the State, in its campaign for the practical education of the masses of the people,
and in its earnest efforts to serve all the people of our common State according to their needs.
RESPONSE.

Dr. W. C. Richardson, Tampa. '
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I certainly esteem it a privilege and an honor to address an audience in this great educational centre of the state. I am afraid, however, that what may be a source of pride to me may be an inﬂic-
tion to you before we get through with it. If it is in the nature of an inﬂiction,
no one will be to blame but your Presi-
dent. When I got his notiﬁcation that I was expected to respond to these ad-
dresses, I was on the eve of going to my groves. I returned home last Friday morning, but with my usual habit of pro-
crastination, had put of? writing my ad-
dress. When I got home Friday morn-
ing, the good Lord had seen ﬁt to send a little grandchild to my daughter's home and that upset me, naturally. So, in the whirl of events, I did not have any time to prepare my address. Then I thought the best thing to do was to look over the records of the proceedings of the last few years and see what had been said and patch up something extemporaneous from that. \Vell, when I tell you what I found, you will know what I was up against there. We had, at the last meet-
ing, an address from our respected friend,
Dr. Kerr. The meeting before that we had an address from our beloved friend,
Mr. Taber, and the meeting before that we had an address from our revered and lamented Mr. McCarty. No one can compete in eloquence, style, ﬂuency and interest with the addresses of these men.
But I am here; it is up to me, and I am somewhat in the position of the hero in one of Bret Hart’s little poems. He was a preacher and a miner, and the bur-
den of the refrain was “He always did his level best," and that is what I am here to do.
I want to say that I am particularly proud to come here to that which is es-
sentially ours; to our University and our faculty. I am particularly delighted to have heard the head of that University speak as he has done. I have thought for years, in my conceit, that I was one of a few men who thought and talked that the only kind of an education that

was worth having, is an education along practical lines, but to hear it from the President of a University is a surprise and a pleasure.
I realize, as he realizes, that a techni-
cal education along technical lines is far better, far more useful and far more ben-
eﬁcial in every way than a so-called clas-
sical education. I think it was Oliver W'endell Holmes who wrote:
“There is many a one, though highly skilled in hic, hac, hoe,
In arts and knowledge still a block."
When my children had grown up and were in school, they laughed at this quo-
tation, saying that my Latin pronuncia-
tion was old style and wrong and that it should be heck, hyke. hoke. I said,
“Let it go at that even, and it will still be applicable as
‘There is many a one though highly skilled in heek, hyke, hoke,
In arts and knowledge still a BLoxEl’ "
I am delighted to know that we have this kind of an institution. I am delighted to know that we have this kind of men at its head. As has been said. “It is ours,” and I am glad that we have come to our own at last.
Now, Mr. Mayor, I want to thank you for your courteous invitation to your hos-
pitalities, for your courteous welcome to what you have here. and they are no small things. \Ve appreciate this city with its paved streets, with its great Uni-
versity, with its great men, and we es-
teem it a privilege to be here. We are glad, and we realize that you understand that Horticulture is more and higher than a human institution. \Ve may come up here with hard hands and hard heads,
perhaps, as sons of toil, but nevertheless we are horticulturists, and horticulturists are men who have something to be proud of. The calling of horticulture is, as you have intimated, of Divine origin. The
ﬁrst horticulturist was the Creator Him-
self. He prepared the garden, put fruits and ﬂowers into it, and ﬁnally put man into it. Man, in his usual manner, dis-
tinguished himself by getting into trouble the ﬁrst thing, and then blamed it onto the woman. Unfortunately for us, the Crea-
tor did the same thing that we are doing.
He put a tree of evil in there, and that caused the trouble.
There was another reference made by your Honor, about anyone being a bene-
factor who caused two blades of grass to grow where one grew before. I want to say that we are, on that proposition, mul-
tiple benefactors. There isn’t one of us who has not beat that all to pieces. If you don't believe it, try to dig up a blade of Bermuda grass and see what follows.
These gentlemen who have preceded me have not taken up all the time allotted to them, and unlike the omnipresent poli-
tician, I have been “elected,'’ for the evening at least, consequently I don’t have to quit.
Isn’t it a wonderful thing that the Bi-
ble speaks so often of fruits and ﬂowers?
It refers to the rose, the lily, the pome-
granate, the olive and the ﬁg, but never a word about the grosser productions such as potatoes, carrots, cabbage, etc.
‘The most wonderful thing that has ever happened, the greatest event that was ever enacted in the world’s history, took place in an olive grove; I mean that won.
derful scene that was enacted in the gar-
den of Gethsamene. ~ I was in that gar.
den about two years ago, therefore it may not be amiss for me to say a word in regard to it. _I can understand why the peopleof Palestine take to horticul-
ture instead of agriculture. They \vOuId not enjoy plowing with a lop-cared mule,

L'S FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
01' plowing at all for that matter. And,
by the way, they have no lop-cared mules in Palestine, and no plows, but you see them scratching along with a forked stick drawn by a cow, or occasionally an un—
dersized donkey; that is the nearest ap‘
proach to a lopeared mule in Palestine.
It is the ﬁnest country for good or-
anges in the world. The JaFfa orange is the best orange I have ever seen. It has been my privilege to eat those oranges right from the trees, but delicious as they are, give me Florida every time. I would not give a quarter section of Florida sand for a township in Palestine. \Vhen I stood in the hill country of Judea looking out 'over the valley of the Jordan and saw the mountains of Moab and Nebo’s lonely peak in all its glory, the idea oc-
curred to me that the Lord was certainly good to Moses to let him die before he got into the land of Palestine. Perhaps it is not today what it was in the day of Moses. Today, it is a land of dirt,
ﬁlth, ignorance and Turkish misrule, and nothing to commend it. Give me Florida every time.
There is one other thing I want 'to bring before you. I think we too fre-
quently neglect to live up to our oppor-
tunities and to make the most of our immediate surroundings. \Ne come up here to these meetings, resolving to do and be done. \Ve come together, hop-
ing to do ourselves and our occupation good, and we talk beautifully and make plans, and resolute—and then we go home and in a few weeks fall back into our lethargic, indiﬁ'erent, indolent meth—
ods, and our good resolutions are all for-
gotten. Now, if we could carry some of our enthusiasm home with us, if we would carry some of our resolutions home and act upon them, it would be better for us, it would be better for the business in which we are engaged, it would be bet-
ter for the institution of which you, Mr.
President, have spoken. Let us try to do it; let us realize that here in Florida we have opportunities such as are found in few countries of the world, certainly in very few states of the Union. Let us work with the determination to make the most of our opportunities. Let us do the best we can to further the interests of our Society and our great educational institution.
I remember reading some time ago of a ship in the days of sailing vessels. The ship had met with contrary weather, and had been partly dismantled, driven from its course, and ﬁnally the water had given out. At last, when the crew was about to perish from thirst, a vessel was seen approaching. The captain of the dam—
aged ship called through the trumpet,
“Give us water,” and the answer came back, “Drop your buckets where you are!" They thought it a strange answer and repeated again, “Water! We per-
ish! Give us water.” Again the answer came back, “Drop your buckets where you are!" The third time they begged for water, and the third time the answer came back, “Drop your buckets where you are!” They ﬁnally thought there must be some reason for such an answer and dropped their buckets which came up ﬁlled and brimming with fresh, sweet water. They had been driven into the hundred-mile—wide mouth of the Amazon and did not know that they were sur-
rounded with fresh water.
Now, when we are perishing with a

diversity of trials, when we are disman-
tled by freezes, droughts, white ﬂies, po-
litical campaigns, etc., we should drop our buckets where we are, and bring them up ﬁlled with the reviving water of re-
newed courage, prosperity and success.
In conclusion, let me say that
“This world is full of beauty like other worlds,
above;
And if we do but our duty, it will be full of love."

President’s Annual Address.
By Prof. P. H. Rolfs.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
\Ve are here to hold our twenty-ﬁrst annual meeting. The hand of fate has guided us during these twenty years into the most distant portions of the state;
from Pensacola on the west, to St. Au-
gustine on the east and Miami on the south. It is quite probable that when Key West shall be made the most south-
ern railway station in Florida we will stretch out a hand of welcome to our lusty young neighbor, the Cuban Horti-
cultural Society.
During our devious wanderings and in the course of these two decades, our membership has gradually increased.
Even the terrible freezes could not chill the ardor for information. The meet-
ing of 1895, following the most disas-
trous catastrophe the state has known,
was characterized by the most earnest attention to the program. While the at-
tendance was smaller than at some of the previous ones, the membership was suf-
ﬁcient to enable us to print the annual proceedings.
Of the members who took part in the organization at Ocala, only four of the original eighteen remain to us. Our worthy and distinguished ex-president was then a lusty youngster. You would not know that he is a year older today,
if it were not for a slight intimation of gray, and his dignity when in the execu-
tive chair.
CHAN GES IN VARIETIES:
Twenty years ago the list of varieties of oranges was probably as long as the list of today. Many that were at that time thought to be the best have since been discarded, and six varieties not then recognized are ranked as among the best today. The list of those that have orig-
inated in Florida is increasing, and it is quite probable that in the course of time the leading varieties will be those that have originated in our state.
In our ﬁrst catalog of Florida fruits only one variety of grapefruit was recog-
nized. There are now at least a score,
nine of which are catalogued by this So-
ciety. The old many-seeded, ﬁrst-known grapefruit is rapidly being displaced by newer and less seedy varieties.
The progressive changes in the citrus fruits are however no greater than in the deciduous fruits.
In the case of vegetables we have a much more radical change. The old va-
rieties have been almost entirely replaced.
In fact, vegetables were grown only to a limited extent twenty years ago. Even celery was spoken of as an experiment as late as the report of our ﬁfth meet-
ing.
CHANGES IN RAILROADING.
At the time of the founding of this Society (1888) a large part of the state was horticulturally unknown. Such rail-
roads as occurred in the state were poorly

equipped, and many were disjointed frag-
ments beginning in a hammock and end—
ing somewhere in the piney woods. How horticulturists ever succeeded in making a living under those conditions of trans-
portation is impossible for us of a later day to understand. The following inci-
dent, which occurred in the spring of
1892, illustrates the indifferent way in which business was done on some of the plug lines then in operation. Some co-
operative experiments were being car-
ried on at Grand Island, and it was de-
sirable for me to make my way from Eus-
tis to a point on the Sanford 81 St. P. R.
R. By driving to Tavares one would be able to take the T. & G. then popularly known as the “Tag.” which left at about sunrise. On the morning in question,
the train, probably the only one on the road, was composed of a few box carsv and a coach for accommodating passen-
gers. The train started about a half hour late, but still early enough to prevent the passengers from obtaining breakfast.
After running for an hour or an hour and a half the train stopped suddenly in the woods. The whole crew, from ﬁre-
man to conductor, abandoned the train and started directly for a nearby water-
melon ﬁeld. We passengers discussed among ourselves whether to follow or to remain. To our surprise, the train men went leisurely about to ﬁnd the choicest melons, carried them to a fence, sat down and ate until satisﬁed, and then each car-
ried back to the train one or two melons.
\Vell, to cut the story short, we got to Clermont just in time to see the train we wished to take pull out from the other station. One train a day. Passengers and perishable fruit left at a junction point without any reasonable cause.
VV'hile we do not live under ideal condi-
tions at present, the passenger and freight trafﬁc is fairly good compared with a decade and a half ago.
THE PRACTICAL HORTICULTURIST AN AR-
TIST.
The progress made in the production of ﬁne fruit is fully as great, or possibly greater, than that in transportation. We all recognize the fact, however, that we still have much to learn. If it were not for the strong desire to improve on our present condition we would not be as-
sembled here.
The best horticulturists of today in Florida are artists in their special lines.
It takes as much careful thought, and as much application of this thought, to produce an ideal tomato, or an ideal or—
ange or grapefruit, as it does to produce a ﬁne picture on canvas, or to build an engine. As there are only a few master hands that can command a talent sufﬁ-
cient to produce a really ﬁrst-class paint-
ing, so there are only a few who produce a really superior horticultural product;
and still fewer who have the commer-
cial instinct sufﬁciently developed to get the highest price for their product.
The pioneer fruit and vegetable grower lives under conditions that enable him to extract a mere existence in exchange for his toil and thought. It is quite natural that he should become more or less dis-
satisﬁed with his lot in life. His sur—
roundings cause him to lose interest in his work and home; he either sinks into a careless and indifferent existence, or drifts to a populous center where he be-
comes a mere atom in human existence,
and tosses about from one engagement to another.
MIGRATION 'ro BUSINESS CENTERS.
Under our old routine rule-of-thumb method of horticulture, the farmer and his children were mere machines, which

did a certain amount of work at the ex-
pense of a certain amount of energy. The thinking-mechanism was scarcely called into action. Under such conditions it is no wonder that our young men and young women sought relief by migrat—
ing to the business centers. The evidence from history is that our foremost states-
men, our foremost men and women in literary pursuits, as well as our foremost business men, were in the majority of cases raised in the country. This migra-
tion to the business centers still continues.
It is not surprising to those who have studied the matter, and who perceive somewhat clearly the cause. You cannot blame a young woman for hesitating to accept the position of a wife in the coun-
try, when laborious drudgery, from early morning until late at night, is the only prospect in view. You cannot blame the young man for shrinking from a life of six days constant toil, and a Sunday of only half rest. Under such conditions we ﬁnd even the fathers and mothers,
who have spent possibly a half century of constant vigil on the farm, moving to the town or city to retire and spend the rest of their lives in comfort. This move to the city would never have been contemplated if they had been perfectly contented on the farm; or if the farm were the ideal place it ought to be. They move to town because their money will there buy them the comforts that were not obtainable in the country.
MIGRATION TO THE FARM AT PRESENT l M POSSIBLE.
I have called attention to the fact of history that a larger percentage of our leading men and women were raised on farms than was due to the rural popula—
tion. There must therefore be some vir-
tue in the country as such for producing superior intellects, sturdy manhood and womanhood. Let us for a moment look at the extreme negative of this question.
In the tenement district of New York City, which is the most populous center in America, there hangs a diagram show-
ing the number of people to the acre of ground. It is calculated that at the same rate of crowding the world’s population could be placed in the State of Delaware.
An accompanying diagram shows that the average boy and girl in this crowded section is far below the normal size.
These facts are so well known to my hearers that it is useless for me to en-
large upon them. My speech has recalle-l to you the well known fact that we have a constant stream of migration from the country to the town, and n0 counter-cur-
rent to the farm. It speaks volumes for the thrift and strength of those who re-
main that this condition could have gone on for decades. The stream has been all one way—toward the town. It should not be understood that I would raise an argument against migration to the city.
It very often happens that a very poor farmer would have made a ﬁrst-class mer-
chant, lawyer, preacher, or doctor. No two of us are endowed with the same talents and tastes combined in the same manner. \Ve cannot readjust the ele-
ments that make up our talents and intel-
lects, but it is our divinely—appointed duty to seek and ﬁnd the vocation for which we have been best endowed.
BACK TO THE FARM.
Thousands of people, possibly hun-
dreds of thousands, in the United States
ﬁnd out when too late to change, that they have taken up the wrong vocation.
The following is a composite of scores

of pathetic letters that have come to my oﬁice for a reply:
Dear Sir :—I have twelve hundred dol-
lars that I have saved in the last ten years and wish to start in farming or fruit growing, as my health has .been pretty badly broken by hard ofﬁce work.
There are three children in our family who ought to be brought up on a farm.
I want to get away from town so that I can enjoy the companionship of my family.
\Vhere in your state can I invest and make a living from the start?
Yours truly,
Can there be anything more pathetic?
After ten years of hard, unrelenting toil,
with health broken, and disappointed in his highest ambition of providin'r for his family. Ten years of the best of his life spent in following the wrong vocation.
Ready, like the drowning man, to grasp at a straw. he risks his future on the ad-
vice of a man to him unknown and in a distant state. I must confess to you,
ladies and gentlemen, that when that prop-
osition is placed before me to answer, my courage fails. It is too serious a mat-
ter. -
These letters, of which the above is a composite, would not have made so deep an impression on my mind; nor would I have realized the magnitude of the un-
rest in the city population, but for one incident that came to my attention rather accidentally.
Mr. A, D. Shamel, a young friend of mine, was asked to award the prizes in the corn exhibit of the North-west. In an interview with a Chicago newspaper reporter he made mention of the fact that many young men wanted to go back to the farm. In less than ten hours letters began to pour in, and for two days three stenographers were unable to complete the work of replying to the inquiries.
This happened just before the money panic. The burden of all these inquiries was, How to get back to the farm?
I do not contend that all of these men would make a success of farm work. It had been clearly demonstrated to them,
however, that they were misﬁts in the city. They were eagerly seeking for an opportunity to get away from the city,
but the way was securely blocked.
I have drawn out these illustrations at length to show fully the present condi-
tion. (No one can say that he is not in-
terested, for it is our own children who are swelling and will swell the throngs in the over-crowded cities.)
Dr. Sledd, in his address tonight, has shown most clearly that our public schools teach our boys and girls away from the farm and from the grove. Nowhere in our common school system do we ﬁnd anything that will make the boy more efﬁcient on the farm or grove, or the girl more efﬁcient in the house.
AGRICULTURE IN OUR COMMON SCHOOLS.
In discussing the matter of agricul-
tural education in various parts of the state this year, a number of people have told me that they could teach their boy more agriculture and better agriculture on the farm than he could learn in any school. My natural retort is: “But do you do it ?” The candid answer must be,
No. Every mother here is able to teach her girls and boys arithmetic, spelling,
and geography; but she does not do it,
simply because it is much cheaper to hire it done, and at the same time the teach-
ing will be much more efﬁcient. Let me ask again: How many of ussend our.

children to hear the reminiscences and war stories told from grocery boxes, and call that history? The agriculture that is taught in the ﬁeld while driving a mule or “cussing” a laborer bears about the same relation to agriculture that the gro-
cery-box reminiscences do to history. It is not because the subject is too intricate or difﬁcult, but no parent can afford to take the time from his busy day of labor to assume the role of a teacher. and give his son a systematic and rounded course
' in agriculture, any more than he can af-
ford to give his son a course in arithme-
tic or bookkeeping. It takes no longer to teach a dozen students in the same class than one; consequently, it is much cheaper to hire some one to teach a whole class than it is to spend all the time on one student. '
Probably the most potent reason why agriculture is at present so imperfectly developed in that adequate systematic effort for its advancement has not been made. Organized and concerted ef-
forts for its advancement have been practically unknown until very re-
cently: and at present even higher edu-
cation in agriculture cannot be said to be well organized. excepting in those states that are most advanced.
\Ve are entering a period where or-
ganized and systematic effort will be re-
quired to accomplish anything even of moderate proportion. Agriculture, the newest of the sciences, is being rounded.
out and brought into tangible shape.
Our sister states, Georgia and Alabama,
have made provision for district high schools in which are taught agriculture and domestic science.
This is well enough so far as it goes,
. but it stops too high up. The very pu-
pils who need the education most are the ones that are denied the privilege of at-
tending the high schools. It is only a small percentage of our Florida boys and girls that receive any training above the eighth grade. These young people need to get some insight into the plants and an-
imals they see and handle every day.
Books have been, and are being, pub-
lishetl bringing our knowledge into a concrete and teachable form. What if they don’t learn quite so much about the number of planets, or recite fewer deﬁni-
tions from a so-called grammar!
It is not necessary to over-burden the course of study with agriculture in order that -we may have pupils to study it.
There are many thousands of children that do not receive any instruction at all.
who would gladly avail themselves of a chance to learn something that appeals to them as being worth the while.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen. I wish to say that we have left our homes and labors at no small sacriﬁce. \Ve are here not for the mere pleasure we get out of the trip—that is a mere incident to the annual pilgrims: nor are we here that we may accumulate a few more dollars by some sordid method; but we expect to go back better men and better women;
better equipped mentally and morally for the unceasing struggle of life. We ex-
pect to return home with newer and bet—
ter ideas of how to equip and beautify the home; and above all, we expect to be better women and men for having met our distant friends and neighbors on common ground for argument and dis-
cussion.
As your presiding ofﬁcer, I hope that the arguments will be strong and force-
ful, and the discussions vigorous and t0
the point, sparing neither colleague nor adversary: for it is the heated furnace that separates the gold from the dross.
