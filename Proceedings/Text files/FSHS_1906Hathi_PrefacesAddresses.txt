PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINETEENTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE Florida State Horticultural Society.
The Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the Florida State Horticultural Society was held in the Auditorium of the Windsor Hotel commencing on the evening of May Ist 1906.
Theopening meeting was unusually well attended and the different addresses were greatly appreciated by the audience. N or—
withstanding the weather during the three days was intensely hot the sessions were fairly well attended.
The latest introduction into the Society‘
was the “Question Box,” and it proved quite interesting. as will be seen by the printed questions and answers in this report. This is a feature that the mem-
bers can take advantage of, even if they are not in attendance, by sending their questions to the president by mail. which will be opened. and answered during the sessions.
The Board of Trade delighted the members with another one of its famous musicales, rendered by the “Ladies Friday Musicale." So very popular are these musicales that the commodious hall of the Board of Trade building was packed to standing room.
There was a spirited contest when the question of the next place of meeting came up. between those who wanted to come again to Jacksonville and those who preferred to visit other parts of the State.
St. Petersburg was well represented. and won the day. so that the Twentieth An-
nual Meeting will he held in the “Gem City of the \\'est Coast."

Addresses of Welcome.
BY HON. D. U. FLETCHER.
Mr. Fletcher spoke extemporaneously and rather rapidly, so we are only able to give more than an outline of his happy and well received address.
Among other things he said: A day or two ago I received a letter from Secretary Painter informing me that he had called me up over the telephone and requested me to perform tonight, that he had print-
ed the programs, putting my name on them and enclosed one, hoping I would be present. I told him that. under the circumstances, I would be here although the notice gave me no chance for any pre-
paration. I approve of the Secretary’s way. however. He accomplishes what he wants and in the easiest, most satisfactory manner. He gets his speaker and the lat-
ter has no time to make excuses or get nervous.
There is nothing the Horticultural So-
ciety could ask of me that I would not make an effort to grant. \V e give you a warm welcome. but the weather seems in-
clined to over-do the thing. It is un-
necessary for me to emphasize the warmth of our greeting. and I assure you that is equally true of its sincerity.
I would feel very much more at home probably discussing some other subject than Horticulture. If our friend Painter should sell a lot of fertilizer and accept a four months note in payment. which he negotiated at the bank. and the parties re-
fused to pay on the ground the fertilizer was not beneﬁcial. I could say whether or not he would have it to pay; or if Mr.
Taber should send out nursery stock to be paid for at a certain time. reserving the title to the trees, I might answer as to whether or not the purchaser could keep the trees without paying the price as agreed.
If this were an agricultural gathering I would be much more at home. I have had some experience raising nubbin corn and bumble bee cotton- Nubbin corn is that kind too poor to shuck. and the cotton referred to is the kind which a bumble bee can suck the top blossom off while sitting on the ground. You have heard of the Doc-
tor who had a patient with fever, and after doing all he could for him. he gave him some medicine at last that threw the pa-
tient into convulsions and when asked why he did so. he stated that he had treated him for days and days for fever and he did not know how to cure the fever,
but he did know how to cure ﬁts and so was giving him something to throw him into ﬁts. If I could change this Conven—
tion into an Agricultural Convention there are many things I could speak of from experience.
Horticulture is a kind of high toned agriculture. or the elite of agricultural pursuits. I imagine this thing of stand-
ing on the shady side of an orange tree and watching its beautiful leaves and en-
joying its odoriferous ﬂowers while culti-
vating it. following it as the sun moves

from one side to the other, is very much better and more pleasant than chopping cotton or plowing corn out in the open,
where the unobstructed rays of the sun beat upon you, and no prospect pleases.
There can be few things more impor-
tant than this great industry you are de-
veloping and fostering. As we recall'in
1899. the value of the fruit products of the United States was $1 31.000.000 and the vegetable products. not including p0—
tatoes was $131,000,000, and we exported over $9,000,000 worth during that year.
The life of the Horticulturist is one of the most joyous and free allotted to man.
If we did not have any freezes. or if we could avoid the consequences of them;
or if we were not troubled with foot rot,
and if the white ﬂy would leave us alone.
and if it rained when it should and ceased when it ought. and if we had satisfactory transportation. and if we could hit the market right, and if we were given proper treatment by consignees, and if a few other things happened, or didn’t happen,
your meetings would partake more of the nature of an annual celebration and you would be touring the country in automo-
biles. _ '
Now, this is the reason you are here;
the purpose of this organization is to sur-
mount the obstacles of this little .word.
“if.” There can be no better or higher purpose of any organization- To solve the questions how to preserve for the human race the necessary food products is a work worthy the brightest minds. the greatest skill. the most persistent industry.
It demands the highest and best activities of the most gifted men and women. It calls for the exercise of judgment. It proceeds upon investigation and study.
It must have the knowledge born of ex-
perience.
We read of the great scientists and statesmen who have won distinction and whose names will be known as long as we have history. but I would ask you wheth—
er Copernicus. Gallileo, Michael Angelo,
or Isaac Newton accomplished more for the world than the men who have made,
developed. and placed on our tables our fruits, ﬂowers and vegetables in their perfection. Of these great scientists who have won distinction, is there any one more entitled to fame than the man who introduced and developed the potato, ap-
ple. peach. rose. or made the white black-
berry and the spineless cactus. Is there one more entitled to fame or to whom man-
kind is more indebted than to Luther Burbank, the American naturalist?
Our Legislature meets every two years'
and passes laws affecting the welfare of the people of this State; there is no more important matter which can command the attention of our law makers and oFﬁcials than the requests of this Society. I can conceive that you might be aided in your eﬁ‘orts by legislation along certain lines and surely there will be found patriotism and public spirit suﬁicient to give a hearty response to your appeal and a generous support to your work. There is no more important organization in this State than yours. and your work for the industrial development of Florida and for the material welfare of her people should meet with every encouragment from every quarter. ’
It is a great pleasure to welcome you here—peculiarly wholesome and joyous and an honor to come in touch with the noble men and women from all portions of the State. who live nearest the fountain of life in the Divine Economy!
Jacksonville recognizes that whatever makes for the prosperity of any portion

of the State is a thing to be desired. She has no prejudices—she reaches out to all sections and would promote the good of each. She loves all the people of the whole State and would have them pros—
per and their various undertakings and enterprises succeed. In this spirit she wishes your meeting here may be proﬁt~
able, and again bids you welcome.

ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.

BY CAPT. C. E. GARNER.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In behalf of the Board of Trade and representing the business interests of our city, it is again my pleasure to extend to you Mr. President, the ofﬁcers, and to every member of the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society, a most hearty and sin-
cere welcome.
I had in mind telling you a great many things. I had conceived of a magniﬁcent oration, expressing my personal senti-
ments of the Horticultural Society, of its splendid work in behalf of our beloved State, and I also had in mind telling you something of the progress and prosperity of our city; but, to use the yachting phrase, “my little craft has had the wind taken out of its sails” by the eloquence of the gentleman who has just preceded me.
If any one in this audience thinks they can follow the Hon. D. U. Fletcher along the same lines, and especially in the mat-
ter of delivering an address of welcome,
and say anything original, or anything appropriate to the occasion which has not already been said, I would like for him to step up on this platform and take my place because I feel utterly unable to con-
ceive of anything that is appropriate that would not be a reiteration of what had been stated.
I wish, therefore, to simply express my high appreciation not only of the Horti—
cultural Society as an organization but of the Horticulturists of the State of Florida.
Probably no man within the bounds of the State has been brought in closer con-
tact with them than myself. It is not an acquaintance of a few days or a few years but for a quarter of a century I have known them, and know them intimately,
and I wish on this occasion to say that they are in my judgment the bravest.
most heroic class of people in this country.
I know of their struggles, I have seen them under all circumstances, of pros-
perity and adversity, chieﬂy the latter.
and if you wish to measure the heroism of people you must be acquainted with them under all conditions. and I know of no people who have withstood adversit}
with a braver spirit than have the Horti-
culturists of this State.
You talk about the rebuilding of your city, the rebuilding of Baltimore, the re-
habilitation of San Francisco from the ter-
rible disaster that has just befallen that fair city, I have in mind the struggles of your horticulturists against all sorts of unfavorable conditions and disasters.
They have been attacked by the white fly.

ant, foot-rot, blight, drought, and in some instances too much moisture. They have seen the result of the labor of years level—
ed to the ground and have surmounted all these and have never appealed, received aid, nor had any insurance, but have gone bravely to work replanting, and today it can be truthfully said that never in the history of the State have the horticul-
tural interests been in as good condition.
I am reminded of an old friend of mine who came to Florida in the early eighties,
bought a piece of land on the banks of the St. Johns River, planted a grove and expected it to support him the balance of his days without any further effort on his part. He used to conﬁde his troubles in me, and he was of an optimistic turn of mind. If his crop was a partial failure he would say “Well, that is not altogether bad because I will get better prices.”
When he lost the entire crop he said,
“\Vell, it is not altogether bad because I can bud better varieties in the stumps.
I am learning every day.” Said he was going to protect his grove against frost in the future. There was never any disaster so great but in his mind it might have been worse. He was really typical of the average horticulturists of Florida as I have observed them, and he reminds me somewhat of a story that I heard about a man who went out West and engaged in the growing of stock. After being away about ten years he came back and one day walked into the store of an old friend who said “Well, John, where have you been ?” John replied “out \Nest.”
“How have you been getting along?”
“Well,” he said, “not so very good and not so very bad.”
“What have you been doing,’
the friend.
“I went into the sheep business”
“Well,” said the friend, “that is good.”
“Well,” said John, “not so very good-
because the sheep all died.”
His friend said, “Well that is bad.”
“Not so very bad,” said John, “because a rich widow sympathized with me in my misfortune and I married her.”
“Well,” his friend said, “that’s good."
John said, “Well, 'not so. very good be—
cause she was a regular virago and had- a terrible temper.”
“Well,” his friend said, “that’s bad.”
“Well,” said John, “not very bad be-
cause she built a great big ﬁne house.”
The friend remarked, “Well, that cer—
tainly was good.”
“No,” said John, “not so very good because the house burned down.”
The friend said, “Well,” that certainly was bad.”
“No,” said John, “that was not so very bad because the woman was consumed with the house.”
So it is with my friend. He says now that he sees a great many good things that have grown out of the freeze. He had diversiﬁed his crops; is more prosper-
ous possibly than if the freeze had not occurred. and he and the other horticul-
turists of the State, who are a people that adversity cannot overcome, and that no amount of prosperity can spoil, are en—
titled to all the success that should come to intelligence, industry, perseverance, and courage.

Response to Addresses of Welcome.
BY G. L. TABER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In a Society like ours there are some-
times pleasant duties to perform and the task you have assigned me, of re-
plying to these generous words of wel-
come, is amongst these pleasant ones.
During our annual meeting some of our members are called upon to speak on cer-
tain well deﬁned subjects, assigned them in advance that have to do with the dif-
ferent phases of Horticulture; and while these duties, never considered onerous, are generally cheerfully complied with, the members who make these Committee Re-
ports, as well as others that follow in dis-
cussion, are supposed to conﬁne them-
selves, rather closely, to the subject in hand. In my case, however, Mr. Presi-
dent, it is different, for custom has de-
creed, wisely or unwisely, that more than the three words “We thank you” is ex-
pected of him who makes response to an Address of Welcome; and this, notwith-
standing all the heart-felt sincerity with which those words can be imbued, or the emphasis with which they can be spoken.
And now, Mr. President, having deﬁn-
ed my independent position, permitted to touch on few or many things, and these in a light or serious vein as my fancy dictat-
es—I wish to tell a story. My story ori-
ginated in a State some distance remov-
ed from Florida, namely, North Dakota.
An automobilist traveling through that untropical country found himself with a disabled machine and without proper tools to repair it.
He called at a near by farm house and asked the owner, a Swede. for a monkey wrench. The Swede replied that he had none. “Do you know of anyone in the vicinity who has a monkey wrench”? ask-
ed the traveler. “Nay” replied the Swede, “may bradder, ’bout eigh miles from hayer ban got cattle ranch, may bradder-law, Ole Olson, ’bout sex miles.
ban got shape ranch; but Nort’ Dakota too blame cauld for anybody keep monkey ranch." Now Mr. President notwith-
standing the more favorable climatic con-
ditions that exists here. I have never heard of a monkey ranch in Florida, and,
even if there were, I take it that you would rule its discussion out of order un-
less introduced in some Horticultural con-
nection, such as “Anima(la)ted Lad-
ders,” “monkeys as orange pickers” or
“The horticultural possibilities of our friend and one time relative. the mon-
key.” Mr. President upon mature consid-
eration I am convinced that even under any such horticultural disguises as those mentioned. further consideration of the subject would be bootless. I therefore re-
quest you that all future allusion to the subject be barred and particularly that no monkey business be allowed to enter the question box—which will be opened later.
Mr. President, there is one danger that always besets a man who is tempted to make humourous remarks and that is that having made them (provided always that his hearers interpret them as such) h¢
ﬁnds it rather hard work to get back on

to serious ground; or at least to convince his audience that the lighter vein has been abandoned. I wish to assure you, how-
ever, that the remaining words I have to say are strictly and sincerely serious-
Eighteen years ago the Florida State Horticultural Society was organized at Ocala. By aycoincidence the ﬁgures eigh~
teen also represent the number of our charter members. Of these just one-half have since passed into the Great Beyond.
Of the remainder some have removed from the State. others are incapacitated by sickness, and a survey of this audience fails to reveal the presence at this meet-
ing of a single conferee who assisted me at the birthv of this Society. Looked at from the standpoint of losses of illustrious members, both of those who were with us at the beginning and others who joined afterwards, retrospection carries with it so much of sadness that I hasten to turn to the brighter side. That lthere is a brighter side is plainly evinced by the fact that notwithstanding our heavy losses by death and otherwise our last annual re-
port showed a membership of 5 19. While the majority of these are located in the State, yet a review of the addresses shows that in addition to Florida, seventeen Stat—
es and nine foreign countries are repre-
sented in our membership,_as follows:
States: Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas and Vermont.
Foreign Countries: Australia, Asia,
Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Mexico, New Zealand, Porto Rico and South Africa.
Now, Mr. President. it is not my pur-
pose to go into detail of what this So-
ciety has accomplished. Our comprehen-
sive annual reports, published for many consecutive years past, contain full re-
cords of our, ei'fogts and our accomplish-
ments. But I make the broad assertion that no other State Horticultural Society in America has done more toward further-
ing the horticultural progress of a State and that none other can show such an in-
terest in its work as evinced by a world—
wide membership. I wish also, Mr. Pres-
ident, to call the attention of these gentle-
men, who have so kindly welcomed us. to the fact that what we have accomplished we have done within ourselves, without outside help. The only exception to this statement is that a dozen years ago, for two years in succession, 1893 and 1894.
our proceedings were published by the State Department of Agriculture. through Hon. L. B. Wombwell, Commissioner.
While many State Societies have looked to liberal legislatures to assist thermin their eitorts toward upbuilding the Hor-
ticultural interest of their States, we have looked only to our own membership;
whatever assistance has been necessary has, with the exception already cited,
come from within our ranks.
Now, Mr. President, I believe this is all wrong. The fault may have been with ourselves in not having sufiiciently appre-
ciated or urged our claims, but I believe the time has come when we should ask.
and should receive, from the Florida Leg-
islature appropriations which shall in some measure relieve the, approximately,
ﬁve hundred members of this Society from carrying on at their own expense a work that is of so much beneﬁt to every one of the more than 500,000 people that comprise our population. For, Mr. Pre-
ident, it is so true as to be axiomatic that back of the lasting commercial prosperity of a country stands the producer, the one who evolves from Mother Earth her ﬁn-

ished products; and just to the extent that he can throw safeguards around these productions, increase their quantity and improve their quality, just to that extent is the commercial prosperity of that Coun-
try conﬁrmed and enchanced.
I hold in my hand, Mr. President, a copy of the “Transactions of the Florida State Horticultural Society for 1905”—a fair sample of many that have preceded it.
We have been issuing them annually ever since I892. This copy of our transac-
tions covers 132 pages of revised Horti-
cultural advice obtained from experience
-—and' experience that has to do with Florida conditions. It contains more than that. It contains 22 additional pages of catalogue, in which all the different fruits that are grown in Florida are listed in such a way as to give the comparative vallie of each variety to any given sec-
tion of the State; whether it be Western North Florida, Eastern North Florida,
Central Florida, or South Florida. The work entailed in getting out this annual edition in the creditable manner in which it is presented is unknowable except to someone who has had experience in this direction.
The price of the book, which also in-
cludes membership in the Society is $1.00.
If we have 500 annual, and say ten new life members (life memberships are $10.-
00) our income for the year would be
$600.00, out of which we have to pay for stenography, secretary’s salary, printing of the book. stationery, stamps and all minor expenses. The secretary’s salary has in time past been, of necessity, so absurdly small, as compared with the work, that it has been repeatedly turned back into ".he Treasury by past secretaries, as a gift.
Not that we want or expect the secretary to do this; on the contrary we want suf-
ﬁcient funds provided from the source from which it should be provided. the State, to enable us to meet proper ex-
penses in a manner that shall comport with our own dignity and that of the great Commonwealth we are trying to serve.
Mr. President, I think that you will par-
don me if I say that I have had an almost.
or quite, unequalled opportunity to know the amount of work performed by this So—
ciety. This from the double fact that l have been a member from the beginning.
and that, since then, I have ﬁlled every ofﬁce but one that it was in the society’s power to confer. I was its ﬁrst Sec-
retary, then, successively, Vice-Presi-
dent, President, and now, a member of the Executive Committee. I have never yet been elected Treasurer, and know but one reason—or possibly two—why I have been overlooked in this connection. The
ﬁrst is that the handling of the society’s funds is too easy a job, and the second
—but perhaps I had better not allude to the second one.
Mr. President, our work has to do with the aiding, up-building and uplifting 0f Horticultural pursuits throughout our State. It is gratifying to know that we.
as a society, are held in esteem both at home and abroad; and it is doubly grati-
fying to know that in this city of Jack-
sonville. where so many pleasant meetings have been held in the past, we are still re ceived with open arms. To you gentle-
men who in behalf of the City and the City’s Board of Trade, have so cordially welcomed us, we feel profoundly grateful and again say with heart-felt sincerity and with emphasis, we thank you.

President’s Annual Address.
BY C. T. MC CARTY.
Members of the Florida State H articul-
tural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen:
This audience will forgive me while I indulge in some retrospection. It is worth while sometimes to lift the veil of the pastand behold the achievements of the then actors. That picture reveals to us lessons which suggest progress, hope and advancement. At the outset of this address, it is well for me to take my bear—
ings and to see what is the duty I have as-
signed myself. To see and to study the standards that have been set for me in the similar efforts of the past; to study the men and the times that have produced the annual addresses of the past eighteen years.
Our Society came forth almost full-
ﬂedged from its birth. In response to the demands of the times, it immediately took its place among the great Horticult-
ural Societies of the age. Fortunately,
it had as its ﬁrst president, one of those rugged, fearless and intrepid characters
' that were transplanted, decades ago, from the great prairies of the Northwest to the tropical and subtropical conditions of our state. With the accumulated wisdom and experience of a life-time, he led the van in the early years of the society’s history and led them with unvarying satisfaction and success. In its ﬁrst decade it had be-
come so prominent that it received and entertained with. success some of the fore-
most scientists of this and other lands.
The energy and persistence, the skill and faith, the merit and the accomplishment of its ﬁrst president, Dudley W. Adams,
are now matters of history. After all it is acts not words, that count in the life impression one leaves upon his age and generation. Judge by this standard what a splendid life was his. It is my duty as well as my pleasure, to put on record the high appreciation this society feels today for its ﬁrst president after he has for well nigh a decade, felt upon his face the breath of the Eternal morning.
Good foundations, like good principles and good practices, never fail to bequeath to subsequent generations their manifold blessings.
In studying the history of our Society during this period of eighteen years, I
ﬁnd impressed upon this latter half, the large-heartedI good-natured, genial per-
sonality and natural ability of its last pres—
ident, George L Taber.
How fortunate our Society was when called upon to bear a sudden vacancy in its Chief Executive, that one so able, so thoroughly equipped for its duties, so willing to bear and forbear, should be ready trained at hand. The annual ad-
dresses of President Taber always con-
tained a message of importance to the So-
ciety. In times of progress and prosperi-
ty it brought congratulations and good-
cheer. In times of adversity, it brought hope, courage and manhood, and faith in skill and science to overcome difﬁcul-
ties or adverse climatic conditions. His

cheery tones were ever on the side of 0p-
timism, were ever turning towards the bright side of the picture of horticultural struggle and endeavor in this state, were ever pointing to new means of combatting the elements, of overcoming the natural enemies of our chosen industries and bolstering up those of less faith and cour-
age. Through all these annual addresses runs the constant tone of enlargement and improvement, constantlv increasing in power, thought and literary ﬁnish,
his last annual address became a ﬁtting climax to the long series of addresses with which he has enriched the literature of our Society. I can well imagine his feel-
ings when preparing his “Message from the Woods.” Like that felt by Bryant when he wrote his Thanatopsis, when he gave to his age, in poetry, his conception of -a proper appreciation of nature and natural surroundings. Like him feels John Burroughs, the nature lover, the poet and admirer of the brook, the ﬁeld,
the orchard and the forest. How much of beauty and poetic feeling and love of nature and nature’s God are embodied in the president’s last annual address~ on-
ly future generations shall fully appreci-
ate.
Of retrospection this is sufﬁcient. The past at least is secure. Our Society hav-
ing passed safely the rapids of its up-
per course and glided successfully along into its middle course, now moves for-
ward in the direction of its lower and broader course. It has met the questions of the past. It has accumulated wisdom by experience. It should be, and doubt-
less it is today, well equipped to meet the questions of the present, to maintain the reputation of the past and to lay broad and deep foundations for the achieve-
ments of the future. The problems of to-
day are not more difficult than in the past, but they are more complex and di-
verse. There are in them a greater num-
ber of factors even if each factor is of less vitality. What message does the pres-
ent bring to us?
\V hat duty do we owe the today? \Vhat accomplishments can the tomorrow claim logically founded upon today? Are there messages that the horticultural conditions of the state at this moment require bring-
ing to your attention? Fortunately we stand in the presence of no calamity. We do not surround, as we have sometimes done in the past, those conditions that buried the hopes of thousands of our peo-
ple. But even those clouds had their silver lining, unseen then, but plainly vis-
ible now. We are in the midst of pros-
perity long continued and pronounced.
Our industries have been enlarged both in number and in volume. Our output is greatly increased in every department of horticulture. Our sources of know-
ledge, our ability to handle the drawbacks the pests and the evils of our diversiﬁed industries have been largely increased.
What then is there to consider? It fre-
quently happens that the most danger-
ous periods are those of greatest prosperi-
ty. It has been well said that, “Security is mortal’s chiefest enemy.”
In the line of thought I shall take to-
night, I may be straying from the beaten path, may be leading the way into battle
ﬁelds where the valiant, the sagacious and the steadfast of purpose alone can be found at the front. The commercial bat-
tles of the present dwarf into insigniﬁ-
cance the battles with insects, with cli-
matic conditions, with all our other 0b—
stacles combined. The struggle for new markets, for cheaper production, for fair-
er treatment by our agents in the markets.

for fair rates and rapid transit, do not these demand our attention and challenge the best brains among us? Of what avail is it that we devote our time and capital to the problems of production if the other and more complex problems of economy,
distribution, transportation, receive not their proper attention? These things are as much a part of our legitimate business as the cultivation of the soil, the ferti-
lizer we shall use or the various matters of every day occurrence. What man is there before me who has not felt like this?
The season has been a good one, I have fertilized judiciously and wisely, I have cultivated, I have sprayed, I have spared no pains to produce a ﬁne crop. How shall I market it to the best advantage?
Have you not realized that you were then confronted with harder conditions than those of production and ones less within your control or management?
The original scope of our Society be-
ing much narrower than its present one curtailed the range of topics considered at our meetings to a very narrow margin.
The original thought of the founders of this Society was to make it apply almost exclusively .to orange growing, to citrus fruits and their allied subjects. As the years have come and gone its scope has been widened so that it now covers, not only semi-tropical, but also tropical fruits,
vegetables and many of the fruits of the temperate zone. This enlargement of its sphere has injected into it new relations and new problems for annual considera-
tion. Let us brieﬂy discuss a few of the important items worthy of thought. This is an age of organization, co—operation and consolidation. It is not sufﬁcient that the horticulturist of today knows how to produce the fruits and the products of the soil but that he knows as well how to successfully transport, distribute and mar-
ket them. Perhaps the largest ﬁeld for present and future investigation is the One covering the problem of marketing. This problem involves the element of business experience and study of the relations of the cost of production and transportation to the market value of our products; the study of the laws of Supply and demand as applied to each particular product; a study of the value of organization in the securing of reasonable and satisfactOry rates of transportation; of the proper commissions to be paid our selling agents;
and the proper distribution of the crop so as to prevent surplus in one portion of the country and deﬁciency in another.
Were there no such thing as organized ef-
fort among those whose ﬁnancial interests are opposed to ours there should be no necessity for organization on our part.
The value of farmers and fruit growers’
organizations is in direct proportion to the tenacity with which they adhere to them and the vigor with which they enforce the principles involved. I do not deem it necessary to go into arguments sup-
porting the needs for compactly united organizations in each of our principal in-
dustries. The need for organization must be apparent to all. For greatest efﬁciency consolidation of all for the handling of problems common to all is only common sense. Questions like transportation, tar-
iffs for protection, rates of commission and kindred broad matters can only be handled powerfully and conclusivelyv in the hands of one central organization. The methods and direction taken by each. in-
terest must be dictated by themselves.
It can do no harm to crystallize among them, into some deﬁnite form the best ideas of the most intelligent and-ener—
getic of the growers, nor need it be be-

‘lieved that the only value in horticultural organization is that of the maintenance of the price or cheapening the cost of the production and the proper regulation of
‘the matter of transportation. In numer-
ous other ways organized effort is super-
ior 'to individual effort. The tendency of the times is to the enlarged costs of the
'material used for the packing and pack-
age purposes, the costs of living and in-
deed, increased cost in everything that the horticulturist purchases. The only fair method of safeguarding the growers and producers’ interests is to see that in-
creased revenue accrues to him suﬁicient-
'ly ‘to meet the increased cost of produc-
tion as well as the cost of living and the necessaries and luxuries of life.
Concurrent with this comes the thought of the reduced cost of production by bet—
ter management, more intensive cultiva-
tion, decreased cost of fertilizing by tak-
ing advantage of cheaper sources of nitro-
gen and other kindred economies. All of these are well and should never be for-
gotten. The opening up of new ﬁelds of production have helped swell the volume of material in our markets and should set us to thinking of how to overcome this new competition.
The solution of these problems will call for the best thought, the best persistent effort and the most constant watchful-
ness of the thoughtful classes in our midst. Among the hopeful signs of the present are the cordial relations existing
‘between the country and the city; between the producer and the carrier; between the producer and the consumer. In these bet-
ter understandings of each others’ rela-
tions we see the future solution of these problems. So long as the different class-
es understand and appreciate each other,
realize their mutual inter-dependence on each other, maintain their mutual respect for each other, that long will harmony and material prosperity exist. In passing,
it might be said that the accentuation of the self-interests of the horticultural class-
es does not necessarily mean war upon or antagonism of any other interest.
The recent report of the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture calls attenltion to the enormous resources of American agri-
culture and horticulture. In comparison,
all other interests combined sink into in-
signiﬁcance. The sums are so stupendous that we can scarcely realize their mag-
nitude. Of this grand total we are a con-
siderable part. It is just cause for con-
gratulation that the importance, vitality and dignity of the horticultural classes is being recognized.
Do our horticultural classes sufficient-
ly appreciate the value of and the necess-
ity for diversiﬁcation? Do we realize the full meaning of living at home? Is it not a fact that too great a proportion of the income from our products goes for that which. can and should be grown in our own state and possibly in our own neighborhood? We hear it discussed on all hands, but have not acted on it vig-
orously. \IVhile this thought is trite, I risk once more calling the attention of our people to its vital importance.
I have felt strongly impelled at this meeting to press upon your attention these important matters. To give vent to the thought that has been growing in my mind for some years, that the most vital and far-reaching questions now calling for' solution by Florida producers were not cultural questions but commercial ones; not planting but marketing; not fer-
tilizing but transportation. Let us think about these things, talk about them, study them, conquer them. If this thought.

talk and study take not the form of action then have we labored in vain.
During the past few months, I address-
ed a circular letter to every member of the society, in which I asked for an ex-
pression of opinion on many matters of importance, and asked for suggestions.
The replies have been numerous and my reward ample for the trouble I took. Much to enlighten and cheer the Society has come to me. Encouragement for the fu-
ture, and splendid appreciation for the past of the Society has breathed from many of the much—valued letters received.
I desire to thank you, most sincerely for these expressions of your better selves.
In the quiet of your homes, you have said things that you would not say on the ﬂoor of this house. You have my promise to use the good suggestionsin so far as I shall be able. These heart-to-heart let-
ters shall bear fruit.
Among the weighty subjects discussed in those letters, was that of “State Aid”
in the printing of our annual reports. A careful tabulation of the replies show about an equal number favoring and op-
posing the acceptance of such aid. Among those favoring, are some of our oldest and most thoughtful and experienced mem-
bers. On the other side, can be found those of equal experience and wisdom.
Some have cited other states in which State Aid is supposed to be the cause of their ruin as a society, while others point out other states in which it has had the opposite effect. The array of arguments pro. and con. is formidable and shows the ability and reasoning resources of our members. It is not my province or wish to discuss the question or to express an opinion on it. If the matter comes up,
all the reasoning, on all its sides and phas-
es, will be developed and the society can then pass upon it intelligently. \Nithout taking the time to discuss them here, I will say that many of the suggestions made by members will be carried out during the progress of the meeting, as they shall ﬁt into our work.
\Ve are to be favored by a number of eminent persons, with addresses and pap-
ers, during the progress of the meeting,
as a glance at the program will show.
Will these friends of the Society allow me to express, if ever so feebly, our sin-
cere thanks for their kindness and our high appreciation of their valued efforts.
But, what of the work? We have six sessions before us, occupying two full days. \Ve shall have seven formal ad-
dresses and papers. We shall listen to the reports of sixteen committees, and these reports will be ably and exhaustively discussed. In the course of these discus-
sions will come out much of the real value of our gathering. Don’t hesitate to stuff our “Question Box.” Show me by your patronage of this box that you appreciate a chance 'to ask questions. Work, fast and furious, is our portion for the next few days. At the close of the meeting may we feel that we never had a better one. Amidst the friends of many years,
in the city of hustle and progress, with words of welcome to inspire our efforts,
with the social feasts before us, our tasks shall be light and their accomplishment assured.
