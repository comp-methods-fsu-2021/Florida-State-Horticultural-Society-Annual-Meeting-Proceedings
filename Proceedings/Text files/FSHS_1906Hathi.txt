PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINETEENTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE Florida State Horticultural Society.
The Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the Florida State Horticultural Society was held in the Auditorium of the Windsor Hotel commencing on the evening of May Ist 1906.
Theopening meeting was unusually well attended and the different addresses were greatly appreciated by the audience. N or—
withstanding the weather during the three days was intensely hot the sessions were fairly well attended.
The latest introduction into the Society‘
was the “Question Box,” and it proved quite interesting. as will be seen by the printed questions and answers in this report. This is a feature that the mem-
bers can take advantage of, even if they are not in attendance, by sending their questions to the president by mail. which will be opened. and answered during the sessions.
The Board of Trade delighted the members with another one of its famous musicales, rendered by the “Ladies Friday Musicale." So very popular are these musicales that the commodious hall of the Board of Trade building was packed to standing room.
There was a spirited contest when the question of the next place of meeting came up. between those who wanted to come again to Jacksonville and those who preferred to visit other parts of the State.
St. Petersburg was well represented. and won the day. so that the Twentieth An-
nual Meeting will he held in the “Gem City of the \\'est Coast."

Addresses of Welcome.
BY HON. D. U. FLETCHER.
Mr. Fletcher spoke extemporaneously and rather rapidly, so we are only able to give more than an outline of his happy and well received address.
Among other things he said: A day or two ago I received a letter from Secretary Painter informing me that he had called me up over the telephone and requested me to perform tonight, that he had print-
ed the programs, putting my name on them and enclosed one, hoping I would be present. I told him that. under the circumstances, I would be here although the notice gave me no chance for any pre-
paration. I approve of the Secretary’s way. however. He accomplishes what he wants and in the easiest, most satisfactory manner. He gets his speaker and the lat-
ter has no time to make excuses or get nervous.
There is nothing the Horticultural So-
ciety could ask of me that I would not make an effort to grant. \V e give you a warm welcome. but the weather seems in-
clined to over-do the thing. It is un-
necessary for me to emphasize the warmth of our greeting. and I assure you that is equally true of its sincerity.
I would feel very much more at home probably discussing some other subject than Horticulture. If our friend Painter should sell a lot of fertilizer and accept a four months note in payment. which he negotiated at the bank. and the parties re-
fused to pay on the ground the fertilizer was not beneﬁcial. I could say whether or not he would have it to pay; or if Mr.
Taber should send out nursery stock to be paid for at a certain time. reserving the title to the trees, I might answer as to whether or not the purchaser could keep the trees without paying the price as agreed.
If this were an agricultural gathering I would be much more at home. I have had some experience raising nubbin corn and bumble bee cotton- Nubbin corn is that kind too poor to shuck. and the cotton referred to is the kind which a bumble bee can suck the top blossom off while sitting on the ground. You have heard of the Doc-
tor who had a patient with fever, and after doing all he could for him. he gave him some medicine at last that threw the pa-
tient into convulsions and when asked why he did so. he stated that he had treated him for days and days for fever and he did not know how to cure the fever,
but he did know how to cure ﬁts and so was giving him something to throw him into ﬁts. If I could change this Conven—
tion into an Agricultural Convention there are many things I could speak of from experience.
Horticulture is a kind of high toned agriculture. or the elite of agricultural pursuits. I imagine this thing of stand-
ing on the shady side of an orange tree and watching its beautiful leaves and en-
joying its odoriferous ﬂowers while culti-
vating it. following it as the sun moves

from one side to the other, is very much better and more pleasant than chopping cotton or plowing corn out in the open,
where the unobstructed rays of the sun beat upon you, and no prospect pleases.
There can be few things more impor-
tant than this great industry you are de-
veloping and fostering. As we recall'in
1899. the value of the fruit products of the United States was $1 31.000.000 and the vegetable products. not including p0—
tatoes was $131,000,000, and we exported over $9,000,000 worth during that year.
The life of the Horticulturist is one of the most joyous and free allotted to man.
If we did not have any freezes. or if we could avoid the consequences of them;
or if we were not troubled with foot rot,
and if the white ﬂy would leave us alone.
and if it rained when it should and ceased when it ought. and if we had satisfactory transportation. and if we could hit the market right, and if we were given proper treatment by consignees, and if a few other things happened, or didn’t happen,
your meetings would partake more of the nature of an annual celebration and you would be touring the country in automo-
biles. _ '
Now, this is the reason you are here;
the purpose of this organization is to sur-
mount the obstacles of this little .word.
“if.” There can be no better or higher purpose of any organization- To solve the questions how to preserve for the human race the necessary food products is a work worthy the brightest minds. the greatest skill. the most persistent industry.
It demands the highest and best activities of the most gifted men and women. It calls for the exercise of judgment. It proceeds upon investigation and study.
It must have the knowledge born of ex-
perience.
We read of the great scientists and statesmen who have won distinction and whose names will be known as long as we have history. but I would ask you wheth—
er Copernicus. Gallileo, Michael Angelo,
or Isaac Newton accomplished more for the world than the men who have made,
developed. and placed on our tables our fruits, ﬂowers and vegetables in their perfection. Of these great scientists who have won distinction, is there any one more entitled to fame than the man who introduced and developed the potato, ap-
ple. peach. rose. or made the white black-
berry and the spineless cactus. Is there one more entitled to fame or to whom man-
kind is more indebted than to Luther Burbank, the American naturalist?
Our Legislature meets every two years'
and passes laws affecting the welfare of the people of this State; there is no more important matter which can command the attention of our law makers and oFﬁcials than the requests of this Society. I can conceive that you might be aided in your eﬁ‘orts by legislation along certain lines and surely there will be found patriotism and public spirit suﬁicient to give a hearty response to your appeal and a generous support to your work. There is no more important organization in this State than yours. and your work for the industrial development of Florida and for the material welfare of her people should meet with every encouragment from every quarter. ’
It is a great pleasure to welcome you here—peculiarly wholesome and joyous and an honor to come in touch with the noble men and women from all portions of the State. who live nearest the fountain of life in the Divine Economy!
Jacksonville recognizes that whatever makes for the prosperity of any portion

of the State is a thing to be desired. She has no prejudices—she reaches out to all sections and would promote the good of each. She loves all the people of the whole State and would have them pros—
per and their various undertakings and enterprises succeed. In this spirit she wishes your meeting here may be proﬁt~
able, and again bids you welcome.

ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.

BY CAPT. C. E. GARNER.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In behalf of the Board of Trade and representing the business interests of our city, it is again my pleasure to extend to you Mr. President, the ofﬁcers, and to every member of the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society, a most hearty and sin-
cere welcome.
I had in mind telling you a great many things. I had conceived of a magniﬁcent oration, expressing my personal senti-
ments of the Horticultural Society, of its splendid work in behalf of our beloved State, and I also had in mind telling you something of the progress and prosperity of our city; but, to use the yachting phrase, “my little craft has had the wind taken out of its sails” by the eloquence of the gentleman who has just preceded me.
If any one in this audience thinks they can follow the Hon. D. U. Fletcher along the same lines, and especially in the mat-
ter of delivering an address of welcome,
and say anything original, or anything appropriate to the occasion which has not already been said, I would like for him to step up on this platform and take my place because I feel utterly unable to con-
ceive of anything that is appropriate that would not be a reiteration of what had been stated.
I wish, therefore, to simply express my high appreciation not only of the Horti—
cultural Society as an organization but of the Horticulturists of the State of Florida.
Probably no man within the bounds of the State has been brought in closer con-
tact with them than myself. It is not an acquaintance of a few days or a few years but for a quarter of a century I have known them, and know them intimately,
and I wish on this occasion to say that they are in my judgment the bravest.
most heroic class of people in this country.
I know of their struggles, I have seen them under all circumstances, of pros-
perity and adversity, chieﬂy the latter.
and if you wish to measure the heroism of people you must be acquainted with them under all conditions. and I know of no people who have withstood adversit}
with a braver spirit than have the Horti-
culturists of this State.
You talk about the rebuilding of your city, the rebuilding of Baltimore, the re-
habilitation of San Francisco from the ter-
rible disaster that has just befallen that fair city, I have in mind the struggles of your horticulturists against all sorts of unfavorable conditions and disasters.
They have been attacked by the white fly.

ant, foot-rot, blight, drought, and in some instances too much moisture. They have seen the result of the labor of years level—
ed to the ground and have surmounted all these and have never appealed, received aid, nor had any insurance, but have gone bravely to work replanting, and today it can be truthfully said that never in the history of the State have the horticul-
tural interests been in as good condition.
I am reminded of an old friend of mine who came to Florida in the early eighties,
bought a piece of land on the banks of the St. Johns River, planted a grove and expected it to support him the balance of his days without any further effort on his part. He used to conﬁde his troubles in me, and he was of an optimistic turn of mind. If his crop was a partial failure he would say “Well, that is not altogether bad because I will get better prices.”
When he lost the entire crop he said,
“\Vell, it is not altogether bad because I can bud better varieties in the stumps.
I am learning every day.” Said he was going to protect his grove against frost in the future. There was never any disaster so great but in his mind it might have been worse. He was really typical of the average horticulturists of Florida as I have observed them, and he reminds me somewhat of a story that I heard about a man who went out West and engaged in the growing of stock. After being away about ten years he came back and one day walked into the store of an old friend who said “Well, John, where have you been ?” John replied “out \Nest.”
“How have you been getting along?”
“Well,” he said, “not so very good and not so very bad.”
“What have you been doing,’
the friend.
“I went into the sheep business”
“Well,” said the friend, “that is good.”
“Well,” said John, “not so very good-
because the sheep all died.”
His friend said, “Well that is bad.”
“Not so very bad,” said John, “because a rich widow sympathized with me in my misfortune and I married her.”
“Well,” his friend said, “that’s good."
John said, “Well, 'not so. very good be—
cause she was a regular virago and had- a terrible temper.”
“Well,” his friend said, “that’s bad.”
“Well,” said John, “not very bad be-
cause she built a great big ﬁne house.”
The friend remarked, “Well, that cer—
tainly was good.”
“No,” said John, “not so very good because the house burned down.”
The friend said, “Well,” that certainly was bad.”
“No,” said John, “that was not so very bad because the woman was consumed with the house.”
So it is with my friend. He says now that he sees a great many good things that have grown out of the freeze. He had diversiﬁed his crops; is more prosper-
ous possibly than if the freeze had not occurred. and he and the other horticul-
turists of the State, who are a people that adversity cannot overcome, and that no amount of prosperity can spoil, are en—
titled to all the success that should come to intelligence, industry, perseverance, and courage.

Response to Addresses of Welcome.
BY G. L. TABER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In a Society like ours there are some-
times pleasant duties to perform and the task you have assigned me, of re-
plying to these generous words of wel-
come, is amongst these pleasant ones.
During our annual meeting some of our members are called upon to speak on cer-
tain well deﬁned subjects, assigned them in advance that have to do with the dif-
ferent phases of Horticulture; and while these duties, never considered onerous, are generally cheerfully complied with, the members who make these Committee Re-
ports, as well as others that follow in dis-
cussion, are supposed to conﬁne them-
selves, rather closely, to the subject in hand. In my case, however, Mr. Presi-
dent, it is different, for custom has de-
creed, wisely or unwisely, that more than the three words “We thank you” is ex-
pected of him who makes response to an Address of Welcome; and this, notwith-
standing all the heart-felt sincerity with which those words can be imbued, or the emphasis with which they can be spoken.
And now, Mr. President, having deﬁn-
ed my independent position, permitted to touch on few or many things, and these in a light or serious vein as my fancy dictat-
es—I wish to tell a story. My story ori-
ginated in a State some distance remov-
ed from Florida, namely, North Dakota.
An automobilist traveling through that untropical country found himself with a disabled machine and without proper tools to repair it.
He called at a near by farm house and asked the owner, a Swede. for a monkey wrench. The Swede replied that he had none. “Do you know of anyone in the vicinity who has a monkey wrench”? ask-
ed the traveler. “Nay” replied the Swede, “may bradder, ’bout eigh miles from hayer ban got cattle ranch, may bradder-law, Ole Olson, ’bout sex miles.
ban got shape ranch; but Nort’ Dakota too blame cauld for anybody keep monkey ranch." Now Mr. President notwith-
standing the more favorable climatic con-
ditions that exists here. I have never heard of a monkey ranch in Florida, and,
even if there were, I take it that you would rule its discussion out of order un-
less introduced in some Horticultural con-
nection, such as “Anima(la)ted Lad-
ders,” “monkeys as orange pickers” or
“The horticultural possibilities of our friend and one time relative. the mon-
key.” Mr. President upon mature consid-
eration I am convinced that even under any such horticultural disguises as those mentioned. further consideration of the subject would be bootless. I therefore re-
quest you that all future allusion to the subject be barred and particularly that no monkey business be allowed to enter the question box—which will be opened later.
Mr. President, there is one danger that always besets a man who is tempted to make humourous remarks and that is that having made them (provided always that his hearers interpret them as such) h¢
ﬁnds it rather hard work to get back on

to serious ground; or at least to convince his audience that the lighter vein has been abandoned. I wish to assure you, how-
ever, that the remaining words I have to say are strictly and sincerely serious-
Eighteen years ago the Florida State Horticultural Society was organized at Ocala. By aycoincidence the ﬁgures eigh~
teen also represent the number of our charter members. Of these just one-half have since passed into the Great Beyond.
Of the remainder some have removed from the State. others are incapacitated by sickness, and a survey of this audience fails to reveal the presence at this meet-
ing of a single conferee who assisted me at the birthv of this Society. Looked at from the standpoint of losses of illustrious members, both of those who were with us at the beginning and others who joined afterwards, retrospection carries with it so much of sadness that I hasten to turn to the brighter side. That lthere is a brighter side is plainly evinced by the fact that notwithstanding our heavy losses by death and otherwise our last annual re-
port showed a membership of 5 19. While the majority of these are located in the State, yet a review of the addresses shows that in addition to Florida, seventeen Stat—
es and nine foreign countries are repre-
sented in our membership,_as follows:
States: Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas and Vermont.
Foreign Countries: Australia, Asia,
Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Mexico, New Zealand, Porto Rico and South Africa.
Now, Mr. President. it is not my pur-
pose to go into detail of what this So-
ciety has accomplished. Our comprehen-
sive annual reports, published for many consecutive years past, contain full re-
cords of our, ei'fogts and our accomplish-
ments. But I make the broad assertion that no other State Horticultural Society in America has done more toward further-
ing the horticultural progress of a State and that none other can show such an in-
terest in its work as evinced by a world—
wide membership. I wish also, Mr. Pres-
ident, to call the attention of these gentle-
men, who have so kindly welcomed us. to the fact that what we have accomplished we have done within ourselves, without outside help. The only exception to this statement is that a dozen years ago, for two years in succession, 1893 and 1894.
our proceedings were published by the State Department of Agriculture. through Hon. L. B. Wombwell, Commissioner.
While many State Societies have looked to liberal legislatures to assist thermin their eitorts toward upbuilding the Hor-
ticultural interest of their States, we have looked only to our own membership;
whatever assistance has been necessary has, with the exception already cited,
come from within our ranks.
Now, Mr. President, I believe this is all wrong. The fault may have been with ourselves in not having sufiiciently appre-
ciated or urged our claims, but I believe the time has come when we should ask.
and should receive, from the Florida Leg-
islature appropriations which shall in some measure relieve the, approximately,
ﬁve hundred members of this Society from carrying on at their own expense a work that is of so much beneﬁt to every one of the more than 500,000 people that comprise our population. For, Mr. Pre-
ident, it is so true as to be axiomatic that back of the lasting commercial prosperity of a country stands the producer, the one who evolves from Mother Earth her ﬁn-

ished products; and just to the extent that he can throw safeguards around these productions, increase their quantity and improve their quality, just to that extent is the commercial prosperity of that Coun-
try conﬁrmed and enchanced.
I hold in my hand, Mr. President, a copy of the “Transactions of the Florida State Horticultural Society for 1905”—a fair sample of many that have preceded it.
We have been issuing them annually ever since I892. This copy of our transac-
tions covers 132 pages of revised Horti-
cultural advice obtained from experience
-—and' experience that has to do with Florida conditions. It contains more than that. It contains 22 additional pages of catalogue, in which all the different fruits that are grown in Florida are listed in such a way as to give the comparative vallie of each variety to any given sec-
tion of the State; whether it be Western North Florida, Eastern North Florida,
Central Florida, or South Florida. The work entailed in getting out this annual edition in the creditable manner in which it is presented is unknowable except to someone who has had experience in this direction.
The price of the book, which also in-
cludes membership in the Society is $1.00.
If we have 500 annual, and say ten new life members (life memberships are $10.-
00) our income for the year would be
$600.00, out of which we have to pay for stenography, secretary’s salary, printing of the book. stationery, stamps and all minor expenses. The secretary’s salary has in time past been, of necessity, so absurdly small, as compared with the work, that it has been repeatedly turned back into ".he Treasury by past secretaries, as a gift.
Not that we want or expect the secretary to do this; on the contrary we want suf-
ﬁcient funds provided from the source from which it should be provided. the State, to enable us to meet proper ex-
penses in a manner that shall comport with our own dignity and that of the great Commonwealth we are trying to serve.
Mr. President, I think that you will par-
don me if I say that I have had an almost.
or quite, unequalled opportunity to know the amount of work performed by this So—
ciety. This from the double fact that l have been a member from the beginning.
and that, since then, I have ﬁlled every ofﬁce but one that it was in the society’s power to confer. I was its ﬁrst Sec-
retary, then, successively, Vice-Presi-
dent, President, and now, a member of the Executive Committee. I have never yet been elected Treasurer, and know but one reason—or possibly two—why I have been overlooked in this connection. The
ﬁrst is that the handling of the society’s funds is too easy a job, and the second
—but perhaps I had better not allude to the second one.
Mr. President, our work has to do with the aiding, up-building and uplifting 0f Horticultural pursuits throughout our State. It is gratifying to know that we.
as a society, are held in esteem both at home and abroad; and it is doubly grati-
fying to know that in this city of Jack-
sonville. where so many pleasant meetings have been held in the past, we are still re ceived with open arms. To you gentle-
men who in behalf of the City and the City’s Board of Trade, have so cordially welcomed us, we feel profoundly grateful and again say with heart-felt sincerity and with emphasis, we thank you.

President’s Annual Address.
BY C. T. MC CARTY.
Members of the Florida State H articul-
tural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen:
This audience will forgive me while I indulge in some retrospection. It is worth while sometimes to lift the veil of the pastand behold the achievements of the then actors. That picture reveals to us lessons which suggest progress, hope and advancement. At the outset of this address, it is well for me to take my bear—
ings and to see what is the duty I have as-
signed myself. To see and to study the standards that have been set for me in the similar efforts of the past; to study the men and the times that have produced the annual addresses of the past eighteen years.
Our Society came forth almost full-
ﬂedged from its birth. In response to the demands of the times, it immediately took its place among the great Horticult-
ural Societies of the age. Fortunately,
it had as its ﬁrst president, one of those rugged, fearless and intrepid characters
' that were transplanted, decades ago, from the great prairies of the Northwest to the tropical and subtropical conditions of our state. With the accumulated wisdom and experience of a life-time, he led the van in the early years of the society’s history and led them with unvarying satisfaction and success. In its ﬁrst decade it had be-
come so prominent that it received and entertained with. success some of the fore-
most scientists of this and other lands.
The energy and persistence, the skill and faith, the merit and the accomplishment of its ﬁrst president, Dudley W. Adams,
are now matters of history. After all it is acts not words, that count in the life impression one leaves upon his age and generation. Judge by this standard what a splendid life was his. It is my duty as well as my pleasure, to put on record the high appreciation this society feels today for its ﬁrst president after he has for well nigh a decade, felt upon his face the breath of the Eternal morning.
Good foundations, like good principles and good practices, never fail to bequeath to subsequent generations their manifold blessings.
In studying the history of our Society during this period of eighteen years, I
ﬁnd impressed upon this latter half, the large-heartedI good-natured, genial per-
sonality and natural ability of its last pres—
ident, George L Taber.
How fortunate our Society was when called upon to bear a sudden vacancy in its Chief Executive, that one so able, so thoroughly equipped for its duties, so willing to bear and forbear, should be ready trained at hand. The annual ad-
dresses of President Taber always con-
tained a message of importance to the So-
ciety. In times of progress and prosperi-
ty it brought congratulations and good-
cheer. In times of adversity, it brought hope, courage and manhood, and faith in skill and science to overcome difﬁcul-
ties or adverse climatic conditions. His

cheery tones were ever on the side of 0p-
timism, were ever turning towards the bright side of the picture of horticultural struggle and endeavor in this state, were ever pointing to new means of combatting the elements, of overcoming the natural enemies of our chosen industries and bolstering up those of less faith and cour-
age. Through all these annual addresses runs the constant tone of enlargement and improvement, constantlv increasing in power, thought and literary ﬁnish,
his last annual address became a ﬁtting climax to the long series of addresses with which he has enriched the literature of our Society. I can well imagine his feel-
ings when preparing his “Message from the Woods.” Like that felt by Bryant when he wrote his Thanatopsis, when he gave to his age, in poetry, his conception of -a proper appreciation of nature and natural surroundings. Like him feels John Burroughs, the nature lover, the poet and admirer of the brook, the ﬁeld,
the orchard and the forest. How much of beauty and poetic feeling and love of nature and nature’s God are embodied in the president’s last annual address~ on-
ly future generations shall fully appreci-
ate.
Of retrospection this is sufﬁcient. The past at least is secure. Our Society hav-
ing passed safely the rapids of its up-
per course and glided successfully along into its middle course, now moves for-
ward in the direction of its lower and broader course. It has met the questions of the past. It has accumulated wisdom by experience. It should be, and doubt-
less it is today, well equipped to meet the questions of the present, to maintain the reputation of the past and to lay broad and deep foundations for the achieve-
ments of the future. The problems of to-
day are not more difficult than in the past, but they are more complex and di-
verse. There are in them a greater num-
ber of factors even if each factor is of less vitality. What message does the pres-
ent bring to us?
\V hat duty do we owe the today? \Vhat accomplishments can the tomorrow claim logically founded upon today? Are there messages that the horticultural conditions of the state at this moment require bring-
ing to your attention? Fortunately we stand in the presence of no calamity. We do not surround, as we have sometimes done in the past, those conditions that buried the hopes of thousands of our peo-
ple. But even those clouds had their silver lining, unseen then, but plainly vis-
ible now. We are in the midst of pros-
perity long continued and pronounced.
Our industries have been enlarged both in number and in volume. Our output is greatly increased in every department of horticulture. Our sources of know-
ledge, our ability to handle the drawbacks the pests and the evils of our diversiﬁed industries have been largely increased.
What then is there to consider? It fre-
quently happens that the most danger-
ous periods are those of greatest prosperi-
ty. It has been well said that, “Security is mortal’s chiefest enemy.”
In the line of thought I shall take to-
night, I may be straying from the beaten path, may be leading the way into battle
ﬁelds where the valiant, the sagacious and the steadfast of purpose alone can be found at the front. The commercial bat-
tles of the present dwarf into insigniﬁ-
cance the battles with insects, with cli-
matic conditions, with all our other 0b—
stacles combined. The struggle for new markets, for cheaper production, for fair-
er treatment by our agents in the markets.

for fair rates and rapid transit, do not these demand our attention and challenge the best brains among us? Of what avail is it that we devote our time and capital to the problems of production if the other and more complex problems of economy,
distribution, transportation, receive not their proper attention? These things are as much a part of our legitimate business as the cultivation of the soil, the ferti-
lizer we shall use or the various matters of every day occurrence. What man is there before me who has not felt like this?
The season has been a good one, I have fertilized judiciously and wisely, I have cultivated, I have sprayed, I have spared no pains to produce a ﬁne crop. How shall I market it to the best advantage?
Have you not realized that you were then confronted with harder conditions than those of production and ones less within your control or management?
The original scope of our Society be-
ing much narrower than its present one curtailed the range of topics considered at our meetings to a very narrow margin.
The original thought of the founders of this Society was to make it apply almost exclusively .to orange growing, to citrus fruits and their allied subjects. As the years have come and gone its scope has been widened so that it now covers, not only semi-tropical, but also tropical fruits,
vegetables and many of the fruits of the temperate zone. This enlargement of its sphere has injected into it new relations and new problems for annual considera-
tion. Let us brieﬂy discuss a few of the important items worthy of thought. This is an age of organization, co—operation and consolidation. It is not sufﬁcient that the horticulturist of today knows how to produce the fruits and the products of the soil but that he knows as well how to successfully transport, distribute and mar-
ket them. Perhaps the largest ﬁeld for present and future investigation is the One covering the problem of marketing. This problem involves the element of business experience and study of the relations of the cost of production and transportation to the market value of our products; the study of the laws of Supply and demand as applied to each particular product; a study of the value of organization in the securing of reasonable and satisfactOry rates of transportation; of the proper commissions to be paid our selling agents;
and the proper distribution of the crop so as to prevent surplus in one portion of the country and deﬁciency in another.
Were there no such thing as organized ef-
fort among those whose ﬁnancial interests are opposed to ours there should be no necessity for organization on our part.
The value of farmers and fruit growers’
organizations is in direct proportion to the tenacity with which they adhere to them and the vigor with which they enforce the principles involved. I do not deem it necessary to go into arguments sup-
porting the needs for compactly united organizations in each of our principal in-
dustries. The need for organization must be apparent to all. For greatest efﬁciency consolidation of all for the handling of problems common to all is only common sense. Questions like transportation, tar-
iffs for protection, rates of commission and kindred broad matters can only be handled powerfully and conclusivelyv in the hands of one central organization. The methods and direction taken by each. in-
terest must be dictated by themselves.
It can do no harm to crystallize among them, into some deﬁnite form the best ideas of the most intelligent and-ener—
getic of the growers, nor need it be be-

‘lieved that the only value in horticultural organization is that of the maintenance of the price or cheapening the cost of the production and the proper regulation of
‘the matter of transportation. In numer-
ous other ways organized effort is super-
ior 'to individual effort. The tendency of the times is to the enlarged costs of the
'material used for the packing and pack-
age purposes, the costs of living and in-
deed, increased cost in everything that the horticulturist purchases. The only fair method of safeguarding the growers and producers’ interests is to see that in-
creased revenue accrues to him suﬁicient-
'ly ‘to meet the increased cost of produc-
tion as well as the cost of living and the necessaries and luxuries of life.
Concurrent with this comes the thought of the reduced cost of production by bet—
ter management, more intensive cultiva-
tion, decreased cost of fertilizing by tak-
ing advantage of cheaper sources of nitro-
gen and other kindred economies. All of these are well and should never be for-
gotten. The opening up of new ﬁelds of production have helped swell the volume of material in our markets and should set us to thinking of how to overcome this new competition.
The solution of these problems will call for the best thought, the best persistent effort and the most constant watchful-
ness of the thoughtful classes in our midst. Among the hopeful signs of the present are the cordial relations existing
‘between the country and the city; between the producer and the carrier; between the producer and the consumer. In these bet-
ter understandings of each others’ rela-
tions we see the future solution of these problems. So long as the different class-
es understand and appreciate each other,
realize their mutual inter-dependence on each other, maintain their mutual respect for each other, that long will harmony and material prosperity exist. In passing,
it might be said that the accentuation of the self-interests of the horticultural class-
es does not necessarily mean war upon or antagonism of any other interest.
The recent report of the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture calls attenltion to the enormous resources of American agri-
culture and horticulture. In comparison,
all other interests combined sink into in-
signiﬁcance. The sums are so stupendous that we can scarcely realize their mag-
nitude. Of this grand total we are a con-
siderable part. It is just cause for con-
gratulation that the importance, vitality and dignity of the horticultural classes is being recognized.
Do our horticultural classes sufficient-
ly appreciate the value of and the necess-
ity for diversiﬁcation? Do we realize the full meaning of living at home? Is it not a fact that too great a proportion of the income from our products goes for that which. can and should be grown in our own state and possibly in our own neighborhood? We hear it discussed on all hands, but have not acted on it vig-
orously. \IVhile this thought is trite, I risk once more calling the attention of our people to its vital importance.
I have felt strongly impelled at this meeting to press upon your attention these important matters. To give vent to the thought that has been growing in my mind for some years, that the most vital and far-reaching questions now calling for' solution by Florida producers were not cultural questions but commercial ones; not planting but marketing; not fer-
tilizing but transportation. Let us think about these things, talk about them, study them, conquer them. If this thought.

talk and study take not the form of action then have we labored in vain.
During the past few months, I address-
ed a circular letter to every member of the society, in which I asked for an ex-
pression of opinion on many matters of importance, and asked for suggestions.
The replies have been numerous and my reward ample for the trouble I took. Much to enlighten and cheer the Society has come to me. Encouragement for the fu-
ture, and splendid appreciation for the past of the Society has breathed from many of the much—valued letters received.
I desire to thank you, most sincerely for these expressions of your better selves.
In the quiet of your homes, you have said things that you would not say on the ﬂoor of this house. You have my promise to use the good suggestionsin so far as I shall be able. These heart-to-heart let-
ters shall bear fruit.
Among the weighty subjects discussed in those letters, was that of “State Aid”
in the printing of our annual reports. A careful tabulation of the replies show about an equal number favoring and op-
posing the acceptance of such aid. Among those favoring, are some of our oldest and most thoughtful and experienced mem-
bers. On the other side, can be found those of equal experience and wisdom.
Some have cited other states in which State Aid is supposed to be the cause of their ruin as a society, while others point out other states in which it has had the opposite effect. The array of arguments pro. and con. is formidable and shows the ability and reasoning resources of our members. It is not my province or wish to discuss the question or to express an opinion on it. If the matter comes up,
all the reasoning, on all its sides and phas-
es, will be developed and the society can then pass upon it intelligently. \Nithout taking the time to discuss them here, I will say that many of the suggestions made by members will be carried out during the progress of the meeting, as they shall ﬁt into our work.
\Ve are to be favored by a number of eminent persons, with addresses and pap-
ers, during the progress of the meeting,
as a glance at the program will show.
Will these friends of the Society allow me to express, if ever so feebly, our sin-
cere thanks for their kindness and our high appreciation of their valued efforts.
But, what of the work? We have six sessions before us, occupying two full days. \Ve shall have seven formal ad-
dresses and papers. We shall listen to the reports of sixteen committees, and these reports will be ably and exhaustively discussed. In the course of these discus-
sions will come out much of the real value of our gathering. Don’t hesitate to stuff our “Question Box.” Show me by your patronage of this box that you appreciate a chance 'to ask questions. Work, fast and furious, is our portion for the next few days. At the close of the meeting may we feel that we never had a better one. Amidst the friends of many years,
in the city of hustle and progress, with words of welcome to inspire our efforts,
with the social feasts before us, our tasks shall be light and their accomplishment assured.

Nematode Diseases of Plants.
BY PROF. EARNEST A. BESSEY.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I wish to speak to you today about nematodes. In the ﬁrst place, it may be well to attempt to explain to you just what a nematode is, although most of you are familiar enough with the work of one of them, the root-knot. Nematodes or ell-
worms as they are sometimes called, are low animals, slender and worm-like, at least when young. Like the true worms they have no legs nor wings at any stage of their development. They differ from the latter in not being segmented and in having no jaws. They consist essential—
ly of a tube-like skin lined with muscles;
inside this is another tube, the alimentary canal. with various modiﬁcations along its course to act as gizzard, stomach, etc.
Add a very simple nervous system and you have nearly all the essential features of a nematode. They should never be confused with the segmented earth-worms nor with the larvae of various insects,
also, but erroneously, called worms.
Many species of nematodes are par-
asitic in animals, as, for example, the roundworm of the horse, the hookworm and trichina of man; many others live in various locations, both in the earth or in fresh or salt water, on decaying or-
ganic matter, a wellknown example being the harmless vinegar-eel; while still others attack living plants. The latter are entirely harmless to animal life. so that we need not fear their presence on that score. They are bad enough as it is, how-
ever.
With the exception of some that are parasitic in higher animals, nematodes are mostly minute. Those that attack plants are rarely over one-eighth of an inch in length, while some are many times smaller. Were it not for their great num-
bers they would scarcely require serious attention.
The principal disease of plants due to nematodes, at least in this country, is root-
knot, in which the nematodes live within the root, causing it to enlarge, forming the characteristic knots. In addition to this disease, other species of nematodes cause abortion of the ﬂowers of grasses,
distortion of leaves and ﬂowers through their presence within the stem, stunting and malformation of plants through nematodes living within the stern, killing out of spots in leaves through nematodes in the tissues at these points, and injured canker—like spots on the roots. The lat-
ter are caused by nematodes attacking the roots from the outside without entering them.
The life history of the root-knot nema-
tode is in short as follows: The eggS,
which are about 1-300 inch long, hatch into little larvea about I-IOO inch longv and about 1-2000 inch thick. These pos—
sess at the anterior end, a stout spear.
Crawling around in the soil they ﬁnally
ﬁnd roots, perhaps not for weeks after

they are hatched. A larvae seeks out the root tip and bores into it by means of its spear, taking its place near the center,
parallel to the axis of the root, with the anterior end directed away from the root tip. The necessary nourishment is sucked out of the surrounding .tissue through the spear which is hollow. Growth is rapid now, and soon the nematode begins to increase in thickness more rapidly than in length. The tip of the root continues to grow. The tissue about the nematode owing to some stimulus, due to its pres-
ence increases rapidly in amount, forming a knot of soft watery cells. If but one nematode has entered, the knot remains small, usually, but often the infections are not single and several to many nema-
todes come to lie close together or at short intervals causing a large knot or a succes-
sion of smaller one to be formed. The nematode’s increase in thickness contin-
ues until it is ﬂask-shaped. At this stage the male and female begin to become dif-
ferentiated in shape; the former perform-
ing a moult and again becoming a slender creature about 1—25 inch long and I-500
inch thick. The female, on the other hand, continues to enlarge until she is as thick as long, and only at the anterior end shows any worm-like portion. At this stage the egg laying begins, and con-
tinues until 400-506 eggs have been laid.
As these hatch they must bore their way out of the root tissue into the soil, and seek other roots or they simply ﬁnd con—
genial places to develop in the same knot so that in one large knot can be found nematodes of all stages of development.
The time required for the development from the egg to the mature egg-laying individual depends to a great extent upon the temperature and upon the plant affect-
ed, being more rapid in warm weather.
It probably never is less than four weeks,
and sometimes requires eight weeks.
The injury to the plant is of two kinds,
direct and indirect. As direct injury may be considered that due to the reduction or stoppage of the passage from the roots of water and dissolved mineral food—
stuffs, due to the tangling and interrup-
tion of the water conducting vessels in the knotted roots, also the injury to the plant due to the diversion of food-stuffs to build up the tissue of the knot instead of building up the rest of the plant.
Then direct injuries, although undoubt-
edly harmful. rarely cause the death of the affected plants. The indirect injuries are due to the fact that the soft abnormal tissue of the knot is attacked by various organisms of both fungous and animal nature, causing decay to set in which may involve the whole root system and thereby kill the plant. Many fungi ﬁnd easy en-
trance in this way. So, for example, the fungus causing wilt of cotton attacks plants suffering with root-knot much more vigorously and destructively than those that are not so infested.
Many plants are attacked so slightly that the injury is very slight or not even apparent. Such plants, however, owing to the large number of eggs laid by a single worm, serve the purpose of keeping the soil well stocked with nematodes.
I have been making a list of all plants on which I have seen- root-knot or on which it has been reported to occur. This list now contains about 300 species of plants. including most of those commonly cultivated. Among those that may be seriously injured, may be mentioned the following: ﬁg. peach, European grape.
roselle. banana, pawpaw, tomato, egg-
plant. rose. carnation, tuberose, violet,
jasmine. cowpea, soy-bean, cotton. and

most of the garden vegetables, especially cucumber, squash, pumpkin, water and muskmelon. On the other hand, the in-
jury has been but slight in those cases where I have observed it on the follow-
ing: various grasses, as Bermuda, crow-
foot, fescue, orchard grass, German millet,
persimmon, sawbrier, wormseed, chufa,
bush-clover, etc. I have yet to see a case of true root-knot on any of the citrus trees, velvet-bean, Florida beggar-weed,
oats, rye, barley, sorgum, hog-millet, etc.
Many ideas have been advanced as to how this pest should be combated but many of them are based on experiments made with the closely related sugarbeet nematode of Germany. But little actual experimental work has been done. One method is that of soil sterilization, i. e.
freeing the soil of the noxious organism by direct means. I shall mention various suggested means of doing this.
Chemical Means—The most efﬁcient of these is the use of carbon bisulphide in-
jected into the soil to a depth of several inches at close intervals and allowed to diffuse there throughout the soil- If enough is used this is effective. It has several serious objections; it is expensive,
so expensive in fact, that it would proba—
bly take several hundred dollars worth to treat one acre, not to speak of the labor of applying it. It is also poisonous to roots. A large ﬁg tree will stand it some-
times, but the cheek to the growth is great.
It is highly inflammable. It does not mix with water, and so cannot be used in wet soil. Formalin in dilute solution is equally effective if applied in sufﬁcient quantity. However. to wet dry soil to the depth of a foot would require about
ﬁve gallons of solution to a square yard c0sting $150 to $200 per acre. My ex-
periments to determine whether a lesser quantity will be suﬁicient are now under way. This solution is also harmful to vegetation, but if kept from the growing part of the plant is not as injurious as carbonbisulphide. Lime, gas—lime, gas liquor, oils, etc., have been tried on the sugar-beet nematode without effect. I am now trying some of them on the root-
knot Heat is the most efﬁcient means yet found for killing out all kinds of pests.
including the root-knot nematode.
Thanks to Stone and Smith in Massachu~
setts, the problem has been settled as far as nematodes in green-houses are con-
cerned. Steam is passed at high pressure through tiles or perforated iron pipes run-
ning through the soil. This effectually kills all animal and fungous parasites.
It seems doubtful whether that method will ever become of use in the open, unless it be for seed—beds or for truck farms where the income is very high. It would probably cost not less than $2,000 per acre to establish such a ster‘lizing appara-
tus. The often recommend :d building of large ﬁres upon the spot to be sterilized is to be discouraged. for the injury to the soil is too great.
Freezing, formerly supposed to be fatal to the root-knot nematode, is considered so by me no longer since I obtained authentic record of peonv plants going through a winter temperature of 35 de—
grees below zero without even a mulch protection and showing root-knot again that summer. That was not in Florida In Java where the dry season is well marked and is really dry, it has been found possible to exterminate the root-
knot nematode by drying out the soil.
This is done by keeping it in ﬁne tilth during the whole dry season by means of repeated plowings, and harrowings.


## p. 29 (#207) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 29
Strange to say, the root-knot nematode is easily killed by drying out, although many of its close relatives are dried without injury, and can remain alive for years in that condition, reviving again upon being moistened up. Paradoxical as it may seem, moisture will also kill the root—
knot nematode. It has often been found that wet lands are free from nematode injury while dryer lands adjacent suffered badly. In one case I learned of some very badly infected land flooded by a spring freshet for several days. Always thereafter it bore crops showing no sign of root-knot. In Java this method had also been tried and found to be successful.
The land must be submerged at least ﬁve to eight days.
Besides these direct means for freeing the soil of nematodes several indirect ones have been suggested, and it is by some of these that I believe our main salvation can be attained. The ﬁrst to be mention-
ed is the starvation method: i. e. growing nothing on the land that can serve as food for the nematodes until all has perished.
How long this would require for the root-knot nematode has not been determ-
ined; for its close relative, the sugar-beet nematode, it is not under two years. To keep the land entirely fallow this length of time is, of course, not to be thought of,
but the same results can be attained by cultivating only plants not attacked by root-knot even in the slightest degree.
Hence comes the great importance of numerous experiments to determine which plants are and which are not susceptible.
Of those which so far I have found to be free from root-knot. are crabgrass. the small grains, velvet bean, Florida beggar-
weed and but few others. Such infor-
mation bearing on the subject as I can obtain from you will be gratefully receiv-
ed. In view of the facts known the prac-
tise of many of allowing the land to grow up thickly to crabgrass in the summer,
is one that ought to tend to keep the root-knot nematode in check. If that could be combined with the use of velvet bean for a season or two, or if small grains were sown as winter crops for two years followed in the summer by vel-
vet beans it looks to me as if favorable results should be obtained. I have such experiments already under way.
Another method of combating the pest,
which promises very good results for cer-
tain annual crops, is‘that of breeding up resistant races. Thus the Iron cowpea, if obtained pure, is not attacked by root-
knot. Unfortunately, however, most of that obtainable in the markets or even some of that sent out from other sources,
contained some admixture of other va-
rieties vitiating the results. Mr. W. A.
Orton has demonstrated that this quality of resistance is transmissable to crosses with other sorts. Doubtless some results of value can be obtained by selecting seed from plants least affected in a ﬁeld known to be full of root-knot. Such plants, when in ﬂower, should be crossed, if possible,
with similar resistant plants in same ﬁeld.
In this way a nematode resistant sugar-
beet has been obtained.
The influence of increased amounts of certain elements of fertilizers on the amount of injury caused by root-knot has received. I ﬁnd, practically no attention.
It has been investigated very carefully in Germany in connection with the sugar—
beet nematode. There it has been found that by greatly increasing the potash the injury is to a large extent, decreased. I am now beginning similar experiments with the root—knot.
The method, however, that has perhaps


## p. 30 (#208) #############################################

30 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
been most successful of all against the sugar-beet nematode is the use of Trap-
erops. Strange to say. although this has often been recommended for root-knot,
I have yet to ﬁnd a single case where it has ever been tried even as an experiment.
I am making some experiments this sea-
son. The method consists essentially, in planting thickly in close rows, some crop known to be very susceptible to the nema-
tode, allowing the nematodes to enter it and before they have developed far enough to lay eggs, and so increase the number in the soil, to destory the crop.
This is repeated several times during the season, and so reduces the number of nematodes still left in the soil that it re-
quires several years before they become very destructive again. Certain cautions must be carefully observed, however, or the use of this method will increase in—
stead of decrease the number of nema-
todes. It is necessary to remove or entire-
ly turn under and kill the plants about four weeks after they come up. If left too long the nematodes will have develop-
ed too far and will have begun laying, if not long enough they will still be in the motile stage and will crawl out again and reinfect the soil.
What to do with a peach orchard, for example, where the root-knot is bad is a serious question. In the ﬁrst place we will take it for granted that the orchard,
even in its diseased state, represents too much money to permit it to be cut down.
It might be well, then, to try watering the trees heavily before the buds open, either early in the spring or 'late in the fall, with a dilute solution of formalin, so as to kill the nematodes in the knots. For such I would prefer the cowpea (not the Iron.) But unless they are re-
moved in time these trap crops will do more harm than good. When the orchard is cut down the land should be freed from nematodes by some of the means above mentioned, before setting again to peaches. Avoid cow-
peas, except possibly Iron, as they propa-
gate the nematode rapidly. Use velvet beans or beggar-weed instead. These are but suggestions, please understand, not from the result of actual personal exper-
ience, but as a result of fair acquaintance with the habits of the nematode. I trust some of you may have the courage to try these in a corner of your orchard and report to me the result.

Report on the Manatee Snail and White Fly.
BY F. D. WAITE.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Our President recently asked me to get up a paper on the white ﬂy and Manatee snail, the latter having been brought to the notice of the fruit growers within the past six months, and several descriptive articles have been published and copied into the leading papers of the State. I have brought a few specimens with me. also another specie of snail which may play a part in the cleaning up of the sooty mould,
as we have found it feeding on the lichens several feet high on the trunks of old seed-
lings.
Messrs Butler and Heathcote of St.
Petersburg sent me several dozen snail found feeding on the Mangrove at Passe-
a-Grille, these were put around a tree dur-
ing early winter and protected with sacks,
but all died, I hope this summer to make another trial with them.
I am sorry to say that parties have visited the grove where the Manatee snail was ﬁrst discovered and stolen so many that we can hardly ﬁnd any left, and our neighbors who afterwards discovered them in their groves, have been treated in like manner.
From observations already made I be-
lieve the snail is not active during cold or dry weather, neither do I think they increase until the rainy season, and dur-
ing the foggy weather in early fall and winter, when they become most active in ridding the trees and fruit of the sooty mould. Those wishing to become famil-
iar with the white ﬂy and its enemies should procure Press Bulletin No. 4. is-
sued May Ist, 1901, Press Bulletin No.

culture June 17th, I897. There is another report of the Entomologist Prof. H. A.

The sooty mold of orange, Meliola, is one of the most serious results of white fly infestation of citrus groves, and is an element in the injury to various plants from aphids and from some of the scale insects especiallythe Lecaniums, mealy bugs, wax scales, and cottony cushion scale. The fungus is not itself a parasite on the plant, but a saprophyte, deriving its sustenance from the sweet honey dew secreted by these insects. The injury to the plant results from the smothering action of the fungus, the heavy coating of

32 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY fungal threads interfering with the healthful action of sunlight on the leaves.
The appearance of the various ornamen-
tal and hedge plants is also disﬁgured by the dark fungus. The sooty mold is es-
pecially bad following the white fly at—
tack owing to the large amount of honey dew secreted by these insects. As the white ﬁy larvae attach themselves to the under side 'of the leaves the honey dew exuded by them falls to the top side of the leaves beneath, thus affording favor-
able opportunity for the growth of the fungus. So constant is the association of the fungus and the white fly that badly infested groves and hedges may be recog-
nized at some distance by the heavily coated dark foliage. The fungus develops on the fruit as well as on the leaves and stem and washing becomes necessary, re—
sulting not only in an added expense. but also in increased danger of decay in ship-
ping. In this connection the habits of the tree snail, Bulimulus Dormam', are of the greatest interest. This snail has been found in the orange groves in Manatee county feeding upon the sooty mould.
Just how long the snail has been present on orange trees in this county it is im-
possible to say. It was observed as long as two years ago by Mr. F. D. Waite, at Palmetto. It seems to have been present in small number in other groves at this time, but attracted no further attention until the present summer. The snail is now widely distributed in Manatee coun-
ty, occurring in many groves on both sides of the Manatee river. The work of
'the snails is very characteristic. When well started they occur in great numbers on the tree spreading over it from base to top. Its favorite food seems to be the sooty mold. The fungus is cleaned from the leaves, stems. and fruit. The leaves thus cleaned have a glossy, shiny appear-
ance as though free from white fly. The fruit thus cleaned has a better color and probably ripens earlier. In addition to the fungus, the snail takes algae and some lichens from the stem and trunk,
giving the trunk a much cleaner and fresher look. The trees that are cleaned stand out conspicuously from the sur-
rounding trees by their bright foliage and clean trunks. The snails increase rapidly under favorable conditions. The eggs are probably deposited in protected places about the trunks of the trees, possibly also about the base of the tree under leaves and other rubbish. That the snails are capable of doing effective work when present in suFﬁcient numbers has been shown in numerous groves in Manatee county during the present summer. Such trees in these groves as are well stocked with the snails have been thoroughly cleaned, the fruit not requiring washing.
The snails are of medium size, measur-
ing. when full grown, three-fourths to one inch in length. The shells are smooth,
white, or corneous white, and with about four bands of brown spots. Old shells have often a somewhat corroded surface.
the bands becoming indistinct or absent.
When the conditions are unfavorable, eith-
er cold or dry, the snails take refuge in the hollows of the trees or under leaves ac-
cumulated in the forks, or elsewhere, or under sacks at the base of the trees when these are provided. It thus becomes an easy matter to transfer them from tree to tree- A few snails placed by Mr. Wade Harrison in one of his trees in March, in-
creased in such numbers as to free the tree of sooty mold by mid-summer of the same year. The snails are known to range with' some variation from the mouth of the St. johns river on the north. to the

Caloosahatchie river on the south. The species is probably native to Florida as specimens in small numbers were observ-
ed about the hammocks and elsewhere as long as ﬁfty years ago. Its habit of feed-
ing on the sooty mold of the orange, how-
ever, was not known until within the past two years.
In view of the fondness of the snails for the injurious sooty mold fungus, it becomes of ﬁrst importance to_ observe their treatment of the beneﬁcial fungi.
Among the fungi parasitic on orange in-
sects there are four species of inestimable value to orange growers. These are, the brown fungus well known as an effective parasite on the white ﬂy larvae; the red-pink fungus also parasitic on the white ﬂy; the red fungus, and the gray headed fungus, both parasitic on the common scales. The brown fungus so effective in control of the white ﬂy, as is well-known, throws out spreading hyphae for some distance around the body of the dead leaves. It seems that the snails oc-
casionally feed to a limited extent on these, spreading hyphae but evidently not enough to interfere with the spread of the fungus, since this fungus is doing particu-
larly effective work in the groves in the Manatee region where the snails occur.
The red-pink fungus is also abundant in the groves where the snails occur and is untouched by them. The snails have not been observed to feed on either the red or the gray fungi parasitic on the common orange scales, and it is probable that they have no taste for these parasitic fungi. Colonies of the snails are being started in part of the State where the white ﬂy injury is severe and where condi-
tions seem favorable for the growth of the snail. It is desirable that close atten-
tion be given to the habits of the snail,
as well as to means of protecting colonies against unfavorable conditions. A few sacks thrown around the tree seem to afford a needed protection against unus—
ual cold. It is probable that sprays can not be used on trees stocked with the snails without injury to the colony, for,
although protected by the shell from the immediate effect, sufﬁcient spray probably clings to the sooty mold on which they feed to destroy them. The beneﬁcial par-
asitic fungi and the snails may be allowed to work together on unsprayed trees.
The snail is here spoken of as the Mana-
tee snail since while recorded as occurring in other parts of the State it was found working on the orange groves ﬁrst in the Manatee region.

Report of Committee on Diseases, Insects and Method of Control.
[There was no regular report made by any member of the committee, but the question was opened for discussion, and this proved very interesting. The fol-
lowing is as full a report as the stenog—
rapher was able to make—See]
Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I regret to say that I have been unable to make any report owing to the fact that I have been in a dark room for some weeks, unable to read or write and have had to depend upon some one else to do my writing for me. After the President had notiﬁed me I was on this committee I communicated with other members telling them of my disability and urging them to attend to the work necessary to a good report.
Mr. Hubbard—I have no formal re—
' port on this subject. I have had no ex-
perience with the white ﬂy, not even like our friend Mr. Hart. I have a small joke at Mr. Hart’s expense. One of our neighbors sent him a specimen and asked if it was the white ﬂy, he also wrote Mr.
Hart, but Mr. Hart was so afraid of the white ﬂy that he immediately burn-
ed it without examination. I do not believe this gentleman had the white ﬂy,
but he did have the white wax scale.
The red fungus is now attacking this scale and I think he will soon be rid of it.
I practically do no spraying. In cases of small trees I use a small atomizer,
using pure kerosense and treating them on a warm, dry day. putting it on care-
fully. The kerosene will evaporate in about an hour and one application will remove most of the scale and will not hurt the foliage. Kerosene has practi-
cally the same chemical composition as turpentine and the essential oil of the orange, so that when it evaporates it has very little effect on the tree. If you should saturate the tree with the kero-
sene, of course it might do some damage.
(Question) Have you used whale oil soap?
Mr. Hubbard—I used to do this. but am now depending on Lady bugs and fungus- Orange trees may have some scale the ﬁrst season, but the next year the lady bug and fungus will clean them out pretty thoroughly. If a man sprays for red spider etc., he kills the fungus and has to keep up the spraying continually.
Maj. Healy.—Mr Waite seems to be the only one who has had any experience with the white ﬂy.
Mr. \Vaite.—One 0f the oldest groves we have, contains 600 large trees, so large we cannot get in between them to spray. This grove has been infested with the ﬂy for ten or ﬁfteen years. The fungi is very abundant. also about one hundred trees are inhabited by the snail, specimens of which I have brought with me. We commenced picking this crop of 4000
boxes during Christmas week and ﬁnish-
ed about the twentieth of January we

had a great deal of rainy weather at the time. Every box was washed except that which had been beautifully cleaned by the snail. The fruit carried well, and sold for $3.00 per box in Providence R. I. The trees cleaned by the snail gave us a uniform bloom this spring, while the balance of the grove bloomed only in the tops of the trees.
Saturday night I went over to the grove to get specimens of the snail but could only ﬁnd a'few, and concluded that our neighbors had gathered the greater portion of them, but Sunday it rained during the night, and the next morning my foreman found plenty of them crawl-
ing up and down the trunks, and over the foilage, and he said that many of the snails had particles of sand still sticking to them. We are not certain that they do not burrow in the earth during the cool winter weather, coming out when the weather is warm, and the atmosphere moist. They do not move around or feed, only when the sooty mold is wet,
which I presume enables them to eat it more readily, and in doing so they clean up the eggs of the ﬂy.
Mr. Hart—Mr. President, I wish to ask Mr. \Vaite if in spraying he would risk clear water.
Mr. Waite—This would assist the snails and after two or three sprayings the fungi would make their appearance,
for this reason I would reccommend to those who do not wish to use insecticides‘
and fungucides, spraying with clear wa-
ter, and if done toward night, it would keep the sooty mold moist all night.
Mr. Hart.—What kind of a nozzle would you use?
Mr. VVaite.—We use the Big Boston in a solid spray on the tall trees. and the Vermoel for small trees and where we wish to throw a mist over the fruit for the rust mite.
Mr. Bell—I would like to know wheth—
er or not the result of the fungi mention-
ed is a remedy for the white ﬂy.
Mr. Waite—After the white ﬂy has been in a grove a few years, this fungi seems to be a natural parasite following it, and will unaided, in time clean up the trees so they will produce one ﬁne crop in three years, and a medium one year, and comparatively nothing the next, but by assisting the fungi to spread more rapidly we may get fewer oﬁ' years.
Mr. Bell—Do I understand that when the -white ﬂy gets into a grove that it will bear probably once in three years?
Mr. \\"aite.—Yes sir, but it is my opin-
ion that if we assist the fungi and snail to spread more rapidly, we will soon lose all fear of the white ﬂy.
Mr. Bell—Is the damage done by white ﬂy as much as one hundred dollars per acre?
Mr. Waite—I should say that was a small estimate but if the fungi and snail have your assistance they will keep out the ﬂy, if you will take the pains. and use the time you would consume in spraying,
distributing fungi and snails, it would not lessen the value of your grove one dollar. As I have stated the fruit ship—
ped from the grove mentioned was as
ﬁne as any I ever saw, while that ad-
joining this grove was not near as ﬁne
ﬂavored, it was covered with sooty mold,
which excluded the air and sunlight, nec—
essary to make a ﬁne quality of fruit.
The trees stocked with the snail were quite clean by the last of Sept, so they had plenty of sunlight (and fully a month before gathering the fruit.) therefore I think the snail the best friend we have with which to ﬁght the white ﬂy.

36 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Mr. McClung—Is this mould respon-
sible for the damage that is attributed to the white ﬂy?
Mr. Waite—Yes sir.
Mr. Bed—How many oranges did you wash and what was the expense of wash-
ing them?
Mr. \‘V aite.—VV e have cleaned as many as ﬁfty boxes in ﬁfteen minutes. with three men at $1.25 per day. We washed our entire crop of grape fruit and oranges not cleaned by the snail.
Mr. Longley.——I would like to ask about the scale and white ﬂy: Is the white ﬂy more destructive to one kind of fruit than to another?
Mr. \Vaite.—.-It is more destructive to oranges than grapefruit, but is worse on tangerine, mandarin and lemon, than any of the others.
Mr. Gist—I would like to ask what steps I should take if the white ﬂy should appear on my grove. Should I spray or use fungi and snail?
Mr. \Vaite.—I would advise spraying the ﬁrst trees showing any sign of the
ﬂy, in this way you may be able to hold it in check for several years, but it would pay to introduce the fungi and snail as soon as you see that you have the ﬂy well started in your grove, but not before. for foilage partially covered with the fungi may contain plenty of pupa which may mature in a few days and ﬂy to other trees not stocked with the fungi.
Maj. Healey-—I have sought infor-
mation on the origin of the white ﬂy and am told that it was brought to this coun-
try from China. It might be we could gather some information from there that would aid us in its extermination.
Mr. Sampson—I would ask if the ex-
termination of the white ﬂy is dependent on fungi, snails, or spraying, and if there would be a full crop the third year.
Mr. Hart.——I would like Mr. Waite’s opinion as to how the spraying can be done on bearing trees, and whether or not it would give us a good full crop the third year or a normal one each year.
Mr. Waite—Six years ago I took charge of the Manatee Lemon Co’s groves in Manatee county. The young grove of 225 acres joined another grove that was badly infested with white ﬂy. Our trees were very small, from one to two feet high, we sprayed that portion near-
est that grove the ﬁrst winter, and as we noticed specimens of the ﬂy farther out in our grove, from year to year, so we increased the area. For the ﬁrst four years we kept the ﬂy down to such an extent that our trees were always glossy,
and only an occasional tree would be black from the sooty mould. As the trees became larger it was more difﬁcult to wet the entire foilage, and the Fly would become numerous by October, and por-
tions of the fruit would be black, but these winter sprayings seemed to clean the trees enough so that they would bloom and set a very nice crop of fruit. Our success was fully as good with old seed-
lings. We did not spray during the past winter, wishing to see what results would follow the introduction of the brown and red fungi, these only work during the rainy season or foggy weath-
er during the fall and winter. By spray-
ing we have increased our crop of fruit each year. It requires more intelligent labor than the ordinary “Darkey” to do successful spraying as one leaf missed may have hundreds of eggs.
Mr. Brown—\IVhat are the surround-
ing dangers of the white ﬂy? Upon what does it feed?


## p. 37 (#215) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 37
Mr. Waite—It feeds upon the orange,
lemon, grapefruit and lime, I have also seen it in all stages from the egg to the adult ﬂy, on the chinaberry, persimmon,
cape jasmine and prickly ash. \Nhile I have never found the larva or pupa on the palmetto and gall berry, I have seen the adult flies quite abundant. The sooty mold attacks the honey dew, following the attacks of many kind of wax scale and mealy bug. Many have sent me speci-
mens of plants or shrubbery covered with this deposit of sooty mold, and asked if it was not white ﬂy. On examination I found only the wax scale, or mealy bug.
Mr. Taber.—I would like to hear from
.Prof. Rolfs on this question.
Prof Rolfs—I was getting more infor-
mation out of this than I could possibly give, but some people are never satisﬁed until they get things stirred up.
The damage done by the white ﬂy, and the smut which follows it, does consider-
able damage to the grove that is ordi-
narily not taken into consideration. The honey dew, which is excreted by the white
ﬂy. falls upon the fruit and the upper side of the leaves, this makes a medium in which the smut or sooty mold grows luxuriantly. By its extensive growth it forms a velvety covering over the leaves and fruit and on account of its black color it keeps the sun from penetrating to the leaves and fruit or in a large measure obstructs it. Sunlight as we all know is absolutely necessary for the welfare of our orchard trees, and is also absolutely necessary for the maturing of the fruit,
consequently, when the sunlight is cut off almost completely, as is often the case with this sooty mold covering, the fruits cannot mature properly. This is brought out very strikingly when the fruit is run through a washer. The fruit as it hangs on the tree appears to be perfectly ripe but when it comes out of the washer it is half green, the green area extending as far as the fruit is covered with the sooty mold.
The Manatee snail does not destroy the white ﬂy as a number of people have as-
serted. No one who has studied the work of this snail with a hand lens, which is the proper way to study it, will contend for a moment that the snail does any harm to the white ﬂy. It merely feeds on the sooty mold cleaning it off completely from the leaves and from the fruit, doing the work much more perfectly than any
> washer yet invented.
The good work of the Manatee snail in clearing off the sooty mold was strik-
ineg apparent in a number of cases. The trees that had been cleared of the sooty mold a year before produced an abun-
dant bloom and set a heavy crop of fruit,
while the adjoining trees bloomed rather sparsely and set, probably, a half crop of fruit. So far as the natural conditions sur-
rounding these trees was concerned they seemed to be alike, there was every rea-
son for believing that the beneﬁcial effect was attributable to the work of the snail.
Maj. Fairbanks—I would like to know about the white ﬂy on younger growth, as it did not seem to be on the older growth.
Professor Rolfs—The females deposit their eggs on the younger foliage, as young trees are usually making a vigor-
ous growth, these are apt to have more eggs deposited upon them proportionally than the large trees. It sometimes hap—
pens that a tree will send up a water sprout while the rest of it is practically dormant, if this occurs during the' ﬂight of the white ﬂy, the water sprout will be

found to have received myriads of eggs on the lower side of the leaves.
Mr. Henderson—I want to touch on one point about the white ﬂy. I am not properly in the orange belt, but I have about one hundred trees. In the fall of
1904 the white ﬂy appeared on one tree.
I was told if I would cut all the leaves off the one tree I would be free of the white
ﬂy, which I did. This is good. I had them only on the one tree.
Prof. Rolfs.—In the matter of keeping the white ﬂy restricted to the area already inhabited. I may cite one instance that occurred among a number, in which we succeeded in eradicating the ﬂy after it had become pretty well established, I am referring to the case that happened at West Palm Beach. A wealthy gentle-
man who had a ﬁne house at Orlando,
decided to build a ﬁner one at \Vest Palm Beach, and after the house was built he
,carried with him some trees and shrubs.
After these had been set out, probably some six months, it was discovered that they were infested with white ﬂy. Per-
mission was obtained to destroy every thing to which the white ﬂy had spread,
all the shrubbery, including citrus planted out, were grubbed up and burned, some of the stuff such as the stems of banana plants that would not burn were thrown into the lake.
Later investigations failed to bring to light any white ﬂy, we think therefore,
that the pest was stopped and eradicated at the point of infection. If the infection is checked before migration of the white
ﬂy takes place, I think it entirely possible to eradicate it.
Mr. Cook—How did you destroy the white ﬂy? If he is in the air, is he killed, or will he propagate a second year?
Prof. Rolfs.—The white ﬂy in its com-
plete development goes through the egg stage; the larval stage, during the ﬁrst part of which it crawls about and during the latter part it remains stationary; the pupa stage which to the unaided eye is not very different from the larval stage,
but can be distinguished from it by the use of a hand lens; and the last stage or adult state. During the last stage is the insect able to ﬂy and only during this stage does it reproduce itself.
During the summer season the eggs hatch in about three days. The larval stage lasts for about twenty ﬁve days, the third stage or pupa stage lasts for about ten days- The adult insect lives only a very short time, the females lay about all of their eggs during the ﬁrst twenty four?
hours, the adult ﬂies live only about three or four days. The time required for an entire generation during the summer time, according to Professor Gossard, is about forty or ﬁfty days, while during the winter portion of the year it may be nearly six months.
Mr. Cook—Does the white ﬂy only live long enough to propagate the ﬁrst time? Does it lay more than one crop of eggs?
Prof. Rolfs.-—The white ﬂy appears to lay only about twenty ﬁve eggs and when this hatch is laid off she does not appear to lay a second batch.
Mr. Cook.—I can spray my trees, but the white ﬂy commences laying her eggs the next night. I have not been able to destroy the eggs.
Prof. Rolfs.—During the summertime there is almost a continuous appearance of adult ﬂies, there are, however. periods during which only few are on the wing. at such a time the work of combatting this pest can be carried on to best advantage.
Mr. Cook—Do I understand that they disappear after laying?


## p. 39 (#217) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Prof. Rolfs.—There are three or four periods during which the adults appear in countless numbers. During this time it is probably not best, to spray, excepting where it is done for special purposes,
spraying can be done most effectively be-
tween the broods.
Mr. Grifﬁng.—Prof- Rolfs mentions that a large portion of the State is now free from the white fly. \Vhile this dis-
cussion has been conﬁned to Manatee,
I would ask if it can be determined just where the territories are that are now affected.
Prof. Rolfs.—\Ve can not give you the deﬁnite data as to what portions of the State are infested with' white ﬂy and what portions are not. Prof. Gossard had this pretty thoroughly worked out,
but we know that every year the insect is spreading to new districts and we know how reluctant people are especially if he happens to be a Nurseryman to admit that white ﬂy is present on his premises. A man might not hesitate to state the fact privately but he would not like to have it advertised.
Mr. .—I have specimens of fun-
gus which I presume the citrus growers are familiar with. Last year the State was full of this particular fungus. The damage is not known as yet, but we hope to know about it soon. Last year we had scarcely any scab at all, but this year we have an abundance of it. Some one found that by spraying the scab with Bordeaux mixture that it could be con-
trolled. This scab will develop on the sweet trees also. Also on grape fruit it is very severe. [The fungus referred to is the sour orange scab. Cladosporium ele-
ganus. Sec.]
Mr. Longley.—Is it more prevalent on grapefruit or oranges?


Mr. .—On lemon it is more severe than on any citrus stock.
Mr. Longley.—Is the fungus shown on vigorous growing trees?
Mr. .—The fungus attacks trees when they are very small, and it seems to make very little difference whether the tree is growing thriftily or not. I believe,
however, we see it more frequently on'-
thrifty trees.
Mr. Longley.—-VV ill the fungus spread during the summer?
Mr. .—-Very little growth appears during that time, but if we have a dry season we are not apt to get much of it.
It requires a rainy season for this to grow.
Mr. Longley.-—Did that same fungus attack lemon trees prior to the freeze.
Mr. .—Yes.
Mr. Beers—W ill inoculation of blue-
stone be beneﬁcial?
Mr. .—I should say, no.
would have no preventative effect.
Mr. T aber.—To what extent have you found this scab affecting trees?
Mr. ———.-—Some sweet oranges are sometimes affected slightly; the satsuma,
very badly. Ordinary oranges we have no trouble with at all after the buds begin to grow- The scab I referred to was that on tall bearing trees, and so differs in that respect.
Mr. \Vaite.—-Referring to the sour scab on the grapefruit, I will say that in the last few days I have received a letter from a gentleman who says his trees are all more or less effected with fungi. with the exception of about two acres where the trees are located on a shell mound,
there they seem to be free from it, is it lime the trees require?
Dr. Rolfs—I cannot answer as to this question as we have made no experiment

on this line. It may be due to location,
soil, or the shell.
Mr. Fairbanks—Is there any way of producing and developing non-resisting trees?
Mr. Brown.—It may be possible that there are some varieties of grapefruit that are more resistent than others.
President McCarty.—This is a matter worthy of study. I hope something may be attempted along this line. I think it probable that something can be done, but I cannot tell how long it will take.
Mr. Brown—There is one other dis-
ease, that is withertip: I do not know how many here are familiar with it. If there are those here who know anything about the withertip, I will beg to hear from them.
Prof. Rolfs—I have been studying the disease (withertip) for the last four years, and have also treated groves vary—
. ing in size from a few trees up to over twenty acres in extent. The methods of procedure are pretty thoroughly worked out. A bulletin on this subject was pub-
lished from the Department of Agricul-
ture, Wasington, D. C., and a revised edition of this bulletin is now being pre-
pared.
In addition to my own experience in treating this disease, I have given advice to many grove owners and have watched the application of this advice. Where the work is done thoroughly and followed up conscientiously the results have always been satisfactory. A number of groves that were treated according to advice, and were very badly infected with the disease,
are now practically free. As there are a number of men present who have had practical experience in combating with this disease, I should like to hear from them.
Mr. Phelps—I have several groves that have been badly effected by this withertip; my fruit dropped badly and I wrote to Professor Rolfs but did not hear from him promptly, so I wrote to a spray-
er and asked about inoculating with blue-
stone. I asked him if it would not have the same effect as spraying. I urged inoculating, mixing equal parts of blue stone and air slacked lime. I have been doing this and ﬁnd that after it has been in about ten days or two weeks there is a great deal of gum coming out- That is as far as I have gotten and I do not know what the effects will be.
Mr. Hart—Before we leave the mat—
ter of diseases and insects there is a very important matter. I am losing trees brieﬂy. A year ago I introduced a reso-
lution asking that we get more assistance from the Agricultural Department in the study of blight. I took it up with Mr.
\Vilson who promised to help us if we could get in shape to receive it. I want to put in the same resolution. This is an important matter. I am losing trees now that would bear ten or twelve boxes each year, and I am putting in new trees in each place and have a tree growing wherever there is a place for it, but my grove is uneven. I am not alone in this experience; this disease is all over the State but we do not know much about it yet and it is something we should look after.
Mr. Painter.—Your Secretary present-
ed the resolution to Secretary Wilson in person, Mr. Wilson said he would be glad to do more than they were doing if he could but that all of their appropria-
tion for this class of work had been used up. I am conﬁdent the only way we can get an appropriation for this work is to take it up with our Senators and Repre-
sentatives and get them to ask for an ap-
propriation.

The Experiment Station Co-operative Work.
BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS,
DII-BCTOR FLORIDA EXPIIIIINT STATION.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen."
-In beginning my talk on the Experi-
ment Station co-operative work I can—
not do better than to show how the pur-
poses for which the Experiment Station was founded is frequently misjudged,
and in many quarters not understood.
So much work has been done with the Horticultural Society, as a society, and with the different members of the Society,
personally, that nearly everyone in my hearing is probably better informed than the best informed outside the Horticul-
tural Society. In I887 Congress pro-
vided for the Experiment Station by pas-
sing the Hatch Act. To show concisely what was intended by the Hatch Act I will quote you Section 2 verbatim:
“Section 2. That it shall be the object and duty of said Experiment Stations to conduct original researches or experi-
ments on the physiology of plants and animals; the diseases to which they are severally subject, with the remedies for the same; the chemical composition of plants at their different stages of growth;
the comparative advantages of rotative cropping as, pursued under a varying series of crops; the capacity of new plants or trees for acclimation; the analysis of soils and water; the chemical composition of manures, natural or artiﬁcial, with ex-
periments designed to test their compara-
tive effects on crops of different kinds;
the adaptation and value of grasses and forage plants; the composition and diges-
tibility of the different kinds of food for domestic animals; scientiﬁc and economic questions involved in the production of butter and cheese; and such other re-
searches of experiments bearing directly on the agricultural industry of the United States as may in each case be deemed advisable, having due regard to the vary-
ing conditions and needs of the respective States and Territories.”
This, as you will see, makes a very clear cut statement of what the funds are to be used for. Thus, things which are not provided for in this Act are necessari—
ly not contemplated and not permissi—
ble under it. The Congress, previous to the one in session at the present time,
passed a law requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to supervise the experiments much more closely, and also co-ordinate the experiments in different States.
During the past year Congress has passed the Adams Act which will prove of great beneﬁt to the Experiment Sta-
tion, and directly. to the people of Flori-
da. In this Act an additional $5000 are appropriated, which is increased by $2000
annually, until it shall reach $15000-
'This fund is more closely guarded even than that of the Hatch Fund. I quote you from this Act which appropriates the fund. -

original researches or experiments bear-
ing directly on the agricultural industry of the United States, having due regard to the varying conditions and needs of the respective States and Territories."
The term, “original research," might be a very general one were it not for the fact that the Director of the Oﬂice of Experiment Stations is held responsible for the interpretation of the expenditure of this fund. The Director of the Oﬂice of Experiment Stations has probably had more experience in Experiment Station work than any other living man, and con-
sequently is able to tell at a glance wheth-
er a proposed piece of work is original research, or whether it is a piece of demonstration work, or, what not.
In interpreting this law the Secretary of Agriculture has issued a circular letter in which he states:
* * * “Accordingly, expenses for ad ministration, care of buildings and grounds, insurance, ofﬁce furniture and
ﬁttings, general maintenance of the sta-
tion farm and animals, veriﬁcation and demonstration experiments, compilations,
farmers’ institute work, travelling, except as is immediately connected with original researches in progress under this Act,
and other general expenses for the main-
tenance of the experiment stations, are not to be charged to this fund. The Act makes no provision for printing or for the distribution of publications, which should be charged to other funds.”
I have thus taken considerable time to show you exactly what are the essential parts of the laws founding the Experi—
ment Stations, and also what limitations are placed upon us. I do this from the fact that there seems to be a general mis-
information as to what the ofﬁce and privilege of the Experiment Station is.
Even our legislators who assemble at Tallahassee bi-ennially and even people higher in authority have had erroneous impressions in regard to the essential parts of the law.
The Hatch Act was passed in 1888 and became operative in the same year. This makes the experiment station a little over seventeen years old. During this time it has published 84 bulletins and several annual reports. Of the 84 bulletins 46
are devoted to horticultural work directly.
and portions of the remaining 38 are also devoted to horticultural work; and also a large part of many of the annual re‘
ports. From this you will see that the horticultural interests of the State have been well looked after. This is especially so in more recent years. Taking the last ten years we ﬁnd that 36 of the bul-
letins are devoted to horticultural matters.
Most of these being fully illustrated. In the last ﬁve years 22 bulletins have been published on horticultural matters. Some of these have been profusely illus-
trated. If no other bulletins had been published from the Experiment Station within the last ﬁve years than those pub-
lished on Horticultural subjects, the re-
quirements of the law, so far as publica-
tions were concerned, would have been more than met-
The matter contained in these bulletins in the most cases, has received world-
wide attention. ’
The pineapple growers of Florida have at their disposal the most thoroughly reliable scientiﬁc publications on their special subject that has been published anywhere in the world. \Vithin the pres-
ent ﬁscal year two new bulletins on this subject have been issued which many of you will ﬁnd on your tables when you reach home from this meeting.

From the beginning the Experiment Station has had an appropriation of
$15000 a year. During the seventeen years of its life the State of Florida has not appropriated anything toward equip-
ment and maintenance of this institution.
Consequently what it has done has been accomplished entirely on Federal appro-
priation. This, of course. is much to be regretted, especially from the fact that,
if. additional funds from the State had been accessible it would have been pos-
sible to have erected very suitable build-
ings and to undertake much more elabor-
ate and useful experiments than it-has been possible in the present conditions.
Frequently in planning experiments these have had to be altered in such a way as to make it possible to meet the expendi-
tures under the conditions imposed by the Hatch Act. Another serious condition that has arisen is the fact that the amount of appropriation has not been increased since the inauguration of the experiment stations and yet the living expenses and supplies have nearly doubled in prices.
In some cases these have more than doubled in price. This is especially true of labor-in the vicinity of the Experiment Station.
CO-OPERATION.
Our most successful experiments that have been carried out by the Florida Experiment Station the State has co-
operated with the Experiment Station.
Among the ﬁrst of these co-operative ex-
periments was the one conducted in the fertilization of pineapples on the ﬁeld be-
longing to Mr. T. V. Moore, at Jensen,
Florida. In this experiment Mr. Moore furnished the ﬁeld and took care of it;
while the Experiment Station furnished the fertilizer and made the application.
The crop was the property of Mr. Moore,
excepting that the Experiment Station made use of as many of the ripened pine-
apples as might be needed for scientiﬁc work. This piece of work proved to be so thoroughly successful, that in spite of the fact that the writer was roundly criti—
cised by members of the Board of Trus-
tees. they found themselves in a position where his successor was permitted to car-
ry out the exact line of work after a year or two of interruption.
In this connection allow me to say that the members of the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society have always given the Experiment Station their generous sym-
pathy. and in every way pointed out to them. have co-operated and helped us along in the most cordial way. This generous co—operation has not been merely that of words of encouragement.
but in actual help in the ﬁeld. Our sci-
entiﬁc staff is not only welcome but re-
quests and importunities are constantly coming for expert help and advice in the
ﬁeld. Whenever possible we respond promptly and cheerfully. There are times however when the conditions at the Experiment Station will not permit us to be absent. It shows that a very great interest is being taken at the pres-
ent time in scientiﬁc information, and that the latest and most improved meth-
ods are sought.
NEEDS OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION.
The ﬁrst requisite of the Experiment Station is to have your hearty sympathy and support. These you have given very generously, though, possibly, not always in the most effective way. We have at times lost some of our most active and energetic men, that could have been saved to us if every member of the horticultural

Society had demanded of the Trustees that the resignation be not accepted.
That we have no support from the Legislature to supplement the funds of the Experiment Station has already been indicated. There is however, a very general misconception on this point, not only by the Legislators, but also by the Agricultural constituents in the State.
The Experiment Station is frequently importuned by the Agricultural people to hold farmers institutes. From the read-
ing of the law which I have quoted it is clear that it was not contemplated by Congress when this act was passed to use the funds of the Experiment Station for Farmer’s Institutes nor for demonstra-
tion work. The following paragraph is taken from a letter of instruction sent out by the Secretary of Agriculture to the Directors of Experiment Stations:
“The increased liberality of the Federal Government in providing for the endow-
ment of research and experimentation in agriculture should be a further incentive to the States and local communities to supplement these funds for the extension of demonstration experiments, farmers’
institutes, agricultural colleges, schools,
and courses of instruction, and the gen-
eral education of the rural communities along industrial lines, in order that the masses of our farmers may be so edu-
cated from early youth that they will ap-
preciate the beneﬁts of original research and experimentation as applied to agri-
cultural problems and be able to appro-
priate in the most effective manner for their own beneﬁt and the general weﬁare of the nation whatever practical results are obtained from the work of the agri—
cultural experiment stations.”
From this you will see that it is very clear that the expenses of organizing and running farmer’s institutes and other similar institutions in the State of Florida must be met from funds provided by the Legislature.
SEPARATION OF THE EXPERIMENT STA-
TION FROM THE UNIVERSITY.
The Board of Control of the Florida educational institutions as soon as they came into power decided to make a more sharply deﬁned segregation between the University and the Experiment Station.
Through their President Dr. Sledd of the University, they have promLsed us that the workers in the Experiment Station should not be required to do University work.
This segregation has its advantages and also its disadvantages. It has its disadvantages in losing the services of, at least, two very able men, Dr. Flint and Dr. Sellards; on the other hand, it has its advantages in securing the undivided efforts of a number of the best workers that we have in the South. During the present ﬁscal year: i. e., until June 30, the connection between the University and Experiment Station will continue as it has been for the past fourteen years. At the beginning of the next ﬁscal year,
which is july Ist, the Experiment Station staff will be entirely free from teaching work. This will make it possible for this corp of scientists to devote their entire time to the working out of experiments that have been inaugurated. It will also enable them to visit various portions of the State of Florida at such a time, and for such a length of time, as their experi-
ment work will permit. During the coming year it will be possible to deliver lectures from time to time at other points and at more frequent intervals.

Every member of the Horticultural So—
ciety is familiar with the fact that the University of Florida is to be transferred to a new site at Gainesville during the coming year. At the same time when the University is transferred the Experi-
ment Station will also be moved to its new location. The Board of Control are providing at Gainesville commodious buildings for every department in the Experiment Station; _ also propagating house, grounds, and other equipments necessary for beginning work at once.
The plans have been made and are being carried out successfully so that there will be no interruption in the experiments that are already in progress and also make it possible to carry forward any new pro-
jects that may be found desirable.

Report of the Standing Committee on Peaches,
Plums and Pears.
BY G. M. GRIFFING.
.ll r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I as chairman of the committee, ad-
dressed a letter to the two other mem-
bers of the committee, Mr. E. H. Hay-
ward, of DeLand and Mr. J. Y. McKin-
ney of Candler, asking if it was their wish that the report be made jointly, or if they wished to make a separate report and asked for suggestions, as neither of-
fered any suggestions or assistance, I pro-
ceed to prepare the following report.
Was quite in hope of getting some valu-
able assistance from these gentlemen as each are from sections where there is in-
terest taken in peach growing.
“In no line of business is there more need of Enterprise, and more problems to answer than in the growing and market-
ing of fancy peaches.” These were the words of Prof. M. B. \Vaite of the De-
partment of Agriculture, in opening his Address before the Georgia Horticultural Society at Dublin, Ga. in 1900. a man who has not only studied peach growing from a scientiﬁc standpoint, but from a practi-
cal as well, he owning large orchard in-
terests. Never was there a statement truer. Yet, where in all this vast country of ours can we ﬁnd a people better ﬁtted.
better qualiﬁed to master this branch of horticulture, and reach the maximum of results, than we ﬁnd in the Ranks of the Florida Horticultural Society. Men who have withstood the adversities and the disappointments that they have, yet who have come out victorous over all; certain—
ly will not acknowledge defeat and aban-
don an enterprise that has made our big sister States, Georgia and Texas famous.
It is true that we are farther from mar-
ket than our Georgia Brothers and that we do not have the famous Elberta va-
riety. These are slight disadvantages we will admit, but we have advantages that outweigh these many times. What are they? Well, I should not think that any true Floridian would ask that question.
It is some thing you all brag of and talk about. \Nhy just simply Florida climate that enables us to grow and market the
ﬁrst good peaches of the season offered to the American people, and we have this market all our own for from two to four weeks. Not only this, but in point of ﬂavor and carrying quality it is the best of the year, whether from Georgia. Tex-
as or Michigan. This is rather a broad statement, but before I am through I hope to prove it to your entire satisfac-
tion.
I do not mean that every neglected,
gnarly and diseased tree or orchard ot Jewell, Waldo, Imperial and other Flori-
da varieties is going to produce this su-
perb peach if left in that neglected un-

healthy condition. No most certainly not. What I do mean is that the orchard planted in soil adapted to the growth of peaches, that is well cultivated and cared for from the day it is planted, that is rightly fertilized and fruit properly thin-
ned, picked at the right stage of maturi-
ty, carefully handled, packed and ship-
ped under refrigeration, will vindicate the statement that I have made. It has done it for the Griﬁing Florida Orchard Company and will do it for others. If the same careful pains-taking attention is given to the growing and marketing that is given by our successful Horticulturist and trucker to the growing and market-
ing of oranges and the tender vegetable crops, that has proved the backbone and the chief support of our State. In the brief time allotted for the reading of this paper I am not going to attempt touching on the details of planting, pruning and cultivation, these are primary points known to all horticulturists.
What we want is to interest more peo-
ple in peach growing, then a few words about the selection of the orchard site,
the treating of the diseases, and last but not least, the harvesting and shipping.
We need ﬁve hundred carloads of Florida peaches a year to sufﬁciently in-
troduce them in the great markets of our country~ so that even a small percentage of the fruit eating, fruit loving people will learn to know, remember, and recog-
nize them and call for them from their fruiters so long as they are to be had in the markets. How many markets know them this way now? One! Just one!
Philadelphia is the only city that it can be said any perceptible number of the con-
sumers recognize the merits of our Flori-
da peach, and last year over forty cars of our Florida peaches were marketed there.
Each day leading the market. Many of these cars were held in storage from two to three weeks. I was on the market one morning when there was over thirty cars of Elbertas displayed and sold, and that morning two carloads of The Griﬁing Florida Orchard Company pack of Imper-
ial peaches were sold from the cold sto-
rage without the buyers even examining or looking at a crate at a price 25 cents above the price paid for the Elbertas on the dock. Why? Because these buyers knew that they had customers that would have no others so long as these lasted.
It is not my object to pit our Florida peaches against the famous Elberta or to encroach upon the season of the Elber-
ta in Georgia, Alabama or Texas, but I do want to condemn to everlasting doom,
that miserable class known as the Per-
sian type. comprising such varieties as Amsden, Alexander, Early Beatrice, and of the later introductions, Greensboro,
Triumph, Sneed, etc. As Downing once said of this class of peach “a peach quick to ripen and quick to rot.” In fact, they are green, ripe and rotten at one and the same time, the under or shaded side will be green. the side next to the sun and light will be ripe, and the blossom end rotten. Delightful conditions to ﬁnd in a fruit ‘to create and build up a demand for it. Yet, hundreds of carloads of this class of peaches are shipped from Georgia,
Alabama and Texas yearly. So soon as Florida produces sufﬁcient peaches to be really felt and known upon the market,
the demand for this class of peaches will cease and good Florida peaches will bring good prices with a strong demand. Ful-
ly ninety per cent. of the fruit eating peo-
ple supplied from our great markets do

not know that there are any good peaches until in July and August when the Elber-
tas and the later, better class of fruit is being marketed, and for that reaSon there is no strong demand in May and June.
A burned child dreads the ﬁre and will give it a wide birth after suffering from its effects. So also the careful housewife who after buying one or two lots of in-
ferior peaches with no quality, hesitates about trying another lot. Restaurants and Hotels will not put peaches on the menues until the Stewards know that there is a sufﬁcient supply of good fruit so that they can be sure to get it daily and in sufﬁcient quantities for their needs.
As the situation now exists. Florida peaches only reach the Cheap Dago fruit stand trade. There is no real life in most markets for our peaches and there will not be until sufficient quantities are pro-
duced for them to become an item in the markets.
If Florida produced from twelve to ﬁf-
teen hundred carloads of peaches a year the average price per crate would be fully
25 cents higher than has been realized.
The Secretary has a few account sales realized by the Grifﬁng Florida Orchard Company the past three years, which he will pass around for those interested to examine. These I consider fair prices and which will yield the owners of an orchard as great a percentage of proﬁt as any branch of fruit growing or truck-
ing. These account sales are taken at random, out of three years sales, we of course omitting those, that owing to de-
lays in transit, insufﬁcient or improper re-
frigeration caused the fruit to arrive in bad order, and covers the shipping season from early in june until late in July.

Cars selling in July came in direct compe-

ly every case sold from 25 to 50 cents per crate higher than the average Georgia stock. Sev-
eral cars were held in cold storage all of which came out in ﬁne condition.
We give the account sales of the last one taken out which sold on July 28th.
None of the Jewell variety is included in these cars. The Jewell would have commenced ripening about two weeks ear-
lier and would have prolonged the season that much. The Grilling Florida Orchard Company now has about 100 acres of Jewell at Komoko, all of which were killed by frost, and a hundred acres at Richland Pasco county planted this past winter. Another year we hope to move our ﬁrst cars by 10th to 15th of May.
As further evidence of the impression good Florida peaches make upon the mar-
ket will read the following extracts from letters from our Commission Men, the originals of which can be seen at the Sec-
retary’s desk.
PHILADELPHIA, PA., June 22nd, 1903.
GENTLEMEN: Car of peaches arrived last night, found them good color, but no larger in size than previous lot, selling fancies $2.25, choice $1.85, expect to ﬁnish the car at these prices. Very good demand and outlook favorable. Wired you situa—
tion. Sorry to know you have no more for immediate shipment, just got our cus-
tomers nicely started on this fruit, and could handle three cars a week to advan-
tage. Quite a good many Georgia peach—
es in today, mostly Carmen, W addells and Early River, fruit much larger than the Florida stock but not as good color or
ﬂavor, fancies selling $1.75 to $2.00 and choice $1.25 to $1.50. So you see your Florida peaches are bringing more than the best Georgias.
H. B. WILLIAMS, INC.
The following is copy of a letter H.
B. Williams wrote Mr. Frank Lindsey,
their representative, with reference to Florida peaches:
DEAR SIR: Have telegraphed you on peaches, Grifﬁngs car arrived. took out a portion. sold fancies $2.25 choice $1.85.
Good color but small compared with Georgia fruit. Had car from Hale Geor-
gia Orchard Co. their smallest grade much larger than the Florida fancies and selling at a lower price. Selling Hales Extra Fancies $1.75 to $2.00, fancies
$1.50, choice $1.25, so you see Florida fruit is bringing high prices compared with Georgia.

GENTS: Have no letter or wire from you today in reference to shipment of peaches; fear you did not get car off.
This is unfortunate as market continues active for your peaches. No trouble to get $2.50 for fancies and $2.25 for choice.
Outlook favorable. Our customers will want more of the Florida stock, while Georgias are larger they are not as good
ﬂavor as the Floridas.
H. B. WILLIAMS, INc.

JULY 21sr, 1904.
GENTS: We took one crate of the Im-
perial peaches out of Cold Storage to-
day, which had been put in there July
2nd, and it came out sound as a dollar.
If we had a car of them today could get two dollars for them. With a big crop of Imperial peaches, and a short crop in Georgia, twenty or twenty ﬁve cars of these peaches in storage they would sell like gold dollars. Their keeping qualities are excellent.
H. B. WILLIAMS, INc.

NEW YORK, JUNE 17TH, 1905.
GENTLEMEN : I want to state that it is a pleasure to handle goods put up in the style and careful manner which you ship in. The trade here recognizes that your brand of Florida peaches, is by far the best that comes from Florida. There will be no trouble in the future. of obtaining top of the market.
LYON BROS. C0.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., MAY II, 1905.
DEAR 51115: We are enclosing you a letter received from Mr. J. H. Hale on the conditions of the crop in Georgia.
One of our customers called on us and wanted to know if your crop was secured this year from the cold weather. When we assured him it was he has gone to the expense of twenty to twenty-ﬁve dollars in having a large sign painted across the front of his store “Headquarters for Grif-
ﬁng Peaches.” He has given us instruc-
tions that he wants IOO crates every day as long as you ship, so you see we feel very much encouraged over the inquiry we are having for your peaches.
H. B. WILLIAMS.

NEw YORK, JULY 25TH .1004.
GENTLEMEN: We have your several communications and it is very satisfac-
tory to us to have you express yourselves as being satisﬁed with the results, but,
we wish to state that a great deal of cred-
it for the results we obtained for your peaches is due to yourselves, for by the style of your packing and the delicious
ﬂavor of your peaches, caused the buy-
ers to seek for more and buy liberally.
They were at the top of the market every day we had them to offer. We can say honestly that the eating quality of your peaches were superior in ﬂavor and lacked that bitter taste from the skin that many of the Florida peaches had, that were on the market, and we can assure you that you can look forward to always having New York take your peaches at the top prices and as many as you can place on this market.
THE LYON Baos. Co.

PHILADELPHIA, JULY 8, 1905.
DEAR 51125: We wired you today to ship all peaches possible here. I enclose you a letter received from Mr. Hale today in which you will note he says about the peach crop there. This is contrary to

what he wrote us a few days ago in re-
gard to the situation, so they must have gone to rot very suddenly. You will no-
tice he says they are rotting green on the trees.
If your peaches arriving here Monday are in good shape and the Elbertas begin to show any rot here, we are going to put them in the cold room, because the last few cars of peaches you shipped us have been the ﬁnest you have ever shipped in the last few years and the trade are more than pleased with them. I could have sold tens cars today as easily 'as one at these prices. I never saw them any bet-
ter size and better color.
H. B. WILLIAMS.
I hope that I have now impressed upon your mind three things. First, that there is a good demand for Florida peaches,
Second, that if properly grown we have-
the best ﬂavored and best keeping peach of the year. Third, that there is money in it.
Now for the troubles and vexations.
And I assure you that the path of the peach grower is not strewn with roses.
Neither can he lay on beds of ease and wait for nature and our climate to bring forth fruit in abundance. Nature and climate if yoked together, and intelligent—
ly worked will produce wonders. But it wont answer to let them run loose.
Oh yes! they will continue to work. But as if vexed at your presumption in yoking
, them together, and working them for your beneﬁt’ they voluntarily enlist in the enemies forces. Nature has created an insect or a form of plant life to prey on and feed off of every other form of in—
sect or plant life in existence, and our cli-
matic conditions are such as to rapidly develop these forms of insect and plant growth which could be justly termed ene-
mies of mankind. Therefore if we would succeed in the cultivation of peaches,
plums and pears all of which are especial-
ly subject to these enemies, we must eith-
er stir ourselves and ﬁnd nature’s way of controlling them, either by parasitic or predacious insects or fungus, or ﬁnd arti-
ﬁcial means of combating them.
As the peach is the ﬁrst and most im-
portant of the fruits under consideration,
will dwell more at length on the troubles of the peach grower. It commences with the nurseryman at the time the pit is planted for no sooner is the little seedling fairly taken root, than an enemy is ready to devour it. This enemy is the Nema-
tode Angoulula, commonly called :root knot. For a remedy or a preventative from this nematode, we are forced to appeal to nature for no artiﬁcial means for controlling or eradicating praticable for the orchardist, has been discovered.
The preventative nature provides is the planting of the nursery or the orchard on virgin soil, not subject to washes from old ﬁeld land. This nematode, the An-
goulula, is present in all our light south-
ern soils, and only needs the presence of plant roots pleasing to his majesty’s pal-
ate for him to feed upon to multiply in myriads and so infest the land that a young peach tree, however healthy when placed there, cannot thrive. The only known means of eradicating this pest from the soil is heating it to a high de-
gree. or the saturation of the earth with bi—sulphide- of carbon as sugges-
ted by Mr. Bessey in his valuable pa-
per on Nematodes. This is sometimes practiced for potting earth for green-
house or bedding plants, but not practical

for the orchardist. Therefore the sim-
ple and effective preventative is to plant on virgin soils, free from washes from old
ﬁelds. \Vith this simple precaution, and planting trees free from the disease, no serious annoyance should be experienced from this source.
The next trouble likely to attract the peach grower’s attention, will probably be the borer. Many are the devices that have been invented and reme—
dies tried all of which have proven more or less a failure. Of these remediesl believe the Porter system of treatment the best and most practical. This system of treatment as invited by Mr. C. M.
Porter of Douglas, Ga. and offered by him in farm rights, consists of a series of mounding, worming and applying a caustic wash. We have tried it on our own orchards, and from present obser-
vation and status of experiment believe it of some value. The method of treat-
ment employed most largely in our own orchards and by many of the largest and most successful orchardists of the south,
is the banking around the trees to a height of eight to ﬁfteen inches in July and August, before the ﬂy deposits the egg on the body of the trees. This forces him to deposit the egg well up on the body. In the fall or early winter this dirt is removed,leaving the young larva in the body of the tree well up in the air, where the bark will harden as soon as the earth is removed causing many to perish.
Would also recommend after removing the earth, the scraping the body of the tree from the crown roots up to 12 or 15
inches in height with a sharpedged instru-
ment, this will disturb and kill many more of the young larva. The painting of the bodies from the crown to the limbs after the earth has been removed, with a strong caustic solution, will also be beneﬁcial in killing many of the larva and preventing others that hatch higher up or that have been knocked off from entering the bark.
After these precautions have been taken,
a few will likely have escaped, dig them out with the point of pruning knife, as soon as they show themselves by their signs, an excretion of a half gummy half sawdusty matter from the point where the young larva entered and commenced to feed, With these precautions no serious trouble or loss should be experienced from the borer.
The next annoyance noticed is likely to be Gall knots on the roots and crowns and which is generally accepted as Crown Gall and if it is the true Crown Gall, I consider that it has been much over-rated,
and especially so by some of the entomo-
'logists and pittiologists in some sections.
Mr. A. C. \Veiting Commissioner of Agriculture, Albany, N. Y. in an article in the National Nurserymen, in discuss-
ing Crown Gall said, “All Galls on the roots are not Crown Galls, a distinction between them may be made.” He fur-
ther said “the galls caused by aphids are usally knotty and very 'hard, while the Crown Gall is rather soft and as easily cut as a turnip. Its tissues being brain like in formation.” As the knots usually found on the peach trees are usually hard woody substance covered with- thick pul-
py bark and wart-like formation. I am very doubtful about the most of it be-
ing the true Crown Gall. This Gall knot has by some been confused with the root-
knot Angoulul'a, and by others with the black-knot of the cherry and plum of the states farther north. It is entirely dis-
tinct and different from the former, but

somewhat similar yet different from the latter. It seems to be caused from a fun—
gus which I believe is either always pres-
ent or develops spontaneously in much of our southern soil. This may be a lit-
tle radical and not in accordance with some of my professional friends’ views,
but I will give one of my reasons for the assertion and I believe the experience of those present, who may have had occasion to note same will sustain me. Natural peach seed can be gathered, and I believe if test wanted to be carried far enough,
sterilized sufﬁcient to kill any possible germs on the exterior of the pits, and planted in virgin soil, and a percent. will develop these gall knots. In some piec-
es of ground not one tree in 5000 will develop a knot, while in another plat,
or possibly in a different section of the same ﬁeld, one or even two per cent. may show it. The Marianna plum roots are especially subject to the attack of Gall knots. Cuttings from apparently healthy trees can be planted in any ordinary ﬁeld,
grown one year, and grafted the follow-
ing winter with scions of the desired variety taken from an equally healthy tree, and by digging time, one to ten,
sometimes as high as ﬁfteen percent. will develop gall knot. Now where did these knots come from if, the fungus causing same, was not either already present in the soil simply waiting for a suitable plant to establish itself upon or de-
veloped spontaneously. The loss from these Gall knots is usually small. As a remedy would advise removing the knots if they appear on the body or crown of the tree where they can be detected and the cut place moistened with a saturated solution of Blue stone water. They will never appear again at the place. If you get too much of the Sulphate of Copper
(Blue Stone) in the wound it may cause a dead place in the wood. I have seen these gall knots for twenty years, or ever since the ﬁrst work I did in a nursery,
even before our own nursery was found-
ed. I have seen the same in all portions of this State, in Georgia, Alabama and my brother reports the same in Texas.
I cannot see that it is any worse now than twenty years ago and do not believe that it will be any more serious in twenty years hence.
Will next consider the part in Florida peach growing played by the most wide-
ly known and widely disseminated scale insect of my knowledge. The San Jose Scale. The rapid spread and dissemina—
tion of this scale insect caused more ac-
tivity and discussion by Entomologists than all other scale insects and has caused many very stringent State and Foreign National laws to be enacted, some of which are now proving a menace to American fruit commerce. This scale pest while bad if allowed to run its own course, is easily controlled, either by natural enemies, the Red or Brown Fungus a native Florida Fungus dis—
covered by Prof P. H. Rolfs, now Director Florida Experiment Station,
Lake City, Fla., and the other the Chinese Lady Bird (Chilocorus Similis)
the Natural enemy of the San jose scale in China, or by artiﬁcial means. The most practical and successful artiﬁ-
cial means is the spraying of the trees once or twice during the winter months with lime, sulphur and salt mixture. Two applications during the dormant period is sufﬁcient to keep the scale under perfect control if not eradicating it until introduced again from Q

other infected trees. The following is the formula for the lime, sulphur and salt mixture and our method of prepar-
ing and applying it.
LIME, SULPHUR AND SALT MLXTURE.
Rock Lime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .21 pounds.
Flour of Sulphur . . . . . . . . . .15 pounds.
Salt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 5 pounds.
Water to make ﬁfty gallons.
The lime is placed in the cooking bar-
rel with about 10 or 12 gallons of water.
The steam is turned on, which agitates the lime while slacking preventing it from burning, and renders the slacking more perfect. After lime is thoroughly slack—
ed ﬁll barrel about one-half full of water.
Mix the sulphur into a paste, after lime is slacked add the sulphur paste and salt and boil vigorously for forty minutes.
The arranging of cooking plant I will be glad to explain to any one sufﬁciently interested to write or ask about it.
In spray machinery we have used everything from a knapsack sprayer to a traction engine and steam pump, the lat-
ter carrying 20 to 30 nozzles, except the gasoline power sprayer. The gasoline power sprayers have never appealed to us for two reasons, ﬁrst: The weight of en-
gine, pump and tank of water for cooling engine, neccessary to haul around, and second, the intricacy of the little engines and a scarcity of a class of help with a knowledge of gasoline engines that would care to work in as disagreeable work as spraying. When you have a days weath-
er, right for spraying you want the most reliable machine possible. The most prac-
tical we have yet found is the Wallace Sprayer, manufactured by Wallace Ma-
chinery Company. Champaign, Ill. The pump is driven by a gear from the wheel,
one extra mule or horse will pull the ex-
tra load occasioned by this gearing and maintain a pressure of from 90 to 120
pounds. For effective spraying a high pressure must be maintained. The trac-
tion engine outﬁt did good service, though do not know as it is an economical outﬁt,
the trouble came from the little annoy-
ances such as two or three of the nozzles out of a cluster of four or six becoming clogged, necessitating the stopping of the remainder of the twenty or thirty noz-
zles for these two or three to be cleaned.
With this steam outﬁt, an engineer, ﬁre-
man and six men could spray thoroughly one side of three rows of trees ranging from I2 to I 5 feet in height, about one half as fast as a man would natUrally walk up and down the rows, covering about ten acres a day. With the Wallace outﬁt three mules and three men would spray one side of one row at a little fas-
ter pace than the engine moved, in fact the team was kept moving slowly and steadily. \Vhile I do not know that the Wallace Sprayers would be practical in an orange grove, where a great amount of leaf surface is to be covered but for spraying peaches, while in a dormant con-
dition they are practical.
The curculio, curculio stung or wormy peaches and plums are found in every old peach growing section and in fact in near-
ly every plum thicket. Cures or remedies for this little rascal are few and difﬁcult,
preventatives are about our only hope.
Here are a few of them.
Plant your trees in a place as far dis-
tant from other peach and plum trees where you ﬁnd worms in the fruit, as possible. Keep all brush heaps, old rot-
ten logs. and such trash cleaned out

55,
from the orchard, and away from around it. Have if possible, a cleared and culti-
vated strip of ground from 150 to 200
feet between your orchard and uncleared woodland. Trash'and rough woodland harbors the curculio; in a large orchard you will invariably ﬁnd worms worse next to woods or near a pile of trash.
Jar the trees and pick up all fruit that drops off and also stung fruit found on the trees. This should be repeated every two weeks from the time that peaches are the size of a marble until lthey are ready to ship. Never allow a drop peach to be plowed under or decay in the orchard for in 99 cases out of 100,
it has a worm in it that will develop in-
to a beetle that will ruin a thousand peach-
es next spring. Jarring the trees and catching in a sheet or bug catcher the peaches that fall and also the beetles .(cur-
culio) that may play o’possum and drop off is an old method practiced by success-
ful plum growers in nearly all parts of the country, and by peach growers in many places. All the drop peaches that may have dropped the night or day or so before should also be picked up and de-
stroyed.
If these precautions are taken it will be years before sufﬁcient worms will de-
velop in an orchard to be a menace to the fruit. This year we are trying some spray experiments for curculio and next
‘year hope to be able to report the results.
Brown Rot Fungus (Moniha Fructig-
ina) is another pest that must be com-
bated by preventatives rather than reme-
dies, for by the time it makes its appear-
ance and you commence applying your remedy, the mischief is done. The pre-
cautions recommended forthe curculio are the principal ones in preventing Brown Rot. The removal of all decaying peaches is important. Especially the mummied peaches, that you may occasionally see hanging in the trees. Plow the orchard by blooming time every spring and be sure to stir the entire surface. This will disturb any mummied and decayed peach-
es that may have accidently been left in the orchard and prevent them from throwing up a lot of larger fungus growth in the form of toad stools that will throw off sufﬁcient brown rot fungus spores from a single mummied peach to in'-
fest the trees of a ﬁve acre orchard.
All caustic spray solutions are ‘good as fungicides, the lime sulphur and salt mixture is equal to almost any fungicide known and one or two sprayings during the winter to kill-
scale, will rid the trees of all fungus spores that may be carrying over on the trees, again if these trees are well spray—
ed and well covered with this caustic so-
lution, at blooming time the spores that may be thrown off from the toad stools in the spring cannot get a foot hold on the trees. Another precaution is to so fertilize and cultivate the trees as not to produce a heavy foliage, also trim all the trees so as to be open in the middle when carrying a load of fruit so as to admit as much air and light as possible.
This I believe covers a list of insects.
and fungus pests that cause the worst,
trouble to the peach grower. The same ones that we have here, trou-
ble them in the north also Georgia.
Alabama and Texas. Besides in the north and in portions of the other statesv mentioned they have peach yellows and rosette neither of which have ever‘been known within the state and either one of which is more serious that all of the pests

we have. Ours can be combated, peach yellow and rosette cannot. If they can make a success of peach growing in other less favored sections, are we to give it up and acknowledge that we are not as skil-
full horticulturalists as they.
Now for the harvesting and shipping.
First, you should plant sufﬁcient acre-
age yourself or organize an association in your neighborhood who would plant sufﬁcient acreage to load and ship in car-
load lots, about thirty acres of a variety is sufﬁcient for this, forty or ﬁfty would be better. Grade and pack all the fruit uniformly, being sure to have every crate so full that you could not get anoth-
er peach in the baskets. Separate the fruit
' and don’t put any cull fruit in the bottom of the baskets, let the bottom be as good or better fruit than the top. Use nothing to ﬁll up baskets but peaches. Excelsior either in top or bottom, paper used in any manner prevents ventilation, de—
ceives the buyer and makes a bad repu-
tation for your pack and brand. Have the fruit graded and packed by pro-
fessional fruit packers, it will cost you but little more and your pack is right.
Care in packing peaches is more im-
portant than any other fruit. In load-
ing your refrigerator cars, see that the ear is clean and that nothing ob-
structs the ventilators between the ice diests and the body of the car at each-
end both next to floor and at the ceiling.
This is necessary for circulation. Re-
member without circulation there will be no refrigeration. Load peaches as soon af-ter picking as possible and if you have to detaincar more than one day, arrange to get a ton and a half of ice to put in bunkers, so as to have them as full as pos-
sible when car leaves the orchards. Ar-
range with the railroad to have car re-
ice-d as soon after leaving the orchard as possible. Remember that the ﬁrst 24
hours after the fruit is placed in the car is the critical time. The fruit continues to ripen and mature until cooled and re—
frigerated to the pit. If car is poorly iced and it takes 36 or 48 hours for this refrigeration, the fruit has had that many hours of ripening process going on with-
in it. and it matters not how well the car is iced during the latter part of journey,
the damage is done and your fruit melts down almost as soon as it comes from the car. If good refrigeration can be had at ﬁrst and the fruit cooled to refrig-
eration point in from 6 to 12 hours, the iceing for the last part of the journey is not so important.
Experiments are being made in quick cooling of the fruit before the cars move,
by artiﬁcally circulating the cold air in the car, and by this means bring the fruit to a refrigeration point in from four to six hours. Fruit quickly cooled this way,
is claimed to hold up, an almost indeﬁnite time if temperature is kept reasonably low, and when taken of? the ice holds up almost as long as when picked direct from the tree.
I will not attempt to tell a Florida Hor-
ticulturalist how to market his fruit.
But would say that of all fruit, you should try to establish a reputation for your pack of peaches and I would say put enough of 'thern on one market so that your commission house at least knows that you are in the peach business.
Do not scatter your shipments a few crates in a place, on such shipments is where you are robbed by both express company and questionable commission men.

doubt many of you are already tired and as plums and pears are not generally enough grown for commercial purposes,
I will not attempt to say anything with reference to them. If however any mem-
ber knows of any plums of any special merit, it would be of interest to myself and dare say to others of the society, to hear about them. The same for pears.
Supplementary to regular report would say that a few days ago I sent out a cir-
cular letter, asking for information re-
lative. to present conditions of peaches in several sections of the state with refer-
ence to damage by frosts of March Ist and 22nd. Also about varieties grown in the several sections. The following is the essence of the replies received bear-
ing on these two points. Some mention was made in some of the replies relative to scale, gall knots and other troubles all of which I think have been covered by

70 to 80 per cent. The Imperial and other medium late varieties suffered very little, practically full crop. In the Baker county orchards near Macclenny, no Jew-
ells were planted. Waldos damages 60 to
75 per cent. Later varieties not hurt.
By studying the map of Florida you can see that the setion in which damage was done is comparatively small.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Henderson—As I have had a good deal of experience in peach grow-
ing, I think I can give some points that may be interesting. I used to think I could not raise peaches without spraying.
1 have an orchard of about 100 acres and last year we sprayed until I discovered what has proven to be a red fungus. At
ﬁrst I did not know what it was. I sent to the Experiment Station and found that I had this red fungus and I stopped spray-
ing. I wrote and asked some questions.
I asked if I could trust my orchard in the hands of this fungus if it was very slightly affected. The answer was that I could. The scale had practically killed
25 per cent. of my trees, but today I can-
not ﬁnd a single scale anywhere. The

scale is off and it was left in the hands of this fungus alone. Today I am very much more encouraged.
The San Jose scale is worse than any other scale, but there is no let up of the fungus until this scale is all off. I think this is one of the greatest things for the peach growers, in the State of Florida.
Take a limb with this fungus on it and it will spread in moist weather in twenty-
four hours and little orange colored pim-
ples show over the trees. As soon as it kills all the scale these become black spots on the tree, hence the name black fungus.
Mr. Griﬂ'ing.—I would like to ask if the trees were not pufting on new growth after this fungus had been on it.
Mr. Henderson—They are, after hav-
ing been cut back. All the trees that were affected with this scale have put on beautiful new growth and some branches are from ﬁve to eight feet long.
Mr. Wood—Should we cut back healthy trees?
Mr. Henderson—By all means. Those from ﬁve to six years old-
Mr. Wood—I cut back some of my trees, but those I did not cut back had more dense foilage.
Mr. Henderson—The fruit will be better next year. The best time to cut it back is just after the fruit is gathered.
say in July:
Mr. Ellis—What is the probable life of the peach orchard from the time it is planted.
Mr. Henderson—That depends on the class of land and the kind of tree planted.
If- planted with yellow subsoil, the orchard will be very poor and probably die after it has borne three or four crops.
If the tops were cut off and a new crop allowed to come on, it would probably bear from twelve to fourteen crops of fruit. The average crop is only from seven.t0 eight crops.
Mr. Wood—Would you advise clean culture.
Mr. Grifﬁng.—I would not, but would advise plowing each spring. Be sure to turn over every inch of the surface, then let it grow up in beggar-weed. The beg-
gar-weed will save fertilizer bills.
Mr. Ellis—On a‘ land naturally salt,
would it do for peaches?
Mr. Grifﬁng.——I would‘not think so.
If old land is to be used for planting a peach orchard, plant and grow velvet beans and beggar weed on it for two or three years before planting the peach trees, letting nothing else but these grow on the land. This will not only build up
'and fertilize the land, but will reduce the nematodes in the soil to such an extent that the young trees will become estab-
lished before the nematode sufﬁciently increases in numbers to injure the tree.
The nematode, may cause some of the trees to be short lived, yet fairly satis-
factory results may be expected.

Report of Standing Committee on Grapes, Figs
' and Kaki.
BY B. M. HAMPTON.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Fellow Members of the State Horti-
cultural Society of Florida:
For some reason beyond my ken, I have been appointed as chairman of the stand-
ing committee on grapes, ﬁgs and kaki.
While I have had Some experience with all of these fruits, I do not want you to think for one moment, that I consider myself as expert authority on any of them; but I suppose you expect something said on the subject, and so I will try and add my mite.
The grape and the ﬁg, as you all know.
are among the oldest fruits of which his-
tory gives us any record. “Under your own vine and ﬁg tree,” is as old as time itself. The vine especially is almost world-wide. Take, for instance, our own country. You will ﬁnd it ﬂourishing on the bleak and rocky hills of New England,
and ’mid the sunny glades of Florida,
as well as on the coral rocks of her thou-
sand keys or islands. One of the most valuable fruits known to man is the grape,
and no home, however humble, should be without its vine or more of the health-
ful grape.
Starting from the shores of the Cas-
pian Sea, you will ﬁnd it ﬂourishing in many lands and under many conditions of soil and climate. As I have already told you, it grows from New England to the southern extremity of the United States with more or less proﬁt; but up to the present time with less proﬁt in Florida than in most other sections where it ﬂour-
ishes. And as I said before, everyone should have a vine or two at least, for their own use. When you have a near-
by market, other things being equal, you can grow them with proﬁt in Florida; but as a bread-winner to be shipped to a dis—
tant market, I do not think it has proven a success.
I have known a number of vineyards to be planted in Florida, but for some reason they are soon dug up or alrandoned alto-
gether, thus intimating that commercial-
ly speaking, they were not a success. I myself planted about two acres some ten years ago. All went well until I came to sell them. For some reason the fabulous prices so often noted in the papers of Florida, did not pan out.
I planted a number of kinds of the Labrusca species or common grape grown in the North for wine or the table mostly
—all seemed to do well—also quite a number of different kinds of the Vini-
fera or raisin grape. Of the former spec-
ies, the White Niagara seemed to get the closest to ﬁlling the bill; thrifty. proliﬁc and a good quality, it is one of the most satisfactory grapes for Florida. Like the old speckled hen, it will give good returns with lots of neglect. Then the Vinifera

species or raisin grapes that are so ex-
tensively grown on the western coast, in California, for wine and raisins, whilst I have given them, that is, most of those grown on a large scale there, and some that are not, a trial, I have never found any that gave much promise of proﬁt;
though you can grow a few for home use,
and they are quite enticing for the novice to experiment with. You see glowing ac-
counts in the papers of this one or that one having phenomenal success with these choice varieties and promising to revolu-
tionize grape culture in Florida. You hear the report quite distinctly, but listen in vain for the echo.
There are two kinds of the Vinifera varieties that seem to be worthy of more extensive notice and also a trial. The one that I am acquainted with is the one known as the St. Augustine grape. It is thin of skin and of a good ﬂavor, quite thrifty and proliﬁc, ripening in July, bun-
ches are large, berries resembling the Ca-
tawba; but the bunches are not so compact.
It thrives in and around St. Augustine,
and is supposed to have been brought from NIarleria hv the Spanish in the early settle-
ment of the place. It seems to ﬂourish and fruit with as little care as the Scup-
pernong, but ripening so much earlier than the Scuppernong helps to extend the sea-
son for this fruit. Then at St. Augustine thev have a blackish-purple grape, pretty much the same as the above, and of the same family, but having larger berries and ripening when the other is about gone. It is quite proliﬁc. Both of them are supposed to come from Spain.
I traced their ancestry back for about one hundred years, and then it seemed to end;
but all agree that it was brought from Spain with the earliest settlement of St.
Augustine.
There is still another grape. said to grow on the Keys in and around Key West. I wrote to the board of trade of Key West about the grape, but failed to get any deﬁnite information.
From all I could learn, the grape is of the Vinifera species, and without a doubt came from Spain, though some say Eng-
land; but this I doubt. The vine is said to be quite a thrifty grower and quite a pro-
liﬁc bearer. The grape is as large or larg-
er than the Niagara. The fruit itself is reported to resemble the famed Malaga,
in color a reddish-purple, bunches large,
said to weigh from ﬁve to seven pounds.
Indeed, I have been told some of them have been known to weigh as much as twenty pounds; but I would advise taking quite a liberal pinch of salt with the state-
ment about the size and weight of these bunches. In fact, it would be well, per-
haps, to take a grain or so with the whole story. Mr. E. V. Blackman is the only one I have ever met that claims to have seen the grape, and he says he has seen the bunches that would weigh from ﬁve to twelve pounds each. Some years ago I had a talk with James Mott about this grape. He took a trip to the Keys par—
ticularly to ﬁnd this grape, and if I re-
member rightly, failed to do so. The vine is said to be quite tender, but in time this might be overcome. I think perhaps Mr. E. V. Blackman could give us some deﬁnite information, he being so close to where it is said to grow. I think it well worth further investigation than I have been able to give it.
Now as to the ﬁg. This is another fruit, if you will allow me to call it a fruit;
for really it is not a true fruit. That which we call fruit being the ﬂeshy recep-
tacle, of a conical form attached to the branch by the narrow end, the broad end

Be it ﬂower or fruit, it is of great value to man wherever the climate will permit of its growth—one of the most whole-
some and nourishing of the long list of fruits given to man, either fresh, canned or dried. I believe several kinds could be grown proﬁtable in Florida, both for home use and for canning and preserving I have grown various kinds with more or less success for the last twelve or ﬁfteen years on high pine land. I ﬁnd the White Marseilles, Brown Turkey, and the Bruns-
wick among the best for home use in Florida. By having these three you will always have ﬁgs in their Feason; but if you have a choice spot of ground, rich and moist; not wet, and feel willing to give the tree a little extra care, then plant a
\Vhite Adriatic, and it will abundantly pay you for all of your trouble; but it must have moisture and plenty of fertiliz-
er in some form. Plenty of good cow-pen manure is about. as good as anything Then you can supplement this with some good commercial fertilizer.
The ﬁg, like the grape,will grow readily from cuttings taken at any time when the tree is dormant and has shed its leaves.
November or December, I have found about the best time to clip the cuttings.
Either plant these at once or bury them until the beginning of February. then plant in good, rich soil, just leaving one or two buds above the ground and keep the ground moist until well-rooted—not wet, mind.
In writing these few lines on ﬁgs, I have taken it for granted that all of you know about them_ their culture and use.
I will just add that all of the kinds I have mentioned are good for all home purposes or for canning, preserving or drying. I have made ﬁne dried ﬁgs out of each kind;
but I prefer the White Adriatic. I have had this ﬁg to cure right on the tree. It is larger than the others when properly grown, and to my way of thinking, much better. It is greenish-white in color and has a thin, but exceedingly tough skin.
with a rich crimson sweet pulp, a ﬁne
ﬂavor, and is especially sweet—well worth the extra care you have given it. Every home in Florida should have at least a few trees for home use.
N 0w a few words on the Kaki or jap-
anese Persimmon, and I am done. This fruit, I think, will in time be of more pro-
ﬁt to Florida commercially speaking than either of the others. But in the ﬁrst place,
one should give them names, good Eng-
lish names, that all can pronounce without giving them the lockjaw. There is much in an attractive name. Give a fruit a pret-
ty sounding name, and the battle is about half won. This fruit is just in its infancy in this country; so that we have much to learn as to what varieties to grow and cul-
ture of same. Some say to give thorough g culture; others tell you just to fertilize and let alone. I have known them to do well under both culture and non-culture. I planted quite a grove of this fruit some years ago and gave it clean culture. The trees grew nicely, but I sold the grove be-
fore they came into bearing. and now I have but a few trees just coming into hear-
ing. These are on high pine land, with the usual grayish top-soil, yellowish or
‘ reddish sub-soil, underlaid with red clay.
at Lakemont, Polk county, Florida.
In some sections of Florida, particularly where I speak of, the japanese persimmon,
so far as I know, has been a shy bearer. I
_ have tried a number of years to get the Tannenashi to fruit, but to no purpose;
so ﬁnally I dug it up. This is a ﬁne fruit

-one of the best, and in many places fruits abundantly. It is a very large fruit, _
conical in shape, skin reddish-yellow, with few seeds—many fruit none at all—and a good shipper when not allowed to get too ripe before shipping. This variety is very attractive to the eye and as good as it is attractive; but for some reason I could never get it to fruit to amount to anything, though the wild persimmon fruited in abundance all around me; but because the Tannenashi would not fruit for me, I did not give it up, for some had trees in bearing of other varieties, but all had a good many seeds and all were of medium size—good to be sure—but not extra. But, at last in an obscure corner,
I noticed a tree that bore full crops every year. The fruit was large, tomato-shaped and of the deepest red in color, covered with a rich bloom like a plum, seedless and less astringent than most varieties,
and was of a ﬁner, richer ﬂavor than any fruit of the kind I had ever eaten, and I think that I have sampled all of the choice varieties around St. Augustine, the home of this fruit; for at this place they all seem to fruit without any trouble. I further noticed when a bud was taken from this particular tree, which for want of a better name, I shall call “Hampton’s Choice,”
simply to designate it from others (I have '
tried in most of the catalogues to locate this variety, but so far have failed,) and budded on a Tannenashi that refused to hold its fruit, that branch would be full of fruit while the rest of the tree would have but few or none. It will thus appear that the “Hampton’s Choice” was immune to that which caused the Tannenashi to drop its fruit.
()11 the high, sandy land at Lakemont.
as yet I have but two or three trees in bearing. They were grafted on the wild,
small stock three years ago the past season and bore full crops of fruit last season and this; however, the trees are but from four to six feet high and had but little care. I have been away from my grove most of the time for the past two years I have gathered this fruit when fully colored and kept it in the house for even four weeks, and at the end of that time it was sound and as ﬁne in quality as a per.
simmon ever gets. The past fall of 1905
I gathered among others, one fruit that was quite hard and only partly colored.
This was early in November, and this fruit was kept until Christmas without showing any signs of decay. Then it was in good condition to eat and was good as one could ask it to be, thus proving its keeping and shipping qualities. The fruit is large, fr0m two to three inches in diameter and of the deepest red and en—
tirely seedless, never having found a sin-
gle seed in a fruit. Yet I do not know of any persimmon so highly colored that can be eaten when as solid as a good, ripe ap-
ple, and then lacking in the astringent qualities that other persimmons would have at that stage of ripeness.
While this persimmon may have been grown by some for years, certainly I have never been able to locate it among others on the fruit stands in Floridaf I sometimes think, however, it is simply the section it is grown in that makes it appear different from some of the listed varieties. But one thing is sure, it is the persimmon par excellence for the high,
pine land, and the one of all others I could plant on such land for proﬁt or home use.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. Grifﬁng.——I would like to hear
'from Mr. Macklin who has had some ex-
perience in growing persimmons.
Mr. Macklin.—As I read a paper before

64 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
this society last year on this subject I did not expect to say anything at this meet-
ing. Nevertheless there are a few re-
marks I would like to make.
I most heartily endorse the remarks of Mr. Hampton, in the paper just read,
on the use of the word “kaki.” \Ve do not call an orange a peach, or a pineapple by its botanical name and I see no reason why we should do so with the persimmon.
We have a good English name for the fruit so why not use it. I would very much like to see that the word “kaki”
discontinued in the reports of this society.
I have been at considerable pains for several years past to introduce this fruit into northern markets as the Japanese persimmon and if I have to begin all over again with “‘kaki” I shall despair of success.
Up till this season I was under the im-
pression that the persimmon was so late blooming as to be immune from frost but this spring a frost on March 21st damag-
ed the crop considerably.
As regards markets, some places will have them while others will not. In New York they sell fairly well, yet Boston which is only a short distance away, will not give a paying price for them. It looks as though the Bostonians were too conservative and would not eat anything that is new. Since reading a paper on persimmons here last year my orchard of the Haycheya variety shows signs of in-
creasing its crop with the increased age of the trees.
Mr. Griﬁing.-—Is the Yemon variety holding its fruit as well as the others.
Mr. Macklin.—-I have only three varie-
ties in commercial quantities, the Hya-
kume, Tannenashi, and Haycheya, the Tannenashi I ﬁnd to be the best.
Mr. Henderson—We can have the per-
_simmon so long that I think there are few fruits better. We can have them from the ﬁrst of August until March. I have only six varieties- The Tannenashi is the best I have. They are of a large beautiful shape and carry well, better than any I have. I kept some of them until after Christmas and they were per-
fect. I think we should have more Japan-
ese persimmions and grapes.
Mr. Grilling—I would call attention to the fact that we may use the persim-
mon to good advantage in diversifying our products. The Japanese persimmon is the very best food for hogs. There is one variety the Zengi that ripens and commences dropping in August and con-
tinues until December. Hogs are very fond of these and will fatten on them.
Mr. Steele—In their report on ﬁgs.
there are two varieties left out that have proven to be very good with me. The Celeste. the little sugar ﬁg, as it is called is always to be desired. The Poulette ﬁg is one of the best that I ever tasted.
Mr. Blackman—Some four or ﬁve years ago there was quite a stir about the Key grape. At several different times there were brought to my ofﬁce, bunches that weighed from 3 to 5 pounds each.
and much larger bunches have been known to be produced. So far as we know they are a very good grape; but will not compare with some of the ﬁner va-
rieties. There is one diﬂiculty regard-
ing this grape, the berries do not ripen evenly and the vines are short lived. I know one party who secured a good many cuttings, all of which grew for a time and then died. Rev. Bolton of Cocoanut Grove at one time had a number of vines in fruiting; but they have since died out.

Report of Standing Committee on Pineapples and Other Tropical Fruits.

MANGOES.
BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Among the tropical fruits that are be-
ing introduced into Florida, no one is more certain to make a deﬁnite impres-
sion upon the market than the new man-
gos. The fruit produced by the mulgoba exhibits such a character that it will push its way into the market were it to com-
pete with peaches; but fortunately it rip-
ens just ahead of that crop, and so we will not be thrown into actual competi—
tion with this luscious fruit. The mul-
goba budwood can now be had in almost any quantity that any one desires in Flor-
ida. There is still some difﬁculty ex—
perienced in propagating and setting out the trees. From my experience in this matter I am inclined to believe that we shall have to adopt methods for the pro-
pagation and setting out of these trees that are radically different from those practiced in setting out citrus trees. As citrus growers we are apt to make this our standard, and anything that does not conform to the methods of procedure that we have adopted for growing citrus trees is considered to be extra difﬁcult, or else not worthy of attention. We are also apt to draw a long breath when the nur-
seryman confronts us with a price for these trees that is probably ten times as high as that of citrus trees. Here again we allow our standard to interfere with our business methods. We should re-
member that mulgoba trees are really rari-
ties.
PROPAGATING.
Budding of mangos is not only pos-
sible but may be done proﬁtably. The mango nursery, however, must be radi-
cally different from that of the citrus nursery. For general purposes I think the methods advised by Mr- John 'B.
Beach, and which he has published re-
peatedly in the agricultural papers, and also in addresses to the Horticultural So-
ciety, are probably familiar to every one here, so I will not take them up again at this point.
AREAS ADAPTED TO MANGOS.
If we will examine the map of Florida we will see that all of that area on the East Coast south from Mangonia and on the West Coast south from Caloosahat-
chee River, is adapted to mango growing.
In addition to this general area there are isolated areas to the north of this in which mangos can be grown with a fair degree of assurance that crops will be obtained.
Several years ago a considerable number of mango trees were fruited in the vici-
nity of St. Petersburg. In this region there are trees sufﬁciently large to pro-
duce a considerable quantity of fruit.
Various places on the Manatee River are also quite certain to produce paying quan-
14—5

nties of mangos. I will not attempt to enumerate further the isolated localities where mangos may be yrcwn. To :1
large extent this will have to be deter-
mined by actual experiments. In a gen-
eral way we may say, however, that wherever citrus fruits may hang on the free all the winter and never become frost-
ed it will be possible to grow the mango.
This deﬁnition for a region in which mangos can be grown should not be taken too strictly as we know that under cer-
tain peculiar conditions a few citrus fruits pass winter in orchards where the greater bulk of the fruit is frosted.
We are hopefully looking forward this year to the fruiting of Alphonse mangos.
This variety is said to be very much bet-
ter than the mulgoba. To us who have eaten the mulgoba, however, this sounds like sweetening honey or perfuming the rose.
MANGO RACES.
The mango. so far as I have examin-
ed the fruits critically. seem to group themselves into the following races: 1st,
The Number Eleven; and, The Pineapple;
3rd, The Manilla; 4th, The Apricot-Ap-
ple; and 5th. The Bombay.
First. The Number Eleven group,
which is composed of seedlings running to well-marked varieties, is early ripen-
ing, ﬁat fruit, and long tapering fruit,
weak ﬁbre. but profuse; color. pinkish or reddish. Tree tall upright growing.
The leaves medium smooth and veining not prominent. Stigmatic area even.
Skin medium and not tough.
Second. The Pineapple group, is early ripening. Leaves medium, smooth and veining not prominent. Stigmatic area prominent early ripening. The fruit medium size, tapering to obtuse point at stigmatic area; ﬁbres medium, profuse;
color light orange with strawberry cheeks:
skin medium and rather strong.
Third. The Manila, which is said to be the same as the Philippine of Cuba,
ripens early; ﬁat fruit; tapering; long;
ﬁbres very weak and scanty. Color, lem-
on or a little darker. It ripens about the same time as the pineapple, and many hy-
brids. and all intergradations were seen,
but the two types are very distinct. Skin very thin but tough.
Fourth. The Apple-apricot group con-
tains a number of named varieties. The tree is of a low, spreading growth.
Leaves rather short. Fruit ripens late Very full at side. Very short. Stigmatic area well up on ventral side. Color uni-
form yellow; between orange and lemon.
Fibres very coarse and strong, though scattered. Skin thick and tough.
Fifth. Bombay, including mulgoba.
Late ripening; fruit short for its diame-
ter; sides very full; stigmatic surface well up on ventral surface; frequently grooved along lower portion of ventral surface; ﬁbres scant and very weak; con-
ﬁned mostly to ventral and dorsal sides:
skin very thick; not leathery; ground color, green turning to yellow with rosy check. The tree is a vigorous grower and is between upright and spreading.
and the leaves are rather small and rigid with the veins prominent.
AVOCADOS.
For a money crop in the sub-tropical region of Florida. this has a very prom-
ising outlook. During the last ﬁve years a very great amount of work has been done in systematizing the vari-
eties and in working up the methods of propagation. In connection with this work, I may be allowed to say that among

the avocados as among the citrus vari-
_eties, we strike some that are particularly difﬁcult to bud, and others that take very readily. Buds of the Chapellow avocado live with the greatest ease. The Trapp avocado does so somewhat less readily;
the Pollock buds fairly easily. and the Baldwin requires considerable attention to work well. The family avocado is one which begins to ripen in July, and continues to ripen its fruit until late in October and November. It should not be planted for commercial purposes, but is one well worth having at the home place.
TRANSPLANTING.
Lately a great deal has been said about the difﬁculty of transplanting avacados. Just why this should occur,
I do not know. I know that a certain disease occurs upon the young trees,
which is especially apt to strike in at the point where the stock is cut off.
This difficulty can be avoided to a con-
siderable extent by waxing over the stock at this point when it is cut off, or by painting it over. Then the shock of trans-
planting is apt to prove somewhat severe and the tree apt tO die back to the bud.
In my own ﬁeld there seems to have been no difficulty in planting avocado seed-
lings. As a matter of fact, I have turned this work over to colored labor, and the success met with has been somewhat bet—
ter than the experiences in having col-
ored labor set out citrus trees. From my experience in this matter I am inclined to believe that there is no greater difﬁculty in having avocados set out than in having citrus trees set out. '
SA PODILLOS.
This is one of the fruits that origi-
nated in the Western Hemisphere. In fact, it has not been domesticated in the true sense of the word. A few seedling trees have been planted out in the Antil-
lian region, which includes the West In-
dies, the eastern portion Of Mexico, the eastern coast of Yucatan, and in the southern portion of Florida. They also occur as native trees down through the central portion of Mexico, and I believe in South America.
This species adapts itself to cultiva-
tion very readily. The number Of vari~
eties, however, are about as great as the number of seedlings that come into bear-
ing. In the Miami and Key West market a very careful distinction is made between the better and the inferior fruits. In Miami some of the largest and ﬁnest of this fruit sell for high as ten cents apiece,
and the smaller varieties one can fre-
quently buy at ten cents a dozen. Syste-
matic work at propagating and improving sapodillos has already begun at the Sub-
tropical Laboratory.
The region through which sapodillos may be grown successfully, is practical-
ly coincident with. the region where the mango may be grown.
CERIMAN.
(Monstera deliciosus). This plant be—
longs to the peculiar family of aroids which includes the calla lily, the tania and various other tropical species the roots Of which are used for food.
This plant has been grown for a number of years and fruited in the vicini—
ty of Miami; also at Mangonia. In the conservatories of the North, it has also been fruited repeatedly. In the regions where only a little frost occurs, and freez-
es are never known, this plant can be grown successfully under a pineapple shed.
It produces a creeping trunk that is about four inches in diameter, and if permitted,

will grow on the wall to the top of the highest conservatories. In such positions the trunk is rarely more than one and one-half to two inches in diameter. For fruiting purposes, however, it is better to prevent the vine from climbing at all.
Under pineapple sheds it blooms profuse-
ly, and it fruits rather abundantly. Every bloom is almost certain to make a fruit.
PROPAGATION.
For propagating purposes the trunks are cut into segments in such a way as to leave an eye on each segment. These segments are planted out and struck with a fair degree of success. In the course of two or three years, if these plants are well cared for; they will produce fruit. It is about I4 months from the time of bloom-
ing for the fruits to ripen.
TYESS.
This is also sometimes called egg-fruit.
N o systematic effort has yet been made to bring this fruit into the best state of cul-
tivation. Only seedling trees have fruit and the product of these is exceedingly variable—good, indifferent, and bad, I think the extreme of inconsistency was met in this fruit in the tree which was fruited by Prof. Gale, at Mangonia. This tree fruited abundantly and gave a ﬁne-
looking specimen. Some of them were sweet and delicious, other fruits from the same tree were only indifferent, and some of the fruits growing on the same tree.
and taken from among the good fruits were extremely bitter. Even the same fruits were somewhat variable; one side being quite palatable while the other side would be distinctly bitter.
THE LOSS OF PLANT FOOD IN PINEAPPLE AND OTHER COARSE SANDY SOILS.
BY A. \V. BLAIR.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
A very interesting point which has been brought out by the pineapple fertilizer ex-
periment, is the great discrepancy be-
tween the amount of plant food applied to an acre of pineapples and the amount that is acutally removed by the crop taken from an acre, inculding fruit. slips and suckers.
AN UNBALANCED ACCOUNT To illustrate, we may ﬁrst take one of the plots from the experiment, which has been fertilized at the rate of 3750 pounds per acre. This plot received annually one pound of actual phosphoric acid, one and one fourth pounds nitrogen and two and one half pounds of actual potash. Multi-
plying these ﬁgures by 150 (the plots be-
ing 1-150 of an acre in size) gives to one acre I50 pounds of actual phosphoric acid.
187 I-2 pounds of nitrogen and 375
pounds of actual potash, or 712 1-2
pounds of actual plant food in one year.
Now, if we allow that this acre pro-
duces 500 crates of pineapples, each weighing 70 pounds net, the amount of plant food removed by this 35,000 pounds of fruit would be, as calculated from the


## p. 69 (#249) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. @
average of a number of analyses, 15
pounds actual phosphoric acid, 25 pounds nitrogen and 79 pounds of actual potash,
or a total of 119 pounds of actual plant food.
This does not take into account that which is removed with slips and suckers,
which unfortunately has not yet been de-
termined, but allowing that these would remove as much as the fruit, which is,
I believe, an exceedingly liberal allow-
ance, there would be removed from the acre a total of 238 pounds of plant food against 712 1-2 applied, a loss somewhere amounting to 474 1-2 pounds—66.6 per cent.
To take a more familiar instance, the grower who puts on 3000 pounds per acre of a fertilizer which would analyze 4 per cent. available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent.
ammonia, and 7 1-2 per cent. potash, ap-
plies 120 pounds actual phosphoric acid,
123 pounds nitrogen and 225 pounds ac-
tual potash, or a total of 468 pounds of actual plant food, and if he gathers 350
crates of pineapples per acre, which would be a good average yield, he removes from his soil 10.36 pounds actual phosphoric acid, 17.32 pounds nitrogen, and 55.26
pounds actual potash or a total of about
83 pounds of plant food from the acre.
If here, as before, we allow that slips and suckers taken off, remove an amount equal to the fruit, the total amount re-
moved in this case would be 166 pounds against 486 applied, a loss somewhere of
302 pounds—64. 5 per cent. But this pro-
bably does not represent the entire loss,
for in many instances there is added, over and above what has been counted, some phOsphoric acid which is not reckoned as available, but which, nevertheless, does become slowly available, and undoubted-
ly some of this would be lost.
WHERE THE BALANCE GOES.
Now what becomes of this lost plant food? If it remained in the soil within reach of the plant, the soil would increase in fertility more rapidly than it does. We are driven to the conclusion that the greater part of it is carried down by the rains and is ﬁnally lost in the water table below. Perhaps a small amount of the nitrogen escapes into the air.
A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION.
In an effort to explain this unprecedent-
ed loss, for certainly in no other ﬁeld crop is the percentage of loss so great,
I have recently conducted some experi-
ments to show the rate at which water percolates through different types of soils,
and the consequent loss of plant food.
And while it is true that the conditions in the laboratory were not the conditions that exist in the ﬁeld, still the results are relative, and serve in a way, to illustrate what takes place in the soil.
Four glass tubes of equal size were taken and one end closed with perforated disc and ﬁlter paper, thus retaining the soil but allowing a solution to pass through. Into each was placed air dried soil as follows: No. I, 150 grams (be-
tween ﬁve and six ounces) of South Car-
olina clay soil; No. 2, 150 grams Colum-
bia Co. virgin soil; No. 3, 150 grams of typical pineapple soil, and No. 4, 150
grams of muck soil. Into each was pour-
ed 100 cubic centimeters (a little less than a gill) of water containing one gram of sulphate of ammonia, and the following observations made:
1) Time required for the solution to begin dropping through. '
(2) Time of completion.

This emphasizes very forcibly the fact that the coarser the soil, the more rapidly the water and plant food get away, and it perhaps gives us a clearer idea of the conditions which exist in the pineapple belt. There we have a very coarse soil.
composed of almost pure sand, through which water runs almost as it would run through a pile of stones, carrying much of the soluble plant food with it. The question then arises. what is there about clay soils, and other ﬁne soils, to hold plant food and moisture, that is wanting in the pineapple soils?
THE WORK OF OTHER INVESTIGATORS.
The researches of Way and other emi-
nent investigators have shown that most soils have an absorptive power with re-
ference to plant food.
In the case of phosphoric acid this is not difficult to explain, as the acid forms insoluble compounds with the iron, lime.
and magnesium. which are present in most soils, and is in turn rendered slowly available by the action of the solutions contained in the roots of the plants.
As to the absorption of the alkalies,the explanation is more difﬁcult, since nearly all their‘compounds are readily soluble in water; the potash salts for example. Since most soils consist of sand, clay, and or-
ganic matter, Way went to work to de~
termine which of these constituents ex-
ercised the absorptive power. Without describing in detail his methods it will sufﬁce to say that he showed that clay alone is capable of absorption phenomena.
(It should be borne in mind that the term absorptive power as used here re-
fers to a chemical change, and not to phy-
sical absorption as when a sponge absorbs water).
Having shown that clay was the main constituent in a soil which caused the absorption of alkalies, Way next tried to trace out the particular compound which caused the absorption, and ﬁnally suc-
ceeded in producing a hydrated silicate of aluminum and soda which exhibted dis—
placement and absorptive properties very similar to those shown by the soil.
Then Eichorn hit upon the idea of try-
ing natural hydrated silicates, or zeolites


## p. 71 (#251) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 71
and found that they exhibited the same power as Way’s artiﬁcial ones. Other investigators have shown that the absorp-
tive power bears a close relation to the amount of soluble silicates present. That is to say the absorption of salts of the alkalies, accompanied by the change of base, is due chiefly to the presence of zeolitic materials in the soil.
There is besides this purely chemical absorption of salts by the soil, a physical absorption, which is illustrated by the ab—
sorption of water containing dissolved salts, by the organic matter of a muck soil; even sand will hold back a limited amount of dissolved salts. but the amount is in proportion to the ﬁneness of the soil, and that it is held in a merely me-
chanical way can be‘demonstrated from the ease with which it is washed out.
IMPORTANCE OF THE ABSORPTIVE POWER OF THE SOIL.
The importance of this absorptive pow-
er can scarcely be estimated. Houston and Goss formerly of the Indiana Station,
have pointed out that by means of this power those mineral ingredients of plant food of which most soils contain but lit--
tle, referring more especially to phosphor-
ic acid and potash, are held in a form too insoluble to allow of rapid loss by drain-
age, and still soluble enough to answer the needs of vegetation, provided the store is large enough. This cannot, how-
ever, be said to apply to nitrogen in the form of salts of nitric acid, but here na-
ture has made. a wise provision for this element by binding it in the form of or-
ganic bodies which nitrify ‘but slowly,
and by supplying each year a small amount from the atmosphere. Houston and Goss concludetheir discussion of the importance of soil absorption with the fol-
lowing statements: “By means of the ab-
sorptive power of soils, the farmer if he puts on an excess of potash and phos-
phoric acids as a fertilizer, does not lose it, but is able to reap the beneﬁts from it in the next year’s crop: If it were not for this power the best method for apply-
ing fertilizers would be a much more complicated problem than it is at present,
' as it would be necessary to apply them at just the proper season and in nicely re-
gulated amounts to insure against loss.”
PINEAPPLE SOILS LACKING IN ABSORPTIVE POWERS.
Of course Houston and Gross did not have in mind such soils as the East Coast pineapple soils when they wrote this, for we have there just the conditions which they say would make the problem of fer-
tilizer application much more complicated than it is, and make it necessary to apply them at just the proper season and in nicely regulated amounts to insure against loss. ‘
We have there a soil which is practi—
cally devoid of clay and therefore of sol-
uble silicates; which contains only traces of iron, lime and magnesia, and a com-
paratively small amount of organic mat~
ter but which is, on the other hand,
98 to 99.5 per cent. sand—much of it being very coarse sand—hence there are wanting nearly all thgse properties which in ordinary soils would effect the absorp-
tion of soluble plant food, and instead of being held there in a form suitable for uti-
lization by the plant roots, it is there in quite soluble forms, and as the rains come it goes down and down into the soil' wa-
ters below. Only that portion is stored

up which the roots actually get hold of,
and that which is mechanically held, and in such coarse sand, the amount mechani-
cally held is quite small as has been dem-
onstrated by leaching tests.
Even organic fertilizers such as bone meal, cottonseed meal, dried blood and castor pomace are slowly converted into soluble forms in the soil, and on account of the almost entire absence of those substances which produce absorption phe—
nomena (a binding of soluble plant food)
a large part of this soluble plant food, if not used at once by the plants, goes down with the ﬁrst rain that comes.
VALUE OF SLOWLY AVAILABLE MATERIALS.
However, there is a great advantage in using these slowly available forms over the readily soluble forms, for all the while that they are thus being made available,
the plants are being beneﬁted, and the ex-
cess to be carried away by percolation is not so great.
I believe one of the merits of slag phos-
phate lies in its somewhat insoluble, but nevertheless slowly available form of phosphoric acid. When applied from year to year, a small amount is being ren-
dered available all the time, and at the same time no very great amount is lost by percolation. I further believe that if we could get a more slowly available form of potash for such soils, the problem of fertilizing pineapples would be simpliﬁed and the expense reduced. The good re-
sults obtained with tobacco stems might possibly be attributed to the fact that the potash becomes slowly available, and thus in the end is nearly all taken up by the plant.
PLANT FOOD AND CAPILLARY ACTION.
But some one asks, may not much of this lost plant food be recovered and brought within reach of the plant roots by the capillary action of the soil mois-
ture?
If the soil were a clay or a clay loam the answer would certainly be in the at-
ﬁrmative, but in such coarse sandy soils the conditions are very different. It is a well-know physical fact that when three tubes of different internal diameters are placed open end in water, the water will rise highest in the smallest tube, that is the smaller the tube the greater the capil-
lary action. So with the soil, the ﬁner the particles the greater the capillary action,
and as the particles of sand composing the pineapple soils are very large in com-
parison with the particles that make up.
clay soil, so the amount of water_ and hence of plant food, brought up from a deep soil by capillary action is correspond-
ingly smaller. Hence it is that plant food when once lost in 'the waters of the sub-
soil, are recovered but slowly and with great difﬁculty by capillary action. This was well illustrated by another experi-
ment conducted in our laboratory.
Over the end of a glass tube of about
3-4 in. internal diameter, was tied a piece of muslin cloth, and into the tube was placed the pineapple soil to a depth of 12
in. The tube was then suspended so that the end over which the cloth was tied just touched the surface of distilled water con-
tained in a beaker. At the end of three days the highest point at which the soil had been moistened by capillary water was 3 3-8 in. The same experiment was tried with the Columbia Co. soil, and the S. C. clay soil with the result that at the

end of the three days the Columbia Co.
soil was moistened to a height of 8 3-8 in.,
and the S. C. clay soil 10 7-8 in. In each case the tube was weighed with the dry soil, and again at the expiration of the three days. The pineapple soil retained
8.9 grams of water, the Columbia C0.
soil 23.4 grams. and the S. C. clay 27.2
grams or a little more than three times as much as the pineapple soil. This indi-
cates very clearly the difference in cap-
illary action. In the pineapple soils the grains are large and as a consequence many of the spaces between them are too large for capillary spaces.
To illustrate in another way, if you could put these grains of sand together into the form of a lamp wick, you would still have a very poor medium for lifting oil, but if the wick be made of ﬁne par-
ticles of asbestos, which is also a mineral,
the oil is raised without difficulty and a good ﬂame is the result.
SOME REMEDIES SUGGESTED.
Then is it possible to do anything to prevent this great loss of plant food?
Certainly it is not possible and perhaps not desirable to convert the sandy soils into clay soils, nor even to mix with the sand a small percentage of clay.
I will mention a few ways that have suggested themselves to me.
(1) By increasing the amount of or-
ganic matter in the soil.
It is a well established fact that organic matter acts as a sponge to hold moisture,
and in holding water it will hold plant food. This was well illustrated in the experiment with the soil. 150 grams of an air dry muck soil retained over 100
grams of water, and 90.9 per cent. of the sulphate of ammOnia. Whereas the same weight of the pineapple soil retain-
ed only 30 grams of water and 5.77 per cent. of the sulphate of ammonia. Old pineapple plants and other organic matter might be allowed to decay on the ﬁelds in-
stead of being burnt. In some cases it might be possible to increase the organic mat-ter by spreading seaweed and muck soil over the ﬁelds. Other ways will doubt-
less suggest themselves to those interest-
ed. O-f course the pineapple grower can-
not resort to cover crops such as velvet beans, cow peas, beggar weed etc., as can the man who grows ordinary ﬁeld crops.
(2) By the use of wind breaks.
Currents of dry hot air passing over the ﬁelds cause the surface moisture to evaporate rapidly, thus to a certain de-
gree breaking the chain of capillary mois-
ture.
(3) By the addition of lime to the soil.
Lime coagulates the soluble nitrogen-
ous matter of manures and fertilizers, and this coagulated nitrogenous matter tends to make the soil more retentive of mois-
ture; moreover lime, before it is carried very far down would probably begin to bind the grains of sand together and thus form a layer somewhat impervious to the downward movement of the water.
In the use of lime, however. care must be exercised that it be not applied in such a way as to cause the loss of ammonia from other materials,
(4) By using materials which become slowly available.
For such a crop as pineapples where the plants remain in the ground from year to year, there would seem little reason for using quickly available materials except say for the ﬁrst 18 months to get the plants started, even had we a soil that was capable of absorbing and holding the plant food.

After a certain amount of these slowly available materials have been added to the soil, some plant food is being rendered available all the time, and as the roots are there ready to utilize it——perhaps al-
most as rapidly as it becomes available—
not so much is lost by seepage to the soil waters below. It seems to me, too that this might apply to the fertilization of orange trees.
(5) By shading.
Shading undoubtedly conserves soil moisture, and if we can retain the soil moisture near the surface, it not only means more water for the plant, but it also means more water, and with it more plant food, brought up from the deep sub-
soil by capillary action.
In the light of the evidence before us I am strongly inclined to the belief that it would be economy to fertilize pineap-
ples from four to six. instead of two to three times a year. I am aware that this is not in accord with recommendations made in the recent bulletin on fertilizer experiments with pineapples, but at the time those recommendations were made we had not discovered that the loss of plant food on pineapple soils was so great If you should give to your horse at one time, food enough to last him one week, you would expect much of it to be wasted; so, if you give to your pineapples at one time, plant food enough to sustain them six months, and there is nothing in the soil to bind or absorb this plant food,
so that it may be given out again gradu-
ally, there must necessarily be much loss.
At present I know of no experimental evidence on which to base such a state-
ment. but reasoning along the lines indi-.
cated, I am of the opinion that 2000
pounds of fertilizer applied at intervals of two or three months would be as ef-
fective as 3500 pounds of the same material in two applications.
There is, however, the difﬁculty that the extra expense of frequent applications might outweigh the cost of the extra fer-
tilizer required in the case of two applica-
tions. This of course could be determin-
ed by experiment, and as the Chairman of the Committee on Fertilizers and Irriga-
tion points out in his paper, it would no doubt be a proﬁtable ﬁeld for investiga-
tion along other lines than pineapple growmg.
SOME NOTES ON THE PINEAPPLE EXPERIMENT AT JENSEN.
BY A. W.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
A bulletin giving full account of this experiment up to and including the crop for last year has recently been published by the Experiment Station, and will very soon be distributed, but I trust that I may I BLAIR.
not be out of place here, if I sketch brieﬂy the object and plan of the experiment,
mention some of the more important re-
sults obtained, and perhaps raise some questions which it may be proﬁtable for pineapple growers and others to consider.

In the beginning, I wish to accord to Prof. H. K. Miller full credit for the part he has had in this work. He plan-
ned the experiment and had immediate supervision of it for three years, and on his retiring from Station work, the writer,
who was associated with him during this time, was placed in charge, and has endeavored to carry to lcompletion the plans which Prof. Miller projected. Much credit is also due Mr. W. R. Hardee,
whose hearty co-operation, and sincere interest in solving the problems which confront the pineapple grower, have made it possible to continue the experi-
ment over so long a period.
Credit is also due a number of others whose names I need not mention, but who, nevertheless, lent eﬁicient aid, and acknowledgment is hereby made to all such.
OBJECT OF THE EXPERIMENT.
The object of the experiment, as stat-
ed in the bulletin referred to above, is to
ﬁnd out from what source or sources it is best ‘to obtain fertilizing materials for pineapples; the right amount to use; best method of applying; ratio for phosphoric acid. nitrogen and potash; the effect of shading, and to determine any other con-
ditions which will prove of advantage to the grower.
Certainly not all of these questions have been answered to our satisfaction, per—
haps none of them have been fully ans- '
wered. However. we had not hoped to be able to make two pineapples grow where one grew before, nor to produce two at the cost of what had formerly been the cost of producing one, but we did hope to throw some light on some or all of these questions, and we leave it for those who study the results obtained, to say with what success we have accom-
plished our task. That there is much yet to be learned, there is no doubt.
GENERAL PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENT.
The experiment was commenced in the spring of 1901, arrangements having been made with Hardee Bros. of Jensen to con-
duct it as a co—operative experiment, they furnishing the land, work, etc., and the Experiment Station to plan and direct it, and furnish fertilizers and shed, and have samples of the fruit for analysis when required.
In accordance with this plan. Hardee Bros. set aside for the experiment about one acre of virgin spruce pine land. It was cleared and put into thorough con-
dition, laid off into 96 plots, 24 sections of four plots each, as shown on diagram.
'and in August of that year, planted to slips of the Red Spanish variety.
The plots are 1-150 of an acre in size,
and contained, in the beginning, just 100
plants each, making a total of 9600 plants.
On account of a border around the out-
er edge, and extra space required for al-
ley-ways only about 2—3 of an acre was ac-
tually required for the experiment.
PLAN FOR FERTILIZER APPLICATION.
As mentioned above. the plots are in sections of four, all the plots in a section receiving the same kind of fertilizers, but in gradually increasing amounts, begin-
ning with the ﬁrst in the section.
The second plot in the sections is taken as the standard, and received annually
.8 pound phosphoric acid, 1.0 pound ni—
trogen and 2.00 pounds potash, or to put it in terms of pounds per acre, it received at the rate of 3000 pounds per acre of a fertilizer which would analyze 4 per cent.


## p. 76 (#256) #############################################

76 FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
available phosphoric acid. 5 per cent. ni-
trogen and 10 per cent. potash. this stan-
dard being based upon the analysis of the plants and fruit, and the experience of the more successful growers. Plot one re-
ceived one fourth less than the standard,
plot three one fourth more, and plot four one-half more or twice as much as plot one.
That is, plot one received at the rate of 2250 pounds per acre of such a fertili-
zer, plot two 3000 pounds, plot three
3750 pounds, and plot four 4500 pounds.
With the exception of a few sections introduced for special purposes, this plan was followed throughout the entire plot,
different sources of plant food, of course.
being used in the different sections.
It will thus be seen that all the plots in a given horizontal line received the same amount of plant food, the difference being in the sources from which they are derived. _
To illustrate, the 2nd plot of sec. H received 0.8 pound phosphoric acid deriv-
ed from slag phosphate, 1.00 pound ni-
trogen derived from dried blood and 2.00
pounds potash derived from muriate,
while the second plot of sectiom M; for example, received the same amount of phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash de-
rived from bone meal, cotton seed meal, and high grade sulphate. Sev—
eral sections were introduced for spec-
ial purposes; for example, section K was introduced with the idea of ﬁnding out the effects of lime when used with acid phosphate; isection L to determine the proper ratio for phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash; section V to determine the number of applications giving the best results, etc. _
After the ﬁrst 18 months the fertilizers were applied twice a year, except in the case of one or two sepcial sections, accord ing to the plan mentioned above. One ap-
plication in February or March as the conditions seemed to require, and one soon after the removal of the summer crop.
THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST YEAR.
Beginning with the ﬁrst crop which came off in 1903, careful count was kept of the number of the different sizes of pines taken from each plot. This record is published in full so that in one table may be found the amount and kind of fertilizers applied to each plot,
and in another the number of the different sizes of pines produced by these plots for the three years 1903, 1904 and 1905.
They cannot be given in detail here.
The crop of 1903 was about 88 per cent. of a total possibility; that is, each plot had a possible yield of 100 pines,
and actually yielded, on the average 88.
This must be considered a good yield when it is remembered that in an ex—
periment of this nature, it is almost a foregone conclusion that some of the plots receive a treatment which will, to a great-
er or less extent, injure the crop.
As a matter of fact there was a wide difference in the yield of the various plots,
some yielding little more than half a crop,
while several yielded 97, 98 and 99 out of a possible 100 and one, at least, yielded
100.
The results are interesting, but can best be studied from the published tables. I will, however, undertake, in a general way, to point out some of them.
COMMENT ON FERTILIZERS.
The experiment has emphasized the fact, which had already been pretty gen-

erally accepted, viz: that acid phosphate and kainit are injurious to pineapple plants; it has shown that nitrate of soda has some good qualities and some bad ones; it is good as a source of nitrogen to start young plants, but used liberally on bearing ﬁelds 'it ﬁnally injuires the plants and produces a fruit which has poor carrying qualities; the results ob-
tained with the sulphates of potash, low and high grade, were slightly better than those obtained with the muriate. As sources of phosphoric acid bone meal and slag phosphate have given very good re-
sults, slag apparently giving slightly bet-
ter results than bone meal Dried blood, cotton seed meal and cas-
tor pomace have all given good results as sources of nitrogen, and it would be rath-
er diﬂicult to say which is the best. One grower may use dried blood with success,
and perhaps another may use cottonseed meal or castor pomace with equally good or even better success. The price of the goods, the requirements of the individual etc. will necessarily come in here as deter-
mining factors. And I may stop here to say that in this work it has been our en-
deavor to show just what results the dif-
ferent amounts and different kinds of fer-
tilizers will give, rather than to calculate to a nicety which is the most economical,
thus leaving it with the grower who is,
in almost every instance, competent to de termine which is the most economical in his individual case.
A THEORY FOR THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF ACID PHOSPHATE.
Before leaving this point it may be well to state that the beds which received acid phosphate without lime have been almost entirely ruined, while those which receiv-
ed acid phosphate and lime in addition.
have remained in good condition and have given almost as good results as some which have been considered among the best. It is not an easy matter to explain this. However, one theory at least has been advanced, which is, that acid phos-
phate contains sulphates of iron and alu-
mina which are astringent salts, the pres-
ence of which might be injurious to the tender rootlets of the pineapple plant.
With the addition of lime these astringent salts would be neutralized with the for-
mation of the harmless insoluble oxides of iron and alumina: This explanation would seem to be strengthened by the fact that the plots which received geniune dis-
solved bone black, which does not contain salts of iron and alumina, were not injur-
ed.
It may be objected that if the tender rootlets of the pineapple plant are injured by these astringent salts, then would not the rootlets of corn, cotton, wheat, etc.
be injured in the same way? To this ques-
tion I would answer no, not necessarily,
since in the soils where these crops grow.
there is much more lime than there is in the pineapple soils, probably all that is needed to neutralize these astringent salts.
However I would not recommend the use of acid phosphate on pineapples, even with lime, at least until the subject has been further investigated.
, The excellent results obtained by the use of slag phosphate might possibly be taken as an indication that there is some eﬂicacy in lime, since this material con—
tains a goodly percentage of free lime.
THE LIMIT OF PROFITABLE FERTILTZING.
One very interesting part of the experi-
ment has been the determining of the lim-
it to which it is proﬁtable to fertilize pine—
apples.

As has already been pointed out, the
ﬁrst line of plots received at the rate of
2250 lbs. per acre, the second 3000, the third 3750 and the fourth 4500.
Now by actual count there was, for the crop of 1903 an increase, in a number of the sections from the ﬁrst to the third plot, though seldom were there materially more on the fourth than on the third,
some times less. This seemed to point to the fact that with the third plot of the section, that is, the one that received its fertilizer at the rate of 3750 lbs. per acre,
we had reached the limit of proﬁtable fer-
tilization. However, when we came to sum up the totals of these four lines, we found them to be so near the same that we would hardly have felt justiﬁed in draw-
ing such a conclusion on this evidence alone But when we came to take into consid-
eration the number of the different sizes,
there was a marked difference.
To take the 24’s for example it may be seen by reference to the table that there is a decided increase in the number from the ﬁrst to the third plot of nearly all the sections, while from the third to the fourth there is seldom a very great increase and indeed sometimes a decrease. Reference to the totals emphasizes this fact. These are in the upper half for No. 1, 45, No-
2, I05; No. 3, 277 and No. 4, 277, and for the lower half, No. I, 124; No. 2,
165; No. 3, I62 and No. 4, 269. a very decided increase from No. 2 to No. 3 but practicably no increase from No. 3 to No.
4 and yet No. 4 received at the rate of
750 lbs. per acre more fertilizer than No.
3. Likewise there was an increase, though not so pronounced, in the 30’s and a some-
what corresponding decrease in 36’s and
42’s; but if by the addition of some-
thing like 1—2 to 3-4 of a ton of fertili-
zer per acre up to a certain limit we can grow 24’s and 30’s where before we grew 36’s and 42’s I think the grow-
ers will bear me out in the statement that we are still engaged in a fairly proﬁtable business.
Plot 19, the third in sec. E and which received its fertilizer at the rate of 3750
lbs per acre, yielded in 1903 an increase over plot one, of this section, apparently due to thus increasing the fertilizers an amount equivalent to over $339
per acre above the expense of the fertili-
zers. Other plots showed an increase nearly as great. The plot which gave the largest total returns for that year was also the third plot in a section and received
3750 lbs. 'per acre, plot 35 sec. I. This yielded at the rate of 537 1-2 crates per acre while plot 36, the fourth‘in the same section, and which received at the rate of
750 lbs. per acre more fertilizer. yielded about one crate less.
Putting together all these facts and some others which I cannot now take time to mention, I think we are safe in saying that for shedded pines and under present conditions, there is proﬁt in applying as high as 3500 to 3750 lbs. per acre, of a fer-
tilizer which will analyze 4 per cent.
available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent. nit-
rogen and IO per cent. potash. beyond this is money lost.
The proﬁt comes chieﬂy in very materially increasing the number of the larger sizes.
THE CROPS FOR 1904 AND 1905.
No such decisive conclusions can be drawn from the crops for 1904 and 1905,
but this is undoubtedly due to causes other than fertilizers. The crop from the ex-
periment plot for both these years was less than one third of a total possibility

and it would seem hardly fair to under-
take to draw many conclusions from such a diminished crop. Certainly the fact that in several instances, at least, the plot receiving the least fertilizer gave the lar-
gest yield of fruit would indicate that it was not want of plant food that caused the short crops. Possibly the shortness of the crop for 1904 may be attributed partly, at lease. to the heavy yield of the previous year, the plants being somewhat exhausted temporarily; the shortness of the crop of 1905 is explained by the freeze of that year. However, there is in the re-
sults from this year. further evidence tending to show that with 3750 lbs. per acre of a fertilizer analyzingas stated,
we have reached the limit of proﬁtable fertilizing. We shall await with much interest the results from the crop of 1906.
For a full discussion of the results of the experiment up to and including the crop for 1905 those interested are refer-
red to bulletin No. 83, Florida Experi-
ment Station.

DISCUSSION.
Prof. Stockbridge—I have forgotten from your statement, whether or not in your different fertilizer applications nitrate of potash was used.
Prof. B1air.—It was not used.
Prof. Stockbridge.—Mr. President,
the thought was suggested to me that capillary action might be increased by changing the character of soil. If we could add clay to pineapple soil the capillary action would be increased; the point I wish to bring out is to know whether chemical salts are put on in addition to the other properties with a view of in-
creasing the capillary action. Some of the salts used in fertilizers such as kainit is known to increase the capillary action.
but it could not be used in pineapple, but there is one, the nitrate 0f potash, com-
monly known as salt peter. Experiments have shown that the nitrate of potash will increase the capillary action to 25 per cent.
or to a very great extent. I believe the best experiments shows an increase of
22 per cent., therefore it seems to me that it is quite feasable, at least there is a
ﬁeld for experiment with nitrate of pot-
ash in growing pineapples and this might increase 20 per cent. the amount of water consumed. I think this suggestion worth consideration. What is the contents of Nitrogen in nitrate of potash?
Mr. Wilson—Sixteen per cent. nitr0~
gen. 44 per cent. potash. 96 per cent. of pure salt peter.
Prof. Blair.-—I think that reasoning very good, but it seems to me that nitrate of potash is so very expensive that the loss by solution and going down deep into the soil, outweighs the capillary action he speaks of.
_ Mr. Blackman.—Mr. President. have you or others ever made any experiments in Dade county with surface soil in regard to loss of fertilizers?
Mr. Blair.—Our experience so far has only been carried on in Jensen. which is not the type of soil you refer to. it is the sandy soil.
Mr. Blackman.—-I wish there could be experiments made in the rocky lands of Dade county along this line. I am of the opinion that there is little or no loss of fertilizers in our rocky soils. The rock is very porous and we believe that a great amount of fertil-
izing properties which in sandy soils would be lost. are retained in the rocks and held there. The rock being so porous that the roots penetrate it gathering up

the stored fertilizer and appropriating it.
Another reason why we do not believe that the fertilizer in solution percolates through the rocks and is lost, is that our pine lands are lower than the glades, and there is an ever ﬂowing underground current of water, forcing its way upward through the rock, which would have a tendency to force back to the surface what soluable matter that had penetrated the rock, making it available at all times.
A well may be put down any where in the rocky lands from eight to ten feet deep which can never be pumped dry,
furnishing an unlimited amount of fresh,
sweet, pure water. During the past three or four years I have put down a number of these wells and have not had a failure in any of them. The ﬂow of water is as great today as it was the day they were put down.
The thought came to me while Profes-
sor Blair was talking, that in some way,
down in our country nature had provided us a pocket in which to hold these fertil-
izers. It is held largely in solution in these rocks and the roots go down and penetrate them, thus throughout the severest droughts we have, does not tend to yellow the trees, to dry up the foliage,
or check the growth. I call attention to this hoping that the professor will some-
time make an experiment to see whether a portion of our fertilizers are lost in percolating through the soil and rocks, or whether they are stored underneath the ground in the rocks and are ready for future use.

Report of Standing Committee on Fertilizers and Irrigation.
BY PROF. E. R. FLINT.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I take it that it is the province of this committee to present any progress that has been made during the year, in regard to fertilization 'and irrigation, in so far as it is of interest to the horticulturist,
particularly of the State of Florida.
While I cannot announce amv start-
ling discoveries for the year in the mat-
ter of fertilization, nevertheless there is undoubtedly a constant and steady ac-
cumulation of experience and experimen-
tal data which is gradually leading to the point of making plant fertilization more nearly an exact science than it has been,
or perhaps it would be nearer the truth to say, to a point where we begin to real-
ize that, as it varies so with every varying condition, it never can be an exact sci-
ence.
In regard to practical results and pro-
gress in our own State, the Florida Ex-
periment Station has just published the results of an extensive experiment on the fertilization of the pineapple and has reached some interesting and valuable re-
sults, which are to be presented in another paper. Fertilizer experiments are also in progress on the orange, cotton and pota-
tOCS.
If we review the work done by the var-
ious experiment Stations on fertilization,
for the past year, it seems to me that we must be lead to the belief that not only every State, but every county, every farm and indeed every portion of that farm requires more or less special or in-
dividual treatment to get the best results.
A universal formula for any particular crop is not possible, Such a formula may serve as a basis, but no intelligent plant grower should rest content with this, but should constantly seek to so modify it that it will best meet his own individual conditions, and the more intelligently and conscientiously he does this, the more economically and proﬁtably he will be able to fertilize his land. It is for this reason that Stations and Agricultural papers are always advocating home mixing, and that fertilizer dealers are advertising,
more and more, the various plant food ingredients rather than mixed fertilizers.
A mixed fertilizer will always ﬁnd some sale because there are many that will not take the trouble to do their own mixing,
and I would not in any way imply that they are not of value, as every reputable dealer aims to supply what is needed and in the best form, as it is in the results ob-
tained that he gets his best advertising,
and I think we have no reason to com-
plain of the dealers in our own State.
I believe, in the past that we have be come accustomed to place too much reli-

ance on published formulas which have been made-up from the analysis of the soil and the crop, and have contented our-
selves with these data. The subject of animal nutrition and feeding is naturally one of considerable complication and dif-
ﬁculty, as compared with plant feeding,
but I think that we shall eventually come to believe that the more intimate ques-
tions of plant nutrition, approach it in this respect. To be sure we are concern-
ed in furnishing only a very small percent of the total plant food that is re-
quired, as by far the larger part is ob-
tained from the air, but that part is just as essential to the growth of the plant as the other. If the problem was merely one of determining just how much pot-
ash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen was re-
moved in the crop and was required for the additional growth for the year, it would be easily solved. But in practice,
this is found to be wholly inadequate for crops like the orange and from eight to ten times as much as the amount so indi-
cated by the above ﬁgures seem to be re-
quired to keep the plant up to the best condition of quality and quantity of fruit.
Where does this excess go to, and how can we economize by reducing this dis-
crepancy to a minimum without lower-
ing the results we wish to obtain ?. To answer this question, I think we must turn from the chemical side of the ques-
tion to the physical one, or. in other words, study the physical and mechani-
cal conditions of our soils to ﬁnd a solu-
tion.
There are various sources of loss of plant food in the soil, and reasons why the plant does not get all that we apply,
with which we are acquainted. One of the most evident of these is the leaching of the material through the soil and car-
rying it away from the area of the root system of the plant. The rapidity of this leaching increases markedly as we pass from a clay to a sandy soil. Now, on our Florida soils there is no question but that leaching goes on to a very great ex-
tent. It is of course desirable that we have our plant food in a soluble form as it is only in this condition that the plants can make use of it. If we apply it in this condition, or in such compounds that it rapidly becomes so, it is conceivable and no doubt to a large extent true, that with the ﬁrst soaking of the soil with rain it is carried away to a large extent be-
yond the reach of the plant (speaking particularly of our loose, sandy Florida soils). Now can we prevent this serious and expensive loss? At present the meth-
od of overcoming this seems to be to sup-
ply suﬁicient to allow for this loss and to feed the plant too, which is one reason why we have to apply from eight to ten times the amount removed by the crop, and that would seem, from all rational and scientiﬁc standpoints, to be necessary. In other words, we apply say from one to two tons to the acre, expecting and know-
ing that we shall lose a large part of it,
when perhaps 200 to 300 pounds is all the crop needs and makes use of. If such conditions held in any technical line. you may be sure the manufacturer would take immediate steps to prevent this loss.
If the'farmer can stand this constant drain and still make a proﬁt, there must indeed be money in farming. I believe,
however, that we can control this loss to a considerable extent. According to the usual practice, we make one or two appli-
cations of fertilizers a year to the crop and expect it to save and make use

of what it can out of this, for the next six months more or less, although its food is being rapidly carried out of its reach,
and I have no doubt but that the amount of available plant food within access of the plant roots, during the last few months of such a period, is exceedingly small. In other words, we give it a sur-
feit of food in one meal and then starve it for some months. Does not the remedy in this lie in our dividing up our appli-
cations, making several of them Illl'Ui‘Hil.
the season, keeping our plants supplied with avaliable food in small amounts, as required. I believe that such a practice would result in a considerable saving and that a smaller amount of fertilizer so ap-
plied, would produce the results of one or two large applications. To get the best results such a system of applying fertili-
zers should be accompanied with means of irrigating, so that, with each small ap-
plication, if there were not sufficient rain-
fall, just enough water could be applied to bring the food into solution, but not enough to leach through the soil. It is true that the proper carrying out of such a system would involve some initial ex-
pense, but to the progressive farmer of today, who aims to get the best results at the least expense, and can look ahead on his balance sheet, it will eventually save money.
Another source of loss, which however is largely temporary, and with the pres-
ent system of applying fertilizers perhaps more beneﬁcial than otherwise, 'is the chemical changes that the fertilizing ma-
terial undergoes in the soil, tending in general, to pass from a soluble to a less soluble form. This would be obviated,
to a considerable extent, by the system just suggested.
The belief in the value of a chemical soil analysis as an indication of what is necessary to add to that soil in order to make it fertile, is rapidly loosing ground,
and attention is being turned more par-
ticularly to the bacteriology of the soil,
the various conditions of acidity and alka-
linity, the changes of the humus in the soil etc., and when the present lines of in vestigations shall have advanced further.
we may hope for a more practical and in-
timate knowledge of the relation existing between the chemistry of the soil and the fertilization of plants.
Present methods of soil analysis are aiming to determine the plant food that is actually available to the plant, rather than the total amount of such material in the soil. These methods should give a much better idea of what is needed than the methods formerly employed.
The farmer has two valuable and in-
expensive means of improving his soil and thereby cutting down his fertilizer expenses, which I do not think are prac-
tised nearly to the extent that they should be, and these are, the plowing under of green crops and the growing of legumin-
ous crops as a source of nitrogen. As the natural sources of fertilizing material become less abundant and more expen-
sive, in the future, these means will be more appreciated and used. It is a strik-
ing fact that is noticeable as we review the developement and advancement of civilization, with its ever increasing neces-
sities and requirements, that no sooner does an urgent emergency arise for any-
thing that may contribute ‘to the comfort and welfare of mankind, than some dis-
covery is made that supplies that demand.
Up to the present time. we have lived in a time when nature, by the exploration

and opening up of new countries'and the discoveries of great deposits of valuable mineral material, has supplied everything needed with a lavish hand. Nor has man been at all backward in using, with the greatest freedom and often times with the most inexcusable wastefulness, the resources which have been so bountifully given to him. The time has already ar-
rived, however, when we begin to look into the future and speculate as to what is going to happen to posterity when we shall have exhausted the resources which we are now drawing on with ever-increas-
ing freedom to supply the constantly growing demands. That the crude ma-
terial stored in the earth, which has grown to be so indispensable to our wel-
fare, will eventually be exhausted, no one can doubt, and in fact it is possible to calculate approximately, with the present rate of use, when many of our natural resources will be exhausted, a period in many instances surprisingly and almost alarmingly short. We must then, con—
sole ourselves with the above mentioned fact, that some discovery will be made which will enable us to get along as well or better without them.
Let us consider for a moment, the sit-
uation in regard to the future supply of fertilizing materials and see what is being done to provide for the time when we shall have exhausted the great deposits that have proved of such inestimable val-
ue to agriculture. , First in regard to pot-
ash. It is calculated that the present con-
sumption. of potash, for all purposes, is over three, million tons. a year and that it is constantly growing. Practicallv all of this comes fromthe great Stassfurt de-
posits in Germany. As minor sources of supply we have wood ashes and cotton seed hull ashes, which are limited. About
2000 tons of muriate of potash are an-
nually made in the south of France from sea water and the Scottish manufacture of kelp yields perhaps 1000 to 1200 tons yearly as a by-product. There are a few other minor sources of supply, such as ni-
trate of potash, wool washings and beet sugar residues. Leaving out these minor sources, which supply but a very small part of the total demand, we have as prac-
tically the sole source, the great potash deposits at Strassfurt, Germany. Al-
though the yearly output of this great collection of mines is now nearly four million tons a year and is steadily in-
creasing, the supply seems almost inex-
haustible, so that it will at least be many,
many years before mankind will ﬁnd it-
Self face to face with. the problem of its potash supply, which has become so es-
sential to successful agriculture, and the necessity for which will grow greater as the population increases, virgin soils are robbed of their natural fertility, and in-
tensive farming becomes more and more a necessity. Let us hope that when that times comes, some means will have been found or new discoveries made, which will supply the deﬁciency.
In regard to phosphoric acid the natur-
al supplies may be summed up in general,
in the deposits of phosphate rock, phos-
phatic guanos, bones and slag. The great guano deposits which have been drawn upon so heavily in the past will be ex-
hausted before a great many years, and although smaller gauno islands may from time to time be discovered, the supply from this source must gradually diminish.
The conditions which allow the accumu-
lation of such deposits, which require many years to form will probably never

be repeated to the extent they have been,
so that this source, when exhausted, will probably never be replaced. The phos-
phatic deposits, as those through the southeastern portions of the United States are large and will give an abund-
ant supply for a long time, but they are not inexhaustible. The source of supply from bones etc, which however, is insuf-
ﬁcient to supply the demand, can be count-
ed upon as a steady source, and the same applies to slag, a by~product in iron smelt-
ing. Viewed as a whole, there is noth-
ing alarming in the present situation of the potash and phosphoric acid supply.
In regard to nitrogen, the fact con-
fronts us that we are continually using up this element of plant food without an adequate return to the soil. The constant cropping of the land, combined with our present system of sewerage disposal,
which prevents the return to the soil of such a large and legitimate nitrogen sup-
ply, the fact that so many crops are sold away from the land, are suﬁicient to in-
dicate the loss, without considering the destruction of nitrogen compounds by de-
nitrifying bacteria, the leaching of the soil and other sources of loss. The world’s supply of the two richest sources of nitrogen, guano and saltpeter, is being rapidly exhausted. At the present rate of consumption of the latter, one billion tons a year, it will be exhausted, as claim-
ed by some, in 30 years. New methods for the production of nitrogen compounds available for fertilizing purposes may be discovered, and some efforts have already been made in that, direction with electrici-
ty, but this does not promise sufﬁcient as yet to count on it to any extent to relieve the situation.
Nature has provided, to a certain ex-
tent, for the return of nitrogen to the soil.
Arising from the chemical changes going on, on the surface, there are always traces of ammonia compounds and compounds of nitrous and nitric acids in the air, which are washed down by rains. Electrical dis-
charges in the air bring small amounts of the free nitrogen into combination so that it may be returned to the soil by the rain. In 1891 it was discovered that there were certain micro-organisms in the soil which could bring the free nitrogen of the air into combination without the aid of any other plant life. Experimen-
tation on this line has been undertaken to make practical use of these organisms but so far without result.
The fact that leguminous plants had a very beneﬁcial effect on the soil is a very old observation and they have been used for this purpose without the knowledge of the reason for this. It was demon-
strated in 1895 that there was actually an increase in nitrogen after such a crop.
It was also noticed that these plants would grow in a soil that contained practically no nitrogen. Hellriegel, in 1886 an-
nounced that leguminous plants derived their nitrogen from the atmosphere and in 1888 Wilfarth and Hellriegel demon-
strated that the growth of such plants in a nitrogen-free soil, occured after the de-
velopment of nodules on the roots. Pre-
vious to this time, although these nodules had been noticed, they had been con-
sidered as a diseased condition of the roots. When the true solution of the question began to appear, it was easily demonstrated that a leguminous plant, grown in a soil absolutely free from nitrogen, as in pure quartz sand that had been heated to redness, and watered with a solution devoid of nitrogen in any

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 87
form, would produce a normal growth when the nodules were present, but if they were not present they would quickly die.
It was indeed proved that a legume grow-
ing in a poor sandy soil provided with no-
dule-forming bacteria, will be even more vigorous and produce a better crop than plants growing in a moderately rich soil devoid of the bacteria. A great many re-
cent ﬁeld experiments in all parts of the country have proved this beyond a doubt.
One of the most striking experiments was that of Prof. J. F. Duggar at the Alabama Experiment Station in 1895 and
1897. On one ﬁeld where hairy vetch had not been grown previously and the fertilizer used contained phosphoric acid and potash without any nitrogen, the yield was but 235 pounds of hay per acre.
On a similar plot, treated in a similar manner with the exception of the addi-
tion of some soil from an old ﬁeld con-
taining the proper bacteria, the yield of hay was 2540 pounds per acre. or an in-
crease of over 2000 pounds. This beneﬁ-
cial effect is not conﬁned to the legumin-
ous crop itself, but is imparted to the crops following such plants and this has become so universally accepted' and so many times proved, that every recogniz-
ed system of rotation includes some legu-
minous crop in its course. The fact is tersely stated by T. E. Neal, from results of experiments at the Deleware Experi-
ment Station, that $100 invested in clo—
ver seed returned four times as much as the same amount invested in nitrate of 50-
da. It is estimated in this country that the average amount of nitrogen added to the soil by legums is 122 pounds per acre.
When it is remembered that a high grade nitrate of soda contains only about 15 per cent. of nitrogen, while much that is on the market often contains considerable less, it will be seen that a crop of legumes is equal to from 800 to 1000 pounds of nitrate of soda per acre, which at the pres-
ent price of this fertilizer, is equal in value to from $20 to $25.
We thus see a possible future solution of the question of the nitrogen supply, at least. The horticulturist of Florida, as well as in other states, in order to meet the gradually extending competition, has got to take advantage of every possible means of furnishing the fertilization necessary to secure the best results, at the lowest price consistent with efﬁciency,
but in doing this he must be careful that he does not deteriorate the quality of his fruit. Every poorly fertilized grove means poor fruit which in turn is a men—
ace to the reputation of the whole crop,
which up to the present time at least, has justly and easily held ﬁrst place. We must however, seek always to improve our fruit, so that we may not only meet, but keep ahead of the competition that is bound to develope from the West Indies etc. The geographical position of Flori-
da is such, that I believe she can and will meet this competition, especially in the quality of her fruit.

THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF FIXED NITROGEN.
BY L. HEIMBURGER, M.5.,
I FIRST ASSISTANT STATE CHEMIST.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Of the three natural elements so often deﬁcient in our soils combined nitrogen is the one most easily exhausted, the most costly and the most rare.
Every crop removes its aloquent por-
tion of combined nitrogen from the soil,
and if not returned by the grower leaves the soil proportionally poorer. Everv bat-
tle results in the waste of hundreds even thousands of tons of nitrogen that could be used in supporting instead of destroy-
ing human life.
Again our sewers are delivering un-
told millions of dollars of nitrogen an-
nually into the sea.
Every pound of coal or wood as or-
dinarily burned, results in the return to the atmosphere of a deﬁnite amount of nitrogen.
The problem is to replace this annual loss 'of combined nitrogen and as our two chief sources at present are neither inexhaustible, it becomes a serious mat-
ter. These two chief sources are our ooal beds and nitrate deposits. Of the coal burned only a comparatively small amount of the nitrogen content is saved and our visible supply of Nitrate is be-
ing rapidly exhausted.
At the present increasing rate of ex-
portation, now one and a half million tons annually, the Chili nitrate deposits cannot last more than another twenty years.
Nitrogen is one of the least active chemically of all the elements, and far this reason, it is found in nature principal-
ly in its free uncombined or elementary form. It is only by the most drastic of chemical or physical methods that elemen-
tary nitrogen can be made to combine with other elements. The ultimate source of all our nitrogen combined and uncombined is the atmosphere where it is present in its elementary form to the ex-
tent of about 79 per cent. by volume. The remaining 21 per cent, is principally oxy-
gen.
The greatest direct economic value of elementary nitrogen in the atmosphere is to act as a delutant to the oxygen. In-
cidentally it is the source of all combined nitrogen.
Elementary or uncombined nitrogen has no neutrant value to the higher or-
ganisms and therefore is of no direct value to the plants and animals we are most interested in.
In its combined forms nitrogen is one of the bases of life among higher organ-
isms being a principal constitutent of pro-
toplasm; the others being Carbon, Hy-
drogen, Oxygen, Sulphur and Phospho-
rus.
If it were not for combined nitrogen,
life as we now know it would be impos-
sible.
Here the question may be asked, how is the free or elementary nitrogen which is so inactive chemically, made to combine in nature with other elements so that higher life may be possible?

This is a most difﬁcult question to an-
swer, and at present can only be answer-
' ed in part by Science. It is along this line that bacteriology together with chemistry and physics have accomplished great work in recent years.
Bacteriology, the youngest of all the sciences has shed the greatest amount of light upon this question. During the last two decades this science through its many researches tells us of a great number of micro-organisms that have the power of
ﬁxing nitrogen; that is, they are capable through unknown processes to cause ele-
mentary nitrogen to combine with cer-
tain other elements present to form com-
pounds of Nitrogen which are available as food for higher plants.
These nitrogen ﬁxing micro—organisms may be divided into two classes, symbio-
tic and non-symbiotic.
The greater amount of research has been devoted to the former, and therefore they are best known at present.
These symbiotic micro-organisms are always found intimately associated with certain higher plants especially the papil-
lionaccae or leguminosae (beans, peas,
clover, etc.) in whose roots they reside.
The amount of nitrogen that may be ﬁx-
ed by these micro-organisms is large and the cultivation of legumes should always be encouraged.
Of late years our National Department of Agriculture has been making great ef-
forts to devise a reliable method by means of which the micro-organisms above men¢
tioned may be readily distributed in a commercial way.
The method of drying the cultures on cotton, recommended so highly not longer than a couple of years ago, has recently been shown to be but at best partially suc-
cessful. Still a reliable method will un-
doubtedly be forthcoming before long.
To the second class or non-symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxing micro-organisms belong those of bacteria that have the power of
ﬁxing elementary atmospheric nitrogen unaided by any host. These organisms have not as yet been studied extensively,
still a large number of forms have been discovered.
Besides the nitrogen ﬁxing bacteria just discovered, there are forms of micro-
organisms that have an opposite function,
that is, they have the power of breaking up nitrogenous compounds with the lib-
eration of elementary nitrogen. There-
fore the action of these bacteria result in the loss of ﬁxed nitrogen in the soil.
These organisms can, however, be readily controlled by the proper drainage and cul-
tivation of the soil, for they are as a rule anarobic, (not capable of existing in the presence of air) or at best but slightly facultative (capable of existing in or not in the presence of air.)
Another natural agency by means of which atmospheric elementary nitrogen is ﬁxed is through electrical discharges.
For many years it has been known that lightning discharges cause atmospheric nitrogen to combine with oxygen to from oxides: These in turn unite with aqueous vapour to form nitric and ni-
trous acids, which are washed out of the air into the soil by the rain.
It must be borne in mind that but a very limited amount of atmospheric nitrogen is ﬁxed in this way.
As far back as 180 years ago Caven-
dish, one of the founders of modern chem-
istry, predicted the commercial ﬁxation of atmospheric nitrogen and a few years la—
ter contemporaneously with Priestly

showed that electric sparks undercertain conditions oxidized atmospheric nitro-
gen.
Later the noted chemist Bunsen did more valuable work in the electro-ther-
mic ﬁxation of atmospheric nitrogen.
Until very recently the yield of oxides of nitrogen has been very poor by elec-
tro-thermic methods being only in the experimental stage. The principles upon which are based all electro-thermic meth-
ods for the ﬁxation of free nitrogen are in general as follows:
When air is subjected to silent electri-
cal discharges of high potential, the oxy-
gen is ozonized and the nitrogen is oxi-
dized most largely into nitric and dinitric oxides (N0, Now) the former can be fur-
ther oxidized to dinitric oxide.
Dinitric oxide or nitrogen preoxide in the presence of water forms nitric (HN
0-) nitrous acid (HN 01) as well as ni-
tric oxide (NO) depending on the relative proportions of peroxide and water pres-
ent.
These acids, nitric and nitrous, com-
bine with bases to form nitrates and ni-
trites.
To oxidize nitrogen requires a very high temperature. It has been shown in recent years, that the percentage of ni-
trogen oxidized is very largely depend-
ant upon the temperature the gases are exposed to. Nernst determined that at
1,811 degrees C. only .37 per cent. of the Nitrogen supplied was oxidized, while at
3,200 degrees C. 5 per cent. of the nitro-
gen was oxidized.
If the oxides fromed are not rapidly re-
moved, this high temperature causes their decomposition.
Electricity is the best source of heat for obtaining the high temperature re-
quired for the oxidization of atmospheric nitrogen.
Of the large number of electro-thermic methods for the ﬁxing of free nitrogen,
but one, the Birkeland-Eyde process, has proven a complete commercial success.
In the Birkeland-Eyde process the in-
ventors use magnetic blow-pipe electrodes with an alternating current, this gives a
ﬂame disk of large surface.
The air enters from both sides of the
ﬂame disk and is drawn off from below in such a manner that it has passed direct-
ly through the plane of the ﬂame.
Only about two percent. of the nitro—
gen is oxidized in the ﬂame. After pas-
sing through the ﬂame, the air is cooled in a suitable chamber where the nitric oxide (NO) is further oxidized to per-
oxide, (NO'-) From the cooling chamber the gases are conducted through absorp-
tion towers, eight in number, where they come in contact with water. The dilute nitric acid is drawn off from below, rais-
ed again, and allowed to trickle down again from tower to tower, until upon
ﬂowing from tower number eight the formerly very dilute acid has been raised to about 50 per cent.
The last traces of acid are removed in towers irrigated with lime water and
ﬁnally in a dry lime chamber.
The nitric acid thus obtained is neu-
tralized with calcium carbonate (lime-
stone) Ca CO" and the resulting calcium nitrate (Ca N0») is evaporated and fused using the waste heat from the electric furnace.
The factory at Nottodden, Sweden using the Birkeland-Eyde process, obtains a yield of from II to 13 hundred pounds of nitric acid per killowatt year, equiva-
lent to about X 1-3 horse power year.


## p. 91 (#271) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 91
At these N ottodden works cheap water power is to be had, and in many places in Sweden power may be produced for the very low rate of $3.00 per horse power year.
With the above ﬁgures in mind i. e.
$3.00 worth of power for the production of one half ton of nitric acid, it is proven that the nitrate of lime as produced at Nottodden can successfully compete with Chili nitrate of soda at current prices.
The Birkeland-Eyde process being new, is susceptible to material improve—
ment.
A new improved plant, recently put up,
turns out over ﬁfteen hundred pounds of nitric acid per killowatt year.
The much dreaded nitrogen famine so often predicted of late years, may in the very near future be entirely eliminated by electro-thermic methods for the direct
ﬁxation of atmospheric nitrogen.
FERTILIZING MATERIALS.

BY LORENZO A. WILSON Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The fertilizer question has been so ably handled before this Association during its nineteen meetings it would appear there was very little left to be said regarding it.
My friend, Mr. Painter has told you some of the things he knows on several occa-
sions and has also issued some very intel-
ligent books that nearly all of you have read. During the past twelve years I have written articles myself, sending them broadcast over the State to nearly every one of you I think, and there is only left for me now the rehashing of the same matter.
There are so many growers in the State who have made such a close study of the question of plant foods and are so well-
posted on it that I ﬁnd it a very difﬁcult matter to-day to get a traveling salesman to work for me, who knows as much on this subject as many members of this As-
sociation do. I have always said it was a bad plan to put a fertilizer manufactur-
er on this Committee as it is almost im—
possible for him at times to leave out some of the good things he might say of his own brands when he writes or talks on fertilizers. In the following article I have tried to write with the idea before me all the time, that I was a fertilizer broker in New York, selling materials to the manufacturers of Florida.
First I would like to say that the fer-
tilizer industry has been very thoroughly developed in Jacksonville during the past two years. To-day the fertilizer factories of this city have a capacity for making approximately two hundred thousand tons of complete goods, if they had the market for them the year round, and the equipment to move them with.
PRICES.
The small growers of Florida buy their fertilizers cheaper to-day in this State than many of the larger buyers do on Long Island, New Jersey or Connecticut or Massachusetts. All of this has been made possible by the development of the fertilizer business in Jacksonville; the

fact that the market has grown as it has;
that the materials are imported direct to this port from their points of production and the fact that the State of Florida it-
self produces practically the Phosphate supplies for the world. I have heard many growers say they were raising orange groves, pineapple patches and vegetable crops for the fertilizer manufacturer, as they get all the money. The question must necessarily then be of all-absorbing interest to the horticulturalists of the State.
The greater proportion of the groves and pineries are on high pine lands. which are composed of from 95 to 98 per cent.
sand. The rest are mostly on hammocks that were quite rich to start on but under the draft of heavy crops of oranges their fertility was soon reduced to the same degree of poverty as the high pine lands so that the fertilizer question began to ap-
peal to all alike and the whole country set in to study this subject.
In this article I will only take up the question of fertilizing materials, princi-
pally those that are used by the orange grower.
Under the inﬂuence of the German Kaili Works the ﬁrst article that seems to interest the orange grower the most is Potash. In the modest opinion of the writer they have worked Potash rather strong on the grower, claiming for its ex—
cessive use a great many things that can-
not be sustained.
The ﬁrst or crude produce of the Ger~
man mines is K‘ainit, which gives 26 per cent. of Sulphate Potash, Salt, Magnesia,
etc. This is puriﬁed and the Double Man-
ure Salts of Potash, Magnesia was form-
ed, which gives 50 to 52 per cent. Sulphate of Potash or 26 per cent. ‘90 and about
35 per cent. Sulphate of Magnesia, with
2.50 per cent. of salt. This is still further puriﬁed and the chemist obtains the al-
most chemically High Grade Sulphate of Potash, 90 to 96 per cent Sulphate of Potash or 49 to 52 per cent K10-
On account of the supposed good effect of the Sulphate of Magnesia on the soil and the fruit a great many orange grow-
ers prefer to buy Double Manure Salts,
paying the difference in price and freights over the High Grade. I do not know whether they are justiﬁed or not in this belief,
I will pass over the Murate of Potash because it is so little used by the grower,
its high content of chlorine or salt mak-
ing it objectionable to the orange tree.
Nitrate of potash or salt petre is used to a limited extent. There are several grades, the highest 16 per cent. ammonia and 44 per cent of potash K=O- giving the ammonia a valuation of $3 per unit per cent. we ﬁnd this a little cheaper source of potash than the sulphate. At a selling price of $92 per ton at Jacksonville the
44 per cent. of Potash is worth $42 or less than $1 for each per cent. It is very quick in its action and does not seem to combine readily with the soil elements and is in great danger of being washed out by heavy rains.
The next important element in a fertili-
zer is the phosphoric acid, without it no blossom or seed is perfect. It is derived from a great many sources. Animal bone gives 4 to 5 per cent. ammonia and about 24 per cent. phosphoric acid of which from 6 to IO per cent. is available to the plants, the rest gradually under-
goes decomposition in the soil and it will take from three to ﬁve years for it all to become used up. Steamed bone gives

about 3 per cent. ammonia and 25 per cent. phosphoric acid and on account of its ﬁneness is more readily available to the plants. The spent bone from the sugar reﬁneries is treated with sulphuric acid to make its phosphoric acid availa-
ble at once, and is used and sold under the name of dissolved bone black. It con-
tains then from 16 to .18 per cent, availa-
ble phosphoric acid.
Florida phosphates or fossil bone is the greatest source of phosphoric acid. This is mined in the central and southern parts of the State and immense quantities are exported to Europe. This phosphoric acid in our Florida phosphates is entirely insoluble. If it had been soluble it would not have remained, but would have been dissolved by the soil water and long since have disappeared from our country into the Gulf of Mexico. Chemistry has come to our relief in making this and other phosphatic materials available to the plant. Sulphuric acid is used in render-
ing water soluble the insoluble phosphor-
ic acid in animal bone and the fossil bone in Florida. Each contains phosphoric acid and lime combined in the same pro-
portion; one part of phosphoric acid and three parts lime which is called bone phos-
phate of lime, which is insoluble. Now to make the material, either bone or the Florida phosphates soluble and available to the plants it is ground and combined with sulphuric acid diluted with water to
52 per cent beaumae. The sulphuric acid has more affinity for the lime than the phosphoric acid has and combined with two parts forming sulphate of lime or land plaster, leaving the phosphoric acid combined with one part of lime which is soluble in soil water and availa-
ble to the plants. The sulphuric acid combining chemically with the lime is no more sulphuric acid and there is no more danger of your getting free sulphuric acid in this preparation than you would in sulphate of potash or sul-
phate of ammonia. This idea of danger from free sulphuric acid is a humbug and not worthy of the slightest attention by the intelligent horticultural-
ists of this State, an idea advanced by a northern manufacturer. Soluble phos-
phoric acid is identical no matter from what source it is derived, and when some growers realize this they will save money.
One of the northern ﬁrms for the last twenty years has been trying to make the Florida grower believe that all other com-
plete fertilizers have free sulphuric acid in them_ claiming that through a secret process by steaming he makes bone, Peru-
vian guano and other phosphatic mater-
ials all available. This statement has been made to many growers in the State but would never be made before a fertili-
zer manufacturer or some one who knew because the party making this claim knows only too well there are no elements in water or steam to combine with the lime in bone or phosphate to make it available even though he should put it through a secret Lsteaming process for seventeen years.
Peruvian Guano is another ﬁne source of phosphoric acid. High grade will give
9 to 10 per cent. ammonia, 9 to 12 phos~
phoric acid partly available and three to four per cent. potash. Lower grades will give 3 to 4 per cent. ammonia, 18 to 20
per cent. Phosphoric Acid and 3 to 4 per cent. Potash. All of its phosphoric acid sooner or later becomes available in the soil. They are not susceptible of treat-
ment with sulphuric acid.

The by-products of the slaughter hous-
es, tankage or blood and bone furnish variable quantities of phosphoric acid and ammonia.
The next and most important element of all fertilizers is ammonia or nitrogen.
it is the-life, the growth of all plants. It is derived from a great many sources,
which are divided into non-organic or chemical and organic. Of chemical am-
moniates sulphate of ammonia heads the list, giving 25 per cent ammonia. This is one of the slowest of all, gradually changing into nitric acid in the soil. Ni-
trate of soda or Chili salt peter gives 17
to 19 per cent ammonia in its most availa-
ble form, the nitric acid separating from thesoda at once,being immediately availa-
ble to the plants. As it does not readily combine with the soil elements it is in dan-
ger of being washed down below the reach of some plants by heavy rains. Nitrate of potash mentioned before has the same tendency.
In the list of organic ammoniates we have dried blood, giving I7 per cent.
This changes quite quickly into nitrate with a reasonable amount of soil water.
Blood and bone or tankage contains from
10 per cent. to 6 per cent. ammonia ac-
cording to grade and changes rather slow-
ly in the soil into Nitrate.
Cotton seed meal furnishes 7 1-2 to 8
per cent ammonia. Castor pomace con-
' tains from 6 to 6 1-2 per cent. ammonia.
Tobacco stems furnish a small amount of ammonia from I to 3 per cent. and some potash, one grade giving 3 ammonia and
10 potash which is in a very available form.
You will see from the above list of am-
moniates that you have quite a lot from which to choose but the intelligent hor-
ticulturalist knows that the chemical am-
moniates give the best results on orange trees and I will conclude by giving an ex-
tract from an article by Mr. Herbert Webber, Assistant in Division of Vegeta-
ble Pathology at Washington, and who is well known to most orange growers.
“Probably no element of plant food used in the fertilization of orange trees should be more carefully considered with respect to both form and quantity than nitrogen. It is the most costly and at the same time the most dangerous element to use, as excessive applications are liable to result in extensive splitting and drop-
ping of the fruit or in the production of the serious disease known as die-back.”
“The mineral nitrogen manures, nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia appar-
ently stimulate the production of fruit more than organic manures, and yet pro-
duce a fair general growth. The fruit produced by fertilization with these salts used in correct proportions with the other elements. which it is necessary to apply,
is usually of good quality, being solid,
rich and juicy, with thin skins and little rag. Sulphate of ammonia has the effect.
growers testify, 0f sweetening fruit to a great extent.
“Sulphate of Ammonia has been very widely used among orange growers. Ni-
trate of soda has been but little used thus far, but is apparently in favor. Its insec-
ticide and water attracting properties are probably much greater than those of sul-
phate of ammonia.
“Organic manures are of doubtful util-
ity. Barn manure is largely used by many growers who still hold to the tra-
dition that chemical manures are injuri-
ous to the plants. The beneﬁts of barn manure in an orange grove are a serious

question. The fruits produced from ni-
trogen from this source are usually large,
coarse, thick skinned, with abundant rag and inferior ﬂavor. If barn manure is used and most growers have a limited quantity and desire to use what they have,
it should be spread over the grove lightly so that each tree receives only a small amount. When such manure is depended upon as the main element of fertilization,
liberal dressings of sulphate of potash should be occasionally applied. This will tend to correct the evils of an overbal-
anced nitrogenous fertilizer. What has been said as to the effects of barn manure on the quality of the fruit applies equally to the effects produced by muck. cotton seed meal, blood and bone, tankage etc.
In general, organic fertilizers do not stim-
ulate fruiting to the same extent as the mineral fertilizers. It is probably better to apply such fertilizers to annual crops,
garden truck, etc.
“In fertilizing the orange, potash is most frequently used either in the form of sulphate or wood ashes.
“The noticeable effect of the potash on orange trees appears to be its aid in com-
pleting and maturing the wood; appar-
ently an insufﬁciency of potash is shown by an excessive growth of weak, imma-
ture wood, which does not harden up as winter approaches and is liable to be in-
jured by frost.”
“The phosphoric acid, which is a very Florida orange lands, is mostly used in the form of dissolved bone, superphos-
phate, bone, bone black, raw bone, guano etc. The immediate effect of phosphoric acid on the orange tree and its fruit is little understood. Several intelligent growers claim to be able to recognize the necessary element of fertilization on effect of phosphorus starvation by the ap-
pearance of the new growth of leaves. If these, when they ﬁrst push out, or while they are young and tender, present a slightly variegated appearance, mottled with light and dark green it is claimed that they are suffering from a lack of phosphorus and if a liberal application of some soluble phosphoric acid is applied this appearance may be checked. If this can be shown to be the case it will prove a valuable index to the available quality of phosphorus in the soil. A similar ap-
pearance may, however, appear in light cases of so-called frenching, a disease, or more properly a symptom of disease which is not uncommon. Phosphorus starvation may have some effect in in-
ducing this disease.”
Having watched the irrigation ques- _
tion since the dry Spring of 1890 I can say that not one plant in a hundred has paid a dividend on orange groves. If the trees are properly fertilized early in the season and kept cultivated until the rainy season sets in, I do not think that irrigation need be resorted to.

FER TILIZERS AND IRRIGATION.

BY F. D. WAITE.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
My report on Fertilizers and Irrigation will not take up much time, but I trust we shall have a full discussion as to the merits of chemical fertilizers. In my mind there is nothing that is so necessary as the right kind of fertilizers, when, and how they should be applied, in order to grow the very be5t fruit and vegetables.
Thinking it necessary that I should give to this Society something new along
' these lines, I reviewed my ﬁle of this so-
ciety's reports for the past twelve years,
and after I had ﬁnished, it seemed that the ground had been completely covered, and that it would be a waste of time to re-
hash them all. Not that they are -not valuable for they are, and I recommend that the members of this Society that have not a complete list of these books, apply to the Secretary for copies of as many as he can furnish, commencing way back in
1893, when Major Healy and others were discussing the merits of muck and stable manure (being a complete fertilizer for orange trees) up to the present time when the question arises, whether we shall (tr get the best results) experiment with our individual soils, using pure chemicals, or purchase ready mixed fertilizers of stand-
ard formulas from reputable manufac-
turers.
Some well known growers have recent-
ly remarked that ten and ﬁfteen years ago when blood and bone was used with a balanced ration of potash, we experienc-
ed less trouble with our groves, and new diseases were not developing as rapidly as they are today, and the question arises:
Are we pursuing the right course?
Some tell us we should not use acid phos-
phate, that it contains so much free acid,
that our soils will become poisoned. Yet our State Chemist tells us that availa-
ble phosphoric acid is just as good from one source as another, and that when we buy the so-called dissolved bone black it is just as liable to be acid phosphate color-
ed with lamp black, and we pay about seven dollars extra for the coloring.
Prof. Rose also says that efforts have been made by agricultural chemists to distin-
guish them, so far without results.
As the situation exists to-day, we may buy a complete fertilizer which has on its tag, dissolved bone or dissolved bone black as its source of phosphoric acid. All our State chemist can do is to determine by samples sent him the true analysis as to its content, of ammonia, phosphoric acid.
and potash.
The manufacturers that w; deal with may be honest, and believe that which they sell us is the true article, as they have a guarantee from the dealers that sold them, and have no way themselves of telling one from the other. Some as-
sert that the supply of bone does not equal the demand, then we had better buy acid phosphate and save seven dollars per ton,
or buy steamed and raw ground bone, if we are afraid of ﬁlling our soils with acid.
I have recently corresponded with deal-
ers who handle nitrate of potash and basic slag. With these two chemicals we can secure a fertilizer well balanced and abso-
lutely free of all acids, and the slag con-
tains 50 per cent. of lime.


## p. 97 (#277) #############################################

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

At present I think all the basic slag is imported, and is a by-product in manu-
facturing steel from an iron ore contain-
ing a high percentage of phosphorous.
To one ton of iron ore, 1000 pounds of rock lime is added, and this material hav-
ing a great aﬂinity for phosphorous, takes up this element from the iron, and when drawn from the converter, the slag is at the top and usually runs about ﬁfty per cent. of the original charge.
At the steel works in this country I un-
derstand the slag is cooled with water which cracks it into small pieces, it is then used to balast railroads. We pay from $20 to $22 per ton in large lots for the imported product which runs about 17 per cent. available phosphoric acid, and 50 per cent. of lime. If the Ala-
bama slag is of the same quality is seems to me that our jacksonville manufactur-
ers could give us a pure form of phos-
phoric acid, and at less expense than the high grade acid phosphate is now costing us.
During our meeting at St. Augustine Mr. C. G. White gave us the results of some very interesting tests made in growing Irish potatoes with slag phos-
phate, and says, “Slag phosphate does sur-
prisingly well and as far as one test goes, sustains the European experiments as to its value on sour soils, also the re-
sults at the Ohio Experimental Station.”
Why is it we have so little exchange of thought in regard to fertilizer? Is it be-
cause we are ashamed to admit a lack of knowledge, or that we are perfectly satis-
ﬁed with our own mixtures or manufac-
tured goods? Even if we are, I believe we should express ourselves more fully,
thereby saving the Novice much time and expense.
This subject has been discussed in the meetings for several years and many plans have been given in recent reports for surface and sub-irrigations. Proba-
bly the best plan for sub-irrigation is that in use at Sanford among the vegetable growers, and fully discribed in Year Book for 1903, page 60. It is just as necessa-
ry to have drainage, as irrigation, and if I could have only the one, I would choose drainage, but with this plan at Sanford it acts for both. Water from artesian wells being the source of supply.
These wells are less than half the depth of those in the Manatee section, I have never heard that the water from the San-
ford wells has an injurious effect.
We, on the Manatee use surface irriga-
tion from artesian wells, carrying the wa-
ter either through cement pipes under ground, in ditches, or canvas hose to all parts of the grove.
Some assert that artesian water has kill-
ed a great many trees, we admit that in some cases this is true, but largely due to the lack of drainage. An excess of rain fall would probably have the same effect.
We should be cautious as we approach the rainy season and not ﬁll our soil too full of water, for if we do we shall certainly suffer from the result.
The following is a discription of the ir-
rigating plant of the Wills grove at Suth-
erland Florida, as given me by Mr. Wills.
The plant is supplied from a pond or small lake, with this as you will see, he can spray his trees with clear water for the red spider and purple mite.
SUTHERLAND, FLA., APRIL 24, 1906.

ary pump, with a ﬁve-inch suction and a four-inch discharge maximum capacity of which, is 335 gallons per minute, with a guaranteed capacity of 250 gallons per minute. We have a four-inch main run-
ning through the center of the 30 acres under Irrigation and from this main are laterals every 150 feet, starting out with two-inch pipe and running down to one inch, with three—fourths inch stand pipes I 50 feet apart over the entire 30 acres, so that a 75 foot piece of three—fourth inch hose connected with two opposite hydrants will meet each other. The spray rods are made of three-fourth inch pipe, six feet long tapered down to a point at the lower end to stick into the ground, with a T about 18 inches from the lower end for connecting the hose and on top of the spray rod is a McGowan sprayer.. We run twenty sprays at a time with three-
fourth inch hose moving them from cen-
ter to center, when the ground is sufﬁci-
ently moistened. Last year I found that our twenty spray rods were giving twelve gallons per minute all over the grove, it took us six days last May to spray the en-
tire grove, with an amount of water equal to one inch of rain fall, according to ﬁg-
ures given to me by Prof. Rolfs. that is,
it will take about four or ﬁve hundred gallons to every 30 square feet to equal one inch of rain fall. The engine that we are using is made by the White-Blakleslee Manufacturing Company, of Birming—
ham, Alabama. We have a three-thou-
sand gallon Tank thirty feet from the ground, connected with our Irrigating Plant, this gives us pressure enough to wash d0wn our budded trees through one-
hundred feet of three-fourth inch hose with a nozzle on same without using the Engine, two men working at a time.
With the Engine running we can easily wash down trees from thirty to thirty-
ﬁve feet through ten or twelve lines of hose at a time. We are now trying to wash the spider off the grape fruit trees with the tank pressure, as we cannot get suﬁicient labor to work many nozzles at a time.

DISCUSSION.
Dr. Bessey.—Mr. President, I would like to ask whether any one present is familiar with the recent work that has been done with the processes invented in Germany for combining calcium with nitrogen of the air; it has been shown that this compound can be produced very cheaply and very satisfactory results have been claimed for it.
No response.
Maj. Healey.—In the old days we used to ﬁght this fertilizer business to a ﬁnish.
We did not have quite so much science then as we have now. It strikes me that if these fertilizer men would give us an
“electro-magnate" that would turn us out ten hours work for $1.00, it would be of interest to us. The time was when this society was the best posted of any in the United States but that was the time be-
fore it fell into the hands of the fertilizer men. We thrashed out our own compost pile and I think we were capable of know—
ing how to combine the necessary ele-
ments to make up the necessary fertilizer for a large grove.
It is a curious proposition that of all the members here on the fertilizer com-
mittee that not a man has a word to say as to where the cheapest source of am-
monia can be found. He says, if you will use my fertilizer you will get a cer-

tain percent. of ammonia and a certain percent. of nitrate. I know there are growers here who have been making nitrate with beggarweeds. The reason I do not use the cow pen is because I have not the cows.
Now we are here to get at the manner of producing a crop from the ground.
We are the ones who produce it and the oth'er fellow is the man who lives on the producer (applause)._ He sells us the stuff, we give him our check, it is placed in the bank and we have to pay it. You can make your soil just as rich with one tenth of the money if you choose to do it.
I have land on which I have raised three crops of corn. When I ﬁrst began to use it, it would not produce more than
ﬁve bushels of corn to the acre, but now I am getting at least twenty bushels to the acre without one pound of fertilizer.
If you can do this in a corn ﬁeld, it can be done in any other ﬁeld. I know, no man can gainsay the fact that this is a true statement.
Professor Blair.—-I would like to see Maj. Healey raise velvet beans on pine-
apple land.
Maj. Healey.—If I were raising pine-
apples, I would raise them the same way I do velvet beans. I have no wish to say what a gentleman should do with his soil, but I wish to say that if you will raise three crops of velvet beans on it,
you will have better success with your pineapples.
Now as stated before, we were not so poor in the old days, we found how much of the chemical fertilizer to put on the soil without knowing its use. I say to this audience that I have land that I wish I did not own, for just as long as it is there I am fool enough to do something with it. It was one time what was called when I was young, an orange grove. It is a sad sight now and I presume it will always be a sad sight to my pocket book.
I own it under the “homestead act” and you understand how that is- I said that it was really a good looking grove and since 1895 I have never put one pound of fertilizer on it, it has been made on vel-
vet beans and beggar weeds. There is potash enough in that to make a grove.
Much to my surprise one of my men said to me last year that there were some oranges on my grove, I went over and looked through the grove and sure enough there was a good crop of fruit and I concluded to ship them and am sorry. for they brought me some money and that was an inducement for me to go to work ahd make another orange grove.
This proves to you that while you can put the enormous sum of eighty pounds of fertilizer to the tree, yet you can get good results from the velvet bean and beggar weed. _
Now Mr. Chairman, I hope this fertili-
zer question will be taken up by this audience and let us see _if we can get down to absolute facts, and see if the old time fool orange grower cannot thrash this down to $50 per year for oranges.
Mr. W ood.—Mr. President, I note that on the ﬁrst paper on this subject the writer recommended the plowing under of green crops. My opinion is that it is much better to let the crop (lie on the ground.
Prof. Stockbridge.-—I am quite sure that the author of that paper through an oversight inadvertantly used the word
“green” when he should not have done so. In the country from whence he came they term green crop what we call cover crop, and that is what he meant to say.
Professor Blain—just one word. I

want to say that the value of both the beggarweed and velvet bean was especial-
ly pointed out in a previous paper.
Mr. Hart—I just want to say that ac-
cording to my knowledge of things, it is easy to make land rich by growing velvet beans or beggarweed, though I would not advise the former in orange' groves.
Beggarweed is a proﬁtable crop when the trees are small but when they get larger and shade the ground it will make little growth. In previous years the poli-
cy of growing velvet beans for orange trees has been discussed; the beggarweed I indorse fully wherever it may grow,
whether in orange groves or any where else, but we have to use commercial fer-
tilizers with it to properly balance the ration. I do not believe we can get the nitrogen we want from beggarweed or velvet beans, after the orange trees inter-
lock their limbs. '
Mr. Hubbard—At the risk of repeat—
ing what may already be known by the members, I will relate the experience of Mr. Butler in the raising of beggar-
weed for nitrogen. He had good trees but no fruit. He had an analysis of the soil made and also for 100 boxes of orang-
es to the acre. The top foot of soil con-
tained about enough ammonia for one to two crops, phosphoric acid for 3 ﬂops and potash for only I 1-2 crops. He then began to use commercial fertilizers,
He studied this question and decided to use beggarweed to gather nitrogen for the reason that it did not produce any soldier bugs to work on the fruit, the consequence was that after three or four years using only phosphoric acid and potash he gathered so much ni-
trogen that he had to take a mower and mow down the beggar weed to prevent die back taking his trees.

Report of the Committee on Nut Culture.
BY H. K. MILLER.
:11); President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject that has been assigned us is rapidly becoming a very live one throughout the South, owing to the great interest now being manifested in the com-
mercial development of the pecan indus-
try. The consumption of nuts in the United States is steadily increasing and we are importing approximately six mil-
lions of dollars worth of nuts, in addition to consuming virtually all the home sup-
ply. In as much as nuts have been, until recent years, regarded as a luxury rather than a staple article of food, and since the reform movement now existing through-
out the country in the matter of more rational foods is strongly advocating the liberal use of nuts as a partial substitute for meats, it may conﬁdently be expected that the demand will rapidly increase.
Already the prices have been steadily ad-
vancing and the ordinary pecans, which a few years since were marketed at ﬁve and six cents a pound are now command-
ing eight to twelve cents, while the fancy pecans readily sell at twenty cents to one dollar per pound.
A health food company in New York,
of about two years standing, is making a specialty of nut food products and here-
tofore have imported the nuts of the edi-
ble pine to be used as a basis for their preparations. However, the demand for their output has increased to such an ex-
tent that the company is already consider-
ing means by which this constantly in-
creasing demand is to be met. Naturally it has under consideration the pecan and is endeavoring to perfect machinery that will enable the substitution being made.
The Persian or English walnut indus-
try has been ﬁrmly established in Califor-
nia and such renumerative prices obtain-
ed that land in that state suitable for wal-
nut culture has increased in value ﬁve fold. Some of the reported incomes from well established orchards are almost in-
credible. Not only is nut growing wor-
thy of our most serious consideration and earnest efforts because of its commercial possibilities, but like fruit trees in proper assortment, a few nut trees merely for home use adds materially to the pleasure and interest of the home. Besides sup-
plying a wholesome and palatable food,
the trees themselves add much in the way of making attractive surroundings. It is difﬁcult to estimate the value that a few nut trees will add to the home.
In presenting this subject brief consid-
eration will be given some of the more important nut bearing trees that are adap-
ted to this state. giving greater attention to the pecan, which so far as known is capable of forming the basis of an indus-
try of considerable magnitude.
COCOANUTS.
In the southern part of the state along the Atlantic Coast is to be found cocoa-
nuts growing wild. These have been es-
tablished there by nuts being' washed

ashore. By selecting choice strains of nuts for seeds, the cultivation of the cocoanut may be attempted near the shore where only light frosts occur, however, it is questionable if proﬁtable returns can be expected. The nuts may be planted in place ﬁfteen to twenty feet apart or bet-
ter planted in trenches in moist soil and transplanted after the seed leaf is well developed.
Little is to be done in way of cultiva-
tion except to prevent other plants from encroaching on the young palms for a few years. Mulching is advantageous as also is the use of fertilizer, however, the returns will not admit of much outlay.
Our supply of these nuts is derived, for the most part, from the wild groves of the tropics. The palm is an attractive plant and ﬁnds considerable use as an or—
namental.
THE CHESTNUTS.
Three species of the chestnut are culti-
vated in America: The native American chestnut, the European chestnut, and the Japanese chestnut, besides we have the chinquapin, a dwarf and small fruited Castaneas. though occasionally the chin-
quapin is found to be a tree of considera-
ble size. A few chinquapins of large size are being propagated which apparently will succeed here. yet it is rather too early to say they will prove of sufﬁcient merit to deserve extensive planting.
These are supposed to be hybrids com-
bining the size of the chestnut with the good ﬂavor of the chinquapin. Trees may be set twenty feet and thinned after crowding begins, thus securing several crops on land otherwise unoccupied, else they may be given greater distance and
ﬁeld crops grown between the trees until the land is given up to them entirely.
Clean culture is to be recommended du—
ring the spring. Spraying with Bordeaux will hold in check the fungus diseases,
but for the weevils, which are the most serious pests, there apparently has been no satisfactory remedy proposed.
WALNUTS.
The commercial growing of the walnut in this country is conﬁned to the English or Persian walnut and while this species is hardy in the east as far north as New York, and trees known to bear frequent-
ly in the southern and eastern states. no attempt is made to grow this nut on a large scale in these localities. In south-
ern California. however. the production of walnuts has assumed important pro-
portions and perhaps ranks only second to the citrus production of the state. Lit-
tle encouragement for growing the En-
glish walnut in a commercial way in Florida can be given, but in as much as bearing trees are reported to exist in the state it is worthy of trial in a limited way.
A rather open alluvial soil seems best for this species. One disadvantage here is root-knot, but this may be avoided by using the black walnut as a stock. Trees bear in four to six years.
The Japanese walnuts will thrive in our state and should have a place in every nut growers collection. The cordifor-
mis is the most desirable variety and may be grown from seed. This tree is attrac-
tive and is being used as a shade tree.
Some towns and cities in the south are now planting them on their streets. The Black or native walnut of the east does well here and while the nut is exceedingly rich the thickness of the shell is against it as a commercial nut. It is held in greater favor in the north than in the south and there commands'a price, but one that is too low to make the cultiva-

tion of this variety for its fruit proﬁtable.
The cheif value of the black walnut lies in the character of its wood which is useful for furniture. The high price of this timber it seems would induce a liberal planting for timber purposes on much of our waste land. The chief obstacle seems to be the long time necessary to grow salable trees. Little attempt has been made to improve the Black walnut or to made to improve the black walnut or to seems to be an inviting ﬁeld for the plant breeder.
HICKORY NUT.
There are a number of species of this nut other than the pecan, which is by far the most important, and some are prized for their delicate ﬂavor, yet, excluding the pe-
can, very little has been accomplished in cultivating these native trees. The hicko-
ries are for the most part of slow growth and the wood is useul on account of its toughness for manufacturing purposes.
Some effort has been made at cultivating the shellbark and shagbark, but the trees are difﬁcult to propegate and are slow growers, however, the nuts are of deli-
cate ﬂavor and the shells comparatively thin. Of all the species of hickory the pecan is easily the most important from a horticultural standpoint; indeed it may well rank ﬁrst in cultural value of all our native nuts. Possessing as it does so many desirable qualities such as rapid growth, productiveness, hardiness, long life and comparative freedom' from dis-
ease and insect pests, and yielding a nut with thin shell having a plump, nutri-
tive and delicately ﬂavored kernel, it seems strange its possibilities were not earlier recognized. Only within the past thirty years has any systematic eﬂ‘ort been made to establish commercial orchards,
and even now, by far the greater part of our supply is derived from the wild trees of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Be-
sides ﬁnding the pecan native in these states, it is also indigenous to the low—
lands of the Mississippi river and its chief tributaries extending as far north as Indi-
ana and Iowa. It has been introduced in the southern states east of the Mississippi and in general, where proper soil condi—
tions prevail has been found to succeed throughout the cotton area. The tree under favorable conditions attains a height of one hundred to one hundred and seventy ﬁve feet with spreading branches so as to produce a majestic dome-like appearance. The foliage is bright and pleasing, thus making the in many of the southern states. These were set with seedling trees, and in many cases, the soil was not wisely selected.
This with the prevailing notion that the trees required no attention, and hence neglected, resulted in disappointment in a majority of instances, and interest in planting almost died out. Still a few pioneers persisted in their efforts to mas—
ter the situation. Grafted trees were sub—
stituted for seedlings, which had prover:
so unsatisfactory, and greater care given to cultivation and selection of soil. 'So much better results followed that interest began to slowly manifest itself once more and has been steadily increasing. A num-
ber of growers in different sections have been making special study of the pecan within the past decade with a view to solv-
pecan one of our most valuable shade trees. The planting of orchards was undertaken some thirty years ago and rather extensive proportions were reached ing the problems involved, with such happy results that many of the barriers to success have been removed and reliable

infomntion is now available. Previously little that was authentic was to be found.
Only in recent years has it been possible to secure trees of good varieties in quanti-
ty and still the supply is short of the de-
mand, on account of the scarcity of graft—
ing scions and the difﬁculty of successful propagation.
By means of improved methods of grafting and budding the output has in-
creased very much in the past four years.
In the attempts to grow trees from seeds the greatest variations were met with,
few if any producing nuts like the one planted. In most cases the nuts were in-
ferior to the original, the trees were of different character, some growing rapid-
ly, others making ordinary growth, and still others very slow growers. On this account the seedling orchards present a very irregular and unsatisfactory appear-
ance, with trees of same age ranging from a few feet to thirty feet in height.
Equal variation exists in the time of bear-
ing, some bearing at the age of ﬁve years and others still barren at twenty. Very different the results from varietal stock.
With budded or grafted trees growth is more uniform and even faster than that of the parent tree. Bearing begins much earlier, generally at from three to six years from planting, and the nuts are uniformly like those from the original tree. Attention is here called to the fact that an opinion prevails, that nuts from an isolated tree will produce trees which bear nuts identical with the one planted.
This is partly due to parties owning such trees advertising the‘ nuts for seed, per-
haps ignorant of the well established prin-
cipfe that a self pollenat'ed tree is the surest one to yield inferior seeds. The range for pecan pfanting in this state ex-
tends southward to the lake region.
Planting south of this region should not be attempted, except in a small way, until a more thorough trial has been given. In selecting a soil for a pecan orchard pre—
ference should be given to a sandy loam with a sand mixed clay subsoil, the richer the better. Success may be had on a great variety of soils, ranging from almost pure sand to rather stiﬁ clay. A thirsty soil or one that is always wet is to be avoided. A soil that will admit easy pene-
tration by the roots and retain moisture in liberal degree is to be desired. Plant-
ing, care, cultivation and methods of pro-
pagation will be discussed in papers by the other members of the committee.
The parent trees of the named varieties of pecans were of course seedlings and it is rather strange that among the vast number of seedlings that exist through-
out the south, such a small number have been found of suﬁicient merit to be given a name and be propagated. Among the older varieties Stuart, Van Deman and Frostcher represent the best. Van De-
man is superior to the others for table use but for commercial purposes in the ordinary sense Stuart and Frostcher are in the lead. Among the varieties more recently introduced Schley, Success. Rus-
sell, Dewey, Delmas, Georgia, Curtis and a number of others may be mentioned. It is beyond the scope of this paper to de-
scribe the different varieties but among the ten above mentioned can be found varieties that are adapted to all require-
ments. Proper appreciation for the dif-
ferences existing between varieties is lacking, and the prospective planter might consider' this subject thoroughly, with proﬁt to himself. There are varieties that are worthless and it will be a happy day when all these are discarded.
There are other varieties which are ex-

cellent in some localities and worthless in others. In this state, however, most any variety that has merit may be expected to succeed. It is good policy to plant at least three varieties in an orchard; what these are to be can only be best determined from a knowledge of the object in view and the location of the land. Some of the more recently introduced varieties are much superior to any of the older standards,
especially in quality of the nuts. Each of the good varieties has its disadvant-
ages, as well as points of merit and it can be said the perfect variety is yet to be
' found.
Successful pecan culture like all other remunerative enterprises is not to be had without effort. The same problems are to be met as in other lines of horticulture,
the only difference being that at present there is prospectively smoother sailing ahead than in other lines. Cultivation,
care, fertilizing and warfare on insects will demand attention. Fortunately the list of insects is not so large nor are these so serious as those which affect the apple,
yet there is sufﬁcient injury to warrant a declaration of war on our part. In con-
nection with this paper a Spray Calendar by Prof. H. A. Gossard will be presented.
In conclusion, it is to be remembered the pecan industry is young, in fact, very young, considering the possibilities that have been lying dormant so long. With many of the difﬁculties removed by a bet-
ter knowledge of the requirements for successful] culture, we may expect rapid progress in the next few years; Young orchards now coming into bearing yield-
ing nuts of superior quality that command a fancy price is giving impetus to the movement. The returns to he expected have largely been a matter of speculation and single trees have been made the basis of estimates. Sufﬁcient progress has been made t'o furnish reliable information and in a few more years exact data may be expected. The expectation of enormous proﬁts is not to be indulged in, yet, com-
pared with other lines of a horticultural nature, very proﬁtable returns may safely be expected and after the trees are large enough to occupy the land, a few acres should yield a good income with small annual outlay.
The question of overproduction seems to cause some concern, however, when we consider the time that must elapse before any very great increase can be expected,
the rapidity with which the demand is in-
creasing and remembering that we have the world for a market, with exportation not yet begun, there need be little fear from this source in our day. Besides, the millions of pounds of common pecans must ﬁrst give place to the improved va-
rieties.
There are many features of nut cul-
ture that might be dwelt upon but it is beyond the scope of this paper. From a careful. review of the subject there seems to be no more inviting ﬁeld of endeavor awaiting the young horticulturist than the culture of nut trees in the south

NUT CULTURE.
BY J. H., WYLIE’ INTERLACHEN, FLA.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Chairman of our Committee on Nut Culture, some time ago requested that I make a short report at this meeting as to planting and cultivating Pecan trees.
I regret to state that this subject has been neglected by our Society for the past two years, we receive a great many in-
quires regarding the setting out, care and cultivation of Pecan groves in this State,
and it is now considered “an important industry.” Increasing and more intelli-
gent attention is being given each year to the planting and cultivation of the Pecan.
The permanent and increasing value of the tree is realized. We believe the out—
look for the industry is brighter than ever.
The demand for ﬁne nuts for table and confectionery purposes is constant, and the supply of ﬁne nuts is entirely inade-
quate.
WHEN AND HOW TO PLANT.
In this State Pecan trees may be set any time after the leaves drop in the fall varying with the season, but nearly al-
ways by the ﬁrst of December until the end of March. It is essential however that the trees be dormant. As to distance apart we prefer to set the trees 40x40 or
50x50 feet. -
In setting out a Pecan tree, a hole twen-
ty-four inches in diameter and deep enough to accomodate length of tap root is usually large enough although larger holes and wider may be dug with advan-
tage, more especially where any fertilizer is used in planting the trees. Well-rotted manure or good commercial fertilizer may be put in outer sides of hole, an inch or two beyond the lateral roots when the hole is being ﬁlled, but not in direct con-
tact with the roots, work and ﬁrmly press the soil among the roots, laying each root in its natural position, no holes or cavities should be left and the soil should be in close contact with the tap root after wa-
tering and it is also very important that no part of the crown or root be left ex-
posed to the air. It is better to plant them an inch or two deeper than they stood in the nursersy than to have the crown roots exposed.
In Pecan groves low growing crops such as peas, melons potatoes, peanuts,
cotton, truck etc. may be planted proﬁt-
ably.
BUDDED AND GRAFTED TREES COMPARED
\VITH SEEDLINGS.
This covers an important feature of the Pecan Industry. Grafted and budded trees have advantage over seedlings be-
cause they usually begin to bear much ear-
lier than seedlings they reproduce the va-
riety from which buds and grafts were taken; perpetuation of the-early~ heavy and anual bearing of the parent tree is ob-
tained; also greater care and attention usually given them on account of their greater cost.
' As a result of the variable success at-
tending the propogation of Pecans by budding and grafting and the compara-

107
tive slowness of the precesses as com-
pared with the simpler propagation of peaches and plums oranges etc., the trees must necessarily sell at a price which al-
lows a margin to cover great losses in budding and grafting from unfavorable weather such as droughts or excessive rains, another'consideration the cost of grafting and budwood, which is a sacri-
ﬁce of nuts from choice bearing trees by the cutting therefrom of scions or bud-
ding wood. Again the disﬁgurement of seedling trees where buds or grafts fail to take the ﬁrst season.
DISAPPOINTMENT.
There will be many disappointments in Pecans to those who have planted the
“cheapest” trees fliey could buy without investigating source of variety of trees or reliability of party who follows the busi-
ness of selling them.
Now is it not very plain to all that it is folly for anyone to risk the use of land for years expense of cultivating etc., to save a few cents on a tree, when for a triﬂing increase in the price he can get the very best warranted stock?
Most of the worthless stock is worked off by strange agents, who sell on their own account and are not authorized by any responsible ﬁrm to take orders for them. Such men buy up refused stock from large nurseries for almost nothing and ﬁll their orders with it claiming it to be good. They also frequently warrant the stock, but as they the unknown or ir-
responsible, their warranty is absolutely worthless. If people would consider this fact, and buy only from agents who can show a certiﬁcate authorizing them to rep-
resent a responsible ﬁrm, there would be less danger of being cheated.
Our attention has been called to cer-
tain tree peddlers in this State buying seedling Pecan trees that had been graf-
ted but grafts having failed to take new sprouts would naturally come out and make a nice healthy top; such trees being worth about ten to twenty cents, have been sold for grafted stock at $1.00 to
$1.50 each.
It will be heart-breaking to' those who have planted such trees relying upon them to support them in their old age to ﬁnd they have been cheated and swindled and all hope of rest and peace in their declin-
ing years vanished. Men will die and leave “Pecan Groves” of this kind to their widows and children—with what result?
Hoods MONU M ENT The accompanying clipping from the daily press dispatches is very signiﬁcant and means much, not only for Texas, but for the entire country. It shows an ap-
preciation of the value of nut trees by a prominent man who had the welfare of the masses at heart and who chose the time of his departure from earth to im-
press the injunction upon his family and,
through them, on the public at large.
“I want no monument of stone,"
he said, “but let my children plant at the head of my grave a pecan tree and at the foot of my grave a walnut tree, and when theSe trees shall bear let the pecans and the walnuts be given out among the plain people of Texas, so that they may plant them and make Texas a land of trees.”
Such a monument will not only perpet-
uate the memory of Gov. Hogg—gener-
ations to come will share in the beneﬁcial results which will follow the stimulus thus given to the nut growing industry, which is only now beginning to attract the at-

tention it merits from every one who owns a farm or village home.
Gov. Hogg was a man of wide exper-
ience, a close observer of cause and effect and he doubtless saw in the future of nut growing much to interest him and much of prospective good to his state. We like monuments of this kind, that help others to better lives and more proﬁtable and pleasant surroundings.
The statement is generally made that the Pecan will succeed wherever the large species of hickory are found in the State,
and this is doubtless true, as the Pecan belongs to the same family of trees.
Our experience in a small way in graft-
ing some of the choice varieties of Pecan on young Hickory has been very satis—
factory, as to the growth, and we trust in a few years to 'be able to make a good re—
port as to our success in getting them to bear fruit.
In working the pecan on hickory we
ﬁnd it an advantage to graft under ground and for this reason advise select-
ing the small trees in the forest where a grove may be desired on account of the hickory ‘being plentiful.
There is no doubt that the Pecan is ex-
tremely hard to work, and only when the budding or grafting is done by an exper-
ienced hand is it likely that good results will be obtained.
The Pecan will grow on any soil ex-
cept springy boggy land where the water stands near the surface or where the soil is underlaid with ledge rock at a slight depth. *
AN ENTOMOLOGICAL CALENDAR FOR THE PECAN.

BY H. A. GOSSARD.
11] r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The following calendar is approximate-
ly accurate but must be admitted to be in a measure conjectural, because observa-
tions on pecan insects have not yet been sufﬁciently thorough to make possible an absolutely authoritative schedule. We hope that this imperfect one will stimulate observation and thereby contribute to the making of a perfect one in the near fu-
ture.
JANUARY.
The twig girdler is at this time, a lar-
va tunneling in the fallen twigs which were severed in the preceding fall. These infested twigs may be gathered and burned.
Other fallen limbs may contain larvae and pupae of the oak pruner, hence,
should be collected and burned.
The larvae and pupae of various borers are in their tunnels in the heart—wood of the trunks. The burrows may be located by the particles of sawdust on the ground and clinging to the bark beneath the ex-
ternal openings; also by the discolored bark below the oriﬁces, caused by the 002-
ing of the sap. By means of a spring bot-
tom can or in some similar manner, inject bisulphide of carbon or chloroform into the furrows and at once stop the openings

with grafting wax or with a wad of clay mud.
The larvae and pupae of the hickory shuck worm are in the fallen and decay-
ing hulls beneath the trees, which may be raked up and burned. The larvae and pupae of this insect, are known to be found in the fallen hulls in December and therefore presume they remain here until early in the summer when new hulls are forming.
Two or three budworms and case-
worms are hibernating in small brownish,
blister-like cocoons and saber-shaped cas-
es on and about the budscales and on the bark of branches. Reasoning from analo-
gy, spraying with the lime-sulphur wash would probably be useful against them.
Grafts may be cleansed of the cocoons and cases by means of a knife point, before be—
ing used.
The cottony scale is in the larval form on the branches at this season. The dor—
mant winter period is the time to treat it;
spray with kerosene emulsion, one part of emulsion to ﬁve or six parts of water.
Pruning can also be effectively used against this pest at this season, the infest-
ed twigs being cut out and burned.
FEBRUARY.
Calendar and pratice ditto as for Jan-
uary.
MARCH.
Practically the same as for February.
APRIL.
Simultaneously with the bursting of the buds in late March and early April, the different species of bud worms and case-
worms commence a most destructive at-
tack. They burrow into the buds and also into the tender twigs. Two of these insects are caseworms, one of them being commonly observed and of considerable size, the other being much smaller and
ﬁnally maturing a case resembling a min-
iature cigar. The third species, after quit-
ting the buds, becomes a leaf-roller and lives in a tube made by folding over itself the border of a leaf. Later it gathers a cluster of leaves to the original one, mak-
ing a conspicuous nest. The larger case—
worm also clusters leaves together into a nest and several caterpillars may be found in the same cluster. If these insects can be successfully treated in the same way as the better known budworms and case-
worms, a spraying with arsenicals should be made while the leaf—buds are swollen,
just before they burst. A second spray-
ing should be made about a week later than the ﬁrst, just where the leaf-buds begin to show green at the tips. A third application should be made as soon as the leaves are expanded. Owing to its ad—
hesive qualities, arsenate of lead will doubtless prove more satisfactory for spraying pecans than Paris green. It will be wise to make one of the ﬁrst two and the third of these sprayings a com-
bination of an arsenite with bordeaux mixture.
The large, leathery skinned caterpil-
lars of the Catocala moths. sometimes known as “alligator” worms, begin their depredations this month. They feed at night and by day lie concealed in crevices of the bark. or under trash on the ground.
This protective coloration makes their dis—
covery difﬁcult. Spraying with the ar—
senites ought to check them. The bud—
worm spraying will catch these insects also. Right after a rain when the bark is discolored by wetting, the lighter color of the worms renders their detection more easy and it is possible to collect and de-
stroy many by hand. If the trunks are

kept wrapped with burlap bands, many caterpillars will retreat beneath these for hiding and the next morning they can be collected and crushed or thrown into a pail containing kerosense and water. If a sticky band of some kind_ such a “tree tangle foot,” made by the O. and W.
T hum C0. Grand Rapids, Michigan, be put around the trunk below the band to prevent any of the worms passing to the ground, it would seem possible to catch nearly all of them in a very few nights.
Thus far, we have heard of no complaint that “tree tangle foot" injures the tree.
In late March and early April, the eggs of the fall webworm are laid on the leaves in clusters of 400 to 500. In a week or ten days, these eggs hatch into very hairy,
large-headed caterpillars, which always live in webs that are enlarged according to need, where spraying-with arsenicals is regularly practiced they are not apt to become numerous, but where no spraying is done, the young nests should be pruned out and burned; or a torch of fat pine,
attached to a pole, may be held beneath the nest until the worms are destroyed.
The eggs of the Pecan tree borer, Sesia scitula, are probably laid in April and early May. Since the young borers usu-
ally enter the sapwood through some wound in the bark, such as a graft union,
all such scars should be well covered at this time with grafting wax with which white arsenic or Paris green has been mixed. Coat over the wax protection with whale oil soap which has been dilut-
ed with enough water to give it the con-
sistency of thick paint. Pour into this soap paint enough. crude carbolic acid to give it a strong odor, and apply with a brush at the beginning of a bright,
sunny day. Before night a tough. sticky
ﬁlm should form which is not readily dis-
solved by rain. Any wounds inﬂicted during the course of cultivation should be at once covered with some such mix-
ture as this.
MAY.
All of the species, hatching in April,
will extend their damage over into May,
spraying with arsenicals may be continu-
ed against caseworms and caterpillars if the previous treatments were insufﬁcient.
Many of the measures already suggested for April work against other insects will need to be continued into May. The moths of the caseworms, budwonm, etc,
begin to appear in numbers this month and may be started up from their resting places on the leaves, on the trunks, in the mulch at the bases of the trees, etc.
The diﬁ‘erent species of heartwood and bark borers are apt to commence egg-
laying this month, hence it will be wise to keep the trunks and larger limbs cov-
ered with white-wash which may be ap-
plied with a spray pump. Some port-
land cement added to the whitewash will doubtless add to its eﬁiciency, since our object is to ﬁll the interstices of the bark and make a covering over the whole trunk which the young borers cannot penetrate when they emerge from the egg.
Possibly a further addition of one pound of Paris green or white arsenic to every
ﬁfty gallons of the white-wash would be good.
During the ﬁrst half of May, the eggs for the walnut caterpillar are laid on the tender surfaces of the leaves, usually those of the lower branches. These are found in clusters of several hundred and before hatching become of a glistening white color. The young caterpillars feed gregariously and when ﬁrst observed, the few leaves on which they are found may

III be plucked and the whole colony destroy—
ed. At _a later stage, spray with arseni-
cals.
JUNE.
The young caterpillars of the bud-
worms and caseworms are hatching from the eggs and would seem to be amendable to treatment with arsenical sprays.
Though some of them must extend their bodies out of their encasing tubes to feed,
and others have in a measure the habits of leaf miners, all consume more or less or the epidermis, hence can possibly be killed with poisons. Continue the work of May against webworms and the wal-
nut caterpillars collect in masses on the trunks of the trees to moult, kill them by means of a burning torch or by crushing.
A ring of “ tree tangle foot” put around the trunk above the_ mass before begin-
ning the slaughter will prevent any es-
caping worms from reascending the tree,
though they may seek other neighboring trees and here continue their develop-
ment. If necessary repeat the white-
washing against the borers so as to keep the coating intact.
JULY.
Young caseworms and budworms working on leaves and can likely be check-
ed by spraying with poisons. Because of copious rains in spring it may be found more advantageous to spray for these in-
sects during the drier months of summer and fall. The second brood of web-
worms may be expected to put in their appearance about this time. It is probably that a second brood of catocalas or “alli-
gator worms” also appear at about this time, since the moths of at least one spe-
cies issue in June and early July. Ex-
amine the white-wash coating on the trunks and renew if necessary.
AUGUST, SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.
Budworms and caseworms continue feeding during August and part of Sep-
ber, but usually ensconce themselves in winter quarters before October. The whitewash may need renewing in August but this is unlikely if cement was used the preceding application. The second brood of webworms become conspicuous during this period, so also does the sec-
ond brood of walnut caterpillars. The twig girdler is busy in September and October laying their eggs and girdling the twigs in which the eggs are laid.
NOVEM BER AND DECEMBER.
Insects and practice about ditto as given for January and February.
Inspect the roots carefully to ascertain if root borers are present. If any are found, treat with carbon bisulphide. Fill up all cavities in the trunk with cement,
ﬁrst cutting out all rotten wood and singe-
ing the cut surface with a blast lamp to destroy the spores of any rot fungi that may be present. This will do away with a favorite hiding place for hibernating forms, such as the pupoe of the fall web-
worm.

REPORT ON NUT CULTURE.
BY C. F. BARBER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Having been appointed by the Presi-
dent as one of the committee on this im-
portant committee and being satisﬁed that the question will be thoroughly covered by the other distinguished committeemen I shall make my report very short and shall deal with the growing of Pecans and leave the question of the growing of other nuts to the other committeemen.
I believe that the Pecan is the only nut that can be raised for a proﬁt in the state of Florida and I do not think it ad-
visable to attempt to raise a seedling Pe-
can grove. My observation has been,
that the bearing qualities are very uncer-
tain. I will not attempt to explain what varieties are best to plant in Florida;
that part of our report I will leave to the other committeemen.
Budding and grafting has proven to be very expensive to nurserymen there-
fore, to plant out a grove with budded or grafted Pecans is much more expensive than it would be to plant the same grove with seedlings but the assurance of having trees bearing earlier with chances of a crops of nuts each year will more than pay the difference in putting out the grove. My experience has been far more satisfactory with buds than with graft-
ing. Where a nurseryman has irriga-
tion, I think the grafting has proven to be as satisfactory and possibly more so than the budding. Most all land in ’the state of Florida has proven to be very satisfactory in raising Pecan trees. The low stiff soil with a clay subsoil anywhere from two to ﬁve foot seems to be the best land to grow Pecan trees on. Pecan trees will stand most any amount of water on low land without any injury to the trees.
They will not do much on land that is underlaid with quick sand or land that is better known as sand soaked land. The Pecans are usually regarded as a difficult subject to deal with in transplanting; af-
ter they have been transplanted for twelve months and get started to growing then a rapid growth can be put on them each year with the proper attention paid to them. I ﬁnd that barn-yard compost is the best fertilizer to use around the Pe—
can trees. I raised one year old buds last season on two year old roots that grew ﬁve to six foot and some larger.
Pecan trees should be transplanted in December or January to get the most sat-
isfactory results in growing off. I don’t think it advisable to transplant late in the spring after the sap has started to ﬂow in the stock. My opinion is that it will cause the trees to dwindle and ﬁnally die.
Plant out budded or grafted trees of the best varieties and the results will be sat-
isfactory in years to come.

Report of Standing Committee on Citrus Fruits.

BY L. B. SKINNER.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
When I was notiﬁed of my appoint-
ment as a member of the Committee on Citrus fruits, I made up my mind that I should surely be there, and even up to to-
day I was of the opinion that I would be there, though there has been creeping in-
to my consciousness, the idea that some thing was going to happen to prevent my getting there after all. _
It is with exceeding great regret that I give up the pleasure of meeting “the fruit growers of the State from whom I always learn something of value, and with whom I always enjoy the time spent.
I say time spent, but I ought to rather say,
time saved. The towering practical, Mr.
Waite. the golden, Mr. McCarty, with his pleasant smile, and hearty ways, the faithful, hard working, Mr. Painter, all these I shall miss.
I had_ intended to make a verbal report,
as I had been unable to get any replies from my fellow committeemen, as to what form our report should take.- The wise men from the East, Phelps, Hart,
Hubbard, have recorded, in time past,
about all there is to know of orange cul-
ture and perhaps a little more, and we,
that are learners, would rather sit still and listen that we may learn more, like Sampson, or Boardman. Perhaps in the past year I have learned some things that will be interesting to fruit growers.
I have extensively used a power duster,
and I ﬁnd that it keeps fruit bright, but it induces scale, and a good deal of it.
I ﬁnd that in a multitude of varieties of the orange there is decided trouble. It were better that a good many of these va-
rieties had never been born.
I hear Parson Brown fruit talked up,
it is a pretty poor fruit to my notion, and Marsh Seedless grapefruit, be sure you want it before you plant it. There is none better than the Duncan Grapefruit, but I am afraid that there has been a large quantity of buds, not accurate to name,
of this variety sent out. Not intention-
ally, but by error, and I suppose that ill often happens, in other cases too. It is disappointing to plant Tardiffs, and ﬁnd that you are going to reap Sweet Sevilles,
or Parson Browns, and ﬁnd you have an ordinary seedling.
The Enterprise seedless orange, some-
times called Stark Seedless, is one of the best bearers, and of a very good quality,
of the ordinary oranges, and commercial-
ly, has given me the best of results.
I have been interested in the compari-
son of the Valencia and the Tardiff or-
anges. I thought for a long time that they were one and the same variety, but under a different name. I ﬁnd upon look-
ing them carefully over, that they are really distinct. That they are diﬁerent in several ways. The Valencia is of a deeper color, less of the lemon in color.
Then too the inside of the fruit is better colored than the Tardiﬁ‘. On the other hand I think that the Tardif’f is the better H—8

keeper, both as to season, that is time of shipping, and as to its ability to hold up en route. And as to keeping qualities the fruit en route, that remark opens up to me the one question that occupies my thinker these days to the exclusion of any other.
How shall we make our fruit keep and carry better? What is the reason of the epidemics of rot such as attacked us at times the last two years? If I knew, and could answer these questions aright, you would have a paper worth your listening to. I would like to ask your agricultural chemists what effect nitrate of potash would have on the stability of fruit? I think from a test made for two years that it is decidedly favorable to the keeping quality. I would like to ask some of the professors whether paraﬁine would tend to keep the fruit from rotting.
I would like to ask whether, in the opinion of growers, late cultivation tends to make fruit rot in transit?
The markets are all practically done with Florida citrus fruits, and yet we could just as well grow enough Tardiffs to keep them supplied for six weeks yet.
Suppose there is some waste, what of it.
we can stand it. And grapefruit—I ate grapefruit in July last year from off the tree that was the ﬁnest thing I ever ate on a hot day in my life. I expect to eat it again this year, and if we can get a grape-
fruit in April, May and June, I am willing to risk its selling at a paying price.
I believe the variety to be a distinct va-
riety, but will know better when it is test-
ed longer. We ought to ship citrus fruits from October to june continuously, and when we do, the fruit industry need fear no competition.
James Russell Lowell has an eleventh Beautitude “Blessed is he that has noth-
ing to say and cannot be persuaded to say it.” I am reminded that I would rather work at growing oranges than talk about it. I grow a considerable quan-
tity of fruit, and some of it is the best I ever saw and some of it is the worst, I am sorry to say. I know a very little, I am hoping to learn a great deal more, and again I want to express my regret at not being able to be with you. I wish you a very interesting and proﬁtable meeting.
I know that your officers have been untir-
ing in their efforts at the proper prepara-
tions for such a meeting.

Report of the Committee on Strawberries.

BY R. F. RIGDON.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen."
Strawberries are now one of Florida’s staple crops and brings in to the State each year many thousands of dollars, and at a time of the year when there is not very much other fruit to be had.
The soil best adapted to the growth is a dark sandy loam, underlaid with clay,—if it can be had—if not, any piece of good lowland that can be well drained.
The best varieties as to ﬂavor and ship-
ping qualities, as far as I have tested, are Klondike, Hofman, Improved, Lady Tompson and Excelsior.
The yield per acre is, with a fair sea-
son, about ﬁve thousand quarts, if you have home grown acclimated plants, and about three thousand quarts if you have to get northern grown plants.
Method of culture—First, the land should be plowed from eight to twelve inches deep and then well pulverized be-
fore being bedded, which should be done at least four weeks before setting of plants.
as well selected ground gives a greater assurance of a good stand of plants and they will grow off more quickly and more thriftliy.
The plants should be cultivated after each rain very shallow. about one half to one inch deep.
Method of marketing—The best and safest way to get berries to market is in ice boxes containing sixty ‘four quarts each as they will arrive in the market three days after as fresh as the day that they were picked.
The growth and extent of culture has been very much checked by the rates that the express companies have placed on car-
rying berries to market.
Draw backs are many. — Drought,
freezes and late frosts are all very much against the berry grower, but the worst of all is the express company in their charges to carry berries to market. and at the end the commission men keep the rest and send back for charges.
BY R. K. MUIRHEAD.
iMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I regret exceedingly that I will not be able to be present this year. In for-
mer years I told the society all I knew about strawberries. The only new thing I know of is the time of planting, this should be done in spring instead of fall and the plants worked all through sum-
mer. This will insure large plants and about four times if not ten times the yield.
I have tried it with the best results but the cultivating through the summer Costs money.
The difﬁculty of getting plants is another difﬁculty but they can be got at almost all the northern nurseries, and when planted then the northern growxi plants do very well.

Report of the Committee on Vegetables.
BY W. N. GIST.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I cannot in this paper, convey to your minds a comprehensive idea of the vege-
table industry of the State. It is varied.
It is a deep subject calling forth much energy and “gray” matter, and let me accent the latter if the grower wishes to be successful. It calls for as much care,
thought and energy as the raising of chil-
dren of which we expect to make men and women of the highest types; that may be an honor to the community in which they may be cast.
The vegetable industry is too varied to be discussed fully here at this time, but I may say that it is one of the moneyed industries and possibly would be pardon-
ed for saying that it now brings more dollars into the State than the orange crop. The movement of truck (you know we grow truck and ship stuﬁ),
commencing in November and continues until July. giving nine month’s shipping season for the State; some part of the State having suit that is wanted by the man who has the dollars; all through this period, and the market demand for all our produce is increasing. Twelve years ago the growers around Gainesville would not have thought of shipping a carload of lettuce to New York at one time, now that market can take care of a trainload at paying prices and I might mention other crops. for instance, what effect would Hasting's potato crop have had on the market even ﬁve years ago.
The demand has increased and also the means of distributing, and I might say this part of the business has been seriously neglected. It should be a busi-
ness separate from the growing. The growing and packing is a job big enough for one man, but nearly every trucker thinks (and I’m one of them myself) he can ship his stuff to better advantage than the man who keeps up with that end and makes it a business. giving his entire time and attention to distributing. I There is money in the business! There is also sleepless nights and gray hair to the one who falls a victim.

The Geology of Florida in Relation to Artesian
' Water Supply.
BY DR. E. H. SELLARDS.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
In its general geology Florida is fortu-
nately of comparatively simple structure.
The formations of the state have suffered no great distortion since their deposition and lie for the most part nearly horizon-
tal as formed, or with a slightly accentu-
ated dip. For a clear understanding of the water supply problem a conception of the leading features of the geology of the state is essential.
The underlying foundation rock throughout the state is a massive and very thick limestone. In character the limestone is granular, soft and with many shells, and, for the most part porous.
Borings indicate that water circulates freely through it. The conditions of for-
mation, as indicated by the rock itself,
were, clear water free from land sedi-
ment in which shell life ﬂourished abund-
antly. This foundation limestone is com-
monly known as the Vicksburg limestone,
or in recent years the Peninsula lime-
stone. This formation we may expect to encounter by 'borings in all parts of the state. Beyond the coast line the forma-
tion is known to extend to Costa Rica.
and there is no reason to doubt that it extends to the east into the Atlantic and to the west into the gulf basin much beyond the present Florida coast, and is the one formation that is of uni-
versal distribution throughout the state lying at the surface in small areas,
but for the most part buried at slight to considerable depth beneath later rock deposits. The peninsula limestone is ex-
posed at the surface except for a more or less thick covering of sand in local areas throughout Marion, Alachua, south—
ern Columbia, and Suwannee Counties.
In other parts of the State it is covered by later formations, indicating that while most of the state remained somewhat longer under water, the areas named appeared as islands at the close of the for-
mation of the peninsula limestone.
On top of the peninsula limestone around these islands and throughout the state in general there accumulated subse-
quent marine deposits some of them of considerable thickness. These later for-
mations are, however, more or less local in character and while reaching a consid-
erable thickness in parts of the state no one of them extends unintermptedly through-
out the state as a whole. Immediate—
ly following the peninsular limestone in the central part of the state is the Ocala limestone, best exposed at the lime kiln at Ocala where it is something more than twenty feet deep. The Chattahoochee limestone is perhaps a little later than the Ocala and occurs along the Appalachaco-

la river. The Tampa Silex beds and Tampa Limestone are seen at Ballast Point, Tampa. Another thin formation,
the \Vhite Beach is exposed along little Sarasota Bay. These several local for-
mations are included along with the pen-
insular limestone to make up what is known in the more recent classiﬁcation as the Oligocene of Florida. The rocks of these several local formations taken to-
gether make up the surface rocks, except for the mantle of sand over a very consid-
erable area of the central and western part of the state.
The Micoene next above has an increas-
edproportion of clay and shales along with some limestone and sandstone. The prin-
cipal area of Micoene extends along the East Coast from Jacksonville to Lake Worth or below, and reaches in some lo-
calaties a thickness of ﬁve hunderd feet.
The same time interval is represented by a thinner deposit along the Appalacha-
cola river and west of the river towards Pensacola.
Formations of still later date cover the extreme south of the state and local areas throughout the Estate in general.
The Florida deposits are all among the more recent of the geology time divisions,
all falling within the Cenozoic or last of the large time divisions. The state as a whole lies entirely within and is a part of the general coastal plains deposits reaching from New Jersey on the north along the Atlantic coast to the Gulf, and west to Texas, embracing as a whole a strip varying in width. but averaging about 100 miles along the coast covering the eastern part of New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, all of Florida, much of the southern part of Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas. The formations of the coastal plains area as a whole are se-
dimentary containing much clay and shales and sandstones, lying nearly hori-
zontal or with but slight dip. The sedi-
ment forming these deposits came evi-
dently from higher lands to the north and west.
Owing to the fact that Florida. especial-
ly peninsula Florida, was farther remov-
ed from the source of sediment the pro—
portion of wash from the land was very much less, and in the resulting seas an abundant shell life was able to develope.
It thus happens that Florida is exception-
al among the other gulf states in the large proportion of limestone it contains.
As will be gathered from this brief re-
view the Florida peninsula has been ele-
vated above water slowly. That the up-
lifting began at the close of the formation of the peninsular limestone is evidenced by the appearance of the island areas at that time. That the further elevation was also gradual and slow is indicated by the successive deposits of later formations around the island areas. It is assumed that the slow upward pushing has brought the peninusla up as a large anticlinal fold with the highest part of the fold forming the central area of the peninsula. Actual observation of anticlinal structure from the rocks themselves is difﬁcult owing to the mantle of sand covering, and the lim-
ited exposures of rock. That there is a dip, however, is indicated by the depth at which any recognizable formation is en-
countered in borings. Thus the peninsu-
lar limestone which is found at the sur-
face in Alachua or southern Columbia county is encountered in wells at St. Au—
gustine at a depth of 224 feet. Farther to the south along the coast an even great-

er thickness of later formations rest on the peninsular limestone. At Lake Worth the limestone is reported at a depth of
1000 feet. A dip to the south is likewise indicated from the fact that the peninsu-
la limestone in that direction dips under later formations towards Tampa and the Manatee region.
The features of the peninsula area bearing most directly on the question of underground waters are as follows: The Florida peninsula has as its sub-forma-
tion a porous cavernous limestone. On top of this is a varying thickness of sedi-
mentary rocks of alternate pervious and impervious layers, limestone, shale, clay and sand horizons, and that these hori-
zons dip in general to the east, south, and west from the central area.
Artesian supply: Artesian water is properly water conﬁned and under pres-
sure, usually pressure of its own weight,
so that when the stratum containing it is tapped the water will rise in the opening thus made.
Artesian flow occurs when the head is suﬁicient to cause the rise of water to and above the surface level of the mouth of the well. '
The conditions necessary to bring about artesian water may be grouped for brevity under three heads as follows:
Dip of the strata.
Alternating impervious and pervious strata.
Some condition or combination of con-
ditions bringing the water under sufﬁcient pressure to supply lthe necessary head.
This latter condition may result from the sagging of a series of these strata at the middle allowing the edge to be expos-
ed at either side, so that the water will
ﬂow at any point lower than the exposed area of the horizon. Such a trough like structure is an artesian basin. The same result may be brought quite as effectively by an inclined porous stratum wedging out between two impervious strata, or by the pervious straum itself grading into an impervious or less pervious condition,
as a sandstone grading into a ﬁner sand-
stone, or a sandstone grading into a shale.
Even a local variation in the thickness or texture of the containing stratum may re-
sult in considerable head. The friction of water threading its way long distances through the pores of a pervious formation affords sufﬁcient head for an appreciable rise of water through a boring. (Cham-
berlin, 5th An. Rpt. U. S. G. S., p. I43).
The term, artesian slope is applied to such an area. It is apparent that the pressure of the Florida artesian water is explained by artesian slope rather than an artesian basin.
The dip of the Florida formations whatever may have been its cause fumi-
shes the ﬁrst of the essential structural features of artesian water accumulation.
The second condition necessary, the al-
ternating impervious and pervious strata,
is met in the varied IIZIJIIII'C of the Florida deposits in which water tight clays and shales are often succeeded by porous and water bearing limestones and sand—
stones. The head necessary to induce ar-
tesian ﬂow is doubtless due to pinching out of strata or change to ﬁne texture of the water carrying layer.
Source of artesian water:
The catchment area.
The general gathering ground for the artesian water of the coast is naturally the interior region of the State. Of the rain-
fall of an area a part is evaporated and re-
turned to the atmosphere; another part is carried oﬁ’ immediately to the ocean as

surface drainage; while a third part ﬁnds its way into the ground.
Owing to the generally porous nature of the Florida formation, that part of the annual rainfall going directly into the ground is an unusually high percentage.
While the part passing off as surface drainage is a correspondingly small part of the annual rainfall.
It is not to be assumed, however, that all of that which passes into the earth is available again as artesian supply. The amount of water reaching the surface through an artesian well is necessarily less than that entering the ground, owing to friction in ﬂow, to lack of completely pervious strata above and below and ow-
ing to the evident fact that there is in all cases sources of escape for the water through channels other than the artesian wells.
The area covered lby the outcrop of any horizon will vary according to the thick-
ness of the horizon, the topography of the area at which the outcrop occurs, and the dip of the strata. The dip of the Florida rocks is slight and the catchment area for any collecting horizon is therefore propor-
tionately large.
In addition to this usual or normal catchment area an added supply in some cases, probably of considerable importance is received from sinks reaching through to the conducting horizon.
Of the great number of sinks through-
out the State receiving regularly surface drainage many evidently reach no great distance downwards and the water after a more or less extended underground course reaches a river or otherwise re-
turns to the surface. On the other hand it is equally evident that some of these sinks are waterways leading through im-
pervious strata and connecting with por-
ous horizons, below which conduct water readily and are capable of becoming ar-
tesian horizons Thus if the water of a sink is observed to rise to a deﬁnite level and to be unaffected by any amount of water going into it, and especially if the level of the water in the sink is found to agree practically with the level to which artesion water rises in borings in the im-
mediate locality it becomes evident that the sink leads to the artesian horizon. The added supply of artesian water received through such sinks is doubtless very con-
siderable.
In this connection should be mentioned also a second unused artesian supply,
namely the drainage of inland areas through deep borings. As is well known this plan of drainage involves sinking bor-
ings to such depth as to encounter a con-
ducting stratum which carries the water readily . Obviously the probabilities are that the water is thus being turned into a horizon capable of becoming an artesian supply horizon in some lower area of the State. Some such wells are recorded in which the water is turned directly into an artesian stratum, the artesian water ris-
ing in fact within a few feet of the sur-
face. Some of these wells present the un-
ique feature of being, during wet weath-
er drainage wells, and during dry weath-
er, through the medium of pumps, irriga-
tion wells. In these cases it is impossible from the data now at hand to affirm that the water thus added is available as an addlition to the artesian supply at any nearby region of lower level aving ar-
tesian ﬂow, but the inferences are very strong that the artesian supply is directly increased in this way.

Available supply of artesian water:
Fortunately Florida with its heavy rainfall and with its formations especi-
ally adapted for taking up and holding a store of water is subject to an annually added supply not likely to be over drawn.
It must not be supposed, however, that more water can be taken from the arte-
'sian horizon than enters it. On the con-
trary the supply avaliable is neccesarily much less than the supply received. For-
tunately the rainfall is sufﬁcient to assure an underground water supply among the States most valuable assets.

Florida Immigration—What Shall It Be?
BY CAPT. a. E. ROSE,
STATE CH BIIST.
M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
The subject assigned to me, “Florida Immigration, What Shall it Be?” is one that is not commanding much attention,
not only in Florida, but throughout the entire South. We have recently had several conventions of representative men on the subject: Seldom do we have a gathering, or convention of any kind,
agricultural commissioners, cane growers,
turpentine producers, timber men, saw mill men, railroad men, ticket agents,
trafﬁc managers, farmers, cattle growers,
agriculturists or horticulturists, but the subject of Immigration “crops out” in one shape or another.
In fact, the Southern States have agi-
tated this question of Immigration—For-
eign Immigration—to a very consider-
able extent during the past few years,
much has been said upon the subject,
numerous plans have been proposed to turn the tide of foreign immigration,
from the West, to the South. The estab-
lishment of direct lines of immigrant ships, from Southern ports to Europe;
with agents of the Southern States estab-
lished in foreign countries, to secure im-
migrants, is probably the most popular plan suggested. To avoid the “contract labor laws," the States are asked to do what the citizen (or corporation), is pro-
hibited from doing; and also to tax the people of the State. to secure cheaper labor, to compete with the working men of the State.
Florida, I am glad to say, has not be-
come hysterical, 0r anxious, in this mat-
ter. She has displayed no great haste to receive the inﬂux of foreign immi-
grants—Japanese, Italians or Chinamen,
so ardently desired, and earnestly advo-
cated, by some of our sister States—
urged on by Land Syndicates—mining and manufacturing corporations, desiring to secure cheaper, and more servile labor,
than is now obtained in the South, out-
side the cities.
While the phenomenal development of the South, during the past decade, along all lines of industry, agriculture, mining,
manufacture and transportation, has created a large demand for labor, and has largely increased the wages of our working people, it is questionable if it be for the best interests of the South, and particularly Florida, to encourage foreign immigration.
The South is now the only distinctly American section of the Union; where the traditions, habits, prejudices, virtues and vices; courage, chivalry, indepen-
dence and love of freedom so characteris-
tic of the early settler or pioneer, can be found in its purity. Where the true American character, begat by the “pio-
neer,” “Puritan,” and “cavalier,” can still be found. The descendants of those ad-
venturous men and women, who at their

own cost of deprivation and hardship, es-
tablished the original thirteen colonies,
on the Atlantic Sea Board; who ﬁrst oc-
cupied the land, drove back the Indian;
threw off the yoke of the old country—
with its limitations, political and relig-
ious, to establish a Republic of F reemen,
where liberty in its truest sense should prevail.
The true American type—we certainly have such a type—is now found princi-
pally south of “Mason and Dixon's Line”
—In the South Atlantic, and Gulf States;
and is most strongly marked in the rural '
districts of the cotton growing States;
particularly in Florida, where most of our people can trace their lineage, direct~
ly t0 the founders of the Republic, with little if any admixture of foreign blood—
Descendants of those grand old pioneers
—rugged, capable. stubborn, courageous and honest, who lone handed, and by mere force of character, conquered the wilderness, as an heritage for their chil-
dren, and children’s children.
The descendants of whom fought the bloodiest war of modern times, to preserve the constitutional liberties of the Republic founded by their fathers. Those fathers,
who by their sacriﬁces, made it possible for the foreign immigrant to flock to the States—the North and \Vest—after the establishment of religious and political liberty, by our Revolutionary ancestors.
Florida has had a large increase of population, during the past ﬁfteen years;
she has increased from 391,000 to 620,-
ooo—a little more than 58 per cent.—
From 1890 to 1900, she increased 35 per cent. (391,000 to 528,000). The States’s census taken last year, now being com-
pleted, will show a greater proportionate increase-
Florida gained a larger percentage of population, than any other Atlantic State,
during the last United States census per-
iod; namely, 35 per cent. She exceeded the-average of all the groups of States—
that is the North Atlantic group—20.90
per cent. The South Atlantic, 17.90 per cent.; the North Central, 17.50 per cent.;
the South Central, 26.10 per cent., and the Western Division, 31.90 per cent.
Her percentage of increase in popula-
tion was exceeded only, by Arizona,
Idaho, Indian Territory, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, \Vashington,
and Wyoming, from 1890 to 1900; while the indications are that her increase for the present decade will be far greater in proportion.

All the other States and territories are represented in Florida's population,
though the above list embraces all States that have 1,000 or more representatives in our population.
What I desire particularly to empha-
size—is that Florida has had a greater proportionate increase in population than any other State, except the few Northern States mentioned previously, that have been ﬁlled up by foreign immigrants;
exploited by the railroads and immigrant ships—for simply “business reasons.”
The “Foreign Immigrant” is exploited by the “Immigrant Ship” and railroad like .any other commercial commodity.
Lumber, merchandise, beef, or pork; cat—
tle or hogs. And were it not for the laws prohibiting individuals (or corpora-
tions), importing contract labor, the ques-
tion of foreign immigration would be solved at once by the importation of mil-
lions of coolies—not Chinamen, Japanese or Malays necessarily, but millions of
“Redemptioners,” from all parts of Europe, who would be sold for a term of years, to those desiring labor, miners,
manufacturers, planters, saw mill and turpentine operators, for simply enough to pay their passage and a proﬁt to the transportation lines, as was done during the early years of the last century.
Another remarkable feature of Flori-
da’s population—not only the great pre-
ponderance of American born citizens, is the great number of native born children;
a population of 528,000 in Iooo—shows
270,293 children. or youths less than 20;
197,600 of school age; and 72,693 less than four years old, more than half of our population. Such facts are potent argu-
ments against foreign immigrants, par-
ticularly when we know that thousands of our best American citizens are now seeking homes in the State. That this domestic immigration is rapidly increas—
ing is patent to any one who is noting the rapid ﬁlling up of the whole State.
I think the State census of 1905 will surprise many of our peole, when the increase of population is noted, particu-
larly the natural increase. Race suicide can by no means he charged against Florida, where over one-half of the popu-
lation are school children, or younger.
That Florida needs, or can comfort-
ably care for—more people. is true; that she is obtaining them more rapidly than any other Atlantic State, is also true;
that by natural increase and by American immigration—men and women from the Southeastern States particularly, she is rapidly ﬁlling up the vacant places is also true.
Speaking of vacant lands, United States lands, I desire to call your at-
tention to the fact that there is compar-
atively little vacant land, State or United States, remaining. The State has little left, no homestead lands at all, and has claims against what remains unallotted of some four millions of acres more than she has to meet the claims with.
United States homesteads are being rapidly exhausted. Most of the desirable homesteads are now occupied. The re-
cent “Stone and Timber acts" are rapidly absorbing the remainder of the United States lands. Ninety per cent. of the public domain has passed into \the pos-
session of individuals, syndicates and corporations, during the past twenty years. Not only in this. but in other States.

Though Florida had probably a greater acreage of State lands than any other State, except Texas, some twenty—seven million acres, more or less, practically
ﬁve-sevenths of all the land in the State—
less than twenty-ﬁve years ago, she to-
day is practically bankrupt in her landed possessions, and has claims against her for millions of acres more than she has to meet the claims with.
At a recent convention held in the Southern part of the State, the statement was made by several gentlemen: men well-informed and familiar with condi-
tions; that one of the principal reasons why young men were ﬂocking to the cit-
ies, was that lands for homes could not be purchased. This was not denied,
though repeated by several members, and in the presence of representatives of sev-
eral of the larger Land Syndicates.
Our public domain—once the boast of our State and Nation—has dwindled until now it is difﬁcult for a young American to ﬁnd 160 acres to homestead. We have parted with our heritage, our vast domain of productive soil—our own chil-
dren—to say nothing of the foreign im-
migrant—are left without homes, to be-
come the “bond servants” or “tenant far-
mer” of land syndicates, corporations or trust magnates.
Do we need immigrants? Yes; Ameri-
can immigrants; particularly from the Southeastern State—=men who will own their own homes; maintain the true American spirit, a love of liberty, and per-
sonal independence. Such men as were recently alluded to by Judge Emory Spear—in charging a jury in a noted criminal case that has commanded inter—
national attention during the past seven years—in charging, the Judge said, “I am told that is has been cyninly said by a famous New Yorker that no man who has a million dollars can be convicted of crime in America. The verdict of this jury of plain, clear-sighted, honest Ameri-
cans has falsiﬁed such a pessimism. Of that jury it may be said that there is per-
haps not a man who cannot trace his an-
cestry to a patriot of the Revolution which established American independence. It is true, as I have often declared, that to the homogeneous Americanism of these Southern States when they are plainly shown their duty, our country may ever look with confidence for the enforcement of its laws and for the maintenance of its institutions.”
True they will have to purchase their lands—and pay several thousand per cent.
proﬁt to_ the present owners; and in a few years, ﬁnd it difﬁcult if not impos-
sible, to obtain a free hold, by purchase or otherwise.
Doubtless, some of my auditors will consider me an alarmist. and believe my picture overdrawn; let me assure them such is not the case. \Vhen but a few years ago—less than twenty—the foreign emigrant, or the native born young American—had tens of thousands of homesteads, from which to select his one hundred and sixty acres: he has today but few to choose from, they are remote.
scattered and not desirable. having but little agricultural value.
While our public domain has to a large extent disappeared, foreign immigration has increased until it has attracted the serious attention of thoughtful Ameri-
cans. I quote a recent editorial from the
“Miami Metropolis,” one of the most conservative of our Florida newspapers:
“Foreign immigrants are pouring into Eastern ports in such large numbers the Department of Labor and Commerce has

become apprehensive and has determined to more strictly enforce the regulations for the restriction of immigration.”
This is a country of vast territory, and its assimilative powers are very great,
but there should be some limit to the in-
ﬂux of foreigners and the crowding of our cities with a population which seriously adds to the gravity of problems that are pressing more and more for so-
lution. The stream of foreigners is not suﬂ‘iciently distributed. Too few become soil tillers and producers. It can be easily understood why this country is so attrac-
tive to the poor of overcrowded Europe,
and quick and cheap transportation makes it comparatively easy for them to seek homes. In 1900 there were 10,460,000
people of foreign birth in this.country,
and over 21,000,000 born of foreign parentage. About 35 per cent. of the total population is wholly or partially of foreign parentage.
Of the foreign-born population, 94 per cent. is resident in the North, and 6 per cent. in the South. In 1900 the total foreign-born population of Allegheny,
Pa., was, in round numbers, 30,000; in Atlanta, it was 2,500; in Charleston, S.
C., it was 2,500, and 12,000 in Colum-
bus, Ohio. In Louisville, it was 21,000
and in Lowell. 40,000; in Memphis, it was 5,000, and in Minneapolis, 61,000.
In Worcester, Mass. it was 37,000; in Rochester, N. Y-, it was 40,000; in Provi-
dence, R. I., it was 55,000, and 46,000,
in St. Paul. In New York City there were 786,000 persons of German parent-
age, 715,000 of Irish parentage, 245,000
of Russian, 218,000 of Italian. 53000 of Polish and 52,000 of Hungarian. A con-
siderable per cent. of the total population is German and Irish.
These, as a rule. make excellent citi-
zens, and become thoroughly imbued with American methods and ideals. But there are millions of immigrants who are not desirable as citizens; and even a large inpouring of foreigners who may make good citizens is not wholly unobjection—
able. Through immigration and natural increase the country is being rapidly ﬁlled,
and when it becomes crowded, as it will,
it means a change of conditions—from the free and easy methods of living char-
acteristic of Americans. to the close econ-
omy and hard life of the crowded coun-
tries of the old world and labor will be cheaper and the cost of living greater.”
That I am not alone in my position,
I quote the language of that typical Amer-
ican citizen, Theodore Roosevelt—that representative American the descendant of the Dutch Founders of Manhattan on the one side, and an equally noted South-
ern family on the other; in an address to the representatives of Organized Ameri-
can Labor, at the White House, on March 21, speaking of immigration, he said:
“You have spoken of the immigration laws. I believe not merely that all pos-
sible steps should be taken to prevent the importation of laborers under any form,
but I believe further that this country ought to make a resolute effort from now on to prevent the coming to the country of men with a standard of living so low that they tend, by entering into unfair competition with, to reduce the standard of living of our own people. Not one of you can go further than I will go in the effort steadily to raise the status of the American Wage Worker, so long as,
while doing it. I can retain a clear con-
science and the certainty that I am doing what is right. I will do all in my power for the lalliring men except to do what

is wrong; and I will not do that for him or for any one else.”
“We must not let our natural sentiment for succoring the oppressed and unfor-
tunate of other lands lead us into what warped moral and mental attitude of try-
ing to succor them at the expense of pull-
ing down our own people. Laws should be enacted to keep out all immigrants who do not show that they have the right stuff in them to enter into our life on terms of decent equality with our own citizens. This is indeed ﬁrst in the in-
terests of the laboring man, but further-
more in the interests of all of us as Ameri-
can citizens; for gentlemen, the bonds that unite all good American citizens are stronger by far than the differences,
which I think you accentuate altogether too much, between the men who do one kind of labor and the men who do another kind. As for immigrants, we cannot have too many of the right kind; and we should have none at all of the wrong kind; and they are of the right kind if we can be fairly sure that their children and grandchildren can meet on terms of equality our children and grandchildren,
so as to try to be decent citizens together,
and to work together for the uplifting of the Republic.”

Report of Standing Committee on Ornamentals.

BY MRS. GEO S. GATES.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Those of us who have borne the heat and burden of the day, those of us who have been twenty years in Florida, and are thus entitled to the name of “Old Settler." are beginning to rejoice because of the real prosperity that is everywhere
' showing up over our fair State—at last the time has come when we also have green lawns, ornamental grounds and good roads.
‘These years of experience have taught us valuable lessons. these lessons are tab-
ulated and crystalized into records and into great nurseries of thrifty stock. avail—
able for all kind of horticultural purposes.
So now, the wayfaring man, though a
“Yankee,” need not err. We are greatly indebted to the State Horticultural Socie-
ty for a large mass of these records. and we should all more earnestly work for a broader ﬁeld of usefulness for this society.
For from the soil must ever come the sound, healthy prosperity of any State.
As the spring is with us still. We must express the joy we have felt from her very ﬁrst appearance, in the fragrant buds of the Yellow Jessamine. to the present pageant now waving about us in the waxy bloom of the great Magnolia.
\Ve have secured much pleasure by avail-
ing ourselves of the simple plants within easy reach. In December we secured many roots of the Yellow jessamine—
planted some about old stumps and some on posts, and it is perfect for old fences and arbors. By March, we had some bloom, and the second year, with care and fertilizer a mass of new growth and blossoms—and I know no miser ever had more joy with his gold. than we, with our mass of golden fragrant bloom.
The wild plum is the next to bloom—
about the middle of February. It does not bring a few blossoms. here and there,
but great wreaths. bunches and banks of snowy bloom. One can go out and cut great armfulls of feathery blossoms, and
ﬁll the house with the very spirit of spring—and one is exalted with that spirit as they pass and repass; those great gnarled branches, that speak of greater life and peace and hope—crowd halls and dark corners with these ﬂeeting joys.
The gentle japanese make the Cherry blossom time the happiest festival of the year. So do all lovers of nature—the pear tree is a marvel just after the plum, and so full of blossoms are all fruit trees, that I feel sure. Nature means that we are to enjoy her blooms, as well as her fruits——
she is never stingy if you ever dare think it of her, look at the spring-time blos-
soms; and learn there the wonderful les_
son of the large, full glorious develop-
ment that is certainly in common with all Nature. Let me plead for the arrange-
ment of blossoms when we bring them indoors—for the busy housewife gets the most of her enjoyment from her cut ﬂow-
ers. Don’t crowd several kinds in the

same holder. A perfect rose; a perfect branch of blossoms have as strong and re-
freshing an individuality as have our human friends, and they repay us as gracefully for respecting it, as they do.
Next to bloom is the pink Azalea, or Wild Honeysuckle, as it is called all along the Atlantic States—simply delightful in a great mass—grown ten or twelve feet in low land, but with care, a thrifty bush on high land. The same can be said of the Dogwood Lily of the Valley tree,
Spirea, or Bridal Wreath, the Oleander,
Cape Jessamine, Crape Myrtle, and the Sweet Myrtle. These are all fragrant,
hardy and close at hand. We ﬁnd December planting most satisfactory for trees and shrubbery. We have had the best success in planting Oleanders, by getting a stake about two feet long, stiff enough to drive, sharpen it at one end and drive into the ground just where you want it to grow, leaving out two or three eyes or buds, they will put out from them and you have a tree at once.
I want to recall Mr. Taber’s paper of last year, to your mind. It is well worth another reading. It was about the joys of a thicket, he called it, “A Message from the Woods.” I saw the thicket be-
fore I read the message, and I felt then,
that every Nature-lover had just some such spot—I have. It is a human instinct to keep a bit of nature’s work close at hand, from whence can be drawn inspir-
ation, strength and hope.
It may be a bit of pond, full of gleam-
ing white lilies, or a bit of virgin forest in its strength and grandure, or a thicket full of the riotous profusion of trees,
shrub and vine, that in its blending of shape and shade, is the despair of all our timid efforts. Let me suggest the greater planting of the Wistaria, both white and purple, there again the Japan-
ese have produced wonderful effects, their arbors are simply dreams. You do not realize you are looking at anything man has done, it looks like magic. Some of the flower stems are three feet long, and hang above the head like a purple and white sky. It will grow rampant here,
even with little care—of course it is not as earlyas the plum, or as evergreen as the Yellow Jassamine, which I heartily recommend—the Wistaria blooms in early April and the Jessamine in early February, both are valuable for wiring to scrawny tall trees, and for covering unsightly objects. But chief among vines in this land of “Creepers,” is the wild Smilax, or Bamboo Briar, as it is called here. I spoke of this vine last year, and wish to call your attention to it again.
I have found four varieties, a plain green one, and a variegated one without thorns and mostly roots, they are worthless,
never grow more than six or eight feet,
then there is a strong rampant growing one with briars, and covered with black-
berries in the fall, ornamental, but cruel.
But the bamboo, or Wild Smilax, that is shipped from the entire South, for decorating along with Holly, Palm leaves, gray moss, long leaf pine, etc.. is a most beautiful and satisfactory plant—
grows just like cultivated Smilax, but is hardy, evergreen and a smooth vine, no berries, latter part of April has small,
greenish blossoms, very fragrant, much like the Mignonette—if the roots are planted in December the vine will grow from thirty to sixty feet in a season.
It comes up in the spring with a head like Asparagus and is edible,
rather a good substitute for that vegetable, the vine runs along with this head and gets its growth before putting H—9

out its side branches- You must be up and doing, for it is a rapid grower, it stays awake nights to grow. But a dain-
tier, cleaner, more satisfactory vine, I have never found.
A beautiful, hardy, ﬂowering border that is very effective along a fence, is the hardy Verbena. purple, it will grow al-
most two feet high. A neighbor has one on three sides of a town lot— it is a surprise and a delight to all who behold it, a mass of soft purple splendor, it reveals the value of ﬂowers in a great mass.
There are wonderful possibilities for Florida, I can only hint at them, and give a bit of cheer and experience from my own little corner in Putnam county,
and urge you to plant things that will also be a joy to others after we have passed away.
That brings me to the Village Improve—
ment work. This work for a higher life for our village, for tree planting and the making of good roads, is one where men and women must work together. It is certainly the mother’s anxious concern that her town, her county, her State be clean‘and up-to—date as well as her home,
for in them she must continue the educa-
tion of her boys and girls. It is the environment of the young that makes us have men and women with proper ideals of civic pride, and of partiotism. Moth-
ers know instinctively how important it is to give children the right appreciation of beauty and cleanliness. When our boys and girls get the right education in Florida, our towns will be too nice for hogs and cattle to run in and not until then. But mothers sometimes fail. You can ﬁnd this out by getting an ordinary man to clean up a bit of road-way. You will most likely ﬁnd his idea of “cleaning up" means to “dig up” everything living in sight, leaving a nice, clean bed of sand,
without the slightest idea of the use for which the cleaning was made. We don’t expect all men to see beauty, any more than we expect all women to sing, but we do ask, if you ﬁnd a beautiful, young tree or Palmetto, that can remain in the clearing, just as well as not; please let it stay. In this village improvement work, we deal with matters of fact, not of opinion, so there is only the common inertia of humanity to overcome, and it is enough. Our study of how to get the most out of what we have, and for the comfort and happiness of all, has brought the Christ spirit much closer to us, in our homes and in our public work, for work-
ing with Nature, not against her, we are one with the birds and the trees, and we become as little children, simple and trust—
ful. Surely Chas. Wagner would love Florida, for one soon learns here the
“Simple Life.” and cannot worry long if he tries.
As woman is the maker of the home
“atmosphere,” and man the strength, the foundation of the structure let us make the most of these great forces, that the environment may be the most perfect for the proper development of our children.
Not stopping at the home but demanding and struggling for better conditions in our towns, our villages and our State-
Give me a man whose mother has taught him to love the birds, the trees,
the beauties of nature, he is the man for road commissioner, for park work, he can see and save what nature has given us so lavishly on every side. But with-
out the right environment and the ear-
nest love implanted in the child-heart, our efforts will be slow and faltering.

this good roads agitation, this work is the most important work before us today,
the home, the mill, the mine are all handi-
capped terribly, without good roads.
Life is without sociability and work a drudgery. There are many lovely spots in our State, beautiful villages, ideal in every way, but the tourist or settler are driven to other localities by the awful sand roads. This is a question for each town to settle for themselves for the needs and conditions are all so different.
\\"e are greatly indebted to Senator Mann and Senator Morgan, for their heroic work along this line, and we feel sure they have the earnest support of every member of this Society. Let me suggest when you lay out your new roads,
you call a conference of the City Fathers.
and the Village Improvement Mothers.
\Vomen’s studies along these lines are showing them the value of nature’s free gifts in all States,_by road-side and river,
on mountain sides and in valleys. Im-
mense amounts of beautiful and suitable material right at hand. They will be sure to get the trees planted at once and have all our magniﬁcent forest trees represented. We like planting each spe-
cies by itself. a long line of “later Oaks, a long line of Hollys, a long line of Camphor, \Vild Olive. Live Oak, Pal-
metto, and a long line of the queen of all flowering trees, the Magnolia Grandi-
fiora. This superb tree with its magniﬁ-
cent and odorous bloom should be planted about every Florida home and village.
All the trees I have mentioned are ever—
green—what a wonderful collection, per-
fect for beautifying and shading our roadways. Miles of highways shaded with such ,a variety of splendid trees would give us, in time, such fame as have the giant Cryptomerians given japan on her wonderful State roads. There the poor of the cities travel for miles on per-
fect roads and under giant trees, taking in their rude vehicles the babies and kitchen outﬁt and journeying along for days out of doors and under God’s great canopy— they get courage and health to return again to the city struggle. How good it would be if our poor could jour-
ney to the ocean or gulf—only a few pal-
try miles, and it would often bring back health to the fever stricken and hopeless.
In the face of the wonderful progress of Florida in twenty years, we feel certain that our good roads dreams will come true. The Times—Union says they will.
and the Times-Union ought to know,
they say we shall have an automobile track from North to South, and from East to West of the State, and in the near future. If there is anything in Christian Science let us all join heartily in believing in this dream. and if we are good Americans “hustle for it” as well,
for nothing can be more ornamental,
more useful, more progressive than hard,
well-shaded highways,

PLANTS FOR HOME ADORNMENT.
BY W.C.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is not necessary for me to come before you with any argument in favor of the ornamentation of the home surroundings. That subject has been so often discussed here, that nothing re-
mains to be said on that line.
I think that we are all agreed that it is desirable to do the best we can to make our homes attractive and beautiful. It then only remains for us to consider the matter of ways and means. There are a few favored mortals who do not need to consider expense when they wish to have a beautiful home. They give orders that such and such things shall be done,
and immediately all the energies of gard—
eners, landscape gardeners, nurserymen and ﬂorists are devoted to the task of com-
pleting the job satisfactorily. The result is not always as pleasing, to a cultivated taste, as would be expected from the great outlay of money. Unless directed by a wise controlling mind, effect is often spoiled by crowding, or by the use of un-
suitable materials. This. however, does not concern very many of our number.
I have thought it best, at this time. to try to give a partial list of trees, shrubs and vines that deserve a place in our door-
yards and are available to every one.
Last year, the present Chairman of the Committee on Ornamentals, recommend-
ed the live oak. quercus virens, and the water oak. quercus aquatica. Both are desirable, the water oak makes the most rapid growth, is symmetrical and beautis ful. It is. perhaps. not so long lived as STEELE.
the live oak. but trees of the water oak that were over 50 feet high and with trunks over a foot in diameter, twenty years ago, are still thrifty and vigorous.
There are two other native evergreen trees that should be added to the list, mag-
nolia grandiﬂora and magnolia glauca,
the latter is commonly known as sweet bay. If given plenty of room, in open ground, where they will not be shaded by older trees, both species will grow rapidly and form symmetrical heads.
They are highly ornamental at any sea-
son of the year, but are especially so when in bloom.
The camphor tree, cinnamomum cam-
phora. is one of the most desirable shade and ornamental trees that I know. It thrives best on moist soil, but will grow wherever an orange tree will live.
There are two smaller evergreen trees that would be more commonly found in cultivation if it were not for the fact that they are very difficult to transplant. suc-
cessfully. I refer to the two larger varie-
ties of holly. Ilex opaca, the common prickly leaved species and Ilex Dahoon.
The latter is much like the ﬁrst except that it is of somewhat smaller growth and the leaves are smooth. Hollies may be transplanted by cutting the trunk of? close to the ground, in winter, and then mov-
ing the roots at once with as little dis-
turbance as possible. I have known holly trees to be transplanted with the tops on,
but there are more failures than successes.
Hollies are diecious, that is the staminate and pistillate ﬂowers are borne on differ-

133
ent trees. None but the pistillate trees ever bear fruit, and they will fail unless there is a staminate trees within a reason-
able distance. If you live near a ham-
mock where there are wild trees you may safely set out a pistillate tree with the expectation that it will bear fruit. But if not, it is useless to look for berries un-
less you have both kinds on your place.
In some locations, shade is not desir-
able all the year, or at least not neces-
sary in winter, in such places a decid-
uous tree may be planted. One of the very best of these is the softmaple, acer rubrum. This tree always excites admir-
ation when in bloom or in fruit. It usually blooms in February and the fruit ripens and falls before the leaves appear.
A close second to the maple is the sweet gum, liquidamber staraciﬂua. It is not striking in appearance when in bloom, but its foliage is attractive, es-
pecially n the autumn just before it drops oﬂ'. The corky winged branches are quite curious in winter when not hidden by the leaves.
Of course those of you who live below the frost line have at least a few orange trees. If any of you are so unfortunate as not to be able to grow the ordinary sweet or sour oranges, we would recom-
mend that you set one or more trees _of the hardy orange, citrus trifoliata. As an ornamental tree it has one advantage over the sweet orange, that is the ﬂowers come in clouds while there are no leaves on the tree to hide part of them. The curious thorny branches covered with a sheet of snowy blossoms are beautiful.
Shrubs that will bloom all the season are most desirable. Where it is not too cold. the Chinese hibiscus has few equals for showiness. but they are too tender for some parts of the State.
- heard.
Altheas, a nearly related family to the hibiscus, are entirely hardy and will bloom throughout the entire season. There are varieties of several colors, but not the range of shades that may be found in the Chinese hibiscus. I can especially recom-
mend the double white as being the best of all.
Tabenaemontana coronaria, that is a long name, but it has no common name in this country, so far as I have ever Henderson. in his “Hand-book of Plant,” says that it is known as East Indian rose bay, quite' as long a name and but little easier to remember. This is one of the most desirable that I have ever seen. It is very tender, easily killed by frost, but has grown at my home for about 18'years, without protection, except that a few times it has been banked about the base with earth, and it has not failed to bloom each year. When killed by frost,
it sprouts up quickly in the spring and
.soon begins to blossom and keeps it up until cold weather comes again. The
ﬂowers resemble those of the cape Jessa-
mine, (Gardenia ﬂorida), but are not over one-fourth to one-third the size, and are more delicate in appearance. They are very double, pure white and have a delicate fragrance.
Bauhinnia acuminata is also quite ten-
der, but in my many years of experience with it. it has not once failed to sprout up and bloom freely.
The ﬂowers are single, pure white,
without fragrance. and from two to three inches in diameter. I have only had Bauhinnia Galpinii for about three years,
it comes into bloom earlier in the season.
The ﬂowering season, as with the other.
lasts until cold weather.. The blossoms are smaller and are orange red in color.
Dautintonia punicea. known in some

parts of South Florida as “red pea-tree,”
is a handsome evergreen ﬂowering shrub or small tree. It blooms about twice a year, covering itself with long clusters of large pea—shaped ﬂowers, bright orange red in color. It is beautiful when in bloom, but the blossoms are destitute of fragrance.
Duranta plumieri, golden dew-drop, is also an evergreen shrub. It is most showy when in fruit. The ﬂowers are small, a delicate lilac in color and are borne-in long racemes. They are quite pretty, but when the large yellow berries are grown the bush is quite showy. The fruit hangs on for months. often until new growth begins again the next season.
There is a desirable class of shrubs that is but little cultivated in this State. I refer to the list of hardy shrubs common-
ly grown at the North, many of them will do as well, or better. in Florida as anywhere. There is only one objection to them. that being that they bloom but once a year and are deciduous. There is one exception. one of the best of these old favorites, the lilac, syringa vulgaris, can-
not be successfully grown in Florida, or at least I have failed and have never heard of any one that has made them do well or even live, for any length of time.
I can recommend the Japan quince, cydo-
nia japonica. common syringa or mock orange, philadelphus coronarius, weige-
lia rosea and other varieties of Weigelia.
The different varieties of Spirea should also be included. All of these are showy
ﬂowering shrubs. The blossoms of the syringa or mock orange. are almost as fragrant as true orange ﬂowers.
I am exceeding the limit and must omit many equally valable species, but I can-
not bear to stop without speaking of a few vines. First the Ipomoeas, the peren-
nial varieties are all desirable. Ipomoea learii is a strong grower and profuse bloomer, ﬂowers large, dark purple.
Like the morning glory, on hot days these blossoms fade by noon or soon after, but in cool weather, I have seen them stand up until nearly or quite noon of the second day. A curious fact about them is that when they last until the sec-
ond day, the color fades into a dull red.
Ipomoea mortoni is, if possible, a more rampant grower than I. learii, but is not so free a bloomer. Flowers red and smaller in size.
Both of these species may become pests if allowed to escape .into land that you wish to cultivate. They run on the surface of the soil and root along every inch of their length. In that case, the more you plow or cultivate them the more you scatter the roots and the more plants you have. The only effectual way to destroy them is to cut-them oﬂ’, just below the surface, with a hoe, as the roots alone will not sprout. An ounce of prevention is worth not only a pound of cure. but many of them, do not allow the vines to run on the ground at all. '
Ipomoea Michauxii, of Chapman's Southern Flora, but I. jalapa of the Cyclopedia of American Horticulture, has received the name of “blushing beauty moonﬂower.” It grows from a large tuberous root. often a foot or more in diameter; and has been called “potato-
vine.” It is a strong grower and a free bloomer. ﬂowers open about four o’clock p. m.. color delicate pink. Ipomoea sin-
uata is known in some localities as “noon-
day glory.” This species can be easily recognized by its foilage, which looks much like that of the rose geranium. It is a vigorous grower, thought the stems are quite-slender. It blooms freely, ﬂow-

ers small, white with a dark center, open-
ing about noon.
Rhynchospermum Jasminoides, some-
times caller Star jassamine is a woody evergreen vine of strong growth and har-
dy throughout this State. In the spring it is covered with small, pure white ﬂow-
ers that are quite fragrant.
I have a vine of this plant that stands about ten feet high by six or eight wide and three feet through, that has been in bloom for a month. During that time the foliage has been nearly or quite, hidden by the dense sheet of ﬂowers which have covered it. In the evening the fragrance is so strong as to be almost overpower-
ing.
I cannot cover the entire list of desir-
able vines, but there is one more to which I wish to call attention. It is Pereskia laculeata, sometimes called “lemon vine,”
from that fact that the leaves are shaped like those of a lemon tree, and are thick and glossy. This plant is one of the few members of the true cactus family that has leaves. It is really a cactus, though few would suspect it, on account of its vigorous growth and profusion of leaves.
It is sensitive to frost and is often killed to the ground. but sprouts up quickly.
Where a screen of vines is wanted, this is one of the best. If killed to the ground it will not bloom that season, for the flow-
ers come on new 'growth that starts from last year's wood. When not hurt by cold.
it will literally cover itself with a cloud of small flowers about one and one-half inches in diameter. The color is peculiar,
being an almost transparent waxen white,
sometimes with a slight greenish tinge.
The blossoms resemble small single roses in general appearance. They have a pow-
erful odor which is unpleasant to some people.
I have barely touched upon the list of desirable plants for home adornment, and have not mentioned any of the more com-
mon species. The subject is so vast that it is impossible, within the limits of a paper that would be suitable on such an occasion, to do more than skim over the ‘
surface.

DISCUSSION.
Mr. Henderson.—\Vhen I ﬁrst came to this part of the State I saw in Gaines-
ville a very beautiful vine on a veranda,
I called at the lady’s door and asked for some and she called it the coral vine.‘
This seems to be the common name for it.
It begins blooming in June but is killed by frost. One thing I think of value about it is that it is the very best ﬂower '
for bees that _I have ever seen. It does not seem to be very fragrant but the bees will work on it while it is in bloom. The flowers are shaped something like the"
sweet pea and are of a dark pink color.
I would like to know what it is. I think it-_worthy of consideration.
Mr. Steele—There is a common vine here known as Rosa Montana. I thought-
probably, from your description that it was your coral vine. But from the dark pink color it is not the same. The proper name of the vine (rosa montana) is anti-
gonon leptopus.

Report of Secretary.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
At one time it looked as if the mem-
bership of the Horticultural Society was going to be considerably behind that of last year as there were not very many remittances received for membership fees during the year. However, the last no-
tice to the members brought out a large response and many of the members did some good missionary work in the way of securing new members and today I am able to make the following report:
Membership fee received for 1905

The Society has developed a new friend at St. Petersburg, Mr. James Henry, who at one time sent in 13 members. Mrs.
McCarty has also put in good work hav-
ing sent in 12 members. Mr._E. L. Rich-
ardson of Avon Park sent in 4 as also did Mr. F. M. Campbell of Largo. Quite a number of members sent in from one to three.

It will be seen from the above report that the society is going to be consider-
ably short of sufﬁcient funds to meet the coming year’s expenses, to say nothing of the expense of presenting a resolution to the State Legislature for an appropri-
ation. It is earnestly hoped that all mem-
bers of the society will increase their ef-
forts towards getting more new mem—

bers through the year as we should enroll,
at least 300 more.
The expenses of the coming year can be cut down by reducing the cost of print-
ing the Report by leaving out the cata-
logue of fruits and doing away with the illustrations. This feature of the Report,
however, is a very desirable one and if it can be possibly done one or more illus-
trations should be continued.
All of the above is respectfully submit-

Report of Committee on Legislation.
_— ' ’-
BY M. F. ROBINSON.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Florida State Horticultural Socie—
ty.
DEAR SIR: As a member of your com-
mittee on Legislation, 1 would respect-
fully report: That it has been suggested by our honored President and Secretary that it is with the greatest difﬁculty that the expenses of this Society can be main-
tained from the modest membership fees;
That no inconsiderable part of the ex-
pense, is the publication of the Society’s Annual Report of its meetings; and that the Legislature of the State should be pe-
titioned to make an annual appropriation in aid of these expenses. Such a petition would be entirely proper and in line with the action of the legislatures of other States that aid in the support of similar Societies. That such a petition should specify the amount of funds desired, and name the purpose for which it will be used, is believed by your Committeeman to be highly important. Therefore it is recommended that the Secretary make a careful estimate of the amount necessary for the publication of the Annual Report,
and prepare an appropriate resolution,
requesting the desired appropriation by the legislature, and submit it to this meet-
ing for action.
Another matter which in the opinion of your Committeeman is highly impor-
tant to the members of this Society, and which it is the duty of the Society to lay
' and before the legislature of the State and ask for relief; and that is the deplorable fence laws of the State; whereby cattle,
horses, hogs, sheep, and goats are per-
mitted to run at large. Therefore to bring this matter before the Society for its consideration, the following preamble resolution is. hereby introduced.
Your Committeeman offers the follow-
ing and moves its adoption.
PREAMBLE AN D RESOLUTION.
WHEREAS, The farming and horticul-
tural community and the towns and cities of the State of Florida aregreatly ha-
rassed and damaged besides being put to an enormous expense by reason of the fact that cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, and goats are permitted to run at large; and,
WHEREAS, The ﬁnances of the State would be vastly improved, if the owners of such stock were compelled to fence,
and, directly or indirectly, pay taxes or rent on the pastures used for such stock,
instead of being permitted to pasture their stock on the land belonging to others or belonging to the public domain; and,
\VnEREAs, It is believed that a large majority of the voters in the State are in favor of a radical change in the present law; therefore, be it Resolved, By the Florida State Horti-
cultural Society in meeting asembled;
that the Legislature of the State of Flori-
da, be and is hereby petitioned and im-

plored to make and inforce such laws as will prohibit the running at large of cat-
tle, horses, hogs, sheep and goats in the State. And if, in the wisdom of the Leg-
islature, it is thought that any County in the State contains a majority of voters in favor of the present law, let it be sub-
mitted to the voters of each County to de-
cide whether the new law or the present law shall be enforced in that particular county. '
Resolved, That the above resolution be submitted to the next Legislature, by the Secretary of this Society.

Notes from Abroad.
BY DR. WM. C. RICHARDSON, TAMPA, FLA.
When Doctor W. C. Richardson ad-
vised me early in January that he was about to visit the Citrus sections around the Mediterranean I asked him to write something on his observations. He kindly consented to do so and mailed the letter from Paris thinking it would reach me at Jacksonville in time to be read to the,
Society. It failed to reach me in time and I am doing the next best thing—
printing it in the proceedings. Personal-
ly and on behalf of the Society I thank Dr. Richardson for his most instructive and interesting letter.—C. T. MCCARTY.

PARIS, FRANCE, April 25, 1906.
C. T. McCarty, Esq., President Florida State Horticultural lSociety, Florida U. S. A.
DEAR SIR: In accordance with your request to write you relative to things of interest that I might see on my cruise around the Mediterranean, in the way of horticultural matters, I take occasion to say that the ﬁrst stop was at Funchal Is-
land, of Maderia. This island grows some oranges of a rather inferior quality,
and all sub-tropical fruits and vegetables
ﬂourish as extensively as the small limits of the island will permit. Sugar cane,
however, seems to be the principal arti-
cle of cultivation.
The next place visited was Cadiz,
Spain, located on an almost barren little peninsula, and aside from the splendid harbor, its commerce as the chief port of South Western Spain, and the manufac-
ture of salt by evaporation, it has little of interest in a business way, but is rich in art treasures and historical associations.
A visit to the interior, some hundred and ﬁfty miles, revealed quite extensive orange groves, and many quite large olive orchards. The orange trees are planted in squares in regular order, eighteen or twenty feet apart, and do not seem to grow anything like as large as our Florida trees. In the gardens of the palace of the Alcazar there are many very old trees,
one of which is said to have an authentic history of over six hundred years; It is a bitter sweet, and the man showing us through the place said that sweet oranges injected into the bitteF'stock, he meant budded, were growing in the grounds and bearing abundantly at ages of two and three hundred years. These trees did indeed look thrifty and healthy, but they were no larger than our ﬁfteen or sixteen year old trees. All the unprotected or-
ange and other sub-tropical trees had been nipped with the cold to the extent of los-
ing their leaves, but this did not seem to worry the Spaniards any, and they ap-
parently treated it as nothing unusual, or of any consequence. Spanish oranges are not of the best quality, and aside from color have little to recommend them;
they are tender, thick skinned and of a negative ﬂavor.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
The next stop was at Algiers, in North-
ern Africa, where oranges, lemons, gua-
vas, bananas. etc., were found in pro-
fusion. All showed the effect of recent cold, but had not suffered as much as in Spain. The orange groves were set out in a much more crowded way. the trees being only 12 or 15 feet apart, and, like in Spain, all pruned up very high. The mandarine oranges are raised very ex-
tensively in Algiers, and are of a most excellent quality—in fact all the oranges here are very good indeed.
After visiting Greece, Turkey and Asia Minor, where olives and ﬁgs are raised extensively, and oranges are grown in a rather limited way, and where they suffer a great deal from cold every win-
ter, the next place of interest from an horticultural standpoint was Jaffa in Pal-
estine.
Jaﬂa is the home of the very best or-
anges we have seen outside of Florida, if an exception be made in favor of a blood navel found in a small way on the island
‘of Malta. The cultivation of the orange in Jaffa is more wonderful to a Florida grower than is the delicious character of the fruit- The trees are planted in rows not more than seven or eight feet apart,
and not more than ﬁve or six feet distant from one another in the rows. All culti-
vation is done with hoes and spades and they dig deep everywhere. even close up to the trees. They have a loose sandy soil, richer apparently than ours and their only knowledge of fertilizers seems to be conﬁned to barn yard manure.
\\'hen the trees get so large as to make them too close together for convenient cultivation and harvesting the fruit, they cut them off alternately in the rows and rebud the sprouts, I do not think any trees are allowed to get more than ten or twelve feet high before they_are thus treated. I was told by a man whose family are the most extensive growers in this country that small thrifty trees close together gave larger returns per acre and better fruit than any other system of cul-
ture they had been able to devise.
Egypt was found to be almost as won—
derful from an horticultural and agricul-
tural view as it is from an ethnological and historical standpoint. At Cario in latitude 30 degrees north, where it never rains and where the climate in much warmer especially in summer, than in Jacksonville, we found many things to in-
terest us. We were fortunate enough to secure an introduction to the Director of the Botanical and Zoological gardens,
who kindly devoted a forenoon to show-
ing us through the wonderfully rich pos-
sessions under his management, includ-
ing rare specimens of all kinds of fruits and plants that grow, in this lavishly productive country. Everything we ever saw growing in Florida seemed to ﬂour-
ish here, including two splendid real American alligators kept in a pool enclos-
ed by wire netting, separating them from the Crocodiles. It seemed like meeting friends from home, and after long asso—
ciation with Arabs, camels, donkeys, etc..
it cheered us up wonderfully.
We were also fortunate enough to be in Cairo at the time of the Egyptian Hor-
ticultural Exposition, conducted with a great ﬂourish under the auspices of the Khedive, who by the way is a very pleas-
ant appearing, popular and democratic monarch. The Exposition had a few very ﬁne exhibits of fruits and some of the ﬁnest kinds of large appetizing appear-
ing vegetables, also a beautiful show of
ﬂowers and tropical plants, but taken as a whole it did not begin to come up to the

exhibit 'of any one of several single c0un—'
ties as shown at the Florida State Fair held at Tampa. Oranges are grown and cared for in Egypt about the same way as in Algiers, except they depend on irrigation entirely. Guava trees are not small bushy things as with us, but quite as large as orange trees and are kept pruned up.
From Egypt we went to Italy and Southern France, where from Naples to Nice, along the shore of the Mediterran-
ean, the orange ﬂourishes in a more or less precarious way, being often found growing on narrow- terraces of a moun-
tain side with snow capped peaks in plain view. In fact it appears to me that the Mediterranean varieties of citrus fruits can, and do, stand much more cold than they do with us in Fla. Even in Egypt there had been, shortly before our visit,
enough cold to cut down bananas and knock the leaves off the guava and other tender trees. While the cold is always felt it is seldom extreme enough to freeze the fruit, and at Nice in Southern France,
where they had recently experienced a real freeze, we were told that all fruit that did not drop off the trees within a couple of weeks was considered as good and marketable as if there had been no freezing. Blooming seems later than with us, and it was after the ﬁrst of April before we saw any trees in full bloom.
None of these countries produce orang-
es in quantities large enough to have much apparent effect on our markets, and in fact they do not seem to raise more than enough for home consumption and to supply local and adjacent markets. We only had opportunity to get~at the prices of oranges as sold at retail, and found them selling at approximately the same I price as at home. As a table necessity they seem to be well appreciated, and I do not remember a single dinner any-
‘where in the Orient or Europe that we did not have them. _
We noticed surprising and astonishing things that completely upset our ideas,
based on experience, of the disposition and nature of orange trees, such as seeing them growing and ﬂourishing luxuriant-
ly out of holes in solid rock pavements with no apparent soil or other nourish-
ment for their support and no possible chance to cultivate or fertilize them. We saw them trained against houses and palaces, and shaded into arbors like vines.
In Egypt we saw several large en-
closures fenced in with hedges of orange trees pruned and trimmed into various shapes as the owner’s fancy dictated.
In conclusion I may say that the most prominent feature of our trip was cold always and everywhere, and with the ex-
ception of a few days in Cairo, and one day clambering over lava and in warm volcanic ashes on Mt. Vesuvius, the very day before the great and destructive erup-
tion, we have not had a chance to get warm !
In the lower end of the Jordan Valley,
near the Dead Sea, around the towns of Jericho and Gillgal, was the only place where we did not see evidence of frost.
In this small territory are a few lemons, guavas, etc., but the Turkish sys-
tem of taxation is so oppressive that little
_is undertaken by the wretched inhabitants in the way of fruit growing. They told us that each and every fruit tree was taxed the same, no matter whether it was large or small, barren or productive.
Many were cutting down their trees and selling the wood as the only way to escape this ridiculous method of taxation. With

Question Box.
A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, ANSWERED BY VARIOUS MEMBERS.
1. What is the cause of thick-skinned grapefruit or oranges? Can the trees be fertilized in a way to produce thin-skin-
ned fruit?
Mr. Taber-—Mr. President, I think Mr. Sampson should be called upon to answer this question. '
Mr. Sampson—There are a number of causes for thick—skinned fruit. The ﬁrst crop might have thick skins while the sec-
ond would' not. If you put on too much ammonia in proportion to phosphoric acid and potash, you might expect coarse-
skinned fruit.
Mr. Sample—I would like to know if cultivating it is conducive to thick skin.
Mr. Sampson—I think it is. We had a portion of a natural sour grove where trees were left too thick for anything but hoe cultivation—three times a year—that invariably grew much thinner-skinned fruit than same variety where trees had clean cultivation till rainy reason. They produced much less fruit but it was solid,
handsome fruit and ripened earlier.
Maj. Fairbanks—I have noticed that where I had my stables the land was very rich and the trees planted near there bore very thick skinned fruit. I concluded that too much ammonia was the cause of this thick skin.
Mr. Connor.—In my last report I said something about cultivation. I think the H—ro matter of cultivation can be overdone to a great extent. I have some old soil and I think it is as poor as any in the State.
My plan has been to cultivate it without cultivation, in other words, to make use of the growth of beggar weed etc., mow it down in summer and use what I want for hay, then in the fall and spring run over it with cutaway harrow and chop it into the soil. After three years such treat-
ment it now looks like good soil.
Mr. Cook—I did not hear all that Mr.
Fairbanks said in reference to thick-
skinned grape fruit. My experience has been this; in cultivating the citrus tree and its fruit the use of a highly ammoni-
ated fertilizer with constant and late cul-
tivation produces a vigorous growth of wood and a large, coarse. thick-skinned fruit either grapefruit or orange. By the free use of potash this result can be modi-
ﬁed somewhat as to the fruit.
Mr. Painter-—The thickness of the or-
ange peel depends on several conditions—
fertilizer, cultivation and moisture. or a combination of the three. Young trees that are highly fertilized and thoroughly cultivated will bear thick skinned fruit if the season is one of abundant moisture.
A dry season would produce thin-skinned fruit because the tree cannot take up as much of the plant food from the soil—a lack of moisture means a lack of nitrih-
cation. Old trees that have but little cul-

tivation generally produce the thinnest-
skinned and best appearing fruit.
Mr. Hart—I will say my groves have not been plowed in many years. I do not cultivate deeply after the second year from setting a grove.
I wish to speak of budding the orange,
more especially the Washington Navel on rough lemon stock. This variety is a shy bearer on sweet or sour stock but fruits well on lemon yet my experience is that on stock the navels are very coarse and poor.
My navels were so poor on this stock the past season that I would not have shipped them at all had I known just how poor they were. The fruit may be better on pine lands but for hammock I would say,
don’t use lemon stock at all.
I am cutting down my navels and put-
ting in other varieties.

2. Citrus trees in a grove eight to ten years old have grown so thick limbed that it is almost impossible to gather the fruit grown inside of the trees. Would it be well to prune out a lot of the inner branches and twigs? Would it be a good time directly after the blossoming season is passed?
Mr. Hart—The older I grow in orange culture the more I ﬁnd that I am not posi-
tive of many things I thought I had set-
tled in my mind, I have not settled. I believe in letting the tree grow, I do not think it was born depraved and has to be cut to pieces every year. I do hardly any pruning at all except to take out dead wood and I am very much pleased with results. Now as to the second question,
I would say this much, I would not prune right after the trees bloom, if I were going to prune at all it would be right before the starting of new growth.
I Mr. Connor.—-I was with Mr. Waite while he was pruning some trees in Man-
atee Lemon Co. Grove at Palmetto three years ago. If he has made it pay—after the use of the knife in what I called at that time a very free manner, it would convince me that pruning is a good thing.
I would like to know what his success has been.
Mr. Waite—If the grove is situated near, or in the white ﬂy belt, I should advise pruning out the centers of the or-
ange trees, for the ﬂy likes these thick places, and we have noticed that almost immediately after it gets started in a grove the scale insects kill the most of this inside wood and unless the tree is cleaned out you will get but little fruit.
With us the grapefruit and lemon trees do not grow as compact, and the lemon especially, sheds a great deal of its inside foliage from the fruit spur wood, yet these will invariably produce bloom which is well protected from cold, and the fruit thus produced is of the ﬁnest quality. As the ﬂy is quite severe on the lemon we have found that the scale soon kills a greater portion of this inside wood.
We have no set time for pruning, but I believe that January is the best month in which to prune, as the tree at that time has enough sap ﬂowing to enable it to heal the wounds thus produced.
Mr. Longley.-—-Mr. President, I do not want to interfere only to prove as near as I can that pruning is very objectionable-
I had a neighbor who had a grove of about 85 acres who is always pruning and today he claims four thousand trees,
but he will not average one box of fruit to the tree. I do not prune at all and have a good crop of fruit all through my trees.
I claim that pruning is good in the fore part of the winter before blooming time.

3. What will labor and material cost to
~ spray 5000 medium sized orange trees?-
Mr. Connor.—During the last three weeks I have had some experience in this line, just the experience fruit growers would have who have not the complete apparatus for spraying. The cost of spray-
ing for about 500 trees was something over $7.00, with an additional cost of
$8.00 for material used, or about $15.00
which would be an average cost to depend upon. Trees bearing from two to four boxes.

4. Will whitewashing orange trees with pure carbonate of lime be detrimen-
tal?
Mr. Hart—I remember twenty ﬁve or thirty years ago there was quite a- discus-
sion in regard to whitewashing orange trees. In California several years ago I saw where they had cut back their trees to bud them, and that they had white-
washed the trunks eight or ten feet high to protect them. This might be all right
. but I remember there were objections found to white-washing but they have gone out of my mind just now and I can-
not state them. Perhaps Maj. Fairbanks can give us something on this line.
Maj. Fairbanks—I wish to say that I have no information whatever- I like the orange tree and think it is the most beau-
tiful tree in creation and it is a sacrilege to white-wash it.
Mr. Painter.—Anything put on the orange tree to cover up its pores is in-
jurious, especially during the growing season. White-wash your fence and out-
buildings but wash the trunk of your trees with water and whaleoil soap.
5. I have Mexican clover in my grove and would like to know how to get it out.
Maj. Healey.—Let more of it grow and you will not want to get it out.
Mr. Painter.——I would suggest that if he really wants to get rid of it he move to another county.

6. Explain how, when and-what quanti-
ty of blue vitriol to use for dieback.
Mr. Brown.-—I suppose that the regu-
lar Bordeaux formula would be used; it should be used just previous to the start-
ing of new growth, I should say the latter part of january, but it could be used later in the season. If the tree is in a very bad co'ndition, inoculate the tree, but my plan is to use a spray.
Mr. Longley.——I would like to know what quantity to use in this inoculation.
Mr. Brown—I use a quantity about equal to that of the size of_ a pea inserted right under the bark of the tree.

7. What -is the best remedy for foot rot? Is it best to resort to remedies for the cure of this-disease, or pull out the tree and plant a new one.
Mr. Phelps—Some time, prior to 1895 g I set out ten trees. I found this foot rot on them later. I happened to meet Mr. M. F. Robinson who advised me to,
apply sulphuric acid to the ground and rake it in well, this I did and the very worst tree I had came out ﬁne, in fact better than any of them.
I should dread very much pulling up a tree as it is no little job. and shall do everything I can to save them otherwise and I have saved a good many so far;
I still believe in the sulphuric acid well raked in.

Mr. Painter.—The sulphuric acid remedy referred to by Mr. Phelps is a dilute form. Three gallons of 50 per cent.
B. acid is diluted with seventeen gallons of water.
Mr. Blackman.—I have tried a good many remedies, spraying, cutting away the wood, Sulphuric acid, in fact almost everything I could hear of; but the Only effective remedy I have found for this disease is blue stone- I inoculate the tree close to the ground, cutting the bark the same as for budding and inserting a piece of blue stone about as large as a grain of wheat. This must be done when the sap is up and the tree in a growing condition. I think that for foot rot blue stone is a grand panacea. In some cases it will scar the tree badly, but in time it will heal over and the tree will put on a most vigorous growth. I have found quite a good many trees that were af-
fected; but in every case they were trees grown on low land. I have never seen a tree in our section that was grown on high pine land affected by this disease.
Dr. Bessey.—What is the appearance of a tree with foot rot?
Mr. Brown.——Thy become yellow and drop their leaves. I did not know just what it was at ﬁrst. but I wish I might tell every grower who has foot rot in his grove that if they will put blue stone in the root just at the surface of the ground,
it will surely do the trees good.
Prof. Rolfs.—About four years ago we tried some experiments in treating die-
back by inserting a small piece of blue stone under the bark of trees.» In this experiment a certain number of trees were chosen to work upon, a number of trees were treated as described above and along side of these an equal number left I untreated, careful notes as to the extent of dieback and the location of the lesions in the tree. About three months elapsed before it was practicable to return to take notes on the work, and it was found that treated and the untreated trees were en-
tirely free from dieback. The point I wish to make here is, that it is absolutely impossible to draw a reasonable conclu-
sion from any experiment unless we have checks upon our operations- Die—
back or citrus tree indigestion, may be brought on by a variety of causes. even different trees in the same grove may have dieback from entirely different caus-
es. The matter of ﬁrst importance in treating dieback is to ascertain what caused it and then to remove the cause.
Often times this is all that is necessary.
The recovery of the tree may, however.
be hastened by an application of weak Bordeaux mixture to the upper surface of the leaves. Among the most frequent causes of dieback I may mention plowing during the rainy season, applications of organic ammonia. hard pan or a rather hard sub-stratum under the tree. A tree that has a tendency to dieback may be set over into a case of dieback by pruning or cases or dieback have been known to be brought on by root pruning. In other cases of dieback have been known to be ables them to secure too much organic ammonia are apt to have dieback.
Mr. Hart.——I'n this matter of foot rot,
the time to cure the disease is in its early stages; look out for it. examine the trees and if you ﬁnd gum exuding at or near the ground, dig the dirt away and expose the roots, this will usually cure it. I think when a tree has foot rot so as it loses its leaves it is best to dig it up and set sour stock in its place that is budded eighteen inches above the collar.~
Mr. Frink.—I would like to hear from

Mr. Wilson as to his experience with this foot rot in Porto Rico.
Mr. Wilson—We have a kind of foot rot in Porto Rico which we have fought with carbolic acid and Bordeaux mix-
ture. but whether this is the same foot rot you have in Florida or 'not I do not know. We discovered it a few years ago only on a few trees. \Nhen I ﬁrst found this foot rot on my trees my men put on the carbolic acid too strong and killed the tree but since then I have used this car-
bolic treatment, superintending it myself.
and found it very successful- A neigh-
bor of mine has found this remedy very successful by pulling the dirt away from the trees and washing them with this mixture.

8. \V ill Dr. \Valker please give the so-
ciety a report of the camphor experiment at Huntington?
Dr. VValkeL—Mr. President, I am afraid the subject on which I am going to speak, will place me in rather a false light.
I have in my possession a sample of cam-
phor prepared in Huntington and puriﬁed in \Vashington, but ﬁrst must tell you how this came into importance (and must confess that it is of great importance to us.)
Most of the camphor used in the United States today coines from Formosa. Re-
cently several Japanese authorities were quietly sent over here to see how much camphor was grown, and whether we could raise it successfully or not.
The results of their visit were so serious that the celluloid manufacturers—our great camphor consumers—said, in their report to Washington that they must have American camphor or move to For-
mosa. Camphor, up to this time had been I worth about thirty cents per pound. but immediately advanced to $1.00 per pound.
In 1898 I met Prof. Hubbard who was our State Entomologist and he showed me the results of his experiments. I found that one pound of camphor could be extracted from 70 pounds of leaves.
It was at this time, when it was worth only thirty cents per pound, that people thought it would be a proﬁtable business to plant camphor trees here.
The camphor trees are very beautiful,
and I got rather enthusiastic over mine,
which were growing well. When I heard that another grade of camphor—a chemi-
cal product could be put on the market at
ﬁfteen cents per pound, so thought it would be useless for us to try and raise the trees. Camphor is very similar to tur-
pentine. Many people have tried to make camphor out of turpentine and think it will yet be done-
We waited for a year or two, during which time the camphor workers were said to be hard at work, but no camphor was produced. Then. at a very oppor-
tune moment, these works were burned and we do not think they will be rebuilt.
Camphor is also very essential in the manufacture of smokeless powder. Al-
tho' other substances might be used yet if anything should happen to draw us into a war. when we would require a quantity of powder immediately, we would be in a dilemma if Japan decided not to provide us with the camphor.
About a year ago, a gentleman came down from the experimental station— -
\Vashington—to see what the camphor outlook was in Florida. After a general look around he took samples of this Flori-
da made camphor back to Washington and puriﬁed it. The celluloid people were interviewed and shown the samples which

resulted in an order from the president of the company for 500,000 pounds of Florida camphor at $1.00 per pound. But unfortunately it was not procurable, and we are out that $500,000. (Laughter.)
.The gentleman from the experimental station came down, later to experiment in Huntington. I was only too willing to offer him all the facilities I had for the experiment, as this was such an important question, and should be pushed forward.
In six weeks time he (and his assistant)
returned to Washington and puriﬁed this camphor. I had gotten 1.42 per cent of camphor from my own trees but am told they can do better at Washington. I did not expect to go into the matter very thoroughly, but just pass this information along.
Other trees may be cut down by severe cold, and that is the end, but not so with the camphor trees, as we can use them even four months after they are cut down.
I used some old trees that had been cut down three months, and obtained 1.021
per cent of camphor, so I know that this is true. So, if we go extensively into the business, and a severe frost cuts down the trees, we can still obtain the cam-
phor from them. '
I wish to call attention to the value the camphor tree will be to us within the next ten years. It will be worth millions of dollars, if we only take hold of it. Japan has all the trade now, but can we afford to let her keep it? If Japan says they must pay $2.00 per pound for their camphor,
we, who are obliged to have it, will be obliged to pay. And if she says we can-
not have any at any price we will not get it. If we do not stop the growth of camphor in Formosa, for use in this country, it means the loss to .us of {nil-
lions of dollars- '
I will take my chances on the camphor growing. It is surprising what can be done, and the only thing we need worry about is that this Cynthetic camphor may be made. Yet if it should be, we still have our ornamental trees.
I would like to have the opinion of this association on this subject.
Scattered about in different parts of Putnam county are groves of these trees,
varying in size from a dozen trees to several acres. If we can get the govern-
ment to take the matter up, you see of what great importance it will be to us.
I have offered them every inducement to come to Huntington and experiment on my trees. I am willing for them to cut them down, dig them up, or do anything they like with them. I would like expres-
sions from this society in favor of having this work pushed forward and suggest that they show the government their ap-
proval and appreciation of the experi-
mental work being carried on.
Mr. Steele—On what character of soil is the camphor grown?
Dr. Walker.—It will grow well on any high pine land. I have beautiful trees growing on my place at Huntington. The cost of extracting the camphor cannot yet be determined, as we were only experi-
menting. I do not know how the govern-
ment sample was extracted, but will know in the fall, how it was done. In \about two weeks I expect to have a sample of the ﬁrst celluloid made from this Florida camphor. ( Applause.)
Mr. Steele—*Mr. President, I had a large camphor tree that was killed down in the freeze of 1899, but now it has grown up and is as large as ever. If you will give a camphor tree a fair start,
it will grow right on, almost anywhere.
There is hardly any soil on which it will

not grow. It does not do so well on dry soil.
Mr. Frink.—I would like to supple-
ment what Dr. Walker has just said on the subject of camphor, I have recently had letters from two different gentlemen connected with the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, who stated that re-
cent experiments in producing camphor gum have been extremely successful and they seem to think it highly feasible to produce camphor gum here on a proﬁtable commercial scale. As a result of those ex—
periments I have recently had inquiries for trees in lots of ﬁve to twenty thousand.
From these letters and inquiries I think within a comparatively short time cam-
phor production will become quite an ex-
tensive industry here.

9. Have any of the members of the society seen the nitro culture that is being introduced by the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and with what suc-
cess? '
Mr. Hubbard—I would like to ask the gentlemen from the State Experiment Station what success they have had with Alfalfa and nitro culture.
Dr. Bessey.—In behalf of the depart-
ment I would ask that a distinction be made between nitro culture and nitrogen gathering bacteria.
Mr. Hubbard—Either one of them.
Mr. Henderson—I did not know there were two kinds, I want to know if their use is satisfactory to the department of agriculture.
Mr. Hubbard—Prof. Connor said that they were experimenting with alfalfa at Lake City and I wished to know if they could give us any report that would be of advantage in growing alfalfa. "
Mr. Merriam—I have had some exper-
ience with nitro culture, some of it is very good. There has been a great deal of discussion about this commercial nitro culture and some of the experiment sta-
tions claim that it is not as good as that sent out by the government. I tried some last spring on beans and English peas and it was a success on my peas, I tried it very fully putting it on the seeds and in connection with this I used fertilizer with-
out any nitrogen and right along side of it I put in some that contained ﬁve percent. nitrogen, but the phosphoric acid and potash, with the nitro culture made better peas than the fertilizer. I do not know why it was but I did not get very good results. I used this on some beans but the cold killed the beans so I could not tell about them. I could not see any dif-
ference on cow peas at all, one was as good as the other. I presume that the reason was that the ground was already well inoculated. I understand that it is necessary to have the nitro culture fresh as it will not keep very long in the shape the department puts it up.
Mr. Ellis—Mr. President, I have used the commercial nitro culture on both cow peas and velvet beans and I planted one half with and one half without the nitro culture and we could discover no differ-
ence at all. The nitro culture was bought from a good reliable ﬁrm who claimed that it was fresh. The bacteria seemed to develop all right in the jars, but I could see no difference in the crops at all.
Mr. Henderson.—I tried peas similar to Mr. Merriam with a commercial nitro-
culture but could see no difference.

IO. Has any member of the society had any experience in growing “Ginseng”?
With what success? Can it be success-
fully grown in Florida?
Mr. Painter.——Ginseng has been tried in Florida but the only one who made money out of the deal was the ﬁrm who sold the roots for planting.

11. Can a grove be cared for and fer-
tilized so that it will give a full crop each year, if so, how and when to fertilize it?
Mr. Blackman.—-Mr. President, I can answer that in part, not from my own experience, but for another. This gentle-
man take it one year with another, has good to heavy crops of grapefruit. The
ﬁrst few years his grove bore, it would produce a heavy crop one year, the next lighter. The owner commenced experi-
menting in fertilizing and for the past three years his grove has been loaded almost to the breaking point. I do not know what kind of fertilizer he uses, or how many applications or when applied.
He uses a fertilizer manufactured in this State. He works his grove in the spring,
allowing the weeds and grass to grow through a'portiou of the summer. I do not know how much fertilizer he uses to the tree; but I do know that he gets a full crop each year.
Mr. Connor.—I do not know that I can give any light on this subject but I wish to say that there are so many things that have to be taken into consideration to produce a full crop of fruit that I do not think we can lay it altogether on the kind of fertilizer used for the reason that there as so many other things that we have to take into account. If we do not have moisture then we are not apt to have a full crop of fruit. then again I think the time, and quality of fertilizer used has something to do with it. My idea is that the time of fertilizing is in the fall of the year, it seems to get the grove in better shape to set fruit and then I would follow that with a light application in the spring,
then feed the tree gradually all along the year. If you feed the trees well, being careful to have suitable analysis, you will have no trouble in getting a good crop each year.
Mr. Gist.—-—All of Florida is not so fortunate as to have a rock foundation to put their groves on, therefore some suffer for the lack of moisture. I_ think Mr.
Connor’s remarks were well made, for my observation is that a tree that has been well fed winters well. Down in Miami they do not have to consider the winters as we do. A well fertilized tree will stand a lower degree of temperature than a poorly fed one and thus better crops will be the result the next year.

12. How are bamboos propagated?
Will they grow from cuttings, if so what time should they be put out?
Dr. Walker.—They are propagated by taking the roots. This can be done at most any time.
Mr. Steele—I saw in a neighbor’s yard a large clump of bamboo, from which it was impossible to get a sprout. I took some cuttings, slender twigs, and planted them in moist soil and all grew.

I 3. Given a sandy soil of a tidewater island that is too salt for growing oran-
ges is it possible to neutralize the excess of salt by the use of a special fertilizer?
The soil is so salty that the kelsey plum after being transplanted when matured will taste as salty as if it had been pickled

in brine. Larger pear trees planted in this soil in February continue to grow,
putting on a large crop of fruit and again blooming and fruiting, as did the plums,
and dying the second year after having fruited three crops; the third crop of the second year being immature. This land is well above the ordinary tide and has a
ﬁne growth of palmettoes, live oak, cedar,
accacia and camphor but it is of a peculiar-
ly dry character getting dry immediately after being soaked, seeming to lack nitro-
gen also. I would be glad to know how I can make oranges and other fruits grow on this land.
Mr. Painter.—There is no hope for your ever being able to neutralize the salt in the lower strata of your soil. It is evi-
dently there from salt water from below.
The only “neutralizer” salt has is water.
This dissolves it and would eventually clear the soil if you had perfect drainage and no return of salt water from below.

14. What is the best size of budded stock of the orange or grapefruit to trans-
plant.
Mr. Frink.——In reference to size of bud—
ded trees, I wish to say that there is con-
siderable difference of opinion as to most desirable for planting. Some people pre-
fer a two year bud and others one year bud. The demand is heavier for four to
ﬁve feet one year buds than any other size, and two year buds probably come second. My own observation and exper-
ience goes to show that a four to ﬁve foot one year bud is easier to transplant and everything considered the most desirable size.
Mr. Connor.——We all know that the smaller the plant is or the-closer it is to the seed, the better it transplants. When it is removed from the seed bed, and is tough enough to be transplanted I think this is very true with the orange tree, for this reason; you can get nearly all the
ﬁberous root with the young tree but if you wait until the stock gets to be of large size the feeding roots are necessa-
rily thrown out farther from the plants and it takes a tree in that condition longer to adopt itself to its surroundings and start new roots. My opinion is that stock from two to two and a half years old well supplied with ﬁbre roots will adopt itself better and receive less shock by trans-
planting than the large ones with no
ﬁbers.. I do not care so much about the age of the bud it may be one or two years old.
Mr. Hart—My interests simply call for the best tree I can get and my ex-
perience has been that the size of stock is of more importance in successful trans-
planting than size of bud. I would pre-
fer the stock to be two inches through.
I have trees bought from nursery stock that were not larger than my ﬁnger after the freeze of 1899 and they are not much larger yet, but I have some trees of my own growing that I planted out three years ago. these buds were thrifty, the stocks of good size and the trees now are many times larger than the smaller ones set years before. I came to this State when the trees for our groves were all taken from wild hammock and we did not take any stock less than two inches in diameter and some wEre six inches through. We set them out and budded them as they were set out, you cannot do that with the small nursery trees. It takes them some time to start new growth but you take large trees at the ground. not too large say about three and one-half inches through and you will get your

grove quicker and make more fruit. You bud the trees after they are transplanted and your buds start right to growing and in three years you have proﬁtable bearing trees. I would not cut the old stock .down close to the bud until the buds get to growing rapidly, then cut them off and wax them and the wound will soon be covered over and a smooth trunk result.
You will get thrifty bearing trees from large stock, while the small stock will give away to drouth or any of the ills to which the trees are heir.
Mr. Connor-—Did you ever try trans-
planting smaller trees from the nursery?
Mr. Hart—I certainly have. Have you ever planted four inch stock? That is well worth trying.
Mr Connor—Take a good tree and at the end of three years you cannot reach the tops of them. I have some now that I tried this with and I cannot reach the tops of them. I have never seen ﬁner trees than I have in my grove planted three years, and I used the ordinary four or ﬁve foot bud, one year old in nursery.
Mr. Longley.—-It makes a great differ-
ence in conditions. I suppose Mr. Hart’s place is on hammock land- On my pine land I have taken stock three eights of an inch thick and planted between trees that had been planted two years, that had grown from one and a half to two inches.
In three years from that time the small trees were the ﬁnest by far and all planted in the same row.
Mr. Chilton—In the past few years I have set out in groves about/20,000 trees of different varieties and I certainly must bear out the view of Mr. Hart in refer-
ence to a good large thrifty stock with a two year old bud in preference to a small stock and bud. I have been in the busi-
ness for the past thirty years and came to this State in the old time, which Mr. Hart speaks of when we had large wild groves of the orange scattered all through our hammocks and know the time when we set those large sour stumps, six and eight inches in diameter and after budding they made a quick bearing grove.
In three years we could count on a good crop. It takes too long to wait with small stock. I prefer a good thrifty four year old stock with a two years old bud of not less than three inches in diameter to. start with and a two year bud.\ The stock should be vigorous which is one of the main points to beginners.
Mr. Blackman.—Is it possible to lay down any iron clad rules that will govern all conditions in the different parts of the state?
Mr. McCarty--—No, of course not.
Mr. Blackman.—The ﬁrst two years is the critical time with orange and grape-
fruit trees in Dade county and my exper-
ience is that a year old bud is the best for planting in that climate and soil. In Marion county I used three year old buds with good success; but not so at Miami.
Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I have a few government hybrid buds here that I cut last winter, if I remember correctly about six hundred. I now have permis-
sion to' distribute these and if any one present would like to try these oranges I will be glad to give them some buds.
Many people have-been writing and ask-
ing the for these varieties and some seem inclined to go into these new varieties heavily. I would not advise that yet, we do not know enough about them. Or-
ange trees when they ﬁrst bear do not

show just what the fruit will be later.
I am the only one who has fruited these two varieties the Trimble and Weshart and both of them have been earlier in former seasons than the ordinary. tan-
gerine and of larger size. The fruit has been large this year but not quite so early as heretofore. It may develop later to be an early orange or it may not, we do not know, I would advise testing them in a small way on different soil. '
Mr. Taber.-—I would like to ask again what these two varieties are, as condi-
tions were so unsettled we did not get-
them.
Mr- Hart—They are Trimble and Weshart, I will give a few buds to any one who would like them; they are hybrids, crosses between the Parson Brown and Dancy Tangerine but are practically tangerines. I took it for granted that most of the members had read of them. As I cannot supply them by mail I take this opportunity.

Mr. Painter.—Basic slag is a by-pro-
duct in the manufacture of iron. It is also known as odorless phosphate or Thomas slag. It was introduced into Florida about ﬁfteen years ago but did not become popular. It was then manu-
factured at or near Philadelphia but is no longer made there. Basic slag does not contain any water soluble phosphoric acid.
About one-half of the total phosphoric acid is soluble in citrate of ammonia. be-
ing tri~calcium phosphate or reverted phosphoric acid. It would be impossible to have water soluble phosphoric acid and lime in the same mixture as the.
lime would at once revert the phosphoric acid. Slag is good for sweetening sour land but lime is much cheaper. One ton of lime will neutralize about seven times as much acid as one ton of slag.
