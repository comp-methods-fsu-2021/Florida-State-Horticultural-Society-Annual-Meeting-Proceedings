 Horticultural Pioneers of the Tropics  WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO HELP THEM@@   David Fairchild, Agricultural Explorer in Charge of Foreign Seed and Plant@@  Introduction  Horticulture is an expression of hu- forest, grow up again to weeds and lianas   man intelligence. It does not differ m this respect from sculpture or architec¬ ture. They all result in the creation of forms. There is this difference though. Horticulturists are working with living, growing things, whereas sculpture and architecture are concerned with materials which stay for ages where man puts them. But just as piles of rock or banks of clay do not make architecture and sculpture, so plants do not make horticulture. '  The tropics are filled with plants but there is amazingly little horticulture in the tropics. The great living persistent intelligences are not there.  Look the tropics over and what do you find? Here and there some lonely, flick¬ ering, intellectual light which refuses to be put out by that wet blanket of indiffer¬ ence which will sooner or later smother any but the most brilliantly burning flame.  It has been my peculiar position during the past twenty-two years to be in touch with these lonely intellects of horticul¬ ture scattered throughout the tropical world and the picture of their struggle continually stirs my emotions.  They are building little places which, like the small clearings of some tropical   as soon as the ^ood chopper dies. They select new varieties of fruits or vegeta¬ bles but these are lost again. They plant variety collections of their pets but when they die who cares for them?  Around government-owned and op¬ erated gardens of the Tropical Colo¬ nies of various European countries there are little centers of horticulture which rally now and then the few congenial spirits who for short periods happen to be located there as officials or business men. As a rule, however, these are show gardens with laboratories attached to them in which research work for the planters is done on some of the staple tropical crops of the colony. Of tropical horticulture there is amazingly little.  But if you have agreed with me that horticulture is the expression of human intelligence it can be easily shown why there is so little horticulture in the trop¬ ics. There are so few people there of the kind of intelligence necessary for its de¬ velopment. We are inclined to overesti¬ mate the white populations of the tropics. I wonder if many of you know that scat¬ tered over the whole group of islands in Hawaii there are only 30,000 white peo¬ ple; that Jamaica has only a little over       15,000; and Trinidad about the same; and that in the whole Dutch East Indies which stretches for 3,000 miles around the, globe at the equator there are only 80,000 Europeans and half castes. The Straits Settlements have not much over 8,000; and Natal with its 35,000 square miles has only 98,000 whites in it, where¬ as Queensland with over half a million square miles of territory has only 380,000 whites and the largest city in it which is the largest white city in the tropics has only 168,000 inhabitants.  When you remember how small a pro¬ portion of people are interested in horti¬ culture anyway and how scattered the populations of the tropics are I believe you will be prepared to accept my state¬ ment that there are more people in Flor¬ ida who are interested in tropical horti¬ culture than in any other place in the world.  At a risk even of offending those trop¬ ical regions of both hemispheres, there¬ fore, I believe it is perfectly proper to address you, gentlemen horticulturists of the Florida Horticultural Society, as the horticultural pioneers of the tropics.  But you are so by reason of your po¬ sition rather than by reason of your ac¬ complishments, great as those have been; and it is my pleasure to address you to¬ day with a view of helping you go ahead and prove what I believe you have al¬ ready proved, that you are the chosen people, the great pioneers of tropical hor¬ ticulture.  We all know that Florida can scarcely claim to have even her nose inside the re¬ gion of tropical lowlands. She might be compared with some great Mesa rising   from some tropical plain with her plateau visited by the, cold winds and frosts of the 8,000 foot altitude.’ She is too cold for the plants, but ideal for the people; and settling there like blackbirds on a rice field, they come in swarms. The whites have found a climate just above the trop¬ ics where they can live and work out of doors. This is one reason why you will be great pioneers. Horticulture is pecu¬ liarly an art of the hands. Who ever heard of a horticulturist who could not bud and graft and perform all of the nec¬ essary operations connected with the propagation of plants.  But there is another great reason why you will be the, pioneers. It will pay you. The product of your art will have a com¬ mercial value. It will pay its way. Com¬ pare the lure of $750 profit from a single avocado tree or $130 from a mango tree with the lukewarm interest which a better variety of either of these fruits produces when offered in a market swarming with inferior varieties.  “What is the, use?” said Dr. Kraemers from Java as he was' eating some deli¬ cious Florida oranges and bewailing the fact that they never had any good or¬ anges in Java. “The people would not pay any more for them if I introduced them.”  Mr. Popenoe wrote me from Ecuador that he had found a plantation there of the most delicious of all tropical fruits— the Mangosteen, but that the fruits were rotting on the ground. Imagine it, gen¬ tlemen, fruits of the mangosteen, which has been rightly called the Queen of Tropical Fruits, going to waste in the only respectable sized orchard of that      fruit in the Western Hemisphere. No market.  What developed the. horticulture under glass, of Belgium, where one could travel for hours under acres of whitewashed panes? The London and other markets which were, willing to pay any prices al¬ most for Gros Colemans, Black Hamburg grapes or wall nectarines. No horticul¬ ture will develop unless those engaging in it can make a good living out of it, for those who can produce good fruit belong to the most intelligent people in any coun¬ try and they will not live on the ragged edge of society. They must have the ne¬ cessities and some of the luxuries of an intellectual life or they will drift into other occupations. This is why you find in the tropics generally such inferior fruits and vegetables. Nobody of intel¬ ligence wants to engage in their produc¬ tion. It does not pay.  But there is still another reason. Peo¬ ple have to learn to like tropical fruits and vegetables. It is one of the strange phenomena of life—this acquiring of a taste for something new. When I first returned from a stay in the eastern trop¬ ics where I had formed a liking for many interesting tropical fruits I was annoyed to find on every side people, who had the idea that there was something mawkish and over sweet about the fruits of the tropics. The ridicule to which some of the very finest of them all were subjected was enough to discourage anyone; and had we not become so involved in their fate in this country by starting out to grow them, I sometimes wonder if we would have persisted in a study of them. It used to seem as though my friends   were purposely antagonistic towards these beautiful fruits and many an un¬ happy hour did their jibes and ridicule cause me.  But it was all unnecessary, for theirs was the perfectly natural reaction towards something new and time has taught me that even the lower animals and the insects at first refuse almost any new food to which they are not accus¬ tomed. But why then should this diffi¬ culty present an advantage to Florida. Because of all the peoples in the world the American is least fixed in his food habits. How this has come about I do not know. Whether it is a part of the general adaptability of this mixed race which is developing under this climate with its tremendous temperature changes would be important to know. That it is a fact I believe can be proven.  If we take a look at the development of British horticulture or French horti¬ culture we get a picture of fashionable garden parties and flower and fruit shows; of royalty appearing at this one and awarding medals or at that taking prizes for their gardens. It is wealth and the rivalries of competing gardeners of great estates which have produced some of the finest varieties of flowers or fruit. Millions have gone into this horticulture of Great Britain—many millions. Think of the craze for hyacinths and mulberries, and orchids, and rhododendrons; or the costly fruit houses where, at one time even the mangosteen was fruited; or the fern¬ eries and now the rock gardens for whose crannies explorers would scale the crags of the Himalayas or brave the wild men of the land of the cross bow.      These things have not come in the trop¬ ics to any extent because there were too few people. But they will come and the < question which I wish you to look at to¬ day is whether the horticulturists of Flor¬ ida are not really destined to be the pio¬ neers in this new horticulture of the trop¬ ics.  They have a climate in which they can work with their own hands all the year round. They have around them in in¬ creasing numbers each year the people of means. They have large numbers of young people to recruit their ranks from. They have a public more willing to take new fruits than the world ever saw be¬ fore. That public goes and comes from * the great centers of a great country which is of all the countries in the world the greatest fruit eating one. The drift of dietetics is towards a greater vegetable diet among people of middle age and they are the people who have their hands on the money.  I am of course aware that many here come from parts of the State which are too frequently visited by frosts to have the same interest in strictly tropical plants which the citizens of Miami and vicin¬ ity have but the question of frost and pro¬ tection from it is connected with every agriculture no matter where you travel on the earth’s surface.  What are the horticulturists trying to do on the bleak plains of Canada? Pro¬ duce a plum which will ripen before the frost can get it in September. What are the almond growers of California stay¬ ing up nights for? Waiting to see if the late spring frost has killed their Jordan almond blossoms and spared their IXL   variety. What is the experiment station in Luleo, Sweden, doing? By extensive breeding experiments, trying to produce a shorter season barley for Lapland.  So, although most of us try to push into the background, when we talk with Northerners, the question of frost, in¬ stead of admitting that it is a factor con¬ nected with all agriculture except that ac¬ tually below the isotherm of 32 F., it is a fact that Florida horticulturists will always be striving to produce hardier forms which can be grown farther north; and that with their production will come wider areas of their cultivation just as the production by Prof. Saunders of the early-maturing Marquis wheat by hybrid¬ ization and selection extended the area *  of this cereal tremendously in the Cana¬ dian Northwest.  But still, what has all this to do with horticulture and its development in the real tropics? Just this. The tremendous stimulus of a great people of 100,000,000 consuming the horticultural products of the tropics. Nothing great that I know of started large. It had its little begin¬ ning. I had the pleasure in 1898 of talk¬ ing with Captain Baker in Port Antonio and of hearing from his own lips the story of his first schooner load of frying pans which he took to the West Indies and of how in desperation he bought a load of bananas and peddled them in Bos¬ ton. The banana was so rare a fruit in Germany and France in 1895 that three of us American students in Bonn dis¬ graced ourselves by laughing out loud in the course of a serious botanical disser¬ tation of how to eat one. The great American public took up the banana. It      would have it. It was willing to pay money for it and the satisfying of this demand has had a greater influence on tropical horticulture than almost anything else since the discovery of the uses of the juice of the rubber tree.  As our fathers and mothers were in at the beginning of the banana so we here today are. standing at the threshold of an¬ other tropical industry which in magni¬ tude may in the lifetime of some here ri¬ val that of the banana itself. I refer to the avocado.  But there are many who will talk here of that remarkable fruit and I shall only allude to it to help me prove what I start¬ ed out to prove to you—that the pioneer work in tropical horticulture is here, and not somewhere off in the sweltering, malaria-infested lowlands, or even on the isolated, inaccessible slopes of some, trop¬ ical volcano, alluring as those places most certainly are to the collector and the lab¬ oratory research man.  If the tropics is the place where, trop¬ ical horticulture will develop why is it that there is not a single large orchard of budded avocados anywhere in the West Indies or Central America whereas there are hundreds of acres of them here?  But someone will say I have chosen as an example a fruit with which Califor¬ nia has done more than Florida, which is true. But my explanation of the rea¬ son is that California has had the wealth and the people.  But let us take a more strictly tropical species, the mango, and see what the sit¬ uation there is. It is one of the most highly prized fruits of India. I have dis¬ cussed its varieties with the wealthiest   Parsee of that vast country, sitting in his marble palace as he gave me the, promise of plants of his best sorts. Its culture there is centuries old and the Mahrad Jas fostered its cultivation and built up vari¬ ety collections, but they did little to study its diseases and nothing which we can discover to produce by careful breeding and selection the finest varieties of which the species is capable. No such question as that of the best stock on which to graft or bud it had been worked out and even the old and expensive system of inarching was the only known method of its propa¬ gation in vogue there. With millions of square miles of territory where giant mango trees could be grown in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere was it not to . be expected that there would have devel¬ oped orchards of the finest varieties to be found in India? Varieties without any fiber which could be eaten as easily as a canteloupe? We have searched the tropics of South America and Central America in vain. The finest mango of Brazil (Mango de. Rosa) is too full of fiber to merit classing as even a fair va¬ riety. The call has come in from these countries for the fine Florida mangos such as that remarkable seedling, the Hayden, than which there is none ap¬ proaching it in commercial character, and thousands of budded plants of these and our imported varieties have been sent into the western tropics.  Some of you perhaps know the strug¬ gle which resulted in the saving of the mother of the Hayden, the Mulgoba. It would be hard to imagine such a struggle and such patience over a new variety of fruit inside the tropics. 1 wish I could      read to you one of the last letters of that early pioneer, Prof. Gale, which he wrote to me. after, for the third time, his Mul- goba mango (the only tree in America) had been killed to the ground. I asked him if he wasn’t discouraged and he came back with that optimism which seems to be characteristic of the old fighting American stocks of eighty years, saying that now he felt convinced that Mango growing was going to be an industry in South Florida. I think of that letter when I see thousands of budded Hayden mangos and hear the. accounts of big profits from single trees which were made last year.  But I have a more serious undertaking than would be indicated by such examples as the Mulgoba mango. These are days when the question of a food supply is up¬ permost in people’s minds, particularly the minds of the legislators.  I sat one afternoon in the woods of Maryland with Mr. Hoover. It was just after the crisis had been passed with re¬ gard to our supply of quinine and we had suddenly realized that Holland had a complete monopoly of that indispensable drug. I was tremendously interested in Mr. Hoover’s conception of the growing importance of the tropical food supply and of the speed with which other coun¬ tries were pushing into them in search of the vast wealth which lies in those vege¬ table oils which every year in immense quantities can be produced there. His long experience in tropical countries has made him realize their tremendous po¬ tentiality and I shall miss my guess if he does not bring into a prominence which   few here realize the great future for Americans in its exploitation.  The discovery of a use for a tropical raw material is the first step in its ex¬ ploitation is it not? How are new uses discovered? By the action of those in¬ tellects which through experience in a certain field have come to know what is needed in that field, in another way. The presence of the intellects is as necessary as the presence of the raw material and here is where Florida comes in. She has the people. She has coming here every winter hundreds of thousands of people who spend their lives in close touch with the most specialized industries in Amer¬ ica. Men who have made their fortunes by discoveries. These men are scatter¬ ing out all over the country getting the only kind of rest which such men take— a change of interest. Why is it unreas¬ onable to suppose that with the bringing in around them of all sorts of these trop¬ ical plants their attention should be at¬ tracted to their possibilities, and out of their interest in them come the develop¬ ment of a demand for them which will extend into the tropics and lead to a great tropical industry?  These things do not seem so specula¬ tive to me as they perhaps would had I not stood with Ridley in his first little plantation of Para rubber and caught in a mustard tin the latex which hardened into an eraser which I still use and which every time I do use it reminds me of the fact that since I caught that juice over 500,000 acres have been planted to that tree, many coming from seeds from that very tree; and that after supplying every motor car with a tire the juice is still       flowing from these half million acres of trees and a Dutch representative from Java has come to suggest that we make rubber carpets and rubber roofs out of the juice in order to utilize it. The trop¬ ical jungles of the Amazon were filled with that para rubber tree, but planta¬ tions of it in the Orient have made jun¬ gle rubber unprofitable.  It is in these little beginnings that the government can and is helping you pio¬ neers of tropical horticulture.  The Office, of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction with which I have had the pleasure of being connected for twenty- three years is that branch of the Depart¬ ment of Agriculture, which concerns it¬ self with these little beginnings. It hunts for plants in various parts of the world, sending out trained agricultural explor¬ ers and through its hundreds of corres¬ pondents getting in living material at the rate of about 2,000 things a year. I would like to present to you on the screen some of these agricultural explorers. They are not accustomed to appearing in public. The public does not yet accord them the honor which it gives to more spectacular explorers. A man who can dance a prettier dance or throw a swifter ball or kick a higher kick or punch hard¬ er will figure large in the newspapers; whereas the man who makes a new plant grow where none grew before or who even creates through hybridization an en¬ tirely new fruit is “just another plant crank” in the eyes of the so called public. I suppose the world will always be lured by the spectacular at least for many gen¬ erations to come. It is its way.   But let me select a few of those lit¬ tle beginnings of tropical horticulture which would develop fast if the public were as quick to take up new things as those of us who are interested in the new things themselves could wish it were. And here is where the great mission of Flor¬ ida comes in. If the people of Florida could only see that by the cultivation of a spirit of progressiveness and open- mindedness they might have here more new and novel foods with which to inter¬ est those coming from the North than any other State in the Union. In my imagination I can hear this kind of a con¬ versation between a Florida business man and a stranger. “What, didn’t you taste a Papaya while you were in Florida ? Don’t you know the Sapodilla ? Or that new hy¬ brid fruit the Tangelo? Or the delicious drink made of the Rangpur Lime and the Persian Lime combined? Or have Dasheen crisps for breakfast? Or make your lunch of an Avocado? Or taste frosted cake with fresh shredded coco¬ nut on it? Or wait long enough to eat a White Sapote? You never even heard of pigeon peas and Hopping John and bonavist pea soup and fresh cassava pud¬ ding? Well, what is the use of going to a place where all sorts of new things to eat can be had and not tasting them? You must have lived in one of the, hotels which cater to the provincial northern taste with a French chef and a character¬ less menu.” The northerner might re¬ ply that he didn’t like new things anyhow but he would have a guilty feeling never¬ theless.  No, the thing to do, it seems to me, is to look at every new plant which will      grow here from the standpoint of its possible utilization by the millions of peo¬ ple north of us. If it has a beautiful flow¬ er can it be grown here, shipped north and forced there, can its flowers be sent north and sold, has it a new perfume which might become popular? If a new vine, could young plants be sent north and used as porch vines during the summer or would it grow outdoors and form a win¬ dow decoration? If it is a fruit what sea¬ son would it be possible to get it into the hands of your friends in the north? Will it carry well? Has its juice new possi¬ bilities of utilization? Is it a better keep¬ er than those with which it will compete ? If it is a new vegetable what are its ad¬ vantages ? Some of its preparations may prove better than those of its competitors.  It may have a pleasant flavor after being thrice cooked and be just the veg¬ etable that diabetics are looking for and which will prolong the lives of thousands by its introduction. Think how many men and women are now eating under doctors’ prescriptions a sea weed—agar agar. Supposing that it should be possi¬ ble to create a fashion for it which would make it supplant spinach and that it were a safer crop than spinach to grow here. The inhabitants of northern Celobes eat the leaves of the Papaya and throw the fruits to the hogs. Dr. Powers investi¬ gated these leaves and finds they contain carpaiin in large amounts but I have af¬ ter cooking the leaves until all bitterness is gone eaten them without injury. In Yucatan there is a tree which grows here luxuriantly and which there supplies del¬ icate greens throughout the summer.   But I know men here in the audience who are saying, “Yes, but it’s such a slow business.” One real estate, man said to me “Let’s try something easier.” A friend of mine who made 8,000 limousines, after hearing my enthusiastic account how af¬ ter ten years we had gotten a new vege¬ table started, scornfully remarked, “Yes, but ten years is an awfully long time.” I admit all this. I see the difficulties which present themselves to the minds of those who would hurry through life, but I also have in mind the small amounts of money which are going into this ex¬ ploitation of new food plants. The gov¬ ernment has not spent on all of the work of this introduction of plants that has been carried on for nearly a quarter of a century as much as $2,000,000 for the whole period and yet last year those growing these introduced plants made $89,000,000 out of their culture. At the present time there are thousands of individual incomes which are greater than the $125,000 which is going into this work next year and of this sum only a small fraction can be used in the exploi¬ tation of new foods. The main expendi¬ ture must still go into the securing of new plants and their distribution to those who will bring them to a point where individ¬ ual initiative will exploit them.  There is another side to this big prob¬ lem. It is intimately connected with cre¬ ating a demand, a taste for a new tropi¬ cal food. Supposing Captain Baker had taken a liking to the West Indian Mangos which are all seedlings and instead of the banana had brought that in. Is it imag¬ inable that he could have created a liking   4      for it and built up a big business with it ? I cannot imagine it. The introduction of the delicious M;ulgoba and other fiber¬ less sorts and their further improvement in the Hayden is what is acquainting the great American public with the excellen¬ cies of that incomparably delicious fruit. And when Americans once really go after the mango and it becomes a million-dol- lar industry, its beginnings will trace right back to the shores of Lake Worth and Biscayne Bay, just as the first days of the grapefruit, which is today as much talked about in France as the banana was a generation ago, were spent here in the south tip of Florida.  Why, I once had the pleasure on a rail¬ way Pullman of presenting a Florida- grown mango of a variety which the great Parsee Tatta had given me, to the millionaire of Cleveland who had escorted Tatta through this country when he vis¬ ited America. He had volunteered the remark that he had been through India and he considered the mango a much over-rated fruit. He opened and ate the Florida-grown Amini mango and de¬ clared, as any honest man would, “I must never have eaten a good one.”  Most of the objection in the minds of the public to what they call tropical fruit is to poor seedling varieties of it. Over half of those who don’t like them have never eaten the selected superior types of those fruits which you pioneers are bring- into existence through your art. We can¬ not blame the. public so long as we give them only rank flavored seedlings, and when we once give them the best of their kinds they will come after them with the money fast enough.   It is in a very real sense then that you are the pioneers of tropical horticulture, for it is to you that a public of a hun¬ dred millions is looking for the perfection of these bewiilderingly fascinating new forms of plants which inhabit the great forests and savannahs of the tropical zone.  So those who have come here to live, should let nobody belittle the mission of Florida. To look upon what you do here as affecting only a narrow sand spit— a sand bar as it were out into the Gulf of Mexico—is to forget that what you do here to improve the plants and popu¬ larize them affects the whole American consuming public by creating a demand which, as our population increases, will draw first on Florida soils and later on the whole available tropics.  Is it not worth while to teach a hun¬ dred million people to like a fruit which can be grown cheaply over millions of acres of inexhaustible volcanic lands where the sunlight and moisture make the fruiting of it a perpetual performance?  Is it nothing to so improve a fruit or nut or vegetable that its use by a great people is made possible and its culture stimulated in regions which never could have been devoted to the cultivation of the wild form of it?  Is it nothing to build up a body of trained and enthusiastic men and women from which will be recuited those who, as opportunity comes, will go out into the wider strictly tropical field prepared to accomplish something worth while be¬ fore the malaria and other diseases pull them down to that dead level of exist¬ ence which almost every white resident      complains of as the; drawback of the trop¬ ics?  The machinery is working which will bring in the plants for the horticulturists. It is woefully inadequate, I know better than you do, but at least it is function¬ ing. But where; are the plant breeders and plant breeding gardens and institu¬ tions where tfte arts of tropical horticul¬ ture are taught to the young men and women who are growing up here ?  A great opportunity is here for the es¬ tablishment of an Institute of Tropical Horticulture which shall become a real center of learning with respect to the problems of the tropics.  Florida’s isolation with a zone of cold land on the north and the sea on the south should make it possible to keep her free from the swarm of tropical diseases and insect pests which has already over¬ whelmed Hawaii and is rapidly sweeping Cuba and Porto Rico and the other West Indian Islands. I was shown the other day a photographic calendar from Ha¬ waii of one of those coconut-planted beaches and to my dismay I realized that the beauty of those Hawaiian palms had departed. A leaf moth has converted them into a lot of worn out feather dust¬ ers. Here is one spot where with intel¬ ligence and money we can have cultures of tropical plants free from disease or at least where the, diseases will be under control.  And here I come to one of the most amazing performances, one of the gigan¬ tic gifts to the world which you pioneers of Florida have given.  I know some of you will not agree with me. I fear some of you have been back¬   ward in recognizing the value of the con¬ tribution. Some of you may still be an¬ tagonistic towards those who brought the conditions into existence because they abridge your individual rights and ham¬ per you in your individual ambitions.  But if I had only the command of lan¬ guage I would love to put this accom¬ plishment before you so that you could not fail to appreciate it.  To one who as an orchid hunter wan¬ ders through the jungles of Java with its hundred and eighty inches of rainfall, every leaf seems clean and every tree free from disease; but a closer inspection will teach you that where the. trees and plants grow there grow their fungus diseases and the insect pests. As long' ago as 1895, when I was first there the Dutch had been so aroused by the complete de¬ struction of the Java coffee plantations by the leaf disease that Treub, the great director of the Botanic Gardens, was building an Experiment Station after the pattern of our American ones in order to study the diseases of the. tropical crops of the archipelago.  Here in Florida where you have such a large body of intelligent plant growers you have done with the aid of funds which a public living far away from you has in part supplied, an amazing thing. You have stamped out one of the dead¬ liest and most easily communicated of plant diseases by your combined efforts. You have shown that the thing is pos¬ sible. Can you imagine such a thing be¬ ing done Anywhere else—anywhere where there was not an intelligent public and easy means of communication?      Have you forgotten that it was the entomologists and their knowledge which made the building of the Panama Canal possible? Cannot you see that the dis¬ coveries which led up to the control of the mosquito, like the discoveries which led up to the building of the first dynamo will be talked of long after the greatest engineering feat which was made possi¬ ble by it have been forgotten ?  To have controlled a virulent plant dis¬ ease ! Look at it from the angle of the future. Go to Hawaii and see what the uncontrolled gathering of plants from all over the tropical world led to and how impossible it has been found to eradicate such pests as the fruit fly.  You, pioneers of tropical horticulture, have shown the vision. Men like, your own neighbors here have seen the hand¬ writing on the wall of your gardens. They have seen how easily your wonderful gar¬ dens would fade; how the unequal fight with the invisible, but none the less de¬ structive monsters from the tropical jun¬ gles, are swarming over your garden walls and will overrun your plantations.  You may complain that they see dan¬ gers where they do not exist and un¬ doubtedly they sometimes do, but does not any doctor see his patient from the pathological side? Are they more in¬ clined to exaggerate than any group of enthusiasts? Will all these things not gradually regulate themselves ?  You see, and I quite agree with you, that the cold water has been thrown on the individual initiative which once prompted amateurs to send all over the world for plants because of the thrills which the introduction of a new plant   brings with it. This work is now cen¬ tered in a small branch of the Federal Department of Agriculture in Washing¬ ton in so far at least as it relates to the out of the way parts of the world. I re¬ gret this, although perhaps I am as re¬ sponsible for its coming about as any¬ one; but it has been for years a dream— a dream which I shall have to leave to younger hands and brains to work out— that there should be in every great section of this country trained men whose busi¬ ness it is to study not only the plants which are grown there, but, through ex¬ tensive travel and repeated comparison, those which exist in all other parts of this planet which have similar conditions of soil and climate. The organization of a central office and the sending out of ag¬ ricultural explorers from that office has been a good beginning but only a begin¬ ning.  The issues are too vast and the number of new plants too many and their study too complicated to make it possible in the brief span of a single human life to do more than touch such a field in the most superficial way. Why should it seem an extravagance for a great commonwealth to spend money on this form of research when it cannot fail to unearth forms of plants which when brought under the searching eyes and within the range of the inventive brains of thousands of ama¬ teurs like yourselves will yield new foods, produce through breeding immensely val¬ uable immune and hardier varieties and form the basis of new and lucrative plant industries ?  Let me sum up as I see them your great opportunities.      A wonderful climate for horticultural operations. An isolation which can be made a protection against the plant dis¬ eases of the tropics, and permit a degree of control of those diseases which is hardly to be hoped for anywhere else in the world. A public coming right to your groves with more money to spend than had the kings and courtiers of a few gen¬ erations ago. A public, furthermore, which has not fixed its tastes on certain things to the exclusion of all others. A commonwealth filled with those; restless spirits—those American pioneers—with¬ out whom this country would not be to¬ day what it is, the most rapidly evolv¬ ing country in the whole world. And a mission which reaches far beyond the confines of your State—the. mission of educating a hundred millions of people regarding that wealth of tropical foods and other useful plant material which lies as yet almost untouched in the tropical forests and savannahs of the world.   The opportunities are here, but you * must build higher your centers of learn¬ ing. Increase with all the speed you can your laboratories of research. Gather together great collections of the plants - which will grow here and furnish mate¬ rials for the breeders. Open the. doors of opportunity for those bright eyed, cu¬ rious minded, little boys and girls who today are catching butterflies and gath¬ ering snails and fishing on the keys when they are not picking fruit in your groves.

 The Institute for Re search in Tropical America@@   Wilmon Newell@@ Gainesville@@   Some of you may assume, from the title of this paper, that the subject is a dry one. I can assure you that it is not, but, on the contrary, there is before us an opportunity to secure for Florida an institution which not only promises to greatly surpass any existing institution in the southern states but one which will presently attain a world-wide distinction in the field of science, including agricul¬ ture and horticulture. I will confess, at this time, that I requested your President and Secretary to afford me the opportun¬ ity of talking to you on this subject, be¬ cause I honestly believe that w<e have something of vital interest to this Soci¬ ety, and that, furthermore, this Society is the logical agency to take the initial step towards getting this institution lo¬ cated in Florida.  Without further preliminaries, permit me to say that within recent months— practically since the close of the World War—there has developed among scien¬ tific investigators, particularly plant pathologists, a definite movement for in¬ vestigations in the tropics, pertaining not only to plant diseases, but to various lines of agricultural and horticultural work. The beginning of this movement is right here in the United States. It is not mere¬ ly the expression of a desire on the part of scientists to explore the tropics along   their respective lines of research, but is the crystallization of the plans and needs of many individuals and large business interests whose financial investments in tropical countries are such as to make certain lines of scientific research a vital necessity. There are many business firms in this country that have extensive holdings in the tropics and the future success of many of their ventures is de¬ pendent upon the solution of agricultural, horticultural or biological problems. It is only natural, therefore, that such a movement, virtually international in scope, should develop at this time.  There is also great need for a more complete knowledge of the trees, plants and crops of the tropical regions than is now available, to say nothing of the, fact that medical men need a knowledge of many factors which concern the origin and dissemination of tropical diseases. There is also a crying need for an insti¬ tution in which students may specialize in the study of tropical problems, in or¬ der to qualify themselves for employment by business interests having investments in the tropics. And it is equally desira¬ ble that there be provided, in cr by the United States, in some form, an advanced educational institution wherein students from the Latin-American countries may take advantage of the large amount of bi-          ological knowledge which has been ac¬ quired by American investigators. All of which things would be directly contrib¬ utory to a closer relationship between the United States and the other American countries.  The step which led up to the organiza¬ tion of the Institute for Research in Tropical America was the appointment, on November 5, 1920, by the National Research Council, through its Division of Biology and Agriculture, of a “Commit¬ tee on Scientific Research in The Phil¬ ippines and Other Tropical Countries.” On November 19, 1920, this committee reported to the National Research Coun¬ cil that, as a result of its investigations, it had found a number of Philippine prob¬ lems demanding prompt solution, most of which vitally concern and are closely identified with important commercial ventures, the headquarters of which are in the United States. One step followed another in rapid succession and “The In¬ stitute for Research in Tropical Amer¬ ica” was formally organized on January 15, 1921. The President of the institute is Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, personally known to many of you, and the Secretary-Treas¬ urer is Dr. G. R. Lyman of the Bureau of Plant Industry, United States Depart¬ ment of Agriculture.  Now, what is this Institute? It is an institution for research in tropical Amer¬ ica and its field embraces biology in its broadest sense, including agriculture, horticulture, plant breeding, bacteriology, entomology, plant pathology, etc. It is being sponsored by and organized under the auspices of the National Research Council, a sufficient guarantee of its   earnestness of purpose and efficiency of operation.  By the way, some of you may not clearly recall what the National Research Council is. The Council was organized in 1916 to co-ordinate the research facil¬ ities of this country for work on war problems and in 1918, by executive order of the President of the United States, it was reorganized as a permanent body. Its essential purpose is the promotion of scientific research and of the. application and dissemination of scientific knowl¬ edge for the benefit of the national strength and well-being. It is virtually a Congress of the leading scientists and scientific institutions of the United States —a co-ordinating clearing house for sci¬ entific knowledge. Its administrative work is provided for by a gift of five million dollars made by the Carnegie Corporation and it has secured various gifts for the support of projects which it has sponsored, including a gift, for Re¬ search Fellowships, of five hundred thou¬ sand dollars from the Rockefeller Foun¬ dation.  The membership of the Institute for Research in Tropical America is open to all Universities, Colleges, Museums, Sci¬ entific societies and even governments that are, concerned with investigations in tropical countries. How will it be fi¬ nanced? Partially with the funds of the institutions, both educational and re¬ search, that constitute its membership; partially by the federal support of pro¬ jects which the institute, undertakes and in which the government is interested; and by endowments, for, be it noted, the responsible character of the institute and      its ability will justify the utmost confi¬ dence in it by those inclined to donate funds for scientific investigation. The heaviest financial backers of the institute will undoubtedly be the big American business interests having investments in Latin America. In short, the institution will be, in a sense, a super-university and a super-experiment station and its field of operations will embrace all of tropical and sub-tropical America. Have I been able to sufficiently express the big idea?  The institute will doubtless have field stations, particularly in the countries south of us, but one thing is sure, there will be a parent station bigger than all the rest which will, also, presumably be the first one established. Where is this main station—the virtual headquarters of The Institute for Tropical Research— going to be located? Nobody knows, as yet, and right here is where Florida is mightily interested. In the southern por¬ tion of this State we have conditions suf¬ ficiently tropical to permit of successfully carrying on many, very many, of the lines of investigation projected by the Institute —and there are certain self-evident ad¬ vantages in having this main station un¬ der the flag of the good old U. S. A. I am satisfied that if we go at it vigorously we can convince the officials of the insti¬ tute that their headquarters should be right here in Florida. This much will, I think, be comparatively easy, but we must go further. In order to get this in¬ stitution we must make a definite offer in the form of land for experimental pur¬ poses and perhaps money for the erection and equipment of a building:. Onre these things are provided, the United   States Department of Agriculture will be free, to send its various specialists to this field station to pursue their respective lines of investigation and professors and investigators from various Universities will be quick to take advantage of the. lab¬ oratory facilities provided. It has been suggested that this first or main field sta¬ tion should be even more than a labora¬ tory or experimental station and that it should, in fact, be also a postgraduate school of tropical agriculture and horti¬ culture, perhaps under the auspices of the University of Florida. I need not tell you what a prestige, such an arrangement would give to our own University.  I am well aware that I have said just enough so that I should say more, but this I cannot do, for the institute, while not exactly in a formative stage, is still in its infancy and detailed plans for its operations have not yet been worked out. But the institute is a reality—some six¬ teen or seventeen big Universities have already associated themselves with it— and it is going to be located either in some of the countries south of us, or in Flor¬ ida. The question is, what are we going to do about it ? Are we going to let this opportunity slip by or are we going after this lusty infant and capture it before it gets so big that it will spurn any advances we may make? It is up to the people of Florida and I know of no more appropri¬ ate. agency to handle this matter than the State Horticultural Society, for there is no other organization in the State the aims and purposes of which are so closely akin of those of the Institute for Research in Tropical America. If the idea of getting this institution located in Florida appeals      to you my suggestion would be that a be necessary to induce the officials of the live committee be appointed from this institute to locate their main instituion in Society to investigate and, with the Soci- Florida, ety's approval, take whatever steps may@@   
 Grass Culture as Applied to Golf Course Con¬ struction in Florida@@   Jos. R. Brooks@@ Palm Beach@@   It is difficult to realize the great popu¬ larity of the game of golf. It is now played nearly all over the world. For sev¬ eral centuries it has been a favorite, in Scotland and England and its popularity is fast growing on the Continent. Bel¬ gium possesses several fine courses, the game having received impetus and royal patronage from Leopold II, of whom the following story is told.  His Majesty was one day receiving a newly arrived American Ambassador, and in the course of the conversation happened to ask him what he thought of the country. The representative of the United States confessed that so far, he had not been very favorably im¬ pressed, as it had rained ever since his arrival, and worse still he found himself deprived of his favorite form of amuse¬ ment, as there were no golf links. Leo¬ pold II replied that he regretted his in¬ ability to influence the weather, but that he could and would supply the remedy to the second objection. The king was as good as his word, and gave his beau¬ tiful shooting-box of Ravenstien in the Sognie Forest, for the purpose, where¬ upon it was transformed into the Royal Belgian Golf Club, which now has a sum¬ mer course at Le Cog, a few miles from Ostend.   Nearly every large city in this country now has many golf courses, Chicago alone having more than fifty in the city and its suburbs.  The great importance of golf in this State lies in the fact that it is the most popular pastime of tourists. One of our best known hotel men recently said that if golf did not constitute the backbone of the resort hotel business, it formed at least a large portion of the vertebrae. Some of the oldest resort hotels in this State have within the last few years found it advisable to make, very large in¬ vestments in golf courses in order to re¬ tain their patronage. The total invest¬ ment in golf in Florida already runs well into the millions and is very rapidly in¬ creasing.  Enough has been said to indicate that the construction of good golf courses has been and will continue to be, an impor¬ tant aid to the development of this State. Every member of this Society has there¬ fore, an interest in this game whether he be a player or not.  The cost of production and mainte¬ nance of a fine turf on any course may depend very largely on the selection of the site. It is always essential to have an abundance of good water, and when a site can be. obtained which also contains      a variety of good soils, such as sandy loam, clay and muck, the cost of construc¬ tion and maintenance is much lowered.  The methods pursued in construction have a most important bearing on the quality of the turf produced, the cost of producing it, and on the cost of the. future maintenance of the course. In the con¬ struction of greens, tees, bunkers, mounds, traps, in the cutting or filling of fairways, and in any other work in which the natural lay of the soil is dis¬ turbed, it is most important that the top soil be. replaced on the top, and not bur¬ ied with the soil from below the surface; for most of our Florida soils are light and the top strata only is capable of sup¬ porting a vigorous growth of turf. Scat¬ tering or burying of top soil in construc¬ tion work will result in poor turf, which condition can be remedied only in two ways; either by heavy fertilization, which is expensive, and affords only temporary relief, or by bringing in top soil from elsewhere to supply the deficiency, which is a very expensive process.  The building of a fairway consists briefly in four operations; first clearing and grubbing the land;, second, draining where necessary; third, plowing and har¬ rowing; and fourth, planting the grass.  The first operation needs no further mention except that the grubbing should be so thorough that palmetto, compte and similar growth will not be liable to spring up in the fairways after the grass is planted.  In some places a considerable drain¬ age system may be required. On flat ground, slight depressions may be exca¬ vated with just sufficient grade to carry   the excess water away rapidly. These may have, side slopes sufficiently gentle to cause no inconvenience to the player, after they have been covered with turf. The use of these grassy hollows in con¬ nection with lines of drain tile will solve most drainage problems in a satisfactory manner.  After the drainage has been provided for, the soil should be prepared for grass planting by thoroughly pulverizing it to a depth of about five inches. I have built fairways where this latter work had to be done mostly with a road roller and a scarifier, but it is certainly much pref¬ erable to build them where the. land may be properly prepared with a tractor, a plow, a harrow, a pulverizer and a drag. Too deep plowing should be guarded against, especially where the soil is very light and practically all of the plant food is very near the surface. It is well to emphasize that all soils should be thor¬ oughly cleaned of trash before planting and that heavy soils cannot be too finely pulverized.  Very little of what has been written in books on golf construction relative to turf culture, will apply to conditions in this State. For instance, we are almost invariably directed to use fertilizer or humus or both on newly cleared land be¬ fore planting grass. On the heavier new¬ ly cleared soils Bermuda grass will pro¬ duce a good turf without fertilizer for the first two or three years, after which some fertilization will be required to maintain a healthy growth and a good color. The lighter soils are seldom too light or too poor to produce a good growth of Bermu¬ da for at least the first season after clear-      ing. These, lighter soils do not afford what golfers term “a good stance’’ or foothold, no matter how heavily fertil¬ ized. Moreover, if heavily fertilized, a large proportion of the fertilizer leaches away in these lighter soils, before the grass can get the benefit of it. In order to meet these two difficulties, a layer of stiff, heavy soil, one to two inches in thickness, preferably clay, should be spread over the ground, after a good stand of Bermuda has been obtained. It is essential that this layer of clay or heavy soil, be kept en masse and not mixed with the lighter natural soil of the fairway. It will thus form a sort of mat which will give the player an excellent footing, hold down the lighter soil, and retain any fer¬ tilizer which may in the future be applied. The Bermuda grass will rapidly penetrate this mat and will form a heavy turf.  Bermuda grass forms the turf on at least three quarters of the area of most of our links. Its greatest advantages are ease of propagation and rapid turf-form¬ ing properties. The grass is most suc¬ cessfully planted vegetatively, the com¬ mon process being to scalp off the tops of mature grass slightly below the sur¬ face of the ground; run these through a feed cutter, or chop them up with mat- chetes, and drop the cuttings in furrows, and cover. If a thick turf is desired in a minimum time, the furrows may be so closely spaced that each one will cover the one before it. A fairway so planted in clay soil on the Miami Country Club links was covered with a good playable turf in ninety days. On heavy soil, good results may be obtained more cheaply by broadcasting the chopped grass on the   prepared land and disking it in. A peri¬ od of hot. dry weather following the planting by this latter method, however, is liable to result in a very poor stand of grass.  On the newer portion of the Miami Country Club course, about half the area is marl prairie and the remainder sandy pine land. Practically all of this portion of the links was carefully prepared for planting before any planting was started. By this procedure work was very econom¬ ically accomplished, as a planting gang once organized and started, never ceased operations until the whole area was plant¬ ed. The heavy marl lands were worked on in the dry weather, and wherever fre¬ quent showers made the sandy pine lands sufficiently moist, the planting gang was transferred to them. In this way a fine turf was produced over the whole area with no watering whatever.  On most of our soils, Bermuda grass will require considerable weeding and at least two good applications of fertilizer per year. It can probably be best main¬ tained if completely plowed under every second or third year and a new growth allowed to come back from the root stocks in the soil. This process prevents the grass from becoming rootbound, cul¬ tivates the soil and destroys many of the weeds.  St. Lucie Grass is similar to Bermuda in appearance except that it is a little coarser and of a lighter color. It is much more easily destroyed than Bermuda, will often die if allowed to grow high and burned off; or sometimes, after a rank growth is obtained, it will not spring again from the roots after having been      cut close to the ground. St. Lucie runs more to tops and less to root system than Bermuda. The latter is much preferable for fairways.  St. Augustine Grass is coarser than St. Lucie and still lighter in color. It makes an excellent turf for fairways if kept closely cut. It is a more vigorous and thrifty grower, once started, than either the Bermuda or St. Lucie. Under favor¬ able conditions, it will crowd out all other grasses and weeds. This grass has pro¬ duced an excellent turf on very poor soils, absolutely without fertilizer, where, the ground water level was approximately three feet below the surface.  It is, however, more, difficult to prop¬ agate than Bermuda and is seldom plant¬ ed in the original construction of a course. After a turf of Bermuda grass has been obtained over the entire course, one of the surest ways of cutting mainte¬ nance costs is to plant small individual sods of St. Augustine grass from ten to twenty feet apart in each direction on all portions of the links favorable to its growth. Within two to four years, the St. Augustine will have taken possession of all those areas where the ground wa¬ ter is sufficiently near the surface. Such areas once covered with St. Augustine grass present no further maintenance problems save cutting and the use. of to¬ bacco dust when necessary to kill the cinch bugs which attack it at times.  The putting greens are of prime im¬ portance on a golf course, for though they usually comprise less than five per cent of the total area, approximately fif¬ ty per cent of all the strokes are played on the greens and it is here that the. in¬   terest of each hole should reach its cli¬ max. It is, therefore, advisable that the greens be. made as perfect as possible, cutting expenditures elsewhere if neces¬ sary to accomplish this result.  Clay Greens are sometimes used, sur¬ rounded by a very carefully kept area of grass which might be said to serve as a part of the green, but the grass greens are so much preferred by the great ma¬ jority of golfers that clay greens should be considered only where, as in some lo¬ calities, adverse climatic conditions, or exceedingly heavy play, or both, make grass greens inadvisable.  From the golfing point of view, there are two important objections to the use of Bermuda grass for turf on putting greens. It is a little too coarse and the runners which it continuously puts out, divert the ball, making accurate putting impossible.  The first objection results in what golfers call a “slow green,” which is perhaps comparable to what race track fans call a “heavy track,” and makes it necessary to hit the ball a much harder blow to make a putt of a given length than would be required on a finer turf. The very finest bladed turf which can be obtained is the most desirable.  The second objection may be at least partly overcome by continually cutting off and pulling up the runners, or by constantly mulching up the green to cov¬ er the runners. Both of these processes are of course expensive, and in my expe¬ rience, not altogether satisfactory.  So far as I know, it was at Belleair that the first attempt was made in this State to get away from the use of straight      Bermuda grass greens. The green build¬ ing process as used there some years ago was as follows: The greens were cov¬ ered with a growth of Bermuda grass, and during the summer when the course was not in use, the Bermuda was as care¬ fully maintained as if being played on, as it was desired to keep the Bermuda grass turf as a foundation for the green.  About the first of October the knives of the mowing machines were set low and the grass cut very short. Each green was then fertilized with 500 pounds of tank¬ age and the fertilizer watered well into the soil. The greens were then sowed with about seventy-five pounds of Italian Rye grass seed and top dressed with suf¬ ficient good compost to thoroughly cov¬ er all of the seed. The ground was kept moist during the period of germination, was rolled slightly before the first cutting of the grass, and the grass was cut just as soon as tall enough for the mower to catch it.  This general process with variations, has been since followed on the links of the St. Augustine Country Club and on those of the Ormond Beach course. At present a mixture of Red Top, Red Fescue, and Italian Rye is used instead of Rye only on these two courses.  During seasons of average temperature this practice produces excellent greens at these localities, for it is usually cold enough to retard the. growth of the Ber¬ muda sufficiently so that it scarcely ap¬ pears on the surface of the green at all until late in the season, when it begins to crowd out or smother the other grass¬ es, making the green slower and coarser. The warmer the winter season, the more   quickly the Bermuda takes possession of the green, and the colder it is the more its appearance is retarded.  At the Palm Beach Country Club course, on the other hand, the same pro¬ cess resulted about February first in greens entirely of Bermuda grass with its objectionable features. This, of course, was due, to the fact that the aver¬ age temperature at Palm Beach is several degrees higher than that at Ormond Beach or St. Augustine. It was therefore necessary to retard somewhat further the appearance of the Bermuda grass.  This was attempted by scalping the whole green with a weeding hoe, remov¬ ing the grass tops entirely and leaving only the masses of roots undisturbed in the ground as the foundation for the green. The mulching was then spread on, and the green seeded as before. This treatment did cause a somewhat later ap¬ pearance of the Bermuda grass, but not sufficiently so; as the fertilizer and wa¬ ter which were necessary to force the growth of the seed, together with the mild winter climate at Palm Beach, re¬ sulted in a Bermuda grass green before the. season was half over.  The next step was to do away with the Bermuda grass foundation entirely and depend altogether upon producing a turf of northern grasses, strong enough to stand the wear and tear of a putting green. This had not previously been thought possible as it was impracticable to sow the grass seed until October, the sun being so hot before that time that it would kill the grass soon after germina¬ tion. The results of this latter method were so successful at the Palm Beach      Country Club course that it has been fol¬ lowed there ever since first tried about three years ago. The greens at the Ev¬ erglades Club at Palm Beach and those at the Miami Country Club are produced in the same manner.  In order to keep a golf green in a high state of perfection, constant watching is required and the greens keeper has many difficult problems to solve. For instance, on the Miami Country Club links the greens were at times affected by what has been termed “damp off” or “die back.” Fertilizers and fungicides of many kinds were tried to correct this but with very indifferent success. The ap¬ pearance of this disease was peculiar and interesting. It was liable to be found particularly on a damp, foggy morning, of which variety we. do have one or two occasionally in Miami, boosters to the contrary. Very early in the morning a few small spots of thick white watery looking material would be found on the grass. These would more or less dry up and disappear as the sun mounted high¬ er, but around them the grass in a circle as true as if drawn with a compass, would lie down like dead. I have seen a dozen or more such circles on a single green, varying in size from a few inches to a   couple of feet in diameter. A solution of sulphate of ammonia or nitrate of soda would sometimes partially revive this ap¬ parently dead grass. Finally an expert from one of the best known New York seed houses came down, examined the greens, pronounced them too highly am- moniated, and advised the application of acid phosphate. This was applied as greens were not treated. In a week the directed except that two of the afflicted greens had all recovered, treated and un¬ treated alike, so the, dieback still has us guessing.  An interesting attempt is now being made here by the Miami Golf Club to keep nine of the greens of the Miami Country Club playable during the next few months. Heretofore, as far as I greens of the northern grasses playable know, there has been no attempt to keep during the summer months in Florida. It may be possible to keep them in fair shape for a couple of months if the weather is not too hot, provided night watering only is done and the grass be cut high enough to give the roots good shade.  I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Wm. Fremd for some of the facts used in preparation of this paper.@@   
 The Golf Course at Mountain Lake@@   R. H. Linderman@@ Lake Wales@@   Mr. Floyd has requested me, in pre¬ paring this paper, to try and give such information as would apply to lawns, generally, and I have tried to do so, men¬ tioning our golf course at Mountain Lake only at such times as the methods prac¬ tised there, might be of use to private lawn owners.  The first nine holes of our course were constructed during the season of 1916, with fairly good results. The second nine, making a complete eighteen-hole course, was built in 1920, with splendid results, owing, largely, to good seasonal conditions and our previous experiences. The entire course was laid out by Mr. Seth J. Raynor, a noted golf architect of New York City. All that we had to do, was the construction work. That is enough history I believe, for this paper, but a great deal more could be said if a true biography of the course were de¬ manded.  In preparing land for grass, the meth¬ ods used, and the thoroughness of prep¬ aration differs in no way to the preparing of ground for potatoes, a citrus grove, or any other commercial planting. I be¬ lieve that I am correct in saying, that the great trouble with the average person in planting a lawn, or large acreage, to grass, is that he does not take into con¬ sideration the very important fact that his   crop will need caring for, in the way of fertilizer, .water, etc., exactly the same as his commercial crop. One fertilizes or¬ ange trees, gardens, etc., at certain peri¬ ods during their development, so why not do the same with a lawn and get the most from one’s work in like proportion that you endeavor to get from the commercial crop.  I believe that it might be interesting to know of the methods used at Mountain Lake, if only for their criticism, so, with your permission, I will outline each step, hurriedly, starting with the preparation of the ground. This same routine can, and is, used to advantage by the man who only plants a small area.  After thoroughly clearing, our ground is plowed with a tractor and three-disc plow, as deeply as six or seven inches, which will get most of that under-ground growth, called gopher-root. The roots that are thus exposed, are then picked up by hand, burned, and the soil thoroughly pulverized with the disc and the Acme harrow. Whether the land will need the second plowing depends on the condition after this final harrowing. One plowing is usually sufficient in our local sandy soil.  The next step is, to get the Bermuda, St. Augustine or other grass roots, that we have decided to use for our lawn. We      have found that the most economical way of digging these roots, is to have a one or two horse plow precede a crew of men armed with ordinary potato hooks, with which to turn the furrows and shake the loose soil from the plants, so that, with an additional shaking with a fork whdh loading on the wagon or truck, the grass roots are practically free from soil. The plants are then brought where they are to be planted and thoroughly watered, or, if water is available where the grass is dug, it is always advisable to wet them at once, although this adds considerably to the weight, in carting.  Whether the fertilizer to be used is commercial or barn-yard, can only be de¬ termined by each one, after considering the cost of each, availability and the needs of the soil. The soil which shows a good native cover crop, requires less of the or¬ ganic matter than one that is barren and lifeless. If we should decide on the sta¬ ble manure, and there is nothing better, it is a very good time to apply this, imme¬ diately preceding the planting of the grass roots, so that it can be plowed in with them.  There are several methods of planting that can be followed, greatly depending on the acreage to be covered. For the small area, a forked orange tree stake, a lath, both sharpened at one end, or a small hand plow, can be used, but for the large area, the old reliable mule and plow will give the best results.  The thickness in planting the grass roots, can only be determined by the re¬ sults desired. One can skip a furrow or plant in every furrow, depending on how long he wants to wait for his lawn, or   how soon he wants to get through with his work. We plant in every furrow, tearing the roots apart so that they will cover as much ground as possible, laying them, practically, continuously in the fur¬ row. The grass needs only to be covered, thoroughly, and I do not believe that there is any specific depth that could be recommended, although we try to cover the roots at least, two or three inches, running the plow only deep enough to hold the furrow.  After the grass is planted, the fertil¬ izer, if commercial, is applied, the ground smoothed and rolled, this smoothing and rolling serving to mix the fertilizer with the soil. This last year, we applied a for¬ mula analyzing 4-7-1, derived from ni¬ trate of soda and sulphate of ammonia, cotton seed meal, goat manure, Peruvian guano, super-phosphate and ground to¬ bacco stems, at the rate of 1,200 pounds per acre, making a second application in sixty days of a smaller quantity per acre. On grass that was planted on August 15, we had a perfect stand by the first of De¬ cember. There are, of course, different formulas, and one need only ask any rep¬ utable fertilizer concern, or their repre¬ sentative, for advice, to determine what to use..  In watering lawns, it is always advis¬ able, as far as possible, to do this either in the early morning or late in the even¬ ing, when the heat of the sun is not nearly as liable to burn the. wet tender grasses, as would be the case if the watering were done during the heat of the day. Then, too, the evaporation is less at these, stated periods, than at mid-day.   5      If one wants the effect of a deep rich lawn, in winter, similar to some of the best lawns in the north in summer, Ital¬ ian Rye. seed, broadcasted on the Bermu¬ da turf and covered lightly with a top¬ dressing of soil, will, in about two or three weeks, if kept moist, give you the results desired.  It has been stated in bulletins, and pa¬ pers, previously, that a periodical reno¬ vating of Bermuda sod, is very beneficial, and in our experience, this statement has been proven. We try, about every two or three years, to plow or disc our Bermuda sod, judging by the condition of the grass to determine when this is necessary. This renovating is particularly necessary in our high pine land, where the grass is noticed, at the end of the period men¬ tioned, to lose strength of growth. By turning this sod , a new and vigorous growth is invariably the result. A light application of fertilizer is very benefi¬ cial at this time.  In preparing our putting greens for the winter season, we mow them as closely as possible, to the ground, letting the cut¬   tings drop. This is usually done by the first of November. We then fertilize them thoroughly and get them reasonably moist, following immediately with Italian Rye Seed and Red Top, the latter giving a ^nuch finer texture to the green than the Rye, alone.  Our hard work is then over, and all one has to do, is to mow, water and feed them regularly, and get them” in such shape that no matter how badly a golf ball is putted, it will, ultimately, fall in the. cup, which, believe me, is no small undertaking, golf players, as a rule crit¬ icizing everything about a green before recognizing their own errors.  It would seem to me, that the secret, if it is such, of getting a good lawn in Florida, is the same as in the north. One would not think of planting a lawn, there, without first applying, liberally, an appli¬ cation of stable manure if nothing else; and here, in God’s country, we surely need to give the same care and attention to one of the. finest and most beautiful landscape features, possible—a well kept lawn.@@   
 Moisture Retaining Properties of Different Soils and Its Relation to the Growth of Grasses@@   John R. Van Kleek@@ Kenilworth Inn, Sebring@@   I deem it quite an honor to be asked to deliver a paper before the State Horti¬ cultural Society of Florida on this sub¬ ject of the growth of grasses. However, I feel as I felt some six or seven years ago when I was employed at the State University of Illinois. I was an in¬ structor with the Landscape Extension Department out there and was sent into various towns in the State to lecture on the beautification of schools, lawns, etc., where it was the custom in the rural dis¬ tricts to call any man who came from the University, “Professor.” I was sent into a small town in the southern part of Illi¬ nois and got off the train loaded down with about 300 lantern slides, a traveling lantern and a suitcase. I found several people waiting at the station, including a reporter, and a fellow came up and said, “Have you seen Professor Van Kleek?” I said, “No, but my name is Van Kleek and if I can fill the bill I will be glad to do so.” I feel tonight, with my short ex¬ perience in Florida, the same way. I know that most of you, in fact all of you, have had more experience with Florida conditions than I have and no doubt you will want to hear the experiences of a professor and I can only give you the ex¬ periences of an instructor.   A little more than a year ago I began the construction of an eighteen-hole golf course at Sebring, Florida. You can im¬ agine my consternation after leaving northern conditions of rock, clay and loam to be cast down upon the sands of Florida. I will tell you frankly that it had me scared and some of it still has me scared, but it has been one of the most in¬ teresting problems of my life to try to cultivate grasses on these sandy soils. Perhaps some of you do not know the section around Sebring. Sebring is in the central part of the State and is quite roll¬ ing. The majority of the soil is of a yel¬ low texture which has been or which is now used for the most successful growing of citrus fruits. On the particular piece of land which I had to work (about 400 acres), we had five separate and distinct types of soil. The problem then was the growth of grass on these five soils.  Contrary to the common belief the con¬ struction of a golf course is purely a hor¬ ticultural problem. There are some en¬ gineering features, such as the design and construction of locations for greens and the proper outlining of the fairways and traps , etc. Those are purely technical features and can be constructed from plans, and have really little to do with the 37       >   construction of a golf course. The real problem is the growing and the cultiva¬ tion of young grasses for the playing sur¬ faces of the golf course. There are two playing surfaces on the golf course, fair¬ ways and greens, that constitute two dif¬ ferent and distinct problems; but never¬ theless, the main problem is the growth and the cultivation of the grasses.  In the cultivation of the grasses the one thing that has come under my obser¬ vation and the one thing that I think spells success or failure is the moisture re¬ taining properties of the soil in the course. As I have said, we had five dis¬ tinct types of soil at Sebring. One was the yellow sand common in the high pine land. Another was what a lot of us know as Rosemary scrub, and those of you who don’t know Rosemary scrub I don’t want to introduce you to it; it has no food value that I have been able to discover. The third soil that I had to deal with is from the bottom lands and it was a muck. The fourth type was a sand soaked type that, again, I don’t want to introduce to anybody; and the fifth type was the salt and pepper sand which resembles the yel¬ low sand in composition.  Well, for the first few weeks and months, I asked questions of everybody that I could talk to in Florida, and dis¬ covered that Bermuda grass was the type of grass best suited to cultivate for the fairways and greens. Hence, I started to plant everything in Bermuda grass. Ih the yellow sandy soil not previously un¬ der cultivation, and which had not been disturbed in the clearing, the Bermuda grass roots planted four to six inches apart with an ordinary amount of rolling,   fertilizer and natural rains, developed a very good and substantial stand of grass. On the other hand, in the same type of soil but formerly under cultivation in orange groves, the grass planted in the same way, with the same amount of fer¬ tilizer and water gave very little growth. That was due, I believe, to the stirring of the soil to a depth of six or eight inches giving a very loose condition which held no moisture. Also the water applied by hose would quickly disappear and hence the grass would not grow. The soil here was made to grow grass only under in¬ tense applications of water and with much rolling. It is my belief that the applica¬ tion of water and rolling brought the soil back to a firm condition and when that was attained we got the same results as in the soil that was undisturbed.  The second type was Rosemary scrub or white sand. For a long time I could not grow a sprig of grass although I used every kind of fertilizer anybody could sell me; used all kinds of manures. I made only a slight application of water. Final¬ ly I commenced pouring the water on during the latter part of the afternoon and evening and then I began to get a growth of grass. Now, here again was a case where without an intensive and ex¬ tremely steady application of water we could get but little grass. The natural condition of this type is very loose and that in a way accounts for lack of plant food in the soil. At a later date I covered the entire fairway with a stiff muck. Even though the expense of the operation prevented a complete job, still this muck added to the loose sand helped to retain the moisture in the soil and produce a      good stand of grass. That soil today still needs lots of water and will never pro¬ duce a good fairway until the Bermuda grass has so permeated the soil that the water will be held there in sufficient quantities to supply the natural needs of the grass.  Now, when we came to the bottom lands we had a good type of soil. It was a black sandy muck high in plant food. I planted the grass before the rainy season and to my utter consternation after the rain was over I had no grass. The water had completely killed out the Bermuda grass roots. I constructed ditches and lowered the water table and replanted, and still the capillary action was so great in this soil that it drew the water to the surface and killed the roots again. After¬ wards I began making another tour of the State and found that the old residents whom I met had discovered the facts long ago and they depended on the native grasses. Hence, I am now depending on the native grasses under these conditions. Here too much moisture in the soil spelled failure for the type of grass needed.  In the fourth type of soil or sand soak, as many call it, there was no food left in it. At least I could discover none. On stirring this sand base the grass would grow up for a time but soon the soil would pack and the grass would die out. The only solution I found for that prob¬ lem was over-laying with a loose sand. Here again too much water retained in the soil had spelled defeat for Bermuda grass. In the fifth type—a black and white or salt and pepper type—the same treatment as with yellow sand produced a very good growth of grass.   The foregoing discussion dealt with the fairways alone. When it comes to the greens the conditions are changed. Most of the greens are elevated and the grass desired must be of the finest possi¬ ble texture. The soil is practically all brought to the greens and we can control absolutely the type of soils for them. We cannot, however, control the water table and have to water constantly. In my first construction of greens I followed the northern procedure putting on clay and muck and then top dressed with Moore Haven muck or a light woody muck that some of you know. I used some of the Moore Haven muck with some of the yellow sand and fertilized with about 150 pounds blood and bone to each green. The grass grew in great quantities and in magnificent quality but before long I discovered that my soil was too light. It took immense quantities of water to keep the grass in good condition.  I then changed my method of proced* ure, cutting out the clay because I dis¬ covered that it was too sandy for the needed use, and picked out a type of stiff muck that contained a sufficient quantity of vegetable matter in a sweet condition. I used about four to six inches of this muck on my greens with no clay and after that I had no trouble. It takes a very small amount of water during the golf season and during the season when we don’t have so much playing it takes water two or three times a week to keep the course in perfect condition. In some cases commercial fertilizer alone was used in dressing the top. I had a peculiar case in front of the hotel. Between the hotel and the road, a space probably 60 by 200      feet, I gave a slight application of stiff muck, probably two inches in depth. Across the road in an area about 50x400 I did not put on the muck but I gave it the same application of commercial fer¬ tilizer as I did at the hotel. Now the Ber¬ muda grass where I had applied the muck stayed green all winter, whereas the place across the road turned brown very quick¬ ly. (Some of you who know the situa¬ tion no doubt discovered Italian Rye growing directly in front of the hotel in the area where muck had been applied. In my observation the presence of the rye grass was disregarded and the Ber¬ muda grass alone was watched. The muck no doubt held the moisture in the soil, prevented leaching and produced a wonderful stand of grass.)  Now all this has to do with golf courses but the same principles apply to every lawn in the State. One of the big problems that I see in the State of Flor¬ ida is that of lawns and the main problem with lawns is that of maintenance. If I should be asked to give my opinion of the landscape features of the State of Flor¬ ida, not from the standpoint of the value of plants, but from the view point of a landscape architect, I would say that the maintenance item is the thing that has been absolutely forgotten. The man in his little home who has a lawn of 20x30 feet perhaps set out in St. Augustine, St.   Lucie or Bermuda grass, as the case might be, sprinkles on a little fertilizer once a year and then proceeds to forget it. Now I think the State Horticultural Society, from the viewpoint of a landscape gar¬ dener or architect, can do more for the State in its beautification by advocating good lawns than in any other way. The soil is the main problem. If one can get good stiff muck that retains moisture, 90 per cent of your problem is solved; then with a little common sense and personal supervision of the water supply and fer¬ tilizer we can have as fine lawns as exist anywhere in the United States. The put¬ ting greens at Mountain Lake, under the supervision of Mr. Linderman, who fol¬ lows me, are the best I have ever seen in the South and I believe but few of the Northern courses have the equal. You would not believe this to be a fact, but Bermuda grass with plain muck, with proper top dressing, produces finer lawn grass than any grass produced in the North. This cultivation of grasses, of course, is a great thing. We all know that England has the best lawns in the world. There is only one thing that gives them this success—moisture in the air. We have a fair amount of moisture in the air and I believe the lawns of Florida can be made as fine as anything in this coun¬ try by the proper preparation of the soil and application of water and fertilizer.@@   
 Little Known Plant Materials and Their Uses in  Securing Tropical Effects@@   N. A. Reasoner@@ Oneco@@   Such a subject as “Little Known Plant Materials and Their Uses in Securing Tropical Effects” naturally needs some clarification. To my mind it falls natu¬ rally into three divisions.  First. General remarks on Florida Climatology—for without this we. would be at a loss for a definition of the “Trop¬ ical” part of the title.  Second. Just what is meant by “Lit¬ tle Known Plant Materials”? To define this unknown I must first give the known, and I have therefore prepared a table of the commoner materials, with appropriate information thereon, which I will submit with this article but not bur¬ den you with just now. Following this I have prepared some information on the. more neglected materials which seem to me to offer promise but have not as yet come into general favor.  And Thirdly, just what is meant by “Tropical Effects”? As we are consid¬ ering this from the standpoint of the lay¬ man rather than the artist it will be suf¬ ficient to mention only the more impor¬ tant motifs such as the Palm Motif, the Color Motif, the value of fragrance, etc.  Having therefore defined and confined my subject let us pass to the true meat of the discussion. First, Florida Climatol¬ ogy-   Perhaps you have already heard the joke, about the East Coast and West Coast Floridians who were arguing the respective merits of their own particular sides of the peninsula—but it happens to illustrate my point so I will tell it again.  The subject under discussion was mos¬ quitoes.  “Why, they’re so thick down in Dade County,” the East-Coaster said, “that you can swing a pint cup around your head and catch a quart of them.”  “That’s nothing,” replied the West- Coaster, “over where I come from they’re so thick, and grow so big, you can’t find room to swing the cup.”  And just so it is with our climate. No section of the State wants to be out-done by any other in this respect.  “Why yes, just over the line in the other county they had a terrible freeze last winter; but it didn’t hurt anything here. No, siree, this is the warmest spot in the State of Florida! Oh, yes, you’ll see some dead ends on some of the trees where they were nipped a little, but it didn’t hurt them any. No, sir, our cli¬ mate just can’t be beat!”  Just such tales as this can be heard in any locality over the State; and the mat¬ ter of accurate determination of damage resolves itself into a matter of one’s own   42        QADSOU     iWAKUUA   TAYLOR                        personal knowledge. It was this reason alone, combined with a desire to observe the damage to supposedly hardy species that led my father to tour the whole southern end of the State immediately following the freeze of ’17.  From our thirty-eight years of expe¬ rience with Florida conditions we have evolved the philosophy that there is no section of the State, at least on the main land, that is absolutely free, from occa¬ sional frost. Of course there are some sections more free than others; some where, even when it does turn cold, it is only of short duration and seems to lack that stinging power it possesses far¬ ther north. So after all we are only rel¬ atively tropical, not absolutely.  How important this consideration must be. to the landscape architect, can be read¬ ily illustrated. Suppose in his effort to secure a definite effect he has recourse to very tropical plants to sound the key note of his garden—either as to color or fo¬ liage. Supposing, then, one of our oc¬ casional freezes is so inconsiderate as to interfere and kill these tropical plants down to the ground. After all, he’s worse, off than he was in the beginning; for he has lost not only his plants but a year or more of valuable time. In con¬ sidering plant materials it is well to re¬ member then the only relative immunity from frost of most sections of the State., and make the backbone of the develop¬ ment at least relatively hardy. Nature has aided considerably in this regard by providing a large class of shrubs which while, they may be killed to the ground by a hard frost, will yet sprout again from the roots, and thus may for prac¬ tical purposes be said to be hardy. Hi¬   biscus, oleanders, acalyphas, lantana, poinsettias, stenolobium, and phyllanthus will be recognized among this class.  Having given the matter considerable study, and finding it an asset as a ready reference, we prepared a rough map of the State a number of years ago showing the relative temperatures to be expected in various sections of the State and their comparative immunity from frost. Hav¬ ing found it helpful ourselves we are glad to pass it on, and a copy is being sub¬ mitted with this report but it does not merit further attention here.  Having then finished our general re¬ marks on Florida Climatology, the next consideration would be the relatively well known and comparatively little known plant materials.  In order to consider the little known materials it was first necessary to sepa¬ rate the well known, and to this end I have prepared a table covering seventy- five of the better known subjects with notes as to their common names, native habitat, color of flowers, blooming pe¬ riod, height, hardiness, and soil prefer¬ ence, and other remarks. This is sub¬ mitted with this report but needs now no further attention. Conifers have not been included in this list, except for Cas- uarina, not because we are unaware of their many fine qualities, but because of the feeling that in a comparative tropical State like this with our wealth of broad- leaved evergreens it would be better to use distinctive subjects which can not be grown in other states. We realize the val¬ ue, of course, of the conifer in the proper position, especially trees. It is the use of conifers in foundation plantings to which we wish to particularly take exception.      FLORIDA CLIMATOLOGY IN RELATION TO  PLANTING  Area i. This includes all western and peninsular Florida as far south, roughly speaking, as Hernando, Marion and northern Volusia counties as shown in ac¬ companying map. The few southern counties of this area—those just men¬ tioned—practically mark the northern limit of the citrus industry. There are scattered groves north and west, of the hardier types on hardier stocks, but they do not figure conspicuously in the indus¬ try. This region is especially adapted to the deciduous fruits that are suited to Florida planting as the. Persimmon, Fig, Pecan, Peach, Plum, Pear, etc. It is true that most of the varieties commonly grown in Florida do splendidly even in south Florida, but generally speaking they reach their perfection in the north¬ ern sections of the State. You will note on going over the remarks on hardiness at the head of each department, to which we call your especial attention, that the * is used to indicate this relative hardi¬ ness.  Area 2.—This is really more than “central Florida,” as it covers all of the southern half of the State with the ex¬ ception of a narrow strip of better pro¬ tected territory on both coasts from Pi¬ nellas County around to Brevard, which widens out at the southern extreme to in¬ clude Dade and Monroe counties, and a large portion of Lee and Palm Beach counties, all of which constitute Area 3. We leave the larger portion of the Ever¬ glade country in the second area as com¬ paratively little is known as to just what   its climatic conditions may be and at some points there it has been colder on occa¬ sion than at many points farther north. Area 2 includes the bulk of the citrus ter¬ ritory as now understood, and also the most celebrated trucking centers of the State. Because of its unusual location, most of the plants we list can be grown successfully with the exception of some of the more tender tropical sorts, though even of these many shrubs may be grown, for even if the tops are killed down, they come right up and flower and fruit again.  Area 3.—Includes the more strictly sub-tropical area in which all plants are as near hardy as at any point in the United States. At the points farthest north, along bays and rivers where water modifies the temperature in cold weather very perceptibly, this area of compara¬ tively safe planting of tropical material extends back from the water one or two miles, the strip widening as it extends southward.  On the information contained in this table, and on considerably less in some in¬ stances, most of the landscape work of the State has been done. It was in the effort to broaden this information, that this article was conceived, and the fol¬ lowing paragraphs given.  Taking up the subjects in the same or¬ der as given in the table, first of all come the Palms. As will be shown in a later paragraph, the palm is one of the primary motifs in the tropical landscape, and cer¬ tainly the one on which our northern friends lay the most emphasis. It be¬ hooves us therefore to pay particular at-       tention to the palms and to use them as often and to the best advantage possible.  First of all there is the Acrocomia to- tai, one of the. handsomest of all palms, attaining a height of thirty to forty feet, and crowned with a magnificent head of graceful pinnate leaves. Its only draw¬ back—and it is seldom indeed that we meet perfection in plants as we do in per¬ sons—is the fact that it is protected throughout, both trunk and leaves, with exceedingly sharp, long thorns, making it unsuitable for parkways and similar pub¬ lic uses. For the private estate, especially for creating backgrounds, it is, however, without a peer. But best of all it is com¬ paratively hardy, being about as resistant as the Cocos plumosa and doing well up into the center of the. State.  Another interesting item is with re¬ gard to Archontophoenix alexandrae, which I am told does well here in Miami. From our experience in growing dec¬ orative palms, it would seem that for large tub specimens it is much superior to the commoner seaforthia, although it is a trifle less hardy. It is a wonderful palm in the open ground too and deserves more attention than has been given it.  Arenga saccharifera, the Java Sugar Palm; Dictyosperma rubra; Elaeis gui- nensis, the African Oil Palm; and Hyo- phorbe verschaffeltii, a stubby-leaved or¬ ange-colored palm from Mauritius, are all magnificent tall-growing palms which should be. planted extensively in the low¬ er end of the State.  To come back to hardier materials it would be well to call attention to the Giant Sabals, blackburniana and haven- ensis, hardy practically throughout the   whole State. Then, too, there is the Phoenix sylvestris, resembling the well known Ph. Canariensis, but lacking the extreme drooping habit of its leaves. It is of interest, too, for its picturesque trunk, slender with the boots remaining on the entire length. It is also interest¬ ing to note that it is a much faster grow¬ er on poor soils.  In the hardy dwarf palms it would be well to remember the Hardy Cocos of the Australis type, comprising several closely connected species, and the Livistona Chi- nensis or australis, formerly known as Latania. These are wonderfully decora¬ tive subjects and hardy throughout the State. The Trachycarpus excelsa, some¬ times still called Chamaerops, has almost disappeared, and is now seldom encoun¬ tered in nursery stock as it is such an ex¬ tremely slow grower. An excellent sub¬ stitute, and even preferred by some, is found in the native porcupine palmetto, Raphidophyllum hystrix, unfortunately quite rare too.  Passing from the Palms to the shade, trees we are struck at once by the lack of variety in comparatively hardy ever¬ green subjects. In this southern section of the State you have a wealth of suit¬ able materials, and it is peculiar indeed to note how badly this has been neglected in a section so richly endowed by nature and which has advanced so rapidly in other ways. Having as you do so many truly wonderful trees that can be grown no where else, in the United States, it will be to your eternal discredit if you do not realize on some of these opportunities. And whatever you do, in all conscience give the Australian Pines a rest! Truly      it is a wonderful subject in its place, but the good Lord never meant it for every use. under the canopy, which is about what you seem to expect of it. For sea¬ shore use where salt and poor soil must be combated it is without a peer—but that is about enough to expect of it!  What a pity three or four miles of the Dixie Highway from Palm Beach south could not have been planted with Bau- hinias, world-famed for their orchid-like beauty, instead of the somber Australian Pines. Another section planted with Jac- arandas; still another with the justly fa¬ mous Silk-Cotton from Jamaica; another with the blood red Sterculia; or Steno- carpus sinuatus, the wheel of fire; or a number of other truly wonderful subjects. Had this been done you would have had a leafy tunnel, constantly changing, both from mile to mile and from day to day. Indeed it could have been so arranged that not a day would have, passed without finding some section in full bloom, mak¬ ing it a true “Pathway of Flowers.”  In the central and northern sections of the State much work must yet be done in searching for really distinctive subjects at the same time practically hardy. It is well to note the increasing use of the Silk Oak, Grevillea robusta, in the central por¬ tion of the. State, especially the high, dry sand hills of Polk County, which is just the type of soil they appreciate. It is good to know, too, that these trees can now be obtained in large sizes, suitable for street planting, and doing away with a large, portion of the delay in securing immediate effects. The Jacaranda is also coming into its own. About as hardy as the Cocos plumosa, it is being extensive¬   ly used in the. central section of the State, and it will not be long until its wonderful sky-blue mass of flowers will be a com¬ mon sight throughout the State during April and early May. It prefers a rather damper soil than the Grevillea but it must be well drained. The Melaleuca leucaden- dron should be mentioned also. It is com¬ monly called Cajuput or punk tree, but really it isn’t a “punk” tree but a very fine one, especially on low, wet situations not too cold. It is also salt resistant. We are doing quite a bit of experimental work in the effort to extend this list of har¬ dier shade trees and hope to be able to report additions, but we’ll have to wait until we have a real freeze before we can report definitely.  In passing from the shade trees I should like to mention the Callitris verru¬ cosa, or cypress pine of Australia, a truly wonderful conifer and hardy through¬ out the State, and growing well even in the. poorest white sand ridges. Ordina¬ rily it makes a broadly columnar tree up to sixty feet in height and branched all the. way up from the ground. By a lit¬ tle trimming, however, it can be forced up as slender as an Italian cypress or it can be kept down into a low spreading, round headed tree, this adaptability mak¬ ing it very useful in landscape artistry.  Having spent so much time on the palms and shade trees, we will have time only for a hasty survey of the shrubs and vines before passing on to the consider¬ ation of the methods of obtaining tropical effects.  In the tropical shrubs we have again a wealth of materials, comparatively little known, and surely worthy of planting   TABLE OF COMMON PLANT MATERIALS   SCIENTIFIC NAMES   PALMS   Cocos Plumosa_  Cocos nucifera -  Oredoxa regia-  Phoenix canariensis _  Phoenix reclinata _  Sabal Palmetto _  Washingtonia robusta _  TREES  Cinnamonum camphora _  Delonix regia _  Eucalyptus robusta _  Eucalyptus rostrata _  Grevillea robusta_  Magnolia grandiflora_  Quercus laurifolia _  Casuarina equisitafolia _  BAMBOOS AND GRASSES  Bambusa argentea _  Bambusa disticha _  Bambusa vulgaris _  Cortaderia selloana _  TROPICAL SHRUBS  Acalypha mosaica _  Caesalpinia pulcherrima _  Duranta repens _  Euphorbia pulcherrima_  Hibiscus rosa-sinensis _  Hibiscus rosa-sinensis _  Hibiscus rosa-sinensis _  Hibiscus rosa-sinensis _  Hibiscus rosa-sinensis _  Hibiscus rosa-sinensis _  Lantana _  Phyllanthus nlv. r. p. _  Plumbago capensis _  Phyllaurea _  Tabernaemontana coronaria_  Thunbergia erecta-  Thunbergia erecta alba_  Vinca -  HARDY SHRUBS  Abelia grandiflora _  Azalea lndica _  Camellia japonica _  Eleagnus reflexa-  Hydrangea hortensis _  Lagerstroemia indica_  Laurocerasus caroliniana_  Ligustrum amurense -  Ligustrum nepalense var.-  Ligustrum lucidum -  Michelia fuseata -  Myrica cerifera _  Nerium oleander -  Pittosporum toblra _  Rhapiolepsis indica -  Viburnum tinus -  Viburnum odoratissimum-  Warneria augusta -   VINES  Allamando Hendersonil  Antigonon leptopus -  Bougainvillea gl. sand. —  Ficus pumila-  Gelsemium sempervlrens  Jasminum pubescens-  Lonicera sempervirens —  Nintooa japonica -  Pyrostegia venusta -  Tecoma radicans -  Traehelospermum jasmin   MISCELLANEOUS Nephrolepis cordata compacts.

To mention only a few in passing, we have, of course, the Acalyphas in va¬ riety; the fragrant Artobotrys and Ces- trums, not to forget the wonderful rose- pink Cestrum elegans and the orange Oes¬ trum aurantiacum, which are not fra¬ grant ; the Assonias with their large com¬ posite heads of soft pink flowers, a single head making a nice corsage;then the Dae- dalacanthus, with its intense blue flowers coming at the height of the tourist sea¬ son; the Ixoras in both red and yellow; the charming Turk’s cap, or Malvaviscus; the intense yellow Stenolobium or yellow elder, a true gamboge shade; and so on down the list. A truly wonderful va¬ riety, also sadly neglected for the better known Allamandas, Hibiscus, and olean¬ ders.  In the hardy shrubbery, the havoc caused by the. Federal Quarantine 37 will of course be noted, cutting off as it did the importation of azaleas and camellias from abroad and forcing the American nurseryman back on his resources. That he accepted this challenge, and won out with his usual ingenuity and enterprise, goes, of course, without saying, and it is interesting to note that there are two firms at least, possibly more, in Florida, that will shortly offer their own stock of these materials. Pittosporum, Laurel Cherry, Oleanders, Privets, etc., have of course been affected by this shortage in other lines but are now getting back to normal again. Just at present the only well known hardy materials which are hard to obtain are the sweet olive, Os- manthus fragrans, and the anise shrub, Illicium anisatum, and it is to be hoped   that some way of augmenting the visi¬ ble supply of these two excellent subjects will be found.  As to notes on new subjects we would call attention to Eugenia hookeriana, Li- gustrum massalongeanum, and Viburnum suspensum (also known as sandankwa), all truly magnificent subjects which we have obtained from California, and while they have not been tested as yet by a real freeze we believe they will be found hardy throughout most of the State. We have also discovered a Raphiolepis ja- ponica, which is the equal or superior of the well known indica, and which grows five times as fast. There is considerable confusion, however, in the nomenclature, the ordinary indica being listed as ja- ponica by some nurserymen, the obtain¬ ing of a stock of true japonica is, there¬ fore, beset with difficulties. The Ilex paraguayensis, or the “yerba mate” of the Argentine, also shows promise and is being propagated for use as a hedge or the taller shrubbery. It will of course be entirely hardy. The native Myrtle, Myrica cerifera, and salt bush, Bacharis halimifolia, are being field grown too, as for some situations they simply “can’t be beat.”  In the vines it will be enough to pause a moment to bewail the comparative lack of interest in the wonderful newer species of Bougainvilleas. We do not, of course, under-rate the. common! glabra sandriana, as we are well acquainted with it from years of experience; but to mention it in the same breath with some of the newer species seems almost like sacrilege. By a great deal of work and experimenta¬ tion we have worked up five of the new      species to a commercial scale, the colors ranging from a deep purple, through light purple, red, and pink, to the most intense and glowing crimson. There are two more forms on which we are work¬ ing but have not as yet sufficiently tested out. It is interesting to note here the entirely different colors of the flowers in plants grown under glass—it would seem there is some slight variation also in in¬ dividual specimens out-of doors. In gen¬ eral, however, the assortment of vines is more complete than any other class of materials. We must not forget, however, to mention the Brazilian Glory, with its scientific name of thirty-three, letters, in spite of which it is a wonderful subject covered twice a year with a multitude of carmine-crimson flowers. Unfortunate¬ ly it is comparatively tender, but if frozen down it will come up again from the roots.  Passing then from the notes on new plant materials, we come to the last and shortest division of my subject, the cre- acion of tropical effects.  Tropical atmosphere is a difficult thing to define, for after all it is not based on things as they are in the tropics, but on what some people think about the tropics. In other words, a dense forest of trees with their branches so thickly interlaced as to make broad noonday only twilight beneath, would never be tropical atmos¬ phere; even though it happened to be. in the Amazon valley, broiling on the equa¬ tor, and the trees were Bread-fruit or other tropical trees! What is called trop¬ ical atmosphere, at least to the northern mind, is best described in the works of   Jack London, Robert W. Chambers, or some other of our popular novelists.  “What then is tropical atmosphere,” you will ask in despair? “You say it is not necessarily the natural growth of the tropics, and you illustrate it with pictures that never existed except in the mind of the author—in other words were only dreams!”  That’s it exactly — “Only dreams!” Only such pictures as you dream of * * * the myriad leaves of waving palms * * * the great raw masses of color, not re¬ fined, not cultured, but primitive as man’s inmost emotions * * * the teasing scent of strange perfumes borne on the tranquil breezes ,of the night * * * the glistening crescent beaches, bathed by a slowly surging sea, bluer than turquoise, more baffling than the sphinx * * * quiet * * * rest * * * ineffable ease * * * the far- off strains of distant music. * * *” This indeed is the tropic atmosphere., not real, perhaps, but then who cares for reality? The fantastic tissue of dreams, in that lies our tropic charm!  If, then, we. are to create the tropic atmosphere we must emphasize the infi¬ nite variety of our dream subjects; must fill in our background with waving palms; must paint largely and with strong colors; provide if possible, a water view or the sound of a gurgling stream; must provide new and strange perfumes; and above all we must provide ease and ac¬ cessibility, so that our tropical grounds shall indeed be dream places, filled with fairies, and far-removed from the rush and harshness of a busy world.  “How to create this atmosphere?”      More than I have given, I cannot tell you! Can the artist give directions for painting again his masterpiece, or can the glowing cardinal tell why he loves his mate? No more can I tell you. It is only something which we, love and to which some of us have dedicated our lives. If we have some   small measure of success, it is not to us to whom credit should be given, but to Him who created these materials, the liv¬ ing pigments with which we work, and gave us the power and imagination, and even opportunity, to work with them.@@   
 Ornamentals Growing on the Lower East Coast  of Florida@@   J. B. Donnelly@@ Palm Beach@@   The subject of my paper is Ornamen¬ tals growing on the lower East Coast of Florida. As I live at Palm Beach a de¬ scription of the plants growing here will probably do for the territory between Fort Pierce, and Cape Sable.  To mention all the ornamentals grow¬ ing in that stretch of coast would make my paper rather lengthy so I will confine myself to such plants, vines, and trees as are growing in my immediate vicinity, and which can be. grown, and probably are growing in several places along the coast.  Catesbia Spinosa, a very handsome ev¬ ergreen shrub, with small, dark green shiny leaves, flowers pale yellow, droop¬ ing, lily shaped, branches full of small spines. The plant is very ornamental when in bloom and I think equally so, when covered with the seed berries which are pale yellow and resemble the fruit of the Kumquat. Grown from seed or cuttings. Common name, Thorn Lily.  Thimbergia erecta is a very satisfac¬ tory shrub, almost continuous bloomer, flowers tubular, dark blue with a rich or¬ ange and yellow throat, does best with me in partial shade;; easily propagated from cuttings. There is a white flower¬ ing variety of this, T. erecta alba.   Eranthemum pule helium, this is a soft wooded plant, particularly useful because it is a winter bloomer, from November to May. The flowers are a rich bright blue, very freely produced, easy of propagating from cuttings of young wood.  Plumbago Capensis, a splendid shrub, suitable for planting singly, making hedges, or for training on a trellis. The flowers which are borne in great profu¬ sion are of a pale blue color, propagated by off shoots from the base of the plant. There is a white flowering variety, but I find it a weak grower.  Murray a exotica, is a fine clean shrub suitable for hedges as it stands close shearing, it has small glossy green leaves and white, sweet scented flowers in clus¬ ters, followed by red berries which hang on for a long time. Planted out as a specimen it can be pruned into any de¬ sired shape. There is another variety, M. paniculata differing only in its fewer flowers and larger growth. These shrubs are now named Chalcas.  Hibiscus, of which we have about a dozen varieties are too well known to re¬ quire any description. They are useful for planting as single specimens or for hedges, windbreaks, etc. They have to be cut back well every year to be. kept in      bounds. They are easily propagated by cuttings and grow freely in almost any kind of soil or sand.  Jacobinia coccinea, a quick growing, soft wooded plant, easily propagated, fine foliage and tall terminal spikes of scarlet flowers. Good winter bloomer.  Tabernamontana Coronaria fl. pi. This is a very fine shrub with dark green leaves and large white sweet scented double flowers resembling Gardenia flor- ida.  Stenolobium Stans (Tecoma Stans). This well known shrub I find if cut back in the fall will bloom freely during the winter, large clusters of yellow, tubular flowers; blooms profusely in the fall.  Bauhinias in variety. These well known shrubs are of easy growth and should be planted more than they are. They will grow in the poorest soil and some of the varieties can be had in bloom at almost any time of the year. B. purpurata is a winter blooming variety and its large, or¬ chid-like flowers are much admired by visitors. Propagated by seeds.  Alpinia Nutans —Shell Flower. This plant is related to the Ginger, a very handsome plant requiring rich soil and plenty of water and a sheltered situation to grow it well. The flowers are in ter¬ minal drooping spikes, pink, and sweet scented. The plant reesmbles the “Gin¬ ger lily.” Common name, Shell Flower.  Carissa arduina. This plant is a small leaved evergreen with double spines; flowers white, star shaped, sweet scented; berries dark red when ripe; they make a fine jelly. The bush is almost constantly in bloom.   Clerodendron pendulajlorum, a very ornamental plant or shrub when in bloom, the flowers are in pendulous racemes from the ends of the branches. Many flowered shrubs about six feet high and bushy. There are several other varieties of Clerodendron, all desirable plants.  Strelitzia—Augusta and Regime. This is a magnificent plant resembling in growth the Travelers Tree (Ravanela). The flowers of S. Augusta also resemble the flower of Ravanela. The flowers of S. Reginae are orange and purple. They are called “Bird of Paradise flower,” are hard to describe but are well worth see¬ ing. Both varieties bloom at Palm Beach. They require rich soil and plenty of wa¬ ter. The plant belongs to the same fam- ily as the Banana. Propagated by seeds and sprouts.  Ravanela, the Traveler’s Tree. This fine plant resembles Strelitzia Augusta; its flowers are white, clustered in alter¬ nate boat shaped spathes. The plant grows fifteen or twenty feet high with a trunk resembling a palm. The seeds are covered with a blue woolly substance and are edible. A very striking and ornamen¬ tal plant in all stages of its growth. There is considerable water stored in the large cup-like sheaths of the leaf stalks from which travelers are supposed to quench their thirst, hence the common name. Propagated by seeds and suckers grow¬ ing from the base of the tree.  o  Pandanus, commonly called Screw Pine is a very ornamental plant. P. utilis grows to a height of twenty feet or more. The male and female flowers are on sep¬ arate plants. The seeds grow in a large cluster resembling a pineapple of large   6      size and hangs on the tree for a year. P. Veitchii is an ornamental plant when young and is largely used as a pot plant. When planted out it makes a large spec¬ imen fifteen feet high with numerous aerial roots. When planted as a hedge or windbreak it is impenetrable in a few years. The leaves of all but one variety have spines along the edges and mid-rib. P. Baptistii is a smooth leaved variety with long finely variegated leaves.  Monster a deliciosia, an ornamental ev¬ ergreen climbing plant, with curious per¬ forated leaves attaches itself to a tree, house, or other support by its numerous aerial roots. The fruit resembles an ear of corn, with a delicious pineapple flavor and odor, propagated by cuttings of the stem. Another fine Aeroid is Pothos An- rea with large dark green leaves, striped and blotched with golden yellow, attaches itself to walls, trees, etc.  I don't know of any finer ornamental than a well grown specimen of the Kum- quat (Citrus Japonica ), with its bright green leaves and hundreds of golden fruit.  In colored foliage plants the Croton, I think, takes first place with its varied colors and forms. Some of the newer va¬ rieties are very fine planted out as sin¬ gle specimens, borders to walks, beds, or planted to cover unsightly places they are always attractive. They are also very effective when grown in pots or tubs, easily propagated from cuttings.  The variegated forms of Aralia and Panax are equally effective in groups, borders or pots.  Aphelcindras and Scinchezia are also fine variegated plants.   Acalyphas in four or five varieties are largely used for borders, hedges or groups, etc.  Among the many vines growing here, Thunbergia grandi flora and T. laurifolin are I think the most satisfactory and beautiful. There is very little difference in these two varieties. They are contin¬ ually in bloom. The flowers are light blue, about three inches across, and the whole vine is literally covered with them. It is a rampant grower and will cover a large space in one season. Propagated by cuttings.  Petraea-Volubilis is a very fine, hard wood twiner, with numerous spikes of blue flowers, blooms a couple of times during the year and is very attractive; a quick grower but rather difficult to prop¬ agate. The well known Bougainvillea is another fine hard wood climber. It is now covered with its purple bracts which makes it a very showy plant for covering arbors, porches, etc. The newer varie¬ ties are being planted largely. Their bracts are very attractive in color, brick red, crimson lake, etc.  Bignonia' Venusta, “Flame Vine,” is a very satisfactory vine of rapid growth, will cover houses and trees in a couple of years. It begins to bloom in December and continues for about three months. During that time it is covered with its large bunches of orange-red tubular flow¬ ers. There are several other varieties of Bignonia vines that are very showy and ornamental when in bloom.  Ipomaea Horsfallea Briggsii is a fine winter blooming vine of the Convolvolus family, with large racemes of crimson flowers and palmated leaves of shining      green. It has a large tuberous root and perennial—a very desirable vine.  Solandra is another desirable vine with large chalice like flowers of pale cream color changing to white. It is a strong grower, easily propagated. There are several other varieties.  There are many other desirable vines, winter and spring bloomers, such as So- lamums, Cryptostegia, Abrus, Rhyncos- permum, Porania, several varieties of Aristolochia, etc., that are easily grown and verv beautiful when in flower.  Of palms we have the following va¬ rieties growing in the open ground with¬ out any protection and all doing well. Cocos Nucifera, the well known Coconut palm, bearing great quantities of nuts every year. Cocos Plumosa, and several others of this class. Phoenix, the Date palm; several varieties Caryotas; three varieties, Arecas; Oredoxia regia, the Royal palm; Washingtonia robusta, the California palm; Latania borbonica, Thrinax Argentia, Pritchard ea pacifica, Attalea Cohnne, Accrocomia total, Hyo- phorbia Verschaffeltii, Seaforthia ele- gans, Mar tine Aa Caryotaefolia, Sabal, the palmetto, and several others.  We have two Cycads that do well here, Cycas revoluta and C. circinalis, that are very ornamental and make fine large specimens. Another Cycad, Dio on edulis, is a very fine plant, resembling Cycas revoluta but not having as many leaves.  In ornamental and shade trees there are a great variety, all making fine spec¬ imens in a very few years and nearly all of them suitable for planting in the terri¬ tory mentioned. They seem to thrive in the poorest sand or rich jungle land   and on the rock ridges bordering Lake Worth.  Tamarindus Indica, Tamarind Tree, makes a wonderful growth, some spec¬ imens here being over thirty feet high, with a spread of fully thirty feet. A de¬ licious drink is made from the pulp which surrounds the seeds.  AlbizAa Lebbec. “Whistling Bean/’ is another fine tree either for shade or street planting. When in bloom it fills the air with its delicate perfume.  Bombax Cebia is another fine tree, with buttressed roots and growing over forty feet high. It is commonly called “Silk Cotton Tree,” and is very tropical in appearance.  Grevillea robust a, Australian Silk Oak, grows freely here and stands the salt air. Small plants set out fifteen years ago are now fully fifty feet high, with a trunk diameter of eighteen inches, two feet from the ground. In the spring the branches are covered with orange yellow flowers in large bunches. A fine tree for street planting.  Many varieties of Eucalyptus grow well here. Some fine specimens planted about fifteen years ago can be seen on several of the streets of West Palm Beach.  Poinciana regia, is so well known on the lower East Coast that it needs no de¬ scription. When well grown it makes a tree forty feet high and wide spreading, covering over fifty feet with a dense shade. When in bloom it is a magnifi¬ cent sight, covered with large bunches of scarlet flowers. Have known tourists remaining here to see the tree in bloom and take photographs of it.      There are about a dozen varieties of Ficus, Rubber Tree, growing here, nearly all, fine shade trees and suitable for street and road side planting. Ficus altissima makes a magnificent tree in a few years and is, I think, the finest of the species. Ficus eburnea is also a fine variety and a quick grower. Ficus pandurata, “The Majestic Rubber” has very large leaves, but is of slower growth. As a single specimen on a lawn it is very effective. Ficus Nitida is the best variety for street or roadside planting; it is a quick grower, gives a dense shade, has dark green, small leaves and is in every way a fine tree for the purpose named ; it would also make a splendid wind break. A cutting of this variety about the size of a lead pencil was sent to me by mail some fifteen years ago and is now a tree thirty feet high, of compact growth, with a spread of the same dimension.  Achras sapota, the Sapodilla, is also a clean evergreen tree of slower growth than the Ficus but makes a very hand¬ some shade tree.  Jacaranda Mimosafolia is a lovely shade tree; the leaves are finely pinnated like the Poinciana. The numerous flow¬ ers come in long erect panicles of a love¬ ly shade of blue. It should be largely planted in South Florida. It is the most ornamental tree I know of and admired by everyone who sees it in bloom.  Casaurina equisitaf olia , Australian Pine, so called, but it is not a pine. This tree is largely grown as a shade tree or windbreak along the lower East Coast; it seems to thrive under any conditions and stands the salt air well. It is largely used in making hedges. It grows very   fast. I have known them to grow ten feet high from the seed in one year. The wood is hard and takes a fine polish. It makes splendid fire wood and should be largely grown in waste places for this purpose alone. I find that this wood lasts longer than pine, it is not what would be called an ornamental tree, but for the uses mentioned it is the best. If cut back it branches better and makes a fine street tree.  Parmentiera ceriefera, the Candle Tree. This is a curious tree bearing large white flowers and long waxy yellow fruit re¬ sembling candles. The fruit is said to be edible, but I have not tried it although I had a crop of “Candles” last year.  Kigelia pinnata is another curious tree. It bears large trusses of tulip¬ shaped flowers followed by a crop of sausage-shaped fruit. It is commonly called “Sausage tree.”  Spath odea palmata, Parkis africana, Heritiera lift oralis, are all fine, tall grow¬ ing trees raised from seeds sent me from the Philippines.  Aberia Kaffra, a dense growing thorny tree bearing golden yellow fruits resem¬ bling a miniature apple.  There are many other available plants, vines and trees suitable for planting along the lower East Coast, but I am afraid my paper is already too long to enumerate any others. I see no reason why there are not more ornamentals planted. They grow with very little care and are easily procured from nursery men at reasonable prices, and one can al¬ ways get cuttings from a friend or neigh¬ bor who have plants growing. The poor man can grow a tree, shrub or vine as      well as the rich man if.he is only in¬ clined. Besides planting his grounds with desirable trees, etc., it makes his place more attractive and valuable. In conclu¬ sion I may add that all of the trees, shrubs and vines mentioned in this paper, and many others, have been planted by me and are growing on the property at Palm Beach which I have had charge of for the past eighteen years.  I would like to call the attention of real estate owners, promoters of sub-di¬ visions, Rotarians, Good Roads Associa¬ tions, and Women’s Clubs to the dreary stretches of roads along: the East Coast   and other parts of the State. What a vast change could be made in their pres¬ ent appearance if there were trees and shrubs planted along the road sides, and there are trees and shrubs to be found suitable for the different soils. What a pleasing change it would be to the home- seeker or tourist in a few years, compared to the present uninviting conditions.  I would like to see some concerted ac¬ tion taken by these organizations to have these dreary road sides improved by planting suitable trees and shrubs and caring for them until they were estab¬ lished.@@   
 Recent Development in Sub-Tropical  Horticulture@@   W. J. Krome@@ Homestead@@   The Committee on Avocados and Sub¬ tropical Fruits, in arranging its portion of the program for this session, has endeav¬ ored to present to you information show¬ ing the development which has been made in the culture of sub-tropical fruits in various sections of our State in a com¬ mercial way, as well as the most recent technical data relative to the propagation of such fruits and the control of the dis¬ eases and pests which may infest them.  Our program deals largely with the Avocado because its culture in Florida has become more general than that of any other sub-tropical fruit and information of both a commercial and technical na¬ ture regarding it is more sought after.  During the past year there have been developments which are of great interest to the Avocado grower. A number of new and very promising varieties have been fruited and some of the older va¬ rieties have shown faults which were not fully anticipated. Seedling Avocados, erown from the seed of fruit of the Gua- temalan type produced in Florida, have begun to bear, and the fruit produced by these trees has given an entirely new trend to varietal propagation.  Henceforth three distinct races of Avo¬ cados have been recognized. The Mex¬   ican, which is hardy and produces fruit of fine flavor but so small in size and of such poor shipping qualities as to be hardly worth consideration as a commer¬ cial proposition; the Guatemalan, a race which provides varieties fairly cold re¬ sistant, prolific and bearing fruit of fine eating and shipping qualities but in many cases of too small size to meet the require¬ ments of our Eastern markets; and the West Indian race, upon which the com¬ mercial culture of the Avocado in Flor¬ ida has been founded and which still fur¬ nishes practically all of the fruit which is shipped out of this State. Occasional natural hybrid varieties have been brought to the attention of propagators, but heretofore these have been crosses between the Mexican and Guatemalan types. In their natural environment there has not been much opportunity for cross¬ es of the Guatemalan and West Indian Avocados to occur, as the two races are seldom found in the same locality. But in Florida we now have West Indian and Guatemalan Avocados growing in close proximity, often blooming during the same period and, from the natural crosses which seem sure to result, we are quite likely to obtain, by selection, varieties combining the good qualities of both par-      ents and better adapted to Florida condi¬ tions than either. Several Guatemalan seedlings of Florida origin have borne fruit during the past season and in each case this fruit has been neither straight Guatemalan nor West Indian but has shown unmistakable evidence of being a cross of the two types, having some qual¬ ities superior to that of either parent.  This winter and spring, for the first time, Guatemalan Avocados have been placed on the northern markets in quan¬ tities sufficient to permit some idea being formed as to the reception which the consumer is going to give this fruit. At any rate enough have been shipped to make it evident that all markets do not value the Avocado alike. When Avo¬ cados sell in one city for $42.00 per crate and ii another only a few hundred miles away at $10.00 per crate, for practically the same grade of fruit, as has been the case this season, it is apparent that neither market is giving the product its proper rating. However, while prices varied greatly, the fact that all offerings met with a ready sale, has been very encour¬ aging to the producers.  Ranking next to the Avocado in im¬ portance, at the present time, we may safely place the Mango. That this deli¬ cious fruit has not been more heavily planted and has not reached a position commercially more prominent, has been due almost wholly to the indifferent bear¬ ing qualities of the finer varieties. Such fruit as is produced by trees of the Mul- goba, Haden, Amini, Paheri and several other of the East Indian type of Mangos, would have brought about the planting of thousands of acres and would have firm¬   ly established the fruit as one of the most sought-after of all of our Florida prod¬ ucts, were it not for the unreliable fruit¬ ing character of these trees, which so far has kept commercial Mango culture on about the same basis as lottery playing. The Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture has been working on this problem for a number of years and some of the results most recently obtained have been very encouraging. One of the papers to be presented at this session will give some interesting information along this line.  It has been heretofore accepted as a fact that Date culture on a commercial basis was limited in the United States to a few comparatively small, arid sections of California, Arizona and possibly Tex¬ as. That Dates could be successfully grown in Florida was not considered a possibility on account of climatic condi¬ tions, vet there now seems to be a fair chance that these conclusions have been in error and that this very profitable in¬ dustry may be established on a commer¬ cial footing in at least one section of our State.  Dates have been produced on Key West Island and some of the adjacent keys for many years, but during the past decade the number of bearing palms has greatly increased and at the proper sea¬ son ripe Dates are to be found on most of the fruit stands in the Island City. These facts have been brought to the attention of the officials of the Bureau of Plant In¬ dustry and some preliminary investiga¬ tions have been made which, while not at all conculsive, are very interesting and encouraging.      The greatest obstacle in the way of Date culture in Florida has been the heavy rainfall and frequent dews during the maturing season of the fruit. The annual rainfall at Key West is hardly more than half of that at points on the southern mainland and there is said to be an almost total absence of dew throughout the period when the date is ripening. This opens possibilities for the fruit which may lead to the founding of an important industry.  A great many thousands of dollars have been spent in exploring the Date¬ growing countries of the Orient and in importing into the United States the off¬ shoots of the finest varieties which are grown in those regions. These varieties are now grown commercially in the Coachella Valley and a few other sections of the West and the extension of the plantings is said to be limited almost wholly by the supply of offshoots avail¬ able. These offshoots which provide the only certain means of growing the palms true to name, sell readily at from $10.00 to $20.00 each. During the past season the California Date growers have been able to market their first-grade fruit, after proper preparation, at from $1.00 to $1.50 per pound. When one consid¬ ers that a full bearing Date Palm will carry an average of 100 pounds of fruit and that the processes of preparing this fruit for market are not more expensive than those required for most other simi¬ lar products, some of the possibilities of this industry become apparent. Among the keys adjacent to Key West, there are thousands of acres of land which is too low in elevation above tide water to per¬   mit the growing of any other fruit trees but upon which the Date Palm will thrive, for the Date does not object to somewhat salty soil conditions. The growers of Dates in California, to realize the best prices for their product must get it to our Eastern markets in advance of the best Dates from the Orient and this fact is ap¬ parently going to bar the commercial growing of some of the best varieties in that State. One fact brought oilt by the recent investigations by the Bureau of Plant Industry has been that the time of blooming of the Date Palms on Key West Island is nearly two months earlier than in California, with probably abcut the same difference applying to the season of maturity. The advantage of this would be very great to the Florida Date grower.  Unfortunately when the Date offdioots were brought into this country from Asia and Africa a serious scale was introduced, which has never been eradicated. If the industry is ever to amount to anything h Florida it would be a great mistake to burden it with this pest to begin with ano it is therefore not advisable to bring into the State, even for experimental pur¬ poses, offshoots of the fine varieties which might otherwise be obtained from California. This will make any possible development in this State, slower of real¬ ization than would otherwise be the case, but the initial steps have already been taken and future results will be awaited with great interest.  Here, there and anywhere within our boundaries may be found men and women working with such fruits as the Litchee, the Papaya, the Anonas, the Guavas, the Carissa, the Jujube and a host of other      more or less exotic food plants. Little by little we are learning of what can or cannot be grown in sub-tropical Florida, and each one of these enthusiastic indi¬ vidual experimenters is doing a work of value for our State which should receive the utmost encouragement from the mem¬ bers of this Society.  Those of us who have lived here long enough have learned to use that phrase “waste land” very carefully when we ap¬ ply it to areas within our own State, for we have seen many sections, which could be briefly described in that way with ap¬   parent safety, become bountifully pro¬ ductive through the introduction of some new product or the application of new methods to the production of some old staple. It must be either a very learned or a very ignorant man who will make the unqualified assertion that any section of our State is hopelessly “waste land,” for at any time some hopeless crank is likely to make his dream come true and bring into profitable production some plant which will turn that particular piece of wilderness into a garden.@@      
 The Avocado From the Investor’s Standpoint@@   L. F. Flipse@@   The Avocado, peer of salad fruits, dur¬ ing its short history in this country has stirred the enthusiasm of its grower, has been favorably received in all the largest markets of this country, and has gained for itself an enviable position from the investor's standpoint.  This fruit was first discovered by the earliest Spanish explorers in Central and South America, and it has since been dis¬ tributed around the tropical world. Never before its introduction to Southern California and Florida has it been grown under modern grove methods, and never before has it been marketed on a scale to have reached the proportions of an indus¬ try.  It is not unusual in the development of new sections of our country to find new and favorable locations for the growing of fruits well known and established in our markets, but it is very rare, indeed, to find a new fruit with all the qualities to create an unlimited demand that has never before been exploited on a com¬ mercial scale.  The topic assigned to me, “The Avo¬ cado from the Investor’s Standpoint,” in its discussion calls for a record of the past performance of the Avocado in South Florida, and of its fruits in the markets of our country. Will it pay the prospective grower to grow Avocados as   we grow other fruits in this State? Will he be rewarded financially for capital in¬ vested and labor expended in growing this fruit?  Fortunately, the Avocado has made some very conclusive performance rec¬ ords right here in South Florida upon which to base expectations as to the fu¬ ture success of Avocado growing. We have passed the experimental stage and have established some very vital and fun¬ damental facts upon which to base our predictions as to the financial success a grower of Avocados may expect. For¬ tunately also, the fruits shipped to our markets have not only made records but have broken all records for returns on fruit shipments.  In all horticultural pursuits there are two main factors essential to the success of the undertaking, viz.: Production of the fruit under practical conditions; and market distribution of the product at a profit.  It would be ruinous to attempt to grow any fruit on a commercial scale in a lo¬ cality where soil and climate or any other condition prevented the fullest develop¬ ment or interfered with the natural func¬ tioning of the tree; nor would it be prac¬ tical to grow any fruit commercially where cost of land or cost of bringing the grove into bearing and maintaining it in     a healthy and prolific state were so great that even the best of returns could not show a profit on the investment.  The best and most conclusive evidence that we can produce the fruit under prac¬ tical conditions in favored sections of South Florida; that our soil and climate and seasons of drought and rainfall are all congenial to the fullest development of the tree and its fruit, lies in the trees now growing in this section and the fruits they have produced in past seasons.  We have in Southern Dade County seedling trees twenty to twenty-five years old and budded trees nearly as old. Trees that have weathered our storms, over¬ came frost.injuries, or suffered none; rested in our periods of drought, and re¬ joiced in our tropic rains and sunshine. For twenty-five years some of them have accepted our climate and weather in all its moods and just as nature makes it and they stand today beautiful and thrifty specimens with all the vigor of youth.  I doubt whether the Avocado trees of the same age growing in their native lands in South and Central America would much surpass our trees in size and vigor or in productivity. Some of these old trees have a spread of fiftv feet or more and tower no less in height. Some of them are so large in girth that my two arms would barely encircle their trunks. Many of them in one grove about fifteen miles south of Miami, were broken al¬ most to the ground during the severe storm of 1910, but undaunted and with renewed vigor have put on new tops and quickly regained their place with their more fortunate neighbors. These old seedlings have not only made a favor¬   able showing in size and vigor, but have also been generous in the production of crops. It is not uncommon for some of these trees to yield fifty or sixty dozen fruits. From a group of almost a dozen trees, 4,200 fruits have been sold and per¬ haps many more were produced by the same trees in other seasons.  These facts as to trees now growing are brought to the investor’s attention to show that the Avocado is at home in parts of South Florida; that our soil and our climate are congenial to the productivity and longevity of the Avocado; that we have passed the experimental stage of Avocado growing here; and that we have here the first factor essential to the suc¬ cess of Avocado growing—the right con¬ ditions for the practical production of the fruit.  The growth and vigor of the trees show that our soil and climate, our sea¬ sons of rain and drought are congenial to the fullest development of the tree and its fruit. Our past experience in growing Avocados demonstrates most convincing¬ ly that these sections of South Florida are natural Avocado sections; that we have a natural Avocado belt here just as truly as they have a peach belt about Fort Val¬ ley, Georgia; just as certain as there is a natural cherry section about Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. And just as has the Hood River Valley become famous for its apples, so will South Florida become fa¬ mous for its Avocados.  The second factor essential to the suc¬ cess of Avocado growing is the profitable distribution or sale of the fruit. The re¬ turns on Avocados sold in all past seasons have been most gratifying. Prices re-      ceived by the grower from the time first shipments were made to this date are evi¬ dence of its popularity, and the demand for this fruit has made it the highest priced fruit on the American market to¬ day. Our budded varieties of Avocados have made records of sales, in individual cases, which, used as a basis for comput¬ ing grove returns would run into figures to stagger the imagination.  The fruit from a grove in Southern Dade County consisting of 200 budded trees returned over $800.00 to the grower three and one-half years after trees were planted. The next season the fruit was sold for $1,200.00 on the trees. Then followed two lean years on account of frost injury to the tips and bloom buds. Last season the fruit from this same grove netted the grower over $4,000.00.  It is not uncommon to sell budded va¬ rieties of Avocados at from $10.00 to $20.00 per crate of about three dozen fruits, and the usual range of prices of the later budded varieties, on the tree, is from $2.00 to $3.00 per dozen. The question that arises in the mind of the investor is, “Will the markets continue to pay the prices paid in past years ?”  The prices of Avocados or of any other fruit are governed by the law of supply and demand, and the answer to the ques¬ tion of future prices resolves itself nec¬ essarily into a prediction. If demand keeps pace with supply or vice versa, if supply falls short of demand, if the pres¬ ent ratio of supply to demand is main¬ tained, then we may expect no reduction in prices of Avocados.  We have in this country a very limited area in which this fruit may be grown   under practical conditions. We have, so to speak, a monopoly on the growing of this fruit commercially south of the line passing somewhere through the peninsula of Florida, a limited area at best, and an important factor in limiting the supply and maintaining the past ratio of supply to demand.  True! The fruit may be grown com¬ mercially in the nearby tropical islands, but it is also true that the fruits of these islands will not carry satisfactorily be¬ yond our seaport cities, and even there does not generally arrive in satisfactory condition. Furthermore, this fruit is from seedling trees and does not come into season with our best varieties. The grower of Avocados here does not recog¬ nize competition of foreign Avocados.  But a few years ago the Avocado was practically unknown in the markets of our large cities. Its sterling qualities won for it immediate recognition of the public, and by a flavor all its own and its characteristic as a salad fruit, it has held its popularity. To some the first taste may be insipid, but a taste usually invites another, which grows into a desire for more. The Avocado with a favorite dressing is pronounced the most delicious of all salads. Once the taste for the fruit is acquired, the desire to satisfy the palate becomes almost a craving, accompanied by a readiness to pay almost any price for the fruit.  In the tropics where the Avocado is well known it is eaten and relished by all; there is no substitute for the Avocado. It is and will be in competition only with itself. It is unique in character and fla-       63-   vor, a salad fruit, and as such is not ef¬ fected by other or competing fruits.  Its popularity is assured whenever and wherever it makes its appearance, and re¬ gardless of other fruits competing for popularity.  A desire for an orange or an apple may be satisfied by a grapefruit or a peach; but a desire for an Avocado will be satis¬ fied only by an Avocado or an Avocado salad. Is it not safe to assume that the palates of the masses of Americans will respond likewise as we grow more of the fruit and make it possible for more to enjoy it?  The sterling qualities of the Avocado have hardly been touched upon. Its food   value is comparable pound for pound with that of milk and eggs and meat.  It is unfortunate, indeed, that this won¬ derful fruit cannot be produced from coast to coast in quantities to supply the demand for food for the masses; for young and old; to nourish the feeble, and give energy to the worker.  The future of the Avocado and the probabilities as to financial success of its growers are so promising as to halt ex¬ pression of candid opinion and it seems evident from analysis of conditions that from the investor’s standpoint the Avo¬ cado offers possibilities never before equalled by any horticultural venture.@@   
 The Control of Insect Pests on the Avocado@@   G. F. Moznette@@ Bureau of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture@@  Miami, Florida@@   The Avocado is not attacked by as many enemies as cause damage to cit¬ rus fruits which have been longer es¬ tablished within our borders, nevertheless there are a number of destructive enemies which cause concern to the Avocado grower, and which must be reckoned with in order to successfully produce healthy trees so that they may produce a satisfac¬ tory crop of fruit. It is generally admit¬ ted that practically every fruit which is propagated commercially has one or more enemies bent on its destruction. At times growers fail to think about these enemies until their trees and fruit are attacked by them, and then it is generally too late to repair the damage done. It is very im¬ portant for the grower who wishes to produce healthy trees in order that they may bear a satisfactory crop of fruit, to be ever on the lookout to detect insect in¬ festation; to know something about the various destructive pests which may at¬ tack his trees and the measures which he may employ in order to effectively control them.  The purpose of this paper is to bring together briefly some information con¬ cerning some of the more destructive Avocado insects present in Florida, so that the grower may have some knowl¬ edge concerning them, and become better acquainted with some of the insect trou¬ bles he may at times be confronted with.  For the most part the insect pests caus¬ ing damage to the Avocado in Florida re¬ semble greatly in habit and general ap¬ pearance those which attack citrus fruits. Practically all of them are insects pro¬ vided with mouth parts fitted for sucking the juices from the plant tissues. Such pests as scale insects, white flies and mealy bugs found on citrus trees are also to be found on the Avocado. It is quite possible that some of the insect pests at present found attacking the Avocado in Florida have been brought in. Others may be insects which have always existed here on some native vegetation and have adapted themselves to the Avocado. Hence as groves are being established in different widely separated sections, we may possibly find at times different in¬ sect pests appearing which gradually es¬ tablish themselves on the Avocado. This condition is quite true of most newly in¬ troduced trees and plants. Then again, we may find sections in the State where the weather conditions prove more favor¬ able for the multiplication of certain pests which do not thrive where the weather conditions are more adverse. This condition is evidenced by certain pests which thrive in groves situated on       the keys with the close proximity of wa¬ ter which greatly regulates the temper¬ atures. Many insect pests are sensitive to abrupt changes in temperature. Hence we may expect to find insect infestations severe in certain localities where others prove less favorable to insect activity.  During the dry winter months in Flor¬ ida, the Avocado is generally considered in a dormant condition. At this time of year various enemies are to be found at¬ tacking the Avocado which thrive under conditions of little rainfall and low hu¬ midity.  THE AVOCADO RED SPIDER.  One of the enemies which attacks the Avocado during the winter is the Avo¬ cado Red Spider, Tetranychus yothersi McG. In appearance it is not unlike most other red spiders which attack citrus trees. By examining the foliage carefully the red spiders will appear as mere red specks moving in every direction over the foliage when disturbed. It is very desir¬ able for the grower to be provided with a suitable hand lens in order to be better able to detect and distinguish between the various pests he may come in contact with as many of the enemies are rather minute.  Trees heavily infested with red spiders appear in a comparatively short length of time under favorable conditions as if scorched by fire, the leaves turning brown and ultimately dropping. The over win¬ ter foliage should remain on the trees un¬ til there is sufficient new growth pro¬ duced in the spring to take its place when normal shedding of the foliage will occur. Where the winter foliage is lost prema¬   turely the result may be an abnormal de¬ velopment of the bloom, and a set back to the trees in their activity to sustain the proper set of fruit. The grower should watch his trees carefully and examine them frequently especially on the ap¬ proach of dry weather in the fall, and when the red spiders are detected in num¬ bers while the foliage is still green he should prepare to spray and not wait until the foliage has become browned and scorched.  Control.  The Avocado red spider may be con¬ trolled by spraying with the regular lime sulphur solution at the rate of one gallon to seventy-five gallons of water.  THE AVOCADO LEAF THRIPS.  Another enemy which may at times be seen infesting Avocado foliage is the so- called greenhouse thrips of the northern states, Helio thrips heniorrhoidalis Bouche, which attacks the Avocado in the open in Florida. This thrips resembles most other thrips in appearance, is black in color and about a millimeter in length.  The first indication of injury caused by this thrips is the production of pale col¬ ored areas to the foliage due to the ex¬ traction of the plant juices. These pale areas gradually run together as the work of the thrips becomes more in evidence over the leaf surface. Later the foliage assumes a brown color and appears scorched. Eventually the foliage drops prematurely as in the case of the red spider.   66 1       Control.  It may be controlled by using a spray of nicotine sulphate 40% at the rate of one gallon to nine hundred gallons of wa¬ ter. To this should be added four or five pounds of fish oil soap to each one hun¬ dred fifty gallons of the diluted spray mixture. The soap will cause the spray to spread more evenly over the foliage. If both the red spiders and thrips are present on the foliage, the two sprays of lime sulphur and nicotine sulphate may be combined, eliminating the soap. As both the red spiders and thrips carry on their depredations on the upper surface of the foliage, the spray should be pri¬ marily directed to that part of the fo¬ liage.  THE AVOCADO BLOSSOM THRIPS.  With the approach of spring various other insect activities present themselves. Before the bearing Avocado tree pro¬ duces new growth, the blossom clusters arise from the terminal twigs or from the base of the year’s growth. The bloom as it appears is attacked by a blossom thrips, Frankliniella cephalicus Craw. This blos¬ som thrips is not the same which attacks citrus in Florida, however, it does not differ materially in general appearance. It averages less than a milimeter in length and in general color is a pale yel¬ low. It was first recorded as taken from the native acacia-like plants in the moun¬ tains of Mexico and it is quite probable that it has found its way into Florida from that country.   The injury by the thrips to the bloom is caused by the feeding of the young and adults on the individual flower parts de¬ stroying many of them in the course of their depredations. As succeeding gen¬ erations appear the adults deposit their eggs in great numbers in the stems and pedicles which bear the floral panicles and which hold the fruits as they set to the terminal twigs. These punctures which later become emergence holes for the young reduce somewhat the strength of the stems which bear the fruit. This condition is evident in such varieties as the Trapp, which naturally bear weak stems. The thrips do not attack the fruit.  Control.  It may be controlled by spraying with nicotine sulphate 40% at the rate of one gallon to nine hundred gallons of water with the addition of four or five pounds of fish oil soap to the diluted spray, which serves as a spreader.  THE AVOCADO WHITE FLY.  With the maturing of the bloom and the setting of the fruit new growth com¬ mences to arise from the floral racemes. As the new growth appears it is attacked by the Avocado white fly, Trialeurodes floridensis Q. This white fly is not un¬ like the species of white flies which attack citrus, it bears white wings and possesses a yellow body. It is however, somewhat smaller than most citrus white flies, and may be distinguished on the foliage in the pupal stage by the characteristic fringe which this stage possesses.   ;      This white fly is usually more abundant in groves situated on the keys and stretches of land between the ocean and bay inlets along the lower east coast of Florida. This probably is due to the fact that the temperature registers more even¬ ly in these localities. It is found, how¬ ever, in varying numbers on the mainland and especially in nurseries on young trees in lath houses, where its activities are more or less protected and not greatly in¬ terrupted by the weather conditions.  The adults which appear in the spring of year emerge from the over wintering pupal stage clustered in great numbers on the lower surface of the older foliage. The adults deposit their eggs in great numbers on the new growth, the larvae which hatch from the eggs pass their ex¬ istence on the lower surface of the leaves.  This species also produces an abun¬ dance of honey dew which accumulates upon the upper surface of the foliage and fruit. The common sooty mold fungus later develops in this honey dew deposit eventually giving the Avocado foliage and fruit a decided blackened appearance.  Control.  Where this pest is present in a bearing grove it may be controlled by spraying with the regular oil emulsion spray. Two sprayings will generally control the white fly, one during the spring after the fruit has set and the first general flush of new growth is sufficiently hardened, using a strength of one gallon to eighty of wa¬ ter. Another application should be made in the fall when the adult flies are for the most part off the wing and the foliage   is turning dormant using a strength of one gallon to seventy of water.  THE DICTYOSPERMUM SCALE.  At times various scale insects give the Avocado grower considerable trouble. One in particular is the Dictyospermum Scale, Chrysomphalns dictyospermi Mor¬ gan. In appearance it does not differ ma¬ terially from a great many scales and re¬ sembles quite closely our common Florida red scale in shape and is a light amber in color.  Where this scale is present in a grove or nursery it attacks the twigs and branch¬ es, and where very numerous may often be found on the foliage. The branches attacked are gradually weakened and ul¬ timately become of little use to the tree. The twigs and branches soon become roughened and crack considerably, there¬ by affording entrance places for various injurious plant diseases. As time goes on an infested tree shows a decided lack of lateral twigs and branches resulting in a badly formed tree.  Control.  The best time to control this pest on the Avocado is when the trees are dor¬ mant, usually from the middle of Decem¬ ber until the first of February. The scale is readily killed by using an oil emulsion spray at a strength of one gallon to seventy gallons of water. Two appli¬ cations of an oil emulsion spray at a three or four-week interval will control this pest.   7      PYRIFORM SCALE.  A scale which seriously attacks the Avocado in a number of localities is the Pyriform Scale, Protopulvinaria pyrif- ormis Ckll. In appearance this scale is somewhat convex, pyriform in shape and of a reddish brown color. In the adult stage it possesses a cottony matter which projects about the margins of the scale.  The scale attacks the foliage. The im¬ mature scales migrate in the spring to the new growth as they hatch from the mature scales on the older growth of foli¬ age. In the process of development on the foliage honey dew is produced in practically the same manner as when white flies are present and eventually sooty mold covers the foliage and fruit.  Control.  It is controlled by using an oil emulsion spray as recommended for the Dictyos- permum scale. However, in this case the spray should be directed toward the lower surface of the foliage where the scales are found.  This in a general way gives briefly some information concerning some of the more important Avocado pests. There are, however, still others of importance about which little is as yet known, while there are still others of less importance. As our investigations along this line con¬ tinue, information concerning these will be available.   Lastly, I wish to mention, that it be¬ hooves us in this early stage of the Avo¬ cado industry, to take full account of all Avocado pests and strive in every way to do our part toward controlling and eradicating such pests as we now have and to prevent the importation of those that exist in other places. Stop and con¬ sider what saving would have been ac¬ complished in our various fruit industries, if the various destructive pests had not been introduced or had been eradicated when first introduced. In Hawaii the Avocados are badly infested with a fruit fly, and the commercial growing of Avo¬ cados, which otherwise would have be¬ come important, has been ruined. Such pests as the Mediterranean fruit fly, the West Indian fruit fly and others, as well as a number of very dangerous Avocado weevils, occur in a number of places where Avocados grow and we do not want in Florida. Every traveler coming from some foreign land is tempted at times to bring along some of the rare tropical fruits attacked by these various dangerous pests. Our laws are stringent on this point, but people are ignorant and we are consantly threatened with the pos¬ sibility of the importation of dangerous pests. We should all be alert and watch¬ ful to aid so far as we can in preventing any such pests that threaten our various fruit industries from becoming estab¬ lished.@@   
 Spraying for Avocado Diseases@@   H. E. Stevens@ Ft. Myers, Florida@@   Last year, in a paper read before this Society, I mentioned some spraying ex¬ periments for the control of Avocado dis¬ eases which the Experiment Station then had in progress. At that time it was too early to anticipate what the results would be. Today I wish to again refer to those experiments and give you the results that were obtained since this work was done in the Redland section of Dade County. I believe this information will be of in¬ terest to the Avocado growers of this section of the State or other sections where diseases of the Avocado fruit are troublesome.  If you will pardon a little digression, I would like to touch on the future possi¬ bilities of the Avocado in Florida, for a few moments. I believe that a substan¬ tial and profitable industry can be de¬ veloped in this line, not only with the Avocado but with the Mango and other sub-tropical fruits that seem to be well adapted to culture in South Florida. This view is becoming more prevalent among our home folks and even the new¬ comer expecting to make Florida his home. This industry is yet new and few have gone into it in a strictly commer¬ cial way, but at the present time I find many people who are interested in devel¬ oping plantings of this nature and I be¬   lieve that the Horticultural Society can aid materially in fostering such a spirit and at the same time help to establish such an industry on a sound basis. There is a demand for information concerning these crops which can hardly be supplied from our present general store of knowl¬ edge. In any new horticultural enterprise the development usually moves slowly, but the time has now arrived when greater impetus should be given to find¬ ing out just what can be done with the Avocado and Mango in a commercial way, how these crops can best be handled and what prospects do they offer for the future. Is it a safe and sane policy to in¬ vest one’s money in commercial plantings of this nature for the future? These are some of the questions that come to the beginner.  Personally, I am optimistic in regard to the future of the Avocado and Mango, and believe that the time is not far distant when these fruits will be as much in evi¬ dence on our leading markets of the country as the grapefruit is today. We do not have to go very far back into his¬ tory to find the grapefruit regarded as a novelty, yet today there are thousands of cares in grapefruit groves and more acres are being planted each year. Why should this not apply to the Avocado and Mango,   70       within the next few years, especially in those localities where it has been dem¬ onstrated that they can be grown. We can not hope to grow Avocados on a com¬ mercial scale and sell them for fifty cents to one dollar apiece, and any one going into the industry with this in view, is apt to be disappointed. I do not think I am wrong in the supposition, however, that Avocados can be grown and put on the leading markets at a price that would tempt the average consumer and at a price that would give a fair return to the producer.  There are a number of things we must yet learn concerning the production of the Avocado and Mango before many per¬ sons will attempt plantings on a large scale. The soils and locations best suited for their culture; the best varieties to plant; methods of caring for the trees; kinds and amounts of fertilizers suitable for best results; disease and insect pest; available market and methods of market¬ ing the output; are some of the questions that come to those interested in develop¬ ing Avocado or Mango plantings for the future. We have a scattering knowledge in all of these subjects, but in some cases it does not extend beyond certain local limits. The beginner needs some more or less definite plan or set of instructions that he may follow with some degree of certainty.  The lower east coast has been the first to recognize the commercial possibilities of the Avocado here in Florida. Dade County has the largest commercial plant¬ ings in the State and probably the oldest bearing trees. There are two men in this   locality who have done pioneer work with the Avocado and Mango and they are largely responsible for what we know to¬ day in regard to the culture and varieties of these fruits best suited to Florida con¬ ditions. Mr. W. J. Krome and Mr. Geo. B. Cellon have contributed much to our knowledge of what can be done with these fruits in a practical way. It is here that the industry as such has started and other sections of the State naturally turn to Dade County for information. While this section is first in the production of Avocados and has demonstrated the feasi¬ bility of commercial plantings, there are other sections in South Florida where the Avocado and Mango can be grown equally as well. I believe there is just as great a future for these fruits along the lower west coast as there is here on the east coast. On the higher lands and the soils that can be well drained, I can see no reason why the Avocado and Mango can not be as generally grown in Lee County as they are in Dade. Lee County has a climate just as favorable, and a soil in many localities which I believe is better adapted to their growth, if the trees that I have seen thus far can be taken as a cri¬ terion.  At present our commercial plantings are few and of small acreages. The door yard plantings are limited to a few seed¬ ling trees and but little thought has been given to the Avocado and Mango as a commercial proposition in the past.  Now, however, the people are begin¬ ning to consider planting Avocados for. the future and they are seeking all the available information on this subject.      We will have our problems to work out as we go along and in many cases can profit by the experiences of the Avocado growers in this section. If the industry develops in Lee County as I anticipate it will, this section should contribute some¬ thing of interest to the Avocado industry in the future. I believe that by close co- * operation and through a free exchange of ideas on the subject, much can be done to rapidly build up a permanent and healthy industry in the growing of sub¬ tropical fruits. We have a section of country peculiarly suited for such devel¬ opment, so why not take advantage of the opportunity.  But to return to the subject I am to discuss, “Spraying for Avocado Dis¬ eases/’  There are three diseases of the Avocado fruit that might prove to be troublesome factors in the production of Avocados for commercial purposes. These are, Black Spot, Avocado Blotch and Avocado Scab. They are all fungus diseases and they were described and treated in the Annual Report of this Society for last year.  Black Spot and Blotch affect the fruit as it approaches maturity, making a worthless fruit for shipping purposes, and both of these diseases may be fore¬ runners of rapid decay. These two dis¬ eases are more common on the seedling varieties at the present time, however, Black Spot has been observed to occur on some of the budded varieties to some ex¬ tent. Avocado Scab occurs on both seed¬ ling and budded varieties and this disease attacks the fruit during the early stages of its development. Scab does not affect the interior of the fruit but it mars the   outward appearance of mature fruits and severe attacks may cause a heavy shed¬ ding of young fruits or a stunted and misshapen growth.  As plant pathologist of the Florida Ag¬ ricultural Experiment Station, I had made some investigation of these diseases for two or three seasons past to determine their causes and find some means of con¬ trol. The preliminary experiments that we previously tried had shown little ef¬ fect in controlling Black Spot or Blotch. In the spring of 1920 a definite plan of spraying was outlined and carried through the season, which took into con¬ sideration the control of each of these dis¬ eases. Our plan was to begin about the middle of the bloom period and to spray at monthly intervals over a period in which the fruits appeared to be more sus¬ ceptible to these diseases. Bordeaux Mixture 3-3-50 or its equivalent was used in the first applications and the 4-4-50 formula in the last applications. The spraying was done with a power sprayer and spray guns. The object of this ex¬ periment was to determine the number of applications of Bordeaux Mixture neces¬ sary to control these diseases and the time they should be applied to be effective. The results obtained were very encour¬ aging and I think demonstrate that each of these diseases can be controlled by proper spraying.  In the sprayings for Black Spot and Blotch thirty-six seedling Avocado trees were selected in a grove where the fruit had spotted badly during the past few seasons from these two diseases. The trees were large and from fifteen to eighteen years old. The trees were di-      vided into groups of four trees each and each group was treated as a separate unit.  Group i was sprayed four times dur¬ ing the season. The first application was made on March 23, spraying directly into the bloom. A second spraying was made April 21. The 3-3-50 Bordeaux Mixture was used in the first two sprayings. A third spraying was made on May 21, and a fourth on June 22, using the 4-4-50 Bordeaux formula, in the last two appli¬ cations. The first part of August the fruits on these trees were examined and checked over for Black Spot and Blotch. Only 1.6% of the fruit from trees in this group showed slight attacks of these dis¬ eases. The infected fruits were found mainly in the tops of the trees and prob¬ ably were not thoroughly covered with the spray material. A striking illustra¬ tion of the effectiveness of Bordeaux Mixture in controlling these diseases was brought out by a single tree in this group. This tree had been observed for two or three seasons past and the fruit at ma¬ turity was always badly affected by Blotch and Black Spot. This season at the end of the experiment the tree was carefully examined and the fruits checked over, but not a single fruit was found that showed any indications of Black Spot or Blotch. The previous year fully 90% of the fruits on this tree were more or less spotted.  Group 2 received three applications of Bordeaux Mixture during the season. The first two applications were made with 3-3-50 Bordeaux, and in the third the 4-4-50 formula was used. These trees were sprayed first in the bloom,   March 23, again on April 21 and the last application was made on May 21. On the first of August when the fruits were ex¬ amined 5% were found to be slightly af¬ fected with Black Spot and Blotch. The slight increase in the percentage of in¬ fected fruits in this case over those in groups 1 and 3 is probably due to failure to thoroughly cover the fruits with the spray solution.  Group 3 was sprayed only twice during the season with the 3-3-50 Bordeaux Mixture. The first application was made March 23 into the bloom, and the second on April 21; 1.2% of infected fruits were found on the trees in this group when the fruits were checked over the first of Au¬ gust.  In the following three groups the bloom spray was omitted and the first ap¬ plication was made after the fruit had set and the bloom had all disappeared.  Group 4 was sprayed three times dur¬ ing the season. The first application was made April 21, using 3-3-50 Bordeaux Mixture. A second application was made May 21 and a third on June 22. The 4-4-50 Bordeaux Mixture was used in the last two applications; 2.6% of the fruit on these trees showed slight infections of Black Spot and Blotch on August 1st.  Group 5 was sprayed twice during the season. First on April 21 with 3-3-50 Bordeaux and again on May 21 with 4-4- 50 Bordeaux Mixture; 2.6% of the fruit of these trees showed slight infections of Black Spot and Blotch.  Group 6 was sprayed only once during the season. An application of 3-3-50 Bordeaux Mixture was made on April      21; 18.8% of the fruit on these trees were found to be affected with Black Spot and Blotch on August ist.  Group 7 was sprayed twice during the season with 4-4-50 Bordeaux Mixture. The first application was made May 21 and the second on June 22. Sixty per cent of the fruit on these trees were found to be badly affected with Black Spot and Blotch on August ist.  Group 8 was sprayed only once during the season with 4-4-50 Bordeaux. This application was made on May 21. On August ist when the fruits were exam- ined, 97% were found to be affected with Black Spot and Blotch.  Group 9 was not sprayed during the season and served as a check. The fruits were examined on August 1st and 84% were found to be affected with Black Spot and Blotch. Why the unsprayed trees should show less spotting than the trees in group 8, which was sprayed once, can probably be explained by the fact that two trees in this group showed a marked de¬ gree of resistance to these diseases.  In summarizing the results it will be noted that sprayings made in April and May were more effective in reducing the amount of Black Spot and Blotch. Where the April spraying was omitted the disease showed an increase following two applications of Bordeaux Mixture.  For the control of Black Spot and Blotch the bloom spray hardly seems nec¬ essary. It appears to me that these dis¬ eases can be controlled by two timely ap¬ plications of Bordeaux Mixture, or three at most. The first spraying need not be made until the fruit is well set, probably   two or three weeks after the bloom has disappeared. A second spraying should follow three weeks to one month later and possibly a third spraying three weeks to one month after the second. I would advise the use of 4-4-50 Bordeaux Mix¬ ture which should be made of fresh stone lime rather than hydrated lime.  The above experiment will bear repeat¬ ing and should be carried through a few more seasons before final conclusions might be drawn, but from the results ob¬ tained it seems to me that spotting of the Avocado fruit can be easily taken care of by timely and efficient sprayings. The lime sulphur solutions might work equal¬ ly as well as the Bordeaux Mixture and they should be tried out along the same lines. I can see no serious objection at the present time, however, to the use of Bordeaux on the Avocado tree.  A similar spraying experiment for the control of Avocado Scab was carried along with the sprayings for Black Spot and Blotch. In each case the sprayings were made on the same dates and the same solutions were used. The scab spraying experiment, however, was con¬ ducted in a different grove. The trees were of the Trapp variety and were in their second or third year of bearing. Eight blocks of trees were set apart for this experiment.  Block 1 of ten trees was sprayed once during the season. An application of 3-3-50 Bordeaux was sprayed directly into the bloom on March 23. The fruits were examined on August ist and 25% of the fruit on these trees showed slight scab infections.      Block 2 of ten trees was sprayed twice during the season with 3-3-50 Bordeaux. The first application was made on March 23 into the bloom and the second applica¬ tion on April 21. Six per cent of scab in¬ fected fruits were found on the trees in this block when the fruits were examined in August.  Block 3 of ten trees was sprayed three times. The first application was made on March 23 into the bloom and a second application on April 21. 3-3-50 Bor¬  deaux was used in these two applications. A third application of 4-4-50 Bordeaux was made on May 21. The fruits on this . block showed 9% of scab infection.  Block 4 of 15 trees received four spray¬ ings during the season. The first two ap¬ plications were made with 3-3-50 Bor¬ deaux Mixture and the 4-4-50 formula was applied in the last two applications. The trees were sprayed first into the bloom March 23. A second spraying was made April 21, a third on May 21 and the fourth on June 22. Four per cent of scab infected fruits were noted on the trees in this block.  Block 5 of five trees was sprayed three times. The first application was made on April 21, after the bloom had disappeared and the fruit had set. The second appli¬ cation was made May 21 and the third on June 22. 3-3-50 Bordeaux was applied  in the first spraying and the 4-4-50 form¬ ula in the last two. Nine per cent of scab infected fruits were found on this block. Through a mistake four of the five trees in this block were sprayed into the bloom during the March spraying and this prob¬   ably accounts for the low percentage of scab noted.  Block 6 of five trees was sprayed twice. An application of 3-3-50 Bordeaux was made on April 21, after the fruit had set. A second spraying was made on May 21 with 4-4-50 Bordeaux. Twenty per cent of the fruit on the trees in this block showed scab infections.  Block 7 of five trees was sprayed once. An application of 3-3-50 Bordeaux was made on April 21. Sixty-three per cent of the fruit on the trees in this block showed scab infections.  Block 8 of 12 trees was reseryed as a check and received no spraying during the season. Ninety-two per cent of the fruit on these trees were affected with scab and in a majority of cases the fruit was badly affected.  With the exception of block 7 all of the sprayings made in this experiment materially reduced the percentage of scab. I believe, however, that a convenient and effective spray schedule can be made up for the control of Avocado scab which need not include more than three applica¬ tions of Bordeaux. The bloom spray seems to be essential and should not be omitted. In making such a schedule I would suggest that the first application be made into the bloom during the latter part of the bloom period. A second ap¬ plication should follow in three weeks to one month later and a third application in three weeks after the second. The 3-3-50 Bordeaux will be of sufficient strength to control attacks of scab on the fruit.@@   
 Behavior of the Guatemalan Avocado and the Chinese Mango in South Florida@@   Edward Simmonds@@ Plant Introduction Garden, U. S. D. A., Miami@@   In 1906 the Department of Agriculture introduced into Florida several Avocado seedlings of the Guatemalan type. Some of these were planted at the Miami gar¬ den amongst South American and Mex¬ ican types. In 1911 some of these fruit¬ ed. Fortunately some of the seed were saved and planted; however, at that time there was very little interest taken in this type. The Trapp Avocado was planted extensively until the freeze of February, 1917, when it became apparent hardier types were necessary.  Attention was then directed to these Guatemalan seedlings, some of which had fruited and were thought to be hybrids probably crossed with the South Amer¬ ican and Mexican types. The seedlings originating here will probably prove to be well adapted and represent a new type well suited to this section. Observations so far show their foliage, pollen and fruit suited to the climatic conditions here. One plant grown from a seed of the Winslow Avocado and fruited out by Prof. P. H. Rolfs, is already being plant¬ ed. This is a free grower and so far fruits well.  The collection recently secured in Gua¬ temala through the Department of Ag¬ riculture represent the best types to be   found there. These are established and some seem well adapted as to growth. Some of them grow well on South Amer¬ ican stock and very poor on Guatemala; some do well on both, and some will not grow 011 either.  The Guatemalan race on its own stock appears so far to be ten days or two weeks later than the South American type in coming into growth in the Spring. It is generally observed at this time, the Guatemala will go very dormant in the winter. Trouble has been experienced in trying to run buds in the winter time.  A large number of Guatemalan varie¬ ties have been worked on their own type of stock at the U. S. Plant Introduction Field Station, near Buena Vista. Some are now in fruit and the next cold wave should prove if this is the proper stock for this race. Of course it must be re¬ membered that these stocks coming from fruits raised in the old garden on Brickell avenue are probably hybrids. Some of these hybrids with their unusual vigor may prove better stocks even than pure Guatemalan or West Indian. With the interest the U. S. Department of Agricul¬ ture and the several responsible nurseries are taking in the Avocado culture, this fruit has a bright future.   76       With the resistance of the Chinese Mango blossom to the fungus trouble which sometimes occurs when these trees are in bloom and with the splendid growth being made on its own type of stock, it would seem that this type has a wonderful future for Florida. The early introduction in 1902 of S. P. I. 8701 un¬ der the name of Cambodiana, does not seem to have been planted extensively on its own type of stock, attention being dL rected at that time to the Mulgoba.  Later introductions in 1904 of S. P. I. 11645, which has been named .the Saigon and of which several seedlings have been planted at the Plant Introduction Field Station on Brickell avenue, Miami, have shown promise of being worthy of prop¬ agation. Seedlings of this strain planted ac the U. S. Plant Introduction Field Sta¬ tion, Buena Vista, Fla., in 1918, have made splendid growth on high pine sand.   It is interesting to note this type of Mango is well established in the Philip¬ pines under the name of Carabao, and in Mexico being called Manila. It seems to have become a favorite in all countries where it has been introduced; however, it has been learned that this type is not planted on its own stock on heavy clay soil in Cuba, but is generally budded on the East Indian stock. This would seem to indicate by its behavior here that this Mango prefers light well drained soil.  The fact that Florida climate suits the Mango from China should interest many in trying to get seedlings of this type es¬ tablished with a view of getting improved strains of this fruit. It is interesting that one of our leading growers have made a start with 400 seedlings of this Mango. It seems desirable at this time to develop this type, which may make Florida famous for this wonderful fruit.   
 Avocados in Polk County@@   L. D. Niles@@ Lucerne Park@@   The Avocado is undoubtedly the most promising fruit among those bidding for popular favor at the present time; it has overcome much skepticism and now ap¬ pears in varieties that can be grown throughout most of the citrus section.  It is difficult at present to define the exact climatic and soil conditions most favorable to the Avocado tree, as the dif¬ ferent races vary in their adaptability under local conditions.  Taking Polk County for our illustra¬ tion, it has been demonstrated that as a commercial proposition, the West Indian race which comes from the moist low¬ lands and sea coasts of tropical America is much more susceptible to frosts than either the Guatemalan, which comes from the highlands of southern Mexico and Guatemala, or the quite hardy Mexican from the table lands of central and north¬ ern Mexico.  It is true, however, that there are quite a number of old, large West Indian seed¬ ling trees in Polk County, some of which were injured only in 1895. There are two at Frostproof, and others near Win¬ ter Haven. One seedling in Polk County measures 12 feet in circumference at 12 inches from the ground and is well over 40 feet in height. All must admit that this is quite a sizeable tree. I estimate the tree to be 40 feet in height.   On March 26, 1921, the tree was near¬ ly through blooming and the indications were for a very light crop; in fact it has always been a shy bearer. While this un¬ doubtedly proves that the West Indian will grow in this section we are satisfied the race is too tender for a commercial planting. However, when one takes into consideration the rapidity with which they renew their fruiting wood, it shows that if one takes the precaution to bank above the bud, even the tender varieties are practical for home orchard planting as they can renew their top and fruit again in two or three years.  Pollock and Trapp trees in our planting  at Lucerne Park are fully as large today  as before the cold of 1917, and some of  them matured fruit last year; proving  that they recuperate very quickly from «  cold injury. As the fruit is excellent and budded trees bear at an early age, a few of this race should by all means be plant¬ ed near the house for home use.  To illustrate the precocity of the Trapp variety, the following is a summary of tree performance records of some trees at Lucerne Park. This block of Trapps was planted in April, 1912, and this sum¬ mary shows the average yield per tree per year. In the year 1914 the average number of fruits per tree was 1.30; in 1915, 6.70; in 1916, 34.33. These trees   78       while injured in February, 1917, fruited again in 1920.  Concerning varieties, would say that after our experience with the West Indian race in 1917, as stated, we secured bud- wood of the best available varieties of the Guatemalan and Mexican races (includ¬ ing the Guatemalans introduced by Mr. Wilson Popenoe), with which we worked over most of our older Trapp and Pol¬ lock trees. We later planted a new test plat budded on three different stocks, giv¬ ing us a total of over forty different va¬ rieties in our groves. Of these some ten varieties fruited in 1920 and thirty-six are holding fruit at present. Some of the results noticed in this test planting which as stated includes trees budded on three different stocks—West Indian, Guatemalan and Mexican, are very inter¬ esting; and in the course of a few years should be of value in determining the va¬ riety and stock best suited for this sec¬ tion.  I wish to emphasize the fact that some of the Mexican race, including seedlings, while not of commercial value, are most excellent for home use, ripening in sum¬ mer and early fall, and being quite hardy, they are of great economic value.  This reminds me, everyone thinks of the Avocado as a salad fruit, but really, have you ever eaten an Avocado pie? Take a good Mexican fruit or fruits, ac¬ cording to the size pie you like, and tell the cook to make it like pumpkin or sweet potato pie. The combination is guaran¬ teed to make an Avocado enthusiast.  Speaking of some of the odd results noticed with these varieties, I would like   to tell you the history of one of our trees. During March, 1917, a Pollock tree (in¬ jured in February) sent up two sprouts from the root stock. During April I budded one sprout with Taft and the other with Fuerte buds. They both lived and looked so promising that the Pollock wood was removed. Both buds made good growth and are now some sixteen feet in height. While both buds are on the same root system, each year the Fuerte has bloomed during January, while the Taft, on same root, has never started new growth until in March. An¬ other point of interest is that the Fuerte bud matured fruit in 1919 and in 1920 and has a fair crop set this spring, while the Taft bud has not bloomed to date.  Regarding the hardiness of the differ¬ ent races and varieties, would say that we have both Mexican and Guatemalan vari¬ eties which withstood the cool spell of 1917, and are fruiting and growing very well today. Consequently exact data as to hardiness had best be left for a future report. At present there appears to be a marked difference in the first start of new growth and in blooming periods. This may be an important point to be taken into consideration later in connection with quality, quantity and favorable ri¬ pening season. The hardiness and vigor of the tree will be the important factors in choosing our most valuable varieties.  As previously stated, there are several stock experiments being conducted in this section which are showing some interest¬ ing phases. Personally, I believe the West Indian is one of the best and most vigorous growers on land which is suited      tc rough lemon stock. By banking above the bud it is undoubtedly sufficiently hardy. We have found a few instances where Guatemalan buds on this stock seem to make an imperfect union; prov¬ ing a point long suspected, namely, that we have still many things to learn con¬ cerning stock behavior.  So far the Mexican stock does not ap¬ pear suited to this section, because as a rule the bud makes slow growth. Some may think there is contradiction in this statement as many Mexican seedlings here are very vigorous growers and bear heavily. It is, however, a well known horticultural fact that seedling trees, un¬ der favorable conditions, will usually make a strong growth. But this is by no means proof that buds from an appar¬ ently vigorous seedling will make satis¬ factory trees when propagated.  In connection with the question of stock there is one point which I deem of the utmost importance. Do not allow the tap root of the stock tree to become in¬ jured by being kept in a box or pot which will prevent the tap root from going where nature intended, namely, straight down towards a water supply. I consider this the greatest cause of failures with Avocados. Germinate the seed in a 5x5xi2-inch box; and then transplant when the tree is some eight inches high. The tap root will be longer if you plant it where you want your future tree to grow and bud later. Handled in this manner your tree will prove more vigor¬ ous, withstand drought and winds and grow better than any root-bound tree can possibly do.   I realize this statement is treading very near some nurserymen’s toes, but I wish to modify somewhat by saying that I re¬ fer to grove planting more particularly than to trees in small numbers for home grounds, unless one is able to bud them himself. Comparatively few have the tree knowledge to successfully bud Avo¬ cados, but for large plantings where best results are wanted the above method is entirely practical.  Would say in this connection that I have an Avocado planting where this method has been tried out and the trees show for themselves. When planted this way the tree will put down a deep tap root, the result being that it will with¬ stand climatic changes much better than if shallow rooted. At first thought this method of developing groves seems more expensive than if handled in nursery rows, but it is more than offset by avoid¬ ing the shipping and handling of nursery trees later. Therefore I am confident groves could be developed by this method ar less cost and ultimately have better and more uniform trees, for the tree is the thing we want. If you don’t like its fruit, the tree, being vigorous can be top- worked to any desired variety and will be quite sure to fruit in two or three years.  In addition to the plantings referred to there are a number of commercial size in this section, perhaps the largest acreages being owned by Mr. M. E. Gillett at Eloise, Mr. Mackay at Lake Alfred, Mr. W. D. Carrier at Crooked Lake, and oth¬ ers, totaling perhaps ioo acres.  In cultivation, one of two methods should be followed. Either keep a dust      mulch from the day the tree is planted which will force a deeper root system; or use a mulch of organic matter such as leaves, compost, etc. This will bring feeding roots to the surface, and the dan¬ ger is that, in a dry spell, unless mulch is very heavy, trees will soon show bad effects from lack of moisture. However, in well drained land, for the first two years after planting, an Avocado tree should have water in anticipation of its wants.  In propagating it would perhaps show wisdom to engage some one who has dem¬ onstrated his ability along this line (but perhaps you desire to do this part your¬ self), very well. Make sure your stock is in thrifty, vigorous condition; do not allow the stock to become too large and the bark to harden before budding, as under such conditions failure is almost certain. With the stock in proper shape, select bud wood from the last growth (va¬ rieties differ, but usually best results are obtanied from fairly mature wood), just before it is ready to start a new growth.  The actual manual performance of budding should be similar to shield bud¬ ding of the citrus, either in form of a T or an inverted T. Personally I use the T, believing it will form a union nearer the ground. The bud being carefully placed in position, should be at once tight¬ ly wrapped with a strip of waxed cloth, covering the entire bud except the eye. Be sure and fasten the end of the cloth, as it is necessary to keep the bud wrapped for a longer length of time than with cit¬   rus. After wrapping, judgment must be used to determine whether the stock plant needs the growth slightly checked by cut¬ ting away, say two or three leaves near the top of plant. This depends somewhat on whether propagation is in the open or under half shade.  Two weeks after the buds are inserted, depending somewhat on weather condi¬ tions, look them over carefully and if the bud is alive, cut off three or four inches of the tip of stock. In another ten days if found alive, judgment must be used in removing axillary buds from the stock, or perhaps taking out a half inch section of bark from the stock about one inch di¬ rectly above the bud. This will usually force the bud into growth, at which time the waxed cloth must be loosened above the eye of bud; but do not fully remove budding cloth until growth is well started. A point to remember is, if stock growth is checked too heavily, the eye is almost sure to fall from the bud and all your la¬ bor is' lost. After the bud has made its first growth and the wood is maturing, the stock should be cut back further, tying bud to stem of seedling and remov¬ ing sprouts, thus forcing all growth to the bud. While dormant during the fol¬ lowing winter, stake the bud and remove the seedling stub, covering the cut sur¬ face with grafting wax.  In conclusion would suggest that every¬ one in the citrus section should plant Avocado trees of each of the three races for home use at least; someone sometime will thank you for doing so.@@   
 Avocado Culture in South Dade County@@   E. R. Goldberg@@ Redlands@@   A great deal has been said about the Avocado and its culture in different parts of the State, as to climatic and soil con¬ ditions, and as to type and-variety of this fruit.  Avocado culture has been growing in leaps and bounds for the past four years in Dade County, and has been retarded only through the shortage of nursery stock available for planting. Hundreds of acres of Avocados would have been planted if trees had been obtainable. I know of cases where trees were ordered one year in advance in order to get the desired variety. The reason for this, I believe, is a shortage of bud-wood for nursery work. Fruiting of different types and varieties of the Avocado has been carried on by the nurseryman only, so that when a certain variety was found worthy of propagation, the source of bud-wood was very much limited. I hope the time is not far distant when the in¬ dividual grower will take it upon himself to be of some help along this line, and plant a few seeds of the different races and varieties. In this way he is not only helping the industry in which he is actu¬ ally engaged, but will be helping himself financially.  Avocado growing in Dade County, from the growers point of view, is indeed a promising one. In making this state¬   ment, I do not wish to infer, that we do not have our troubles in propagating this :fruit. This, however, is only a natural condition and is one that confronts the grower of all fruits and vegetables.  I am going to give you a few facts taken from experience and observation during the past six years as a grower of this fruit. In doing this I shall confine myself to the district with which I am familiar—South Dade County.  The first question for the Avocado grower to solve is the land on which to make his planting. I would consider any land that is not subject to overflow, or land upon which water does not stand for more than two or three days at a time, as good Avocado ground. The Avocado is a gross consumer of this liquid, but also appreciates a happy medium. I have seen many Avocados destroyed in a very short time from stagnant water around the crown roots of the tree, and I would therefore regard land of this type with suspicion.  The type of land with which we have to deal in South Dade County, is of cor- aline origin, the rock coming to the sur¬ face and intermingling with a red clay soil. This soil is very shallow, which necessitates a preparation of the land prior to planting, for good results. This can best be done by scarifying to a depth   82       of not less than six inches. Where this method has been tried out it has given ex¬ cellent results. The majority of the older plantings of Avocados in this section did not have any preparation of the land prior to planting. In a good many cases the tree stumps were not removed, and has proven to be a sad mistake and should not be repeated. Where no preparation of the land was made as stated above, the grower worked out a system of breaking the coraline rock from two to six feet around each individual tree during each year until the entire tract has been brok¬ en up. If this work is done in time, or in other words, if the root system has not been retarded to any great extent, the results obtained are very satisfactory.  The distance of planting the Avocado in grove form, should be given consider¬ able thought, as in after years one may wonder just why he left so little room around his trees, in which to do the spraying, fertilizing and the harvesting of his crops. I would not think of planting any trees less than twenty-five feet in the row, and the rows the same distance apart, unless it was the kumquat. As the trees increase in size from year to year, one will find it very convenient to be able to drive down the middle of the rows without coming in contact with the branches of the trees.  Selection of the race and variety of trees that are to be planted is a question that is somewhat trying and often proves to be very expensive to the grower. A profitable planting will consist of trees that will fruit during different months of the year. The reason for this is plain when you consider that about 90% of the   Avocados grown in this section today are fruiting during the months of August, September, October and November.  We have two distinct races—West In¬ dian and Guatemalan—from which to make selections as to variety. The West Indian race has been extensively planted in this county, and has been used as stock in the propagation of the Guatemalan va¬ rieties. The Guatemalan race of Avo¬ cados has proven to be more hardy than the West Indian, and no doubt will be used as stock in nursery work, if the sup¬ ply ever exceeds the demand. But with Guatemalan Avocados selling from five to ten dollars per dozen, I see no relief in sight for some time to come, in order to use this race for nursery stock.  In making your selection of the vari¬ eties you intend planting it would be well to know if they are climatically suited to your location. This is particularly true of the Guatemalan race, as they come to us from their native home, from far above sea level. Mr. Wilson Popenoe, of the Department of Agriculture, tells us that he had found Avocados growing at an al¬ titude of 8.500 feet. With this informa¬ tion I am not at all surprised at the be¬ havior of some of these varieties when planted a few feet above sea level.  I hope that sometime in the near fu¬ ture the Avocado growers will get to¬ gether and select a standard as to variety and to season of fruiting. This should be done for the benefit of the present grower, and more so for those who expect to embark in this enterprise.  The following varieties of Avocados have done exceptionally well in this sec-      tion, and I will class them as to season of maturity and race:  Pollock .—This is our summer fruit, maturing during the months of August and September, and is of very good qual¬ ity. It is a large fruit weighing from two to three pounds, and is as a rule a shy bearer. This characteristic seems to ap¬ ply pretty much to all varieties bearing large fruits. The tree is a vigorous grower, and of West Indian race. It has netted the grower some very good returns during the last two years.  Trapp .—This variety has been grown extensively in Dade County, for a good many years, and has been a profitable in¬ vestment for the grower. Trapp is of West Indian race and is a fair grower and fruiter. We have found that this variety is not an even fruiter, being in¬ clined to put on more fruit than it is able to take care of, and at the same time put on new wood for the next season’s crop. This is indeed an objectionable feature, as the tree is very often completely defo¬ liated, leaving no protection to the branches from the direct rays of the sun, and the result is a stunted tree, which takes as a rule a year or more to over¬ come, and of course the loss of the crop on such trees for that year. I have seen Trapps bear themselves to death during the first two or three years after planting. This can be overcome by thinning out the fruit each season until the tree is strong enough to carry its crop. But you will find that the average grower will not carry this out, as it is like pulling teeth to throw good Avocados on the ground. This variety is also very much affected by Avocado scab. I will not take up time   on this subject, as I think this will be brought out by other members on the program, but would like to say that if you insist on planting Trapps in South Dade County, I would advise that you place your order for a power sprayer at the same time, as you will find it impos¬ sible to produce marketable fruit without a system of spraying. I have also found that this variety has a small per cent of loose seeded fruit, the extent of which varies from year to year. This feature is not a desirable one, because the con¬ stant shifting of the seed in its cavity is no doubt responsible for the large per¬ centage of decay which occurs while en- route to extreme northern markets.  Waldin .—The Waldin is a variety of the West Indian race, which was orig¬ inated in Homestead, Fla., by Mr. B. A. Waldin and has a very promising future. This is a holiday fruit coming to maturity in November to January. It is a very good grower, and of good quality. The shape is oval, and is of good marketable size, having a tight seed and a tough skin. The tree seems to be more hardy than most of the West Indian race. During the cold winter of 1917 and 1918 this variety did not show any bad effects from the cold, while other trees of the same race (West Indian) adjoining the Wal¬ din were badly frosted. Waldin is a good fruiter, coming into bearing at an early age. I consider this variety as one of our future leaders.  Taft .—The Taft belongs to the Guate¬ malan race, and it has been very much of a surprise to the growers of this section. It is a vigorous grower, making a very symmetrical tree. It is inclined to bush   8      rather than grow tall, as do most varie- ties of this type. Taft is a good fruiter, distributing its crop well throughout the tree. It is of good flavor and size, aver¬ aging in weight about one pound. It has a tough thick skin which will stand con¬ siderable rough handling, making it an exceptionally good shipper. Season Feb¬ ruary and March.  The Taft has been regarded with sus¬ picion for various reasons, and in some sections I believe they have been well founded. The variety is a very poor grower in the northern part of this coun¬ ty, while with us it is the best grower we have. Taft does not come into maturity at an early age, usually the fourth year after planting. I am satisfied that this variety will be one of our standards.  Taylor .—This variety originated in Miami, from a seed that was produced in California. It is of Guatemalan race, and one of the best fruiters we have. While the fruit is rather small in size, I think its season of maturity—January to March—• will more than off-set the disadvantage. The quality is not of the best, but fruit¬ ing at a season when Avocados are scarce, this variety will bring good re¬ turns to the grower for many years to come. The tree is a strong vigorous grower, having a tendency to shoot straight up as do the seedling varieties. The fruit has a small tight seed, and a thick skin.  Taylor trees planted in this section dur¬ ing the past three years have done excep¬ tionally well, and I would certainly con¬ sider this variety in making a commer¬ cial planting of the Avocado.   Wagner .—This variety comes to us from California, and was produced from the same tree that gave us Taylor, being of Guatemalan race. Wagner and Taylor are identical in growth and foliage, while the fruit of these two varieties would hardly reveal their close relationship. Wagner fruit is almost round, and is much larger, weighing from 18 to 24 ounces. It is of good quality and fla¬ vor. This variety like Taylor, is an early and exceptionally good fruiter. I have seen Wagner grafts 14 months old, that were put into an old seedling stump, set a crop of fruit that would do justice to a three-year-old tree of ordinary fruiting qualities. Season of Wagner is January to March. This variety has not been planted to any extent in this section, be¬ ing a recent introduction and having been fruited by Mr. W. J. Krome of Home¬ stead, during the last three years. The color of Wagner is green with a thick brittle skin. Wagner has a good future as a commercial variety.  The above races and varieties of the Avocado are those found in grove form, and have been fruited sufficiently to de¬ termine their commercial value. There are a great many other varieties being tested each year, and as the list grows, we find the selection of a variety more difficult.  In setting the Avocado in this section, I have found that placing one-half stick of 40% dynamite in the center of each hole, at a depth of 15 inches, is of much benefit during our dry season. In using this system I would suggest that the hole be filled with small rock and then filled in with soil. In doing this your tree will      not settle below the surface and leave a pocket in which water would stand dur¬ ing the rainy season. I am a great be¬ liever in drainage for the crown roots of all trees, which necessitates the setting of your tree, from three to four inches above the level of the ground.  Fertilizing the Avocado is a problem to which many growers have given but little thought, and the results obtained have been very unsatisfactory. The Avo¬ cado is a gross feeder, and to do well must be kept in good condition at all times. I know of no tree that responds to good care as does the Avocado; on the other hand, you will find a neglected tree is very much a burden.  The source of plant food best suited to the Avocado is still a question in the minds of some growers. Personally, I prefer the organic mixtures, and have used these with very good results. I have seen Avocado trees upon which plant food from chemical sources was used, de¬ stroyed during the rainy season in this section. Avocados in the same district and at practically the same elevation upon which the organic mixtures had been used   for several years, came through without the loss of a single tree. I am not pre¬ pared to say as to what caused the dam¬ age in the grove where chemical sources of plant food were applied, but I will say, that it looks somewhat suspicious.  In fertilizing the Avocado, I have found that three applications a year, of two pounds each, and two pounds added for each year to each application, will keep your trees in good fruiting condi¬ tion. The mistake is very often made in fertilizing the Avocado as to size; if you expect to have a planting of even stand and size, I would advise giving the small tree just as much plant food as the larger one, providing it be of the same age.  Mulching the Avocado has been prac¬ ticed here to some extent, but should not be overdone. Trees that have a heavy mulch the entire year, are inclined to send their feeder roots into this, and as the mulching decays forming humus, it set¬ tles leaving these roots exposed. A light application of mulching is very beneficial, but strike the happy medium, as near as you can, for best results.@@   
 The Avocado and Mango on the Sand Lands of Palm Beach and St. Lucie Counties@@   John B. Beach@@ West Palm Beach@@   Mango and Avocado trees seem to thrive well on the sandy soils along the coast in Palm Beach and St. Lucie coun¬ ties, as evidenced by many old Avocado trees six to eight feet in circumference, and 40 to 50 feet in height, and by Man¬ gos less lofty, but running larger in girth.  The soils, where almost all of these old trees are found, are classified by the U. S. Soil Survey as various grades of St. Lucie sand, Palm Beach sand, and Gainesville sand. Nine-tenths of them are on the former, owing mainly to the fact that this alone has proven suitable for pineapple growing, and this was for many years the only form of agriculture in this region; all the dooryard trees were planted in it. The Palm Beach sand em¬ braces what is locally known as “beach hammock,” and lies on the ocean side. It consists of a good percentage of calcar¬ eous material, largely organic, with hu¬ mus, mingled with silicious sand. The Gainesville sand is confined in this sec¬ tion to the so-called “red hammock,” un¬ derlaid with rock, only occurring on the eastern shores of Lake Worth and Jupiter Island.  On Palm Beach sand the Mango does not seem to thrive so well, bears poorly, and is often troubled with a fungus   blight. Avocados, however, thrive, and make huge, productive trees. Where found on the Gainesville sand, both trees seem vigorous and productive, although there is sometimes a tendency to blight among the Mangos. Of the St. Lucie sand areas, that described as the “yellow sub-soil phase,” where yellow or orange sub-soil appears near the surface, is the best for both trees, as is the case with al¬ most anything else planted, either trees, pineapples or vegetables. However, lit¬ tle of the famous Pineapple Ridge in St. Lucie county has this sub-soil.  The other determining factor is the humus content. St. Lucie sand is de¬ scribed as pure silica, with nothing else but humus. In the absence of the yellow sub-soil phase, all depends on the per¬ centage of humus. Hundreds of acres of old pineapple fields, which have been abandoned to grow up in Natal grass and weeds, and which we all hope will some day recover their former productiveness, are at present useless as well as unsightly, and all would be glad to see them produc¬ ing Avocados. Mangos are easier start¬ ed, and require very little fertilizer, but not being such money-makers, few care to plant them. We know from the big, old, bearing Avocado trees of the door-      yard plantings of the past 25 to 30 years, that the land will grow them, but it is a question of getting them started. I have talked with a number of people who have been trying this, and it is apparently mainly a matter of water. After the seo ond summer they are sufficiently estab¬ lished to stand any ordinary drouth with¬ out need of watering, but faithful water¬ ing is required to bring them to this con¬ dition. Planting in a basin 12 to 18 inches deep, and at the same time mulch¬ ing very heavily, seems to be of much as¬ sistance; and shading with slatted lath frames, with the top covered over with burlap, seems to be well worth the cost involved. This frame may be covered with old sacks, temporarily, if a frost is threatened during the first winter.  Planting the young trees in a young pineapple field, simultaneously with the pineapples, is a splendid plan, and works out beautifully, as has been often dem¬ onstrated with citrus trees also. Carroll Dunscombe, at Stuart, has some Trapp trees which were planted seven years ago in common St. Lucie sand (which is now well supplied with humus) among a field of young pineapples. They look as well as any trees of their age that I have seen anywhere in Florida, outside of custard- apple hammock. He reports them to be very productive, and they appeared to be setting a good crop when I saw them a few weeks ago. He is so well pleased that he plans to plant 50 to 100 acres this year, provided he can get the slips and trees.  In planting out old pineapple fields, it is often an open question as to whether it will pay. If you cannot plant out pine¬   apples at the same time to help pay ex¬ penses, and provide the surplus fertilizer needed, it may still be worth the trouble and cost to get something growing on the old unsightly field. Avocado trees stand more cold than pineapples, and even if we did not have the old trees to prove it, we could safely assume that fields that had produced pineapple crops successfully would serve to support an Avocado grove, without danger of loss from that factor. L. C. Harbrecht on the north bank of the St. Lucie at Rio, has some very promising Avocado trees, mainly Trapps with a few Guatemalans, which he has successfully brought to the bearing stage, upon one of the highest, sandiest old pineapple fields to be found any¬ where. He prefers Solano among the Guatemalans.  Water seems the great factor on these sandy ridges. At the residence of the late John Sorensen of Jensen, there is a row of seedling Avocado trees, planted many years ago, as evidenced by their size. One stands close by the well, and rises to the full altitude of the 50-foot windmill tower, and is easily 50% bigger than the one which comes next to it, and is 20 or 30 feet farther from the well. This ap¬ parently tells its own story.  In a grove I am planting a mile west of the shores of Lake Worth on “fine St. Lucie sand, yellow sub-soil phase” (as described by the U. S. Soil Survey), I have this clearly demonstrated. It is an old abandoned orange grove, which was destroyed by fire some years ago, and has been cleared 18 or 20 years, and until I acquired it recently, had been swept pret¬ ty regularly by fire every year. One tree,      close to the negro cabin where the family washing is done, is now three times as large as any of the rest, all having had equal advantages of water and fertilizer, aside from the weekly wash water.  Avocado planting on the flatwoods west of the coastal ridge is of course in its infancy, owing to the fact that little of it has been drained even four or five years, and little of that has been drained per¬ fectly for that length of time. However, it looks very promising, so far as we have seen, not only for Avocados, but citrus stock as well. There were 50 Avocado seedlings planted four miles west of here   (Weot Palm Beach) about eight years ago. They were planted on ridges to keep them out of the water, and have been subjected to frequent inundations at intervals ever since. When about three years of age we had a 15-inch rainfall in 24 hours about August 1st, and water stood within a foot of the top of the ridges for two weeks. This only killed four out of the original fifty, and the others are alive today, and as thrifty and productive as could be expected of trees that have never been properly fertilized or cared for.@@   
 Shipping and Marketing the Avocado@@   Hamilton Michelson@@ Miami@@   Before proceeding with my subject I wish to state my pleasure in being asso¬ ciated with the Florida State Horticul¬ tural Society. Last evening was my first opportunity of attending such a meeting and I wish to state that the discussions presented, represented to my mind no lit¬ tle food for thought. This formation of thought will produce but one result, and that is a crystalization of the thought formed, and the Horticultural Society de¬ serves the strongest support from every community in the State. The subject which has been assigned me—The Ship¬ ping and Marketing of Avocados—is of interest to the entire State and especially to Dade county, where the fruit grows to perfection in size and flavor.  The value of the Avocado as a food is equal to that of meat or milk, as the bet¬ ter varieties contain about 20% of vege¬ table fat; and the most delicate person can partake of them with relish. How¬ ever, in the North, the Avocado is eaten mostly by the well-to-do classes as its scarcity puts it in the class with luxuries.  Owing to the peculiar nutty flavor the average person does not take to it readily. The taste must be acquired. This ac¬ counts to a large degree for the difficulty in marketing large quantities of the fruit. At the present time a hundred carloads of grapefruit and oranges can be sold   where one single crate of Avocados can be disposed of.  We who know the value of the Avo¬ cado, feel that it is but a matter of time when the fruit will be as popular, and in as great demand, as the citrus fruit. Sys¬ tematic advertising is all that is required. This systematic advertising has long since been acknowledged as the making of any article of value. Take the concerted ad¬ vertising of the California raisins/ A few years ago it was impossible to find a market for the small quantities produced; now, after a few years of advertising, all the wine grape vineyards are being con¬ verted into vineyards of raisin grapes. Hammer it home, as it were, and your task is accomplished. This same condi¬ tion existed with the California walnuts. The Avocado is just as nourishing and very much easier digested than either the raisin or nut and is extremely appetizing.  Speaking of appetizing brings to mind an experience which I had some years ago when a brother visited me from Cal¬ ifornia. After giving him a sample of the fruit he replied to my inquiry as to how he liked it: “Well, to be perfectly frank with you, I never tasted anything that resembled Octagon soap more than does this fruit.” He further remarked, “I would not give you a dollar for all the Avocados in Dade county.” Now he has   90       me ship them across the Continent to him. We hope the day is not far distant when the Avocados will be taken out of the lux¬ ury class and be regarded as a staple, throughout this country as it is in the tropics.  The methods of handling the Avocado are of great importance on account of the extreme delicacy and perishable nature of the fruit. In our early days, dating back to 1911 when the industry was in its in¬ fancy, we used a long bamboo pole with a hook on the end to pull the fruit from the brittle limbs which could not be reached with the hand. Some of our seed¬ ling varieties tower twenty-five to thirty- five feet in height and the use of a lad¬ der against the brittle limbs is out of the question. So one man would pull the fruit with a long pole and hook while an¬ other would watch his chance as the one, two or three-pound Avocado gained mo¬ mentum on a direct downward line to¬ wards him, allowing it, not infrequently to slip through his hands on to the ground and breaking into a dozen pieces or more, and occasionally to drop on top of his head. Now a small canvas bag is at¬ tached to the hook at the end of the bam¬ boo pole and the greatest of care is taken in their gathering. Only the perfect fruit, free from all blemishes, is shipped lo the fancy trade. All scarred and blem¬ ished fruit is shipped to a cull market.  By so watching and carefully grading our fruit, the little business of 1911 has grown to a point where it now handles about 70% of the entire production of Dade county. Shipments are selected carefully as many of the varieties do not carry well; some become soft in twenty-   four hours while others hold up six or eight days. Those varieties that soften quickly are always sorted out and shipped to nearby markets, while the firmer ones are used for the distant markets.  Three styles of packages are used by our concern in making shipments. The one which is considered the standard crate contains about forty pounds of fruit net weight. This package is used more extensively than any other style of crate as it is recognized by the express company as the standard. The next style is the flat crate carrying about half the contents of the standard crate. For some years this flat crate, carrying one layer of fruit, was used in making long distance ship¬ ments such as across the Mojave Desert to the Pacific Coast with a great deal of success. As the war came on we were forced to abandon this flat ventilated crate, and after considerable experiment¬ ing, we invented a very inexpensive pony refrigerator which could be discarded at the receiving end owing to its cheapness of construction. We found this mode of transportation very successful as the ex¬ press company was then delivering ship¬ ments of ventilated crates in a worthless condition on account of arriving long over-due. This refrigerator, which has its iced compartment immediately over the fruit, saved the day. No matter whether it was on the road ten or twenty days, as long as the crate was properly re¬ iced, it carried the fruit in perfect con¬ dition. We are now using this style of package in all of our shipments except the immediate South.  Perhaps the greatest difficulty we have to contend with is the importation of Cu-      ban and other foreign Avocados, which are dumped on our markets. Cuba makes no attempt to grade or cull her fruit, nor do we get much protection against the poor quality of fruit which is shipped into our large consuming markets from that country. I know it to be a fact that many of the Avocados that are shipped in here from Cuba are carried in bags, thrown over a horse’s back, for a distance of many miles before the already bruised fruit is crated for shipment into the States. When we get protective tariff against this foreign fruit our markets will handle all the fruit that is now being grown, if properly distributed.  In addition to the foreign shipments that flood our leading markets, some of our good growers make bad conditions worse by shipping indiscriminately on consignment. To my mind the consign¬ ment of perishables is not the proper method of marketing them. Would a shoe merchant consign his products to some distant points to be sold for his ac¬ count? Do the California raisin growers ship their products to be sold for what¬   ever the market will bring? Or do the nut growers of California ship in this manner? No. Are the tomato growers of Dade county shipping on consignment today? Very few. Why? Because they are being properly distributed and with such equal distribution that the demand holds up.  Just so is our method of marketing the Avocados. We buy and sell upon a plain business basis and never in our ten years of Avocado business have we con¬ signed a crate of Avocados, except culls, that we would not put into our printed wrappers, or an occasional extra crate when the pickers misjudged the amount required for the day’s orders and over¬ picked. We always try to pick the exact amount of fruit each day needed for shipment that day, whether it be fifty crates or five hundred crates. When markets are flooded with consigned fruit the tendency always is to bring the gen¬ eral price down to the level of the price brought by the surplus. Our motto is, “Create your market or sell to one who has created one. Never consign!”@@   
 Some Observations on Avocados in Custard  Apple Muck@@   H. O. Sebring@@ Sebring@@   In April, 1919, I paid my first visit to the territory lying on the south side of Lake Okeechobee, known as the Ritta sec¬ tion. The land is a rich custard ap¬ ple hammock soil, well drained, and has on it a growth of tall custard apple trees, or where these have blown down, a thick growth of elders. We found a hotel at the mouth of the Miami Canal, and from that point visited the section along the lake for a distance of ten or twelve miles, also Ritta Island.  At every home, we found a few Avo¬ cados ; seeds having been planted, and in every instance, they were growing fine, and some of the stories told us were un¬ believable. The oldest tree was on the Sewell place, having been planted in 1910, and at this time was about forty feet in height and eighteen inches in diameter at the base. None of the trees had had any fertilizer, and from appearances, they had had no care. On this immediate shore, there seemed to be no effect of the cold of 1917? as Royal Palms, Avocados, guavas, Australian pines, rubber trees and other tropical growths were doing fine.  We were unable to locate on this trip, any budded stock, and were disappoint¬ ed with the amount of fruit that had set on the seedling trees, but everyone told us   they had carried heavy crops the year be¬ fore.  Later, we made a trip to the plantation of Mr. Ed. Forbes on the north end of Ritta Island, and to the grove of T. D. Feister on Kramer Island. We found plantings of Trapps and Pollocks at these places. At that time they were very small, but at this time have attained a wonderful size for their age. The trees on the Forbes plantation, that are two and one-half years old are eight to nine feet in height and have set a crop of fruit of about a box to the tree. And the trees in the Feister grove, which were four years old last September, are eighteen and twenty feet high, and are carrying a crop of seven or eight boxes to the tree. The trees have been given no fertilizer.  Physical development in the Glades is in a pioneer stage. Transportation is very slow and uncertain. The cost of developing and handling fruit is high, but the prospects are bright, as a railroad is being constructed from Moore Haven to Sandy Point; there is talk of a bond issue of $350,000, for a good road from West Palm Beach to the south side of the lake and on towards Ft. Myers.  During the spring of 1920, we made some purchases at the Sewell plantation.      so that I have been back to this country almost every month since that time. All of the seedlings have produced heavy crops during the years. There is one large tree on the Sewell place that bore a crop of over seventeen hundred fruits, and the indications are that it will have a good crop this year.  I have discovered only one or two Avo¬ cado trees of the Guatemalan type in the Glades and they are only three or four years of age. These have produced the same amount of growth that the seedlings and West Indian varieties have. The Winslow variety bore a fair crop in 1920.  The custard apple soil seems to have all of the ingredients necessary for the raising of Avocados and producing good crops of fruit and all interested in the Avocado industry will watch this section closely, for as soon as transportation is improved, a heavy production of Avo¬ cados is bound to come from the south shore of Lake Okeechobee.  W. J. Krome: This concludes the pro¬ gram to be offered by the Committee on Avocados and Sub-tropical Fruits, and if there are any questions anyone would like to ask in regard to any of the papers that have been presented along the lines of Avocados or sub-tropical horticulture, the members of the committee will be glad to answer them before we adjourn.  Mrs.-: I would like to ask what  to do for the Avocados and Mangos drop¬ ping the small fruit.  W. J. Krome: We have had that trou¬ ble at various times in our groves and it   may result from several causes. A very heavy rain during the time that the bloom is open seems to result almost certainly in the dropping of fruit. The presence of either thrips or an infection of the an- thracnose fungus will have a similar re¬ sult. The thrip injury will quite fre¬ quently take place, throw off the bloom and in most cases the fruit will not actu¬ ally set. The dropping from the anthrac- nose fungus usually takes place about the time the fruit is the size of a bird’s egg and seems to be due to a weakening of the union between the stem and the branch upon which it is located. I think that there are several other reasons but those have come under my own observations. Possibly some member of the committee can more fully answer that question.  H. H. Hume: I might say in behalf of the Society that we appreciate very much the program on Avocados which these gentlemen have given us this after¬ noon. There is no question about the importance of this branch of horticulture in Florida. It is one of the coming things; it has been a long time coming because there have been a lot of difficul¬ ties and a lot of unknown things to be worked out but we are gradually getting around to it and I think before very many years we will have an Avocado industry in Florida that will be of first great im¬ portance in the horticulture of the State, and these men who are on this platform today are the men who are making it, are doing the work and Florida owes much to that type of pioneers in an actually new field so far as we are concerned.@@    
 The Improvement of Pineapple Soils@@   Alfred Warren,@@ Ft. Pierce@@   In the improvement of the soil for pineapple culture two things should be kept in mind; first, the addition of hu¬ mus, a very necessary part of any soil for any kind of plant production, and sec¬ ond, the control of the nematode.  Humus, although seemingly but scant¬ ily supplied on our ridge-land soils, even on the virgin land, still plays a greater part in the growing of the pineapple than most persons believe. It is the humus, though meager in quantity on our so- called typical pineapple lands as compared with that of the rich hammock lands, that gives stability to all productive soils and this applies equally well to our pineapple soils. It helps to retain the moisture, on the sandy pineapple lands, which is a very important feature; it absorbs and holds the fertilizer elements that are applied and releases them as the plant needs them; it furnishes food and a medium for the soil bacteria without which plants could make but little growth; and it improves the tilth allowing better aeration, bac¬ terial action, and other processes that go on in the soil for the good of plant growth. Humus then is one of the prime factors in restoring old pineapple fields or in retaining those that are still fairly productive.  Good illustrations of what the lack of humus does may be found in perhaps any   of the pineapple plantations. Parts of a field for some reason or other may lie fallow and scorch in the sun for a year or more, or a path or an alleyway after a few years’ of use may be planted to pines. Such plantings always stand out in glaring contrast to their surrounding plantings by their stunted growth, due to lack of humus and bacterial life.  Next in importance in the improvement of the soil comes the nematode control. The scientists, among whom may be men¬ tioned Dr. C. D. Sherbakoff and Messrs. J. R. Winston and H. R. Fulton, who have given the pineapple problem a great deal of thought and attention for the past number of years and who are still carry¬ ing on experiments in St. Lucie county, are still of the opinion that the nematode is one of the chief factors, if not the chief one, in bringing about the so-called pineapple wilt.  In the summer of 1919 Dr. Sherbakoff started some very interesting experiments with the view to either prove or disprove the nematode theory. Briefly his line of attack was sterilization of the soil with steam, carbon bisulfid, and formalde¬ hyde. In addition to these soil steriliza¬ tion experiments other very interesting and important test plots were started to show the value of selecting strong healthy slips versus poor slips; also the      fumigation of slips before planting ver¬ sus non-fumigation.  The above mentioned experiments were started nearly two years ago on the A. N. Hoofnagle place, one and one-half miles south of Ft. Pierce. The plants are now bearing their first crop. Three things loom up very conspicuously in these ex¬ periments, namely:  1. Cuban slips by far are giving the best results.  2. Of the local slips those chosen for their vigor and from healthy plants are far outranking those that showed weak¬ ness at the time of planting or those taken from wilted plants.  3. The plots whose slips were fumi¬ gated with hydrocyanic acid gas, at the rate of 2 ounces of sodium cyanide to 100 cu. ft., are superior to those not so treated. Just why fumigation should make such a difference in the growth of the plants has not yet been explained.  With regard to the soil sterilization plots it is yet too early to draw any defi¬ nite conclusion. During all of the first year the plots, including the checks, looked uniformly well, all plots growing as vig¬ orously as in the days when the pineapple was in its prime on the East Coast. Even during this year, until just recently, the plots appeared to be quite uniform and bore a good crop of large-sized apples. But about six weeks ago the plants of the outside row on one side of one of the check plots began to show some wilt. Just the other day it was observed that the wilting has crept in as far as the fourth row. So far no wilting appears in any plant of the other check plots nor in any of the sterilized plots. As said be¬   fore, it is still too early to draw any def¬ inite conclusions with regard to the ster¬ ilization plots, but in another year some very interesting points may be cleared up.  Although these sterilization plots do not at this time give us anything definite with regard to soil sterilization, yet they bring out another interesting and most important feature in the soil improve¬ ment problem. These plots are located in a part of the experimental field that had Natal grass growing on it since 1916. The grass had been left undisturbed, hav¬ ing been neither cut down nor plowed in until just before the slips were planted when the ground was plowed. Each bed, whether treated or not, produced uni¬ formly large and vigorous plants. This vigorous growth cannot be attributed alone to the sterilization of the soil, for the reason that the check plots, until only recently, produced equally vigorous plants. This uniformly fine growth of pines was undoubtedly due, first, to the humus that was restored to the soil by the three years’ continuous growth of Natal grass; and second, to the partial starving out of the nematode, as the Natal grass is highly resistant to this dreaded enemy of the pineapple.  This humus theory is further substan¬ tiated as follows : Plants growing in an¬ other part of the same field, but where the grass was plowed under two or three times a year, are not doing nearly so well as those where the grass had not been dis¬ turbed. Likewise on still other parts of the field where more recent plantings have been made under these particular cultural differences, the plants show less vigor in the plots that had the grass      turned under two or three times a year for the past two years than in the plots where the grass was left undisturbed dur¬ ing the three years previous to planting. The explanation for this no doubt is that where the field is plowed and a long dry hot period follows the bare soil is exposed to the hot winds and to the rays of the sun which burn out both humus and bac¬ terial life.  On our pineapple ridgeland in St. Lu¬ cie county Natal grass has up to date found no superior in the way of improv¬ ing the soil by adding humus and at the same time starving out the nematode. Natal grass is drought resistant and will make a good stand even in dry weather on poor soil once it makes a start.  To summarize the salient points that have been brought out by the experiments carried on in St. Lucie county in the growing of pineapples the following may be mentioned:  i. Restoration of humus in the soil by the growing of some plant or plants re¬ sistant to the nematode. The different varieties of velvet beans, the iron and brabham cowpeas, and the various grass¬ es are resistant. So far the forage crop that has given the best results is the Na¬ tal grass. And so far the best results with this grass have been obtained where it has been allowed to grow undisturbed for two or three years and only plowed under just before the planting of the pineapples.  It may be that equally good results could be obtained by plowing under each successive crop of Natal grass if the plowing could be done just before a heavy   rain or just before the starting out of the next grass crop, thus allowing only a very short period of time for the soil to lie fallow.  2. The control of the nematode. This is but a corollary of the first. By plant¬ ing nematode resistant plants to restore the humus, the nematode will be con¬ trolled at the same time.  3. A definite rotation of crops. For a stable pineapple industry the grower should have a definite system of rotation. After the fourth or fifth crop of pine9 the field should be planted to some cover crop for one or two years to be plowed under. A plantation could be divided off into say five different plots, and each plot in rotation planted to a cover crop, thus maintaining a uniform acreage in pine¬ apples year after year.  4. The selection of slips. Cuban slips have given good results wherever plant¬ ed. But since it is next to impossible to obtain slips from Cuba, the grower should pay the closest attention to the selection of local slips. Only slips from strong and vigorous plants should be taken. By con¬ tinuing such a practice in a few years a strain more or less resistant to the nema¬ tode could be developed. Such a scheme should have the co-operation of all the growers.  5. Since the fumigation of the slips by hydrocyanic acid gas has proven in our experiments to make a decided differ¬ ence in the growth of the plants, it would be well to continue this practice, at least as long as we obtain good results from it, or until we learn why fumigation is bene¬ ficial.      6 . The proper use of commercial fer¬ tilizers as set forth by experimenters along this line.  The experiments that have been carried on and are still being carried on in St. Lucie county by the Federal Department,   by the State Experimental Station, and by the growers of St. Lucie county, are of greatest importance to the pineapple in¬ dustry. These experiments should by all means be continued until we know defi¬ nitely just what causes pineapple wilt.@@   
 Pineapple Problems@@   R. L. Goodwin@@ Ft. Pierce@@   Pineapples have been successfully grown commercially on the East Coast of Florida during over 30 years.  The industry brought about a million dollars annually into St. Lucie county, until 1915, at which time many fields had become old and unprofitable, and a large percentage of the fruit small and unmar¬ ketable.  A dying off of plants appeared in many fields. This condition was recognized as “Wilt,” something that had always been known on a small scale but not feared up to that time by the growers in St. Lucie county.  The industry had been wiped out grad¬ ually in the vicinity of West Palm Beach, but St. Lucie county growers felt that pineapples were exempt from pests or dis¬ ease and could be grown on the same piece of land indefinitely; that when a field needed replanting all that was neces¬ sary was either to remove the old plants and plow the land or grub the old plants under and replant. In some locations fields have been planted three times in 25 years. One field was kept well fer¬ tilized and by filling in vacant places from time«to time was made to yield profit¬ able crops for 26 consecutive years.  When the war broke out with Germany the shipments of potash were cut off and potash later disappeared from the pine¬   apple fertilizers. Consider for a moment that in Florida, in a sub-tropical climate, we have growing a tender tropical plant— the pineapple. We found by experiment that we could harden the pineapple plant by using a good percentage of potash in our fertilizer mixtures so that there was less liability to injury by cold waves. We had also learned that apply ingammoniates without potash made the plants tender and very susceptible to injury by cold. Potash not being available except at an exorbitant price, the grower applied only ammoniates and phosphates, such as blood and bone, tankage, etc.  In February, 1917, a frost injured the plants; a year of droughty followed, and in December, 1917, another cold wave did damage. 1918 was another dry year and the pineapple grower threw up the sponge when fertilizers became as valuable as gold dust.  In the meanwhile the United States Department of Agriculture at Washing¬ ton and the State Agricultural Experi¬ ment Station at Gainesville were con¬ ducting experiments on various planta¬ tions to develop a method of control for red spiders, mealy bugs, and nematodes (root knot); and were seeking for para¬ sites and other agencies that might be re¬ sponsible for pineapple troubles. Plant selection, fumigation, soil sterilization,       disinfection of soil and of plants have been carried on. Natal, napier grass and rattle box have been tried as rotating crops, and healthy plants sterilized, fumi¬ gated and planted in 1919 show signs of giving a good crop this season. Plots of ground on old fields have been steamed, and others treated with formaldehyde or with carbon bisulphide. The experiments are being conducted to prove or disprove the many theories that have been ad¬ vanced and the information obtained will always be of value to whoever grows pineapples in Florida.  An association for the Promotion of Pineapple Culture was formed in July, 1919, and about $1,500 was raised to help the State carry out its experimental work. The treasury is at low ebb at the present time, but money will be forthcoming in same way. The work must not stop!  There are fields that went through the cold spells of 1917 with little injury, and were fertilized normally that fruited well last year and the fruit brought high prices. A few fields that were cleaned off and allowed to remain fallow in 1917 and 1918, were replanted in 1919 and at the present writing the plants are full of   bloom and promise a 90% crop. The plants look healthy. One field, belonging to D. T. McCarty, is located on Riverside Drive, Dixie Highway, one mile south of Ft. Pierce, and is observed by every one passing. One company has made con¬ tracts to replant a thousand or more acres of pineapples during the coming season and there is hopes of the industry being restored.  The land immediately adjoining and overlooking the Indian River is in de¬ mand as winter resident sites, and the lo¬ cation is beautiful with about 35 feet ele¬ vation above the river and a hard as¬ phalted road over which all automobiles pass to and from Miami and Palm Beach.  Many acres of the old pineapple belt will never be planted to pineapples again. Other crops such as limes, guavas, avoca¬ dos, pigeon peas, cassava and nursery stock have been planted and will produce an income.  Local pineapple plants are very scarce and high in price, but plants will be im¬ ported from other parts of the world, and in a few more years the pineapple in¬ dustry will again be an important factor in Florida’s upbuilding.@@  
 A Fertilizer Program@@   S. F. Poole@@ Lake Alfred@@   Any material added to the soil to pro¬ duce crops and maintain the soil strength may be termed a fertilizer. This being the case any real fertilizer program for our groves and farms has a double pur¬ pose to fulfill: (i) To retain and add to the soil reserves, and (2) produce the maximum of crops.  Soil reserves. At all times during the production of the crop (and in a citrus grove this means twelve months every year), there must be sufficient plant food to properly feed the tree. This plant food should not be too readily soluble, for dur¬ ing periods of wet weather the absorption by the trees together with leaching, would remove too much plant food from the soil. Then would follow a period when the trees could not secure sufficient food to continue operations.  The grove man, following a system of fertilizing at stated intervals, is often at a loss to understand why his trees do not always maintain their usual healthy condition. I have in mind a num¬ ber of groves that, two years ago this summer, illustrate this very condition. At that time we had all through June, July, and during the most of August a rainy season such as I have heard the old settlers tell about. By the first of Sep¬ tember the rains shut off and two months of dry weather followed. By the middle   of July these groves were seriously af¬ fected by withertip as evidenced by a con¬ siderable dropping of fruit. By October the situation was really serious, with from 25 to 50 per cent of the fruit on .the ground and the trees full of dead wood. Groves that had been fed a less readily soluble fertilizer weathered this trying period in safety. In these latter instances the soil had sufficient stocks of food in reserve to carry the trees along.  Soil reserve should be maintained; or in other words, keep food before the tree at all times. No bank can do business without capital. Add to this, for as your capital increases so grows your ability to transact business. With the citrus grow¬ er this spells bigger crops and better fruit.  The trees require certain kinds of food from the soil and these should be supplied by the fertilizer in proportion to the needs of the tree, the fruit and the deficiencies of the soil. There should be provided for the trees the food they need to produce complete growth and fruit.  A complete fertilizer is so termed when it contains ammonia, phosphoric acid, and potash. These three are named because they are the three elements of which a Florida soil is usually deficient. They are also regarded as the most active in fostering growth and production of crops. The other elements that are necessary   100        101   but are found in the soil in sufficient, though small quantities are sulphur, lime, magnesium, iron, etc.  Ammonia is the element that produces growth. The spring and early summer is the best time to apply fertilizers having relatively high percentages of ammonia. It is best to wait for the removal of the fruit before applying high percentages of this element; yet I have seen growers ap¬ ply four and even six per cent of am¬ monia in February and then wonder why their late fruit became course and green before the time for shipment arrived. It would have been better to wait until after the fruit was picked before using stimu¬ lating applications of ammonia.  Potash is necessary for the formation of sugars and wood and for the transfer of these compounds from one part of the tree to another. It is held that photosyn¬ thesis cannot take place without potash. It is commonly understood that potash produces a thin, tough peel, making a fruit better fitted to withstand the shocks of transportation.  Soil Conditions. Let us turn back to the soil again. Four things are requisite for a satisfactory fertilizer program: (i) Proper type of land; (2) Water; (3) Humus; and (4) Soil bacteria.  (O Type of Land. The trees should be planted on land adapted to citrus trees. The high pine lands of the Winter Haven section are a good example. These lands are high, well drained, and well aerated. The sub-soil is clay located deep enough to provide space for the tree roots and moisture is easy to retain. Groves have been set on flat woods and sand scrub lands in this section but the returns are   not commensurate with the effort ex¬ pended.  (2) Water. The citrus tree like all plants uses its food in solutions as dilute as the fraction of one per cent. The sap of the tree is very dilute, the only ap¬ proach to concentration being found in the fruit and seed. There is a constant stream of water flowing through the tree day and night. Large quantities of water are required for a tree to carry on its vi¬ tal functions. When the amount of wa¬ ter in the soil gets low, or in other words, when the solutions of food in the soil be¬ come too concentrated, the trees wilt. They are unable to get sufficient raw ma¬ terials for their requirements.  ( 3). Humns is decayed vegetable mat¬ ter thoroughly incorporated into the soil. Its presence in the soil makes it easier to retain moisture and encourages the growth of living agents. There are two ten-acre groves in our section that were planted side by side on the same kind of land seven years ago last winter. One grove man has kept his land virtually clean the year round. The other man has not. His grove is clean during the dry season and full of grasses and beggar- weed during the rainy season. Today the trees in the grove where clean culti¬ vation has been practiced the year round are fifty per cent smaller than those in the other grove. The amounts and qual¬ ity of fruit bear no comparison. The grove kept clean during the dry season only has produced three times as much fruit.  (4). Soil Bacteria. Last but not least, are the soil bacteria. These are the agents that convert the crude materials of the soil   102       into forms that are soluble and beneficial. The helpful soil bacteria cannot do their work unless they have plenty of humus and an abundant supply of fresh air and water. Conversely land that has no soil bacteria is dead and will not produce sat¬ isfied grove owners.  The soil may be compared to a factory in which the: Building is the inert par¬ ticles of soil; labor, the bacteria; raw ma¬ terials, the water, air, solvents and hu¬ mus; capital, the fertilizer; finished prod¬ ucts, the products absorbed by the tree roots.  A good fertilizer program requires a   consideration of all these factors. Nor is the case as simple as this presentation might lead one to think. These factors are entirely dependent upon each other for the absence of any one interferes with the health of the trees.  Let us sum up briefly:  Apply fertilizers to the soil that are congenial to the tree and sufficient to build up the soil reserves, and see to it that the soil bacteria have a chance to flourish. I know this is not always an easy thing to do, that there is danger in straying from the straight road.@@   
 Humus, Fertilizers, Lime and Fertilizer Inspection@@   Dr. H. J. Wheeler@@ Boston, Mass.@@   HUMUS  Before entering upon a discussion of fertilizers and their use, it is of first im¬ portance to speak of humus; since, if the soil is not adequately supplied with hu¬ mus, plants cannot make their best growth, neither can fertilizers exert their maximum effect.  What is needed in Florida soils is not organic matter which has reached the most advanced stage of decomposition, but rather organic matter in the various stages of decomposition. I have known soils ex¬ ceedingly rich in organic matter, a large part of which had decomposed to such an extent and was in such a state that it could be dissolved from the soil by treat¬ ment with ammonia water; and yet these same soils were very unproductive be¬ cause of the need of organic matter in the earlier stages of decomposition. In gen¬ eral it is probably safe to state that the richer the plants are in protein, the chief nitrogenous constituent, the more quickly they decompose. On this account many of the non-legumes decompose rather more slowly and furnish organic matter in the various stages of decomposition for a longer time than the legumes do. Young and tender legumes decay very rapidly. In fact, they act almost as quick¬ ly as sources of available ammonia for   plants as do certain of the well recognized organic materials, such as tankage and cottonseed meal.  I recall experiments made several years ago, in which I grew the perennial flat pea for two or three years on the same land and then turned the crop under and sowed barley. The barley was much bet¬ ter than it was on adjoining land where flat peas had not been grown previously, and the crop appeared to be abundantly supplied with nitrogen. The next year, however, there was no appreciable in¬ crease in the crop where flat peas had been turned under a year before as com¬ pared with the plot where no flat peas had been grown. This showed that the nitrogen contained in the flat peas had practically all been utilized by the crop which followed or that it had been trans¬ formed into nitrates which had leached away.  For crops or plants which may be in¬ jured by the presence of too much nitro¬ gen, particularly toward the close of or just following the rainy season, it might be better in some cases to use non-le¬ gumes as cover crops, rather than le¬ gumes. It is generally recognized, that certain crops or plants are more affected by various diseases if the plants are over¬ fertilized with ammonia at certain stages   103    104       of their growth, than if they are supplied with properly balanced plant food which does not carry an excess of ammonia.  Another point in connection with le¬ gumes ought to be mentioned. Everyone recognizes the importance of getting ni¬ trogen out of the air and of utilizing legumes wherever they can be utilized to advantage. Until quite recently some mistaken notions have existed in regard to the amount of nitrogen which they fix from the air; since, as long as there is present in the soil an abundant supply of combined nitrogen in forms which the plants can utilize, they take it up instead of assimilating atmospheric nitrogen to any considerable extent. Recent experi¬ ments in the Middle West have shown where legumes and non-legumes have been grown side by side and then removed from the land, that the soil has been made poorer in nitrogen where the legumes were grown than where the land was de¬ voted to non-legumes. Even if the crops are left on the farm and are returned in manure, a large percentage of the ammo¬ nia is finally lost before the plant residues in the form of liquid and solid manure are returned to the land. On this ac¬ count, if one wishes to add to the soil the greatest amount of nitrogen from atmos¬ pheric sources, the legumes must be grown on land which is not already rich in combined nitrogen, and they must then be plowed under.  When plant residues are applied to the soil, the complex nitrogenous compounds which are contained in them are soon broken up through the activity of bac¬ teria and the other naturally-existing mi¬ cro-organisms of the soil. While these   changes are taking place, some plants are able to assimilate directly certain of the more simple organic nitrogenous com¬ pounds, comparable to those produced from hair, wool, and other complex or¬ ganic nitrogenous compounds when sub¬ jected to suitable factory preparation and treatment for fertilizer uses. The greater portion of the nitrogen, however, is trans¬ formed into ammonia by the agencies just mentioned, which in turn is transformed in the soil into nitrous acid and finally into nitric acid. This nitric acid then en¬ ters into combination with potash, soda, lime, or magnesia, from which it is taken up by plants unless lost in the drainage waters. In Indiana even aluminum ni¬ trate has been known to be formed in soils to such an extent that it became poison¬ ous to vegetation. In other words, this compound may act in the same way as certain of the other soluble aluminum salts.  The various changes in plant residues take place more readily in soil well sup¬ plied with moisture, and at fairly high temperatures, than in rather dry soil, es¬ pecially when the temperature is low. The formation of nitrates is said to oc¬ cur most actively at a temperature of about 98° F.; hence, in many cases soil near the surface in summer becomes too hot for the most rapid formation of ni¬ trates.  It is not necessary from the standpoint of the plant that all of the nitrogen, aside from the small amount which is taken up in simple organic forms, be changed into nitrates; for at least many kinds of plants at certain stages of their growth are able to use some nitrogen while still combined       105   as ammonia. On the other hand, if there is too great and sudden a formation of ammonia, owing to the conditions being unfavorable to its transformation into ni¬ trates, there is a possibility that ammonia may in some cases accumulate in the soil to such an extent as to be injurious to plants. In a word, the most important problems in connection with the feeding of plants are the selection of the proper plant foods and the compounding of the various materials in such proportions as will insure a proper and adequate supply of all necessary plant foods to meet the plant requirements from seeding time un¬ til full maturity is reached.  Even if fertilizers are supplied in ade¬ quate quantities and of the right analysis, it is also important to have the right pro¬ portions of the different materials used in the mixtures. This may best be illus¬ trated by citing my own experiment with fertilizers in Aroostook County, Maine. I found it possible to produce 30-40 bush¬ els more of potatoes per acre with one fertilizer than with another, even when an analysis of both would show the same percentages of ammonia, available phos¬ phoric acid, and potash. The factors de¬ termining the difference in yields in these cases were the kinds of materials and their availability. Thus the difference in the value of the product from an acre of land produced by the two fertilizers hav¬ ing the same analysis was enough in most seasons to pay the entire cost of the fer¬ tilizer used. It is because of these impor¬ tant considerations that a careful study of soil and climatic conditions and of soil and plant requirements is necessary in or¬   der to manufacture fertilizers which will give the best possible results.  FERTILIZERS  Ammonia .—I notice that the previous speaker spoke of ammonia as that ingre¬ dient of the fertilizer which “produces plant growth.” I know it is a more or less common practice nowadays to speak of nitrogen,-or ammonia, as that which causes growth, of phosphoric acid as that which produces the seed, and of potash as the fertilizer ingredient which causes the production of starch, sugar, and cellu¬ lose. We must not forget, however, that there are at least ten different plant foods, all of which are important to the proper functioning of the plant; and if any one of these is entirely lacking, the plant will not thrive. Therefore, iron, magnesia, and lime are as necessary to growth as nitrogen is. We are led, however, to think of nitrogen as especially necessary to growth for the reason that when it is deficient in a soil, plants generally take on a light or yellow color and present an unthrifty appearance. And yet, I have seen Indian corn which looked as light- colored and unthrifty as a plant possibly could, when supplied with everything a plant requires excepting iron, but which, as soon as iron was supplied, recovered its normal green appearance and throve per¬ fectly.  Another important consideration in connection with the use of fertilizers is their effect upon the soil. Nitrates, for example, are subject to ready loss by leaching on sandy soils if heavy rains oc¬ cur, and nitrate of soda in particular   106       tends to de flocculate clay soils and serious¬ ly injure their physical condition. On acid soils nitrate of soda tends gradually to correct the acid condition; and if the soil is of such a physical character that it is not likely to be injured by the residual sodium carbonates, the after effect from the use of nitrate of soda is beneficial.  Sulphate of ammonia is not so subject to leaching as nitrate of soda; yet if it were used as the exclusive source of ni¬ trogen on a highly calcareous soil, there is a possibility that so much ammonia would be liberated at once that some of it might escape into the air and be lost, or even, under such conditions, cause direct injury to plants, many of which are very sensi¬ tive to its presence in large quantities. Sulphate of ammonia also tends to make soils acid on account of the fact that the ammonia is largely changed to nitric acid in the soil, which further adds for a time to the marked acidity created by the resid¬ ual sulphuric acid that was combined with the ammonia at the outset.  Calcium nitrate and potassium nitrate are both subject to ready loss by leaching in open sandy soils in case heavy rains •occur. For crops which are greatly in need of lime, especially when they are grown on acid soils, calcium nitrate has distinct advantages; whereas for certain root crops which can use some soda, in case the supply of potash becomes de¬ ficient, nitrate of soda may be a more efficient or better source of nitrogen.  If calcium cyanamid is introduced into fertilizers in small amounts under cer¬ tain chemical conditions, the nitrogen may be largely transformed into urea, a most valuable organic source of nitrogen   for plants. On the other hand, if it is introduced into fertilizers under other conditions or in large quantities or if it is applied directly to the soil under the usual conditions, large amounts of dicyanodi- amid are formed from it—a compound which is highly toxic to plants. It is on this account that calcium cyanamid of it¬ self is usually considered unsuited for use as a top dressing or direct application to growing crops or trees. It is on this ac¬ count, also, that it must be applied two to three weeks before the seed is sown in or¬ der not to injure the young rootlets.  There is a possibility that in the near future ammonium chloride may be placed on the market as a source of ammonia. If this occurs, it will have to be used with even more care than sulphate of ammo¬ nia, especially on acid soils.  The important feature in connection with fertilizers is to have such quantities and such proportions of various materials used as to exert the best and most favor¬ able influence upon plant growth, taking into account, also, the effect of the ferti¬ lizers upon the physical and chemical con¬ dition of the soil. It is possible with a clear understanding of these points to use such proportions, for example, of certain nitrates, ammonium salts or other mate¬ rials, as to avoid the ill effects which may arise from their exclusive use as sources of ammonia; for when combined in the proper proportions and in a proper man¬ ner, the various drawbacks mentioned may be largely or wholly avoided, by making the effect of one substance coun¬ teract the unfavorable effect of another.  A further interesting phase of the ni¬ trogen problem is that of denitrification,        107   or the destruction of nitrates within the soil. It has been proved by the most painstaking experiments that if a soil be¬ comes water-logged up to a certain limit, nitrates instead of being formed or con¬ served in the soil, begin to undergo de¬ composition, especially if the soil con¬ tains considerable amounts of fresh ma¬ nures and certain other kinds of organic matter in the early stages of decomposi¬ tion. This change may go only so far that ammonia is formed; or it may even progress to such an extent that the major part of the nitrogen existing in nitrates already in the soil or applied to it in fer¬ tilizers, may be changed into gaseous form and thrown off into the air. The nitrogen would then be in the same form as the nitrogen in the air which we are breathing in this room at the present mo¬ ment, and it would be of no more use to plants than the naturally-existing free ni¬ trogen already in the air. A very small part of the nitrogen under these condi¬ tions is transformed into organic material consisting of the micro-organisms which bring about this change. Thus it is im¬ portant that soils be properly drained. If they are not, organic material which has considerably decomposed or which has been well composted is far safer than or¬ ganic material in a less advanced stage of decomposition, since the latter is capable of supplying a greater amount of nutri¬ ment to the denitrifying organisms.  Phosphoric Acid .—In regard to phos¬ phoric acid, it is a well-known fact that in Europe in the early days no such thing as superphosphate, or acid phosphate, was known. Due, however, to the work of Von Liebig during the latter part of the   first half of the preceding century, it was shown that the crop-producing efficiency of ground bone was very greatly in¬ creased by treating it with sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol). Still later phosphate rock which is a far less effective source of phosphoric acid than bone when both are untreated, was also subjected to the same treatment, whereupon it was found that the available phosphoric acid, thus produced, was as efficient a source of plant food as if it had been produced by treatment of bone with sulphuric acid.  Ordinary bone and phosphate rock con¬ sist chiefly of tricalcium phosphate, some¬ times called a “three-lime” phosphate. In the manufacture of superphosphate (acid phosphate) either from phosphate rock or from bone, it is customary to add enough sulphuric acid to combine with two of the three atoms of lime, so that only one atom of lime remains in com¬ bination with phosphoric acid. This re¬ maining compound containing only one atom of lime is soluble in water, supply¬ ing what is known as “soluble phosphoric acid.” The other two-thirds of the lime in the bone or in the phosphate rock are changed into land plaster, or gypsum, which remains in the mixture. This, therefore, the farmer secures without cost, since the charge for the superphos¬ phate is based merely upon the percent¬ age of available phosphoric acid.  It has been found in some of the states on the Pacific Coast and elsewhere that sulphur, even in such combinations as land plaster, or gypsum, is very helpful to the growth of certain plants; and it is not at all impossible that the sulphur con¬ tained in the land plaster, associated with   108       acid phosphate, or dissolved bone, is often of some use to plants. It may not only serve as direct plant food, but, to a cer¬ tain extent, the gypsum may act as a lib¬ erator of potash; and if ammonia happens to be present in the soil in the form of carbonate, it may react with the ammonia so as to change a part of it temporarily into sulphate, in which form it is non¬ volatile and cannot escape into the air and be lost.  Two great advantages are derived from the use of superphosphate, whether made from bone or rock, namely: (i) it is soluble in water and hence can be taken up immediately by the plants, and (2) it becomes better distributed in the soil if applied in soluble form than if ap¬ plied in its untreated natural condition. To be sure, much of the soluble phos¬ phoric acid, upon application of a super¬ phosphate to the soil, is soon changed into less soluble forms, known as “reverted” or “back-gone” phosphoric acid. Its ef¬ ficiency, after this reversion has taken place, is determined to a considerable ex¬ tent by the character of the soil and the relative proportions of the various sub¬ stances with which the soluble phosphoric acid can combine. For example, if the soil contains large quantities of aluminum and iron oxides, and little or no available lime, there is a tendency for much of the phosphoric acid to enter into combination with the iron and aluminum and for but little of it to enter into combination with lime. It is on this account that it is ad¬ vantageous to make small or moderate applications of lime from time to time to soils where superphosphates are to be   used, provided crops are grown which are not subject to injury by liming. For citrus fruits, unfortunately, lime must for other reasons be used with exceeding care and in very small quantities if at all.  Much has been said and written in re¬ cent years about raw rock phosphate, or, in other words, regarding phosphate rock which has not been subjected to treatment with sulphuric acid; and many extrava¬ gant claims have been made concerning its efficiency as plant food. It is of some agricultural value even without treatment, on certain soils, and its greatest efficiency is observed when it is used on acid peat or muck soils. The next best soils on which to use it would be upland soils which contain large amounts of acid or¬ ganic matter. However, for most crops and soils throughout the greater portion of the United States and especially in the east along the Atlantic seaboard, no other form of phosphoric acid has proved equal to superphosphate prepared from bone or rock phosphate by treatment with sul¬ phuric acid. It has been found, for ex¬ ample, that if the raw rock phosphate is used on land which has been recently limed or which naturally contains a con¬ siderable amount of carbonate of lime, its efficiency is very greatly reduced or in some cases practically nullified, for the reason that the acids of the soil or those contained in the rain water or produced as a result of nitrification and fermenta¬ tion are likely to attack the carbonate of lime before they can exert any material solvent action on the raw rock phosphate. It is for this reason that soft phosphate, which generally contains much carbonate       109   of lime, is often less efficient than it would be if it were entirely dissociated from carbonate of lime.  When soluble phosphoric acid reacts with lime, it first forms dicalcium phos¬ phate or, in other words, a two-lime, or reverted, phosphate. This is still very available to plants; for even though it is not directly soluble in water, it is readily dissolved by the action of plant roots and by water containing carbonic acid, such, for example, as rain water and the nat¬ ural soil waters, which derive their car¬ bonic acid from the decomposition of the organic matter of the soil.  The chemist determines in the labora¬ tory the amount of water-soluble phos¬ phoric acid and also the amount of re¬ verted phosphoric acid and refers to the sum of the two as “available” phosphoric acid.  Another source of phosphoric acid, which was used in this country somewhat extensively before the war, is basic slag meal, or Thomas phosphate. This was produced in the manufacture of steel from phosphate of iron by what is known as the “basic” process. The phosphoric acid in this material is largely combined with lime in a different combination from any of the other phosphates mentioned, and some iron, manganese, and free lime are also present. As concerns the avail¬ ability of its phosphoric acid, it is some¬ what inferior to superphosphate. It is, however, superior in this respect to un¬ treated bone meal and is much superior to raw rock phosphate or soft phosphate. Its availability to plants depends very largely upon the conditions under which it is manufactured, and certain basic   slag meals produced in some European works before the war had a very low availability as compared with that pro¬ duced in others. Thus the source of the basic slag meal, or Thomas phosphate, may be a very important consideration from the purchaser’s standpoint.  Another new source of phosphoric acid is the so-called “ammo-phos,” which is a combination of ammonia and phosphoric acid. This is a material which is as yet but relatively little known in agricultural circles. It must be used experimentally under varying conditions and with a large number of different kinds of plants be¬ fore one can state definitely the condi¬ tions under which it can be used to the best advantage, or can be sure of its .real desirability and of the efficiency of its phosphoric acid as compared with phos¬ phoric acid in superphosphate. '  During and since the war many pro¬ cesses have been patented for the prepara¬ tion of phosphates for agricultural use from raw rock phosphate by different methods involving fusion with various substances; but as yet none of these prod¬ ucts has apparently been able to hold its own in competition with superphosphate, either by way of efficiency in crop pro¬ duction or economy of manufacture.  In connection with my experiments, especially in the Middle West, I have been astonished to find that as small amounts as 90-150 pounds of a relatively low- grade fertilizer, containing high percent¬ ages of phosphoric acid, have given in¬ creases of 8-15 bushels of wheat to the acre, 15-40 bushels of oats, and 10-25 bushels of corn. In one case 100 pounds of fertilizer were used to the acre for   110       sorghum. The sorghum was then manu¬ factured into syrup from both the ferti¬ lized and unfertilized areas with the re¬ sult that where no fertilizer was used, the yield of syrup per acre was 67 gal¬ lons; and where fertilizer was used, the yield was 140 gallons. This syrup was worth at that time from 90 cents to $1.45 per gallon; hence, the gross gain even at 90 cents would be $65.70, from which there must be deducted only the very small cost of the 100 pounds of fertilizer in order to show the net profit from the fertilization.  Such increases often seem to be more than might be expected from the mere plant-food effect of the fertilizers; and it appears possible that in addition to fur¬ nishing plant food in immediately avail¬ able form in close proximity to the young rootlets of the plants, the fertilizers may also have a corrective effect by way of overcoming the toxicity of certain sub¬ stances which may be present to an in¬ jurious extent in some of these soils. Furthermore, it is now known that fer¬ tilizers have a very marked stimulating effect upon the development of certain of the soil bacteria upon which soil fertility is very largely dependent. In connection with the first point raised, attention should be called to the fact that Conner, Abbott, and their associates in Indiana, found that in some soils aluminum nitrate was present in sufficient amounts to be toxic to plants. This is a substance which is decomposed by either lime or superphosphates; and wherever such com¬ pounds are present in the soil, the appli¬ cation of fertilizer containing superphos¬ phate would be expected to make the con¬   ditions more congenial to the develop¬ ment of young plants. Similarly, at the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station, Hartwell, Pember, Damon, and their associates, have found that where sulphate of ammonia was applied to the soil for a series of years as the exclu¬ sive source of ammonia, aluminum sul¬ phate had been formed in the soil in suf¬ ficient amounts to render the soil unable to longer support the growth of various kinds of crops. It had previously been shown by the author of this paper that the existing toxicity, regardless of its cause, could be entirely overcome by the use of lime. More recently it has been demonstrated by Hartwell, Pember, Da¬ mon, and their associates, that exceeding¬ ly large applications of superphosphate are also capable of overcoming or greatly reducing the toxicity of the aluminum sulphate; and this is due to the fact that the phosphoric acid upon combining with aluminum, changes it into a very insolu¬ ble form which the plant cannot assimi¬ late. Ruprecht, while at the Massachu¬ setts Agricultural Experiment Station, found soluble, or toxic, aluminum salts present in certain soils. It appears, there¬ fore, that this is a condition which we have but just begun to recognize in this country. In fact, it is not improbable that certain soluble salts of the protoxid of iron may have similar effects, which superphosphates are able to correct.  Where sufficient quantities of soluble aluminum salts exist in the soil to prevent utterly the growth of onions, beets, let¬ tuce, spinach, upland cress, asparagus, cabbage, cauliflower, and, in fact, a large number of other kinds of plants,       111   there are still others which can thrive on such soils without difficulty. I refer par¬ ticularly to one of the flowering peren¬ nials, Silene orientalis, which throve to perfection where most of the plants enu¬ merated above died before they had made materially more growth than was possi¬ ble from the stored-up food material in the seed. The blackberry, for example, grew well on such soil. The Lima bean was also able to make a fair growth, whereas the Golden Wax and other vari¬ eties of string beans were partial failures. Watermelons grew splendidly, whereas the cantaloupe practically failed. Other plants were found to range between these extremes.  Potash .—For most crops it is more or less immaterial what the source of the potash is, as long as it is soluble in water, or is available to the roots of plants. However, citrus fruits, tobacco, sugar beets, and hops are illustrative of noted exceptions. The usual potash sources are muriate, which contains about twice as much chlorine as potash; high-grade sulphate of potash, which contains little or no chlorine; kainit, which contains two or three times as much chlorine as pot¬ ash ; and the double manure salt, contain¬ ing both sulphate of potash and sulphate of magnesia, and but relatively small quantities of chlorine. It is the aim of progressive fertilizer manufacturers to supply those forms of potash for special crops which are adapted to the kind of plant to be fertilized.   LIME  There are soils in Florida which con¬ tain a great abundance of carbonate of lime, in fact, far more than is desirable. On the other hand, there are some soils which are so acid and deficient in lime that its application is one of the first es¬ sentials to success. For citrus trees, as stated before, lime should be used with extreme caution, if at all, for we are well aware of its various ill effects on citrus trees of all kinds. But if any lime is used for citrus trees, one should probably em¬ ploy only a small part of what is indi¬ cated as necessary to completely neutral¬ ize the soil; whereas, if one were growing cantaloupes, lettuce, spinach, beets, and many other truck and field crops which are greatly benefited by lime, liming ap¬ proximately to the full limit of the quan¬ titatively determined requirement may prove helpful.  I have been much interested in what one of the speakers has said regarding die-back; for in connection with an ex¬ periment which I have been conducting with oranges here in Florida, die-back was markedly increased where magnesian lime was used three years before at the rate of only one ton per acre. The dis¬ ease was even worse when practically pure lime was substituted for magnesian lime. The die-back was also accompa¬ nied by wither-tip and frenching. The trees in the same experiment which re¬ ceived no lime were far less affected with die-back. Die-back was also present in   112       an adjoining grove in which all the trees were subsequently treated with bluestone (copper sulphate). Since it was my de¬ sire to ascertain to what extent different lime and fertilizer treatments would af¬ fect die-back, no bluestone was used on the three experimental areas. Neverthe¬ less, die-back has now very largely disap¬ peared. If bluestone had also been used on the experimental trees, it might have been inferred that the disappearance of die-back was chiefly or wholly due to the bluestone. In view of the circumstances, however, it is evident that climatic or other conditions were responsible for a good part of the improvement observed.* I do not mean by this that I would not advise the use of bluestone as a means of combating die-back, for it seems, at present, to be the best-known remedy for this disease. It must, however, be used with care and moderation or trees may be injured by it. I say this, notwithstand¬   ing that in some cases unusually large amounts have been used without injury. In the course of my travels for several years through the citrus sections of this State, covering in all many thousand miles and visits made at different times of the year, I have not found anyone who has been able to tell me positively all of the different causes of die-back nor how it can always and surely be avoided. Ap¬ parently, there may be several causes. At any rate, everything which can be done to throw light upon any one or more of these causes will be of material help to the citrus industry. It is for this pur¬ pose, among others, that the company with which I am connected is conducting several experiments in this State with citrus fruits on different types of soil. We cannot expect that the citrus industry of Florida will ever attain its highest and fullest development until the mysteries connected with the die-back problem have   *As the discussion following this paper was drawing to a close, one of Florida’s authorities on citrus diseases, citrus culture, and especially on the use of bluestone, disputed the statement that die-back had largely disappeared without treatment, saying that he had visited the grove mentioned and found that this was not the case. I thereupon stated that what I said was based upon the report of a man also familiar with Flor¬ ida and its citrus problems, rather than upon my own examination, although I had observed a marked general improvement in the grove. Soon after the meeting at Miami arrangements were made through Professor Newell to have the grove carefully examined and reported on by Mr. Gumme, county agent and citrus expert of Polk County, who reported as follows:  Section i. No Lime. —Not as heavy growth as in Section 2 or 3. Slight indication of frenching. Hail has damaged young fruits—also young and old wood, causing the wood to split considerably. Fruit irregular in quantity. No S-shaped growth apparent. No indications of die-back by gum pockets or multiple buds. This section could not be recorded as having die-back.   Section 2. Limed Area—Magnesian Lime.—  Hail damaged fruit and branches as in Section 1. Small amount of frenching. Growth in general is better than that in Section 1 or 3. S-shaped growth is present in almost all trees but there are no indications of die-back by gum pockets or multiple buds. This section shows vigorous and healthy growth.  Section 3. Limed Area—Non-Magnesian Lime.  —Die-back present on a few trees which show gum pockets, multiple buds, frenching, and brown exudation on wood. This condition is not ex¬ tensive, although it is marked on a few trees. The fruit and wood had been considerably dam¬ aged by hail. As in 1 and 2, the damage seems to be more marked on the younger wood.  The Grove Across the Road from the Above Three Sections.—This grove has been treated with bluestone. No die-back is apparent though a few S-shaped branches were noticed. There has evi¬ dently been die-back in this grove at some earlier period as some of the old wood is stained, but no gum pockets or multiple buds were found on the younger growth.           been more fully explained. Until we know more of the causes and of the means of avoiding this disease, we shall be in essentially the same position as the physicians and veterinarians who were at¬ tempting to combat yellow fever and ma¬ laria in the human family, and the Texas fever in cattle, before the relationship of the mosquito and the tick to the transmis¬ sion of these diseases was definitely as¬ certained. Most thorough and careful experiments should be made on every dif¬ ferent type of soil used in this State for the growth of citrus trees, and this seems to be one of the greatest needs of the cit¬ rus industry in Florida at the present time. It is not enough to have one ex¬ periment station, but experiments should be conducted in all of the important citrus districts in which different types of soil are represented.  FERTILIZER INSPECTION    Before closing, I wish to say a word about the fertilizer law in Florida. I trust I may be able to qualify as a compe¬ tent witness for the reason that I was for four years connected with the fertilizer inspection in Massachusetts, and for more than twenty years had general charge of the chemical work connected with ferti¬ lizer inspection in Rhode Island.  I notice that there is a tendency in some states to require the manufacturer to name the sources of the materials used in his goods. In this connection it should not be forgotten that requirements of this kind are of no use whatsoever, unless the chemist can substantiate or disprove the claim of the manufacturer. Further¬   more, such requirements are often con¬ trary to the best interests of both the pur¬ chaser of the fertilizer and the manufac¬ turer.  For example, there are a considerable number of materials rich in nitrogen which, in their natural, untreated condi¬ tion, are generally known to have a rela¬ tively low crop-producing value, but when properly treated in the fertilizer factory, are capable of transformation into mate¬ rials as valuable as or in some cases even more valuable than the best organic am- moniates with which we are familiar; such as, dried blood, tankage, and cotton¬ seed meal. If the manufacturer is obliged to state that these materials are used, it is likely to create a prejudice against the fertilizer, whereas the fertilizer really will be of very superior quality if these same materials are subjected to proper factory treatment at the outset. Further¬ more, after treatment, the nitrogen may be present in compounds entirely different from those existing before the treatment was applied. Such requirements are about on a par with the requirement that a manufacturer of turpentine must state that he used long-leaved pine in his prod¬ uct. It is true that special crops seem to be of better quality when certain ammo- niates are used than when others are em¬ ployed, and any manufacturer with his future at stake strives to furnish that which will give the best results. It is of great importance to know the availability of the ammoniates in the fertilizer; but it can do no one any good to state what they were once, what they are not now, and what they never will be again. A law of this character, which requires the mak-   114       ing of statements that would be mislead¬ ing to the purchaser, is in many respects worse than no law at all.  If I were to state that I used hair or wool in a fertilizer, the purchaser, know¬ ing the low value of each in its raw or untreated state, would think that the fer¬ tilizer was inefficient. However, I can take the hair off your individual heads or the wool off the backs of your sheep (with your permission) and, by chemical treatment in the fertilizer factory, trans¬ form it into material as valuable as, or even more valuable than, the best organic ammoniate known. After such treatment it would certainly no longer be hair; but it would consist of a very large number of different nitrogenous compounds, many of which no chemist could practically hope to identify in making a fertilizer analysis, and much less determine quan¬ titatively. In fact, if, under such circum¬ stances, I were to state that hair was used, I should be telling you that some¬ thing was there which was really not there.  I mention these points merely as illus¬ trative of tendencies in connection with some recent fertilizer laws to require statements which are useless, absurd, positively misleading, and contrary to the best interests of the user of fertilizer. If you wish to know the source of potash in a fertilizer, a chlorine test in addition to the test for potash will usually tell all that is required. If you wish to know the real crop-producing value of a fertilizer, a determination of the percentage of available phosphoric acid and potash, and the availability of the nitrogen as shown   by the most reliable chemical methods known, affords the best possible means of protection for the purchaser. In those states where this plan has now been in vogue for several years, the results have been most acceptable to the farmers.  I wish also to say a word about the collection of samples of fertilizers. It is to be presumed that the object of a fer¬ tilizer inspection is to set forth the actual facts as to the quality and analysis of the fertilizer. This being the case, it is of the utmost importance that samples be so drawn that they will truly represent the fertilizers which are being inspected.  If you were to make up a fertilizer containing bone, tankage, and various other materials, including potash salts, nitrates, sulphate of ammonia, and simi¬ lar materials, you might find, no matter how accurately the mixture had been made, that some of the lighter materials in the mixture would tend to come to the top of the bag when shaken up in transit or handled in the storehouse. Conse¬ quently, the only way that a truly repre¬ sentative sample can be secured is to have it drawn with a sampling implement which extends the entire length of the bag. The sampler should not be opened until it has been fully inserted. It should then be opened throughout the entire length, filled, closed, and then with¬ drawn. Such sampling-rods are in exist¬ ence and are used exclusively in many of the states. These secure a true core of fertilizer extending the entire length of the bag. A perfect mixture of such cores will give a true test of the character of the goods, if properly handled and an¬ alyzed.       115   It is also important that samples be drawn from such a number of bags as will properly represent any given lot of fertilizer. If there is a §mall number, all should be sampled; and if there are many bags, samples should be drawn from not less than 10-20% of those present. Great care must also be taken in properly mix¬ ing the samples after they are drawn, so that a uniform, composite sample can be secured for analysis. If I were merely to draw a sample of fertilizer with my hand from the tops of bags in a shipment and were to send it to your state chemist for analysis, the chances are that he would report that the analysis did not agree with the guaranty. Imagine for a moment that each of you is a manufac¬ turer and I the purchaser. You will ap¬ preciate the position in which you would find yourselves, if I used such an analysis as a basis for non-payment of the goods and as a means of having the goods con¬ fiscated. It must be obvious that such a situation as this would add to your over¬ head costs in the manufacture of ferti¬ lizers and to the prices which you would have to charge me for them; or the alter¬ native would be that you would be driven from business in this State.  My conception of a fertilizer inspection is that it should be conducted in such a way, and the law should be so drawn, that it affords protection to the purchaser and at the same time protects the honest man¬ ufacturer from injustice, imposition and the perpetration of fraud on the part of any dishonest purchaser; in other words, the inspector of fertilizers should be backed by a just law and should stand as an absolutely neutral party, seeing to it   that absolute justice is done to both pro¬ ducer and consumer. No other plan is as good for either the purchaser or the man¬ ufacturer.  DISCUSSION  I  \  Question: Mr. Chairman, the speaker has already remarked that too much lime may be injurious to citrus fruits. Now I wish to ask if too much iron, too much magnesia or too much of other materials would be injurious, and at what point the limit should be set?  Answer: In regard to iron there may be a situation where, on account of large amounts of moisture and organic matter, an oxide of iron may be formed which, in certain combinations, may possibly be in¬ jurious to plants. We know, for exam¬ ple, that in some of the peat and muck soils of Holland and England, protosul¬ phate of iron has been found in such quantities as to be destructive to vegeta¬ tion. There are instances on record where soils contained so much magnesia as to be injurious or almost sterile; but this is doubtless inconceivable in the case of Florida soils, since most of them con¬ tain very little magnesia, so little, in fact, that I suspect some magnesia may be ben¬ eficial for some crops under certain cir¬ cumstances. It is true that excessive amounts of certain plant foods may be injurious; but I do not think we have rea¬ son to fear the use of too much, especially in view of the present high prices, which have unfortunately placed too great a curb upon their purchase.  Plants differ very widely in their sus¬ ceptibility to injury by excessive amounts of certain salts of iron, magnesia, and  116       other substances, which may be present in the soil. A concrete illustration is af¬ forded in connection with experiments which I made several years ago in Rhode Island. It was found that soil which had possibly never received any fertilizer treatment was exceedingly acid and con¬ tained substances so toxic to lettuce, spin¬ ach, beets, onions, asparagus, and many other crops, that they could not be grown successfully, and the application of a highly acidic fertilizer further accentu¬ ated the difficulty; yet other plants grew to perfection on this soil. I mention this merely as an illustration of the fact that we cannot conclude necessarily from the effect of a given substance or substances upon one kind of plant what the effect will be upon others.  Question: What do you think of cot¬ tonseed meal as a source of ammonia?  Answer: If you get meal which does not contain an undue amount of cotton¬ seed hulls, it generally has a fairly high availability, although it is not so quick in its action as the ammonia in dried blood, tankage, and dried fish.  Mr. Beech: What can you say regard¬ ing calcium cyanamid? I am aware that it is considered to be destructive to plant nematodes. I also understand it carries a considerable amount of lime and that it should be applied some time in advance of the date of seeding.  Answer: It is undoubtedly true that this material is destructive to nematodes; but in order to prove highly effective in this respect, it would have to be used in far greater quantities than should be rec¬ ommended in ordinary agricultural prac¬ tice, especially in view of its high content   of nitrogen and lime. The material does have the advantage of supplying some lime, providing the plants grown and the soils used require it. It is also true that dicyanodiamid is formed from it when it comes in contact with moisture in the soil; and this material exerts a poisonous action upon plant roots until it, in turn, is decomposed by the micro-organisms and by chemical changes taking place within the soil. In general it should be applied two or preferably three weeks be¬ fore the seed is planted. It can be mixed with fertilizer in small quantities under such conditions that practically all of the nitrogen is transformed into urea, which is a most excellent source of ammonia for plants. Under other conditions of manu¬ facture, dicyanodiamid may be formed, so that here again the skill and experience of the manufacturer come into play.  Calcium cyanamid has been found to be highly injurious to workmen who are brought extensively into contact with it in its natural state, especially if they have been imbibing alcoholic liquors. And I may add that I am not bringing this up as an argument in favor of prohibition, even in this dry city.  Mr. Gray: Just a question in relation to bluestone. There are thousands of barrels of it used annually in this State; and in connection with your experiment, you show that the recovery of the trees was not necessarily due to bluestone. Where there are thousands of dollars at stake in connection with die-back, what would you advise a grower to do if the disease appears?  Dr. Wheeler: I should by all means advise its use, until a time when some-       117   thing better is found as a remedy or until we know how to prevent the disease. However, I should also advise great care in its use and the application of relatively small quantities. I hope some day we may know more about it and how it acts. Until we do, we cannot use it most in¬ telligently.  Question: I wish to ask what results would be secured by the application of sulphate of iron to the leaves of trees which show lack of color, or frenching?  Dr. Wheeler: I think it is impossible at this time to predict surely what effect spraying with protosulphate of iron would have. Pineapples have been sprayed with it successfully in an exten¬ sive way in the Sandwich Islands on soils which contained excessive amounts of manganese, and where the plants were not able to secure enough iron under the usual cultural conditions. Upon spraying the leaves, the plants absorbed the iron and developed a healthy color and normal crops became possible.  In Porto Rico, Gile found that lime caused chlorosis and a bleaching effect on pineapples, which was overcome by spray¬ ing with protosulphate of iron. This re¬ sult indicates that the addition of lime to the soil rendered the iron so insoluble that the plants were not able to take up enough of it. Recent successful experi¬ ments have been made in spraying con¬ ifers with protosulphate of iron. Re¬ peated sprayings with a i% solution caused certain kinds of pine trees to de¬ velop normally and to develop good color, whereas the use of a 2% solution resulted in positive injury to the trees.   It should be determined at the outset by a few careful experiments what strength may be used on citrus trees with¬ out injury. The next problem will then be to ascertain whether frenching can be overcome to any extent by such spraying. Doubtless the results will depend upon what causes the frenching; for, according to many observations by our best author¬ ities, it seems to be caused by several dif¬ ferent conditions. It would be of the ut¬ most interest and importance to have spraying experiments made with proto¬ sulphate of iron and possibly with ferric chloride wherever frenching has followed an application of lime, in order to ascer¬ tain if the condition can be corrected. In Porto Rico, Gile found that several* suc¬ cessive sprayings were necessary in order to accomplish the wished-for results with pineapples; and obviously the finer the spray and the more generally it is distrib¬ uted over the leaves, the better the results should be.  I should like to ask if anyone in this audience has sprayed with protosulphate of iron and, if so, with what result. I ask for the reason that about four years ago I suggested the idea of spraying with it to some of the members of this Society who were present at our meeting at Ar¬ cadia. I am not aware that any of them ever followed up the suggestion.  In general it has been found that when protosulphate of iron is applied to the soil, it is not so effective in overcoming chlorosis, or frenching, as it is when it is sprayed on the leaves, and very large quantities may often be necessary to cause material benefit if the application is made   118       to the soil. This is probably for the rea¬ son that lime and other basic compounds in the soil may make the iron insoluble as soon as the two compounds are brought into contact with each other.  Answer from the Audience: I have made experiments in spraying with proto¬ sulphate of iron, where the trees were very much frenched and bore small fruit, and the result from one to three sprayings was excellent. In other cases it apparent¬ ly did little or no good, but I presume the conditions giving rise to the frenching were different in the two cases.  Another answer: About four years ago, one or two acquaintances of mine had groves which showed frenching, and they suspected that this was due to a lack of iron; and after spraying them with protosulphate of iron from three to six times at rather frequent intervals, a marked improvement in the trees re¬ sulted.  Another answer: I have noticed cases of frenching in the Indian River region where it seemed probable that too much fertilizer had been used, and I am satis¬ fied that you must have a satisfactory amount of humus in the soil in order to get the best results from fertilizer.  Dr. Wheeler: I have had my attention called to cases of frenching which may have been caused by too much water and also by to deep cultivation and injury to the feeding roots. This injury to the roots results especially in cases where a   deep cutting disc or cutaway harrow is used instead of the acme harrow which works the soil only to a slight depth.  What has been said about the impor¬ tance of humus in the soil is deserving of special attention, since it is fundamental to the best results in growing practically all kinds of crops, including citrus trees. The humus may also play an important part in connection with the assimilation of iron. It is well known that where great accumulations of vegetable matter come in contact with sands containing iron, the iron is often so largely dissolved out that the sands become greatly bleached. This shows that the humus has a solvent action on the iron. It is much better to maintain conditions in the soil, if possible, which will prevent frenching than to take the chance of curing it after it appears.  Another point concerning which I would utter a caution is in regard to mak¬ ing spraying experiments with protosul- phate of iron on a large scale at the out¬ set. My advice would be to determine in a small way on a few branches, or at least on a few trees, what strength of proto- sulphate of iron will be tolerated without injury to the foliage or trees. By pro¬ ceeding cautiously in this way, no great damage can be done; and after this point is determined, you can then spray exten¬ sively with reasonable safety, provided you find it helpful.@@   
 The Branch Experiment Station@@   Wilmon Newell@@ Gainesville@@   A Branch Experiment Station, to be devoted primarily and essentially to the study of citrus problems, has been estab¬ lished near Lake Alfred, in Polk county, Florida. This is a branch station of the University of Florida Agricultural Ex¬ periment Station at Gainesville and, like the latter, is under the exclusive control and direction of the Board of Control. The branch station has been established in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 7379, Approved June 4, 1917. This Act authorized and directed the Board of Control “to locate, establish and maintain a Branch Experiment Sta¬ tion, in or near Winter Haven, Polk coun¬ ty, in the citrus growing section of the State, where insect pests, diseases and other agencies, affecting the production of citrus fruits and citrus trees shall be studiedprovided, that no branch station should be established until lands, moneys, groves and other things of the value of not less than $10,000 should be donated for the use and purposes of the Branch Station.  By the summer of 1919, donations and subscriptions to this amount were secured by a committee of Polk county citrus growers, consisting of Messrs. S. F. Poole, J. A. Snively, J. H. Ross, H. W. Snell, L. L. Davis, A. M. Tilden, C. H. Thompson and W. L. Drew. The Board   of Control shortly thereafter, on July 14, 1919, held its regular monthly meeting at Winter Haven and, in connection there¬ with, visited and inspected various pro¬ posed sites for the Branch Station, finally deciding upon an 84-acre property located on the Dixie Highway, about one mile northeast of Lake Alfred and forming, at that time, a part of the holdings of the Florida Fruitlands Company. This tract of land was donated for the purposes of the station by the Florida Fruitlands Company, the Board of Control merely refunding out of the cash donations made, the actual cost of planting and bringing the 14J4 acres of grove on the property to its condition at time the prop¬ erty was transferred to the Board. This amounted to $5,900.00.  From December 1, 1919, to March 1, 1921, there has been expended on the property in fences, clearing, fertilizer, es¬ tablished seed beds, superintendent’s sal¬ ary, etc., the amount of $3,005.53, so that on March 1, 1921, there remained, out of the original donation of $10,000.00, a balance of $1,094.67. Since the latter date the Florence Villa Packing Associa¬ tion has paid over to the Board, for the Branch Station, $1,282.15 and the Coun¬ ty Commissioners of Polk county, $2,- 500.00, so that the total cash resources (as of date March 1, 1921), out of   119    120       which running expenses are paid and for permanent improvements are $4,876.82.  On October 1, 1920, Mr. John H. Jef¬ feries was appointed superintendent of the Branch Station and has given the property his constant and efficient atten¬ tion since that time.  As a citrus property, the Branch Sta¬ tion is almost ideal. For the most part the land is sandy, typical of the Ridge Section and the topography gently roll¬ ing. As stated above, 14*^ acres are in citrus grove. About 12 acres have been cleared and will be devoted in part to cit¬ rus and in part to ornamental grounds, seed beds, etc. About 1 y ]/ 2 acres are in meadow and marsh and the remaining 40 acres are as yet uncleared. It is undoubt¬ edly in the latter area that the principal experimental work with citrus will be conducted.  You will bear in mind that no appropri¬ ation has been made for the Branch Sta¬ tion, that no federal funds are available for use in connection with it and the total resources have consisted and still consist of the donations mentioned above. Un¬ der such circumstances work has had to proceed slowly. Nevertheless, consider¬ able has been accomplished in the way of preparation for the serious business yet to come. Since acquisition of the prop¬ erty by the Board of Control about 12 acres of land have been cleared, plowed and placed in good tilth, about half the total area has been placed under substan¬ tial fence, seed beds laid out, and a small tool house constructed. Through the kindness of the City Council of Lake Al¬ fred a road running the full length of the property, along its east side, has been sur¬   faced with clay. Dr. R. W. Ruprecht, Physiological Chemist of the Experiment Station, is conducting on the Branch Sta¬ tion property a study of the cause of die- back and for this purpose is utilizing the young 10-acre grove consisting of four varieties.  It appears advisable, before proceeding with the clearing of the main tract, and with the platting and planting to citrus, to have a thorough soil survey, topog¬ raphy survey and biological survey made of the entire property. The information recorded by such surveys may go far, in future years, in explaining the outcome of experiments. We have not the funds now to make these surveys and they will have to wait upon legislative appropria¬ tions, but this work should precede all of the experimental work proper, as form¬ ing a proper basis for it. We do not want hap-hazard results from the Branch Station. We also have in mind giving careful consideration to the planting, so that plats strictly comparable as to drain¬ age, soil and past floral history will be obtained. This calls for careful study, based on the preliminary surveys and, doubtless also, conferences with various citrus authorities. Do not be surprised therefore, if the plantings on the Branch Station do not show up with incredible rapidity, for it is going to be our policy to “make haste slowly” and, as far as possible, avoid undoing, in future years, things hastily done in the beginning. Kindly remember too, that we intend to have at Lake Alfred an Experiment Sta¬ tion and not a curiosity shop or a tropical fair.       121   The plans of the Board contemplate the early construction of a cottage for the superintendent, the cost of which can largely or entirely be defrayed out of the funds now in hand. In addition, as funds become available, it is planned to install a unit electric lighting plant and waterworks and sewage plants. As far as possible, these will be made models of what such outfits should be for typical and up-to-date Florida country homes.  The lines of experimental work to be taken up, when all is in readiness, will be greatly varied, including such research projects as variety tests, insect and plant disease problems, propagation methods, etc. One can see at a glance that there are unlimited opportunities for investiga¬ tional work with citrus in Florida and all of the experiments and problems suggest¬ ed by the growers cannot be taken up at once. On the contrary, attention must first be given to those problems most cry¬ ing for solution or which presents pros¬ pects for prompt solution with results im¬ mediately applicable by the majority of growers. The establishment of the vari¬ ous citrus plats and the building and equipment of a laboratory, in addition to the superintendent’s cottage, will open the way for co-operation with various work¬ ers of the U. S. Department of Agricul¬ ture and there is no doubt but what many co-operative experiments will be conduct¬   ed at the station. In fact, some prelim¬ inary arrangements in this direction have already been made.  So far as actual research work is con¬ cerned, the Branch Station is now virtu¬ ally “marking time,” waiting for the leg¬ islature to provide for its needs. As a matter of information, you will be inter¬ ested in knowing that the Board of Con¬ trol in its budget shortly to be presented to the State Legislature, will ask for the following funds for the Branch Station:  Salary of superintendent, 2 years  at $2,000_$ 4,000  Current expenses, including labor, experiments, etc., 2 years at  $5,350-10,700  Permanent improvements, includ¬ ing laboratory building, water supply, fencing, etc., per an¬ num at $8,300_16,600  Total for 2 years ending June 30,1923- $31.300  It is well to remember, too, that no fed¬ eral support for the Branch Station will be forthcoming at any time: the Branch Station is exclusively a State institution and if the legislators do not provide for this promising infant it must necessarily meet an early and untimely end.@@        
 An Example of Non-Cultivation in Citrus Groves@@   H. B. Stevens@@ DeLand@@   I have been asked to say something about planting and cultivating a citrus grove. I presume it is desired that I tell of our experience at DeLand in the grow¬ ing of trees on the high pine lands where the trees were left standing.  About ten years ago, we decided late in the winter, to move some of our trees. As it was then too late to clear the land or even thin out the pine trees, we plant¬ ed our orange trees among the pine trees without removing any of them. These trees have done well and during the cold of 1917 we found the pines a great pro¬ tection. They bear every year and the fruit is fine in quality. We dug holes to plant the trees, but have not plowed, har¬ rowed or even hoed the ground. The only cultivation that they have received is the mowing of the grass when neces¬ sary. We use a mineral fertilizer and scatter it on the ground, without working it in. We find that these trees do not take any more fertilizer than those plant¬ ed in the open.  This first grove having done so well, we set other groves among the pines, in every case thinning out the pines to some extent because we thought the first grove had too many in it. In none of these groves have we done any plowing, or harrowing, either before or after we planted the trees.   In our older groves that had been plowed for years, we have adopted the same practice of non-cultivation. We now fertilize and do nothing more. We mow as often as it is necessary to keep the grass and weeds from making seed. By cutting in time, we make them give back to the soil what they have been gathering from the air, thus enriching our land by that much and supplying plenty of hu¬ mus. The shading of the ground is also a benefit. Having followed this plan for a number of years, we find our fruit has better quality in addition to the good carrying trait of pine land fruit.  The number of times we mow, depends on growth of the grass and weeds; when they are high enough to cut we cut them; no matter how many times. I think four times is the most we have ever had to mow our groves in any one season.  In the fall we make fire lines around our groves, as we did when we plowed, and I do not think there is any more, if as much danger, of fire under this plan, than in the cultivated groves. As the grass and weeds are cut green, they rot quickly, and leave nothing but the stubble, which does not burn easily.  My observation has been that the soil is looser before it is plowed than it ever is after it has been broken up; except imme¬ diately after plowing. In addition, plow-   122        123   ing allows the growth of foreign weeds and grasses which take up more moisture, and make more work than the wire grass if the ground is left undisturbed. In 1877 I set out some trees in hammock land, and as I was very anxious that they do well, during the next spring I grubbed a circle around the trees and beyond the ends of the roots. During the second year I went back to grub a larger circle and found that I was cutting large roots that had grown beyond where I had grubbed the year before. I saw that those roots did not need any loosening of the ground, so I did no more grubbing.  We gave our young trees about one pound of fertilizer to each tree, three times a year during the first three years.   During the fourth year the amount to each tree was increased to three pounds, and applied three times during that year. We think now it would have been better if we had given two pounds to each tree at each application during the third year instead of only one pound, though the trees grew well and looked healthy. In the spring of the fourth year, we noticed some purple scale getting on the trees, which was the reason for increasing the amount of fertilizer so markedly at that time. We have found that a little addi¬ tional fertilizer generally rids the trees of purple scale, but an over dose may cause die-back. We have no die-back in our groves at present.@@   
 Practices in Groves Planted on Low Hammock  Soils@@   C. T. Pattillo@@ Shiloh, Florida@@   I am going to be brief so that when I have finished I may have time to sit back and listen to the discussion of the subject which I hope will follow. This I know will be both interest¬ ing and instructive to myself as well as to other owners of low hammock groves. It is not the purpose of this pa¬ per to discuss practices which may be ap¬ plicable to types of soil other than the low hammock. In such a discussion it would be well to give a short definition of the term “low hammock” and to begin the discussion with the clearing of the raw land.  The term “low hammock” is generally applied to a body of land covered with a heavy growth of cabbage palmetto, oak, maple and other hardwood trees and usu¬ ally requiring considerable drainage. The top soil is black or grayish in color and varies in consistency from a heavy muck to a light sandy loam, all types being sometimes mixed with marl or lime, rock and containing a great deal of natural humus. The sub-soil is often of marl or lime rock, which varys in depth from a few inches to several feet.  Clearing is generally accomplished by underbrushing the small growth, cutting down or digging out and burning all   hardwood trees but leaving a large pro¬ portion of the palmettoes, which afford considerable frost protection to the grove.  After staking the ground for trees, mounds are prepared, and will vary in height and diameter in accordance with the elevation above the water table. When necessary the sub-soil is first broken up by blasting. These mounds should be left three to six months before, planting, to al¬ low the ground to become mellow. At time of planting the mound is practically torn down and rebuilt, all roots and such material being carefully raked out. It is also advisable to dig down several feet through the. sub-soil, afterwards filling this in with surface dirt. In selecting the tree to be set preference is usually given to those budded or grafted on sour or¬ ange root. The actual planting is very much the. same as is practiced in any grove except that the trees are always somewhat elevated.  Cultivation for the first few years may best be accomplished by flatweeding and hand mowing, for generally the ground will be found too rough for mule or trac¬ tor. After that time the disc harrow, well blocked up so that it may cut only about two inches deep, will be the princi¬ pal implement for cultivation, plows be-   124        125   ing almost never employed. As a rule only one or two light cultivations a year are given with the harrow, this being done early in the spring. At the same time, the harrow is running the trees may all be circled with the weeding hoe or they may be spot-hoed, that is, hoeing the trees which need stimulation and allowing the. others to go unworked.  From the time that cultivation ceases until midsummer the weeds and grasses are kept mowed, after which time they are generally allowed to grow until mow¬ ing is resumed in the fall.  Fertilizing is different in the amount of ammonia used, three per cent usually being considered sufficient. Preference is very often given to fertilizers of purely chemical origin or base. The amount used per acre is less than on the lighter types of soils, there being present more natural plant food and less chance for that which is put on to leach away.   Spraying is not often necessary in low hammock groves because the friendly fungi thrive in the moist atmosphere and with very little help will control the whiteflies and the scale insects. Rust mites are rarely found on this type of grove.  Drainage is discussed last here but in the grove it should emphatically come first. I want to place a great deal of em¬ phasis upon drainage, for on that more than on any other one. thing depends the building and maintaining of a successful low hammock grove. If the grove has just ordinary treatment in every other way but sufficient and proper drainage, the trees will be pretty sure, to have on them a bountiful supply of thin, smooth skinned fruit of a good color and a deli¬ cate flavor, and which, best of all, will sell in the markets for a premium.@@   
 The Planting and Cultivation of Groves in the  Ridge Section@@   Max Waldron@@ Crooked Lake@@   One of the outstanding characteristics of citrus culture in Florida is that there exists a wide range of opinion among growers regarding the most satisfactory methods for developing a grove. Few industries exhibit such a lack of standard¬ ization; few such a profusion of mere no¬ tions. An important duty, therefore, of this Society is to standardize our grove practices wherever possible or where rea¬ sonable differences of methods exist to in¬ dicate why these are necessary. It is to avoid confusion of ideas, then, that this paper is limited to certain grove opera¬ tions in that part of Florida known as “The Ridge.” It will be found, however, that even though these statements are confined to well defined and uniform conditions, there will still exist many dif¬ ferences of opinion on such matters as the depth of planting; sources, amounts and time of fertilizing; time of plowing; methods of pruning; mowing of cover crops; treatment of diseases, etc. These opposing opinions add zest to the already fascinating game of citriculture and serve as an incentive for constructive competi¬ tion. In the efforts to demonstrate the effectiveness of our own methods, "we incidentally do other things tending to benefit a grove that might otherwise be neglected. However, under present eco¬ nomical conditions, it is especially neces¬   sary that we standardize our methods and reduce our operating expenses wherever it will not result in decreasing the vigor and capacity of the grove. Thus, for in¬ stance, one California Exchange packing house reduced the size of lemon wraps one inch each way, thereby saving $6,000 in one season.  Nowhere, perhaps is the citrus indus¬ try so thoroughly standardized as in the Ridge Section, for many of the groves there have been developed and are being successfully handled by large corpora¬ tions who adopted to a great extent the methods established by Dr. Inman, the father of the citrus industry in Polk county.  The “Ridge” is the backbone of Flor¬ ida, extending from Haines City to Se- bring, and like all backbones, is in the form of a series of elevations and depres¬ sions, the elevations being the rolling pine-clad hills and the depressions the wide and limpid lakes over which the cold winter winds are moderated to such an extent that the grower scarcely fears the frost. This backbone, however, is constructed mainly of sand instead of lime as are other backbones; in fact, there is so much sand on the Ridge that it seems to have become an integral part of the settlers there, resulting in a phe¬ nomenal development where a decade ago   126        127   there was a tractless wilderness. Sev¬ eral of the largest citrus projects in the world, together with thousands of small¬ er acreages, have made the Ridge of such major importance from a citrus stand¬ point that it is well for us to consider the methods obviously successful there.  Too much care cannot be exercised in the planting of a citrus tree; it rapidly be¬ comes very valuable and will live through many generations. The planting of it is one of the least expensive items in its long history, yet faulty setting often causes trees to be weakened or stunted for years before the cause is recognized, or it may result in physiological disturb¬ ances, bringing losses far greater than the cost of more careful setting. If one has occasion to let a contract for setting his trees it might be best to let it to the highest bidder instead of to the lowest. It invariably pays well to get the soil in the best of tilth before setting trees, pref¬ erably allow it to lie over for a season, but at any rate thoroughly pulverize it and remove the roots as the accumulation of roots and bunches of grass prevent the soil from settling well about the tree roots when planted, as well as causes it to dry out.  The most important consideration in planting a grove (aside from the soil) is to select good trees—trees with grey- green bark, vigorous looking buds, and a dense mass of fiber roots. The experi¬ ence of planting many thousands of trees has proven conclusively that invariably the ones which die or do poorly are those having a deficiency of fiber roots. The presence or absence of a tap root seems to be of little consequence, but if a tree   is weak on fibers you will be farther ahead to throw it away. Be merciless in culling out doubtful nursery stock; be merciless again after the tree has been set and made its first growth. All trees have enough vitality in them, if alive when planted, to push out a preliminary growth; in fact this would occur even if the roots were cut off, but if the growth the first year is not strong and vigorous it would be best to discard the tree and start anew.  On the loose sands of the Ridge sec¬ tion only trees on rough lemon stock should be used. This is a highly debat¬ able subject in other parts of the State but with those of us on the Ridge, the question is very thoroughly settled and we know of no one who would consider a commercial planting on sour stock on typical Ridge soil, unless the ground is near the lake level.  The setting of trees is expedited by means of the following method: Stake the land with stakes one inch square set preferably 25x30 feet. Drive these stakes down about fifteen inches, shovel away a hole deep enough to accommo¬ date the fiber roots, putting the dirt on both sides of the hole. Pull the stake and insert the tap root in the hole at such a depth that the crown roots will be level with the surface of the ground. The tap root being on a prolongation with the trunk, the tree will automatically right itself. With the stake, pack the soil thoroughly about the tap root so the tree will not settle, then carefully place the soil with the hands about the fiber roots, being careful to spread them out as they originally grew and to thoroughly pack   128       the. soil as it is placed in the hole. Water well on the day of planting and cover with a heavy dust mulch. Trees thus planted are bound to give good results.  By this time we are led to believe that nearly every member of this Society knows the proper way to cultivate a cit¬ rus grove on high pine land; how often to cultivate, when to commence and when to cease. It is a subject frequently dis¬ cussed and printed over and over again in our horticultural publications. Surely there is no excuse for not being convers¬ ant with it, yet a glance at many groves indicates that their owners have failed to observe some of the cardinal points of cultivation, the word cultivation here be¬ ing confined to the use of tillage tools.  Briefly to summarize the methods then, it may be said that cultivation commences about the first of February with an acme harrow and is repeated every two weeks until the commencement of the rains, af¬ ter which time trees over four years old are merely hoed while the younger ones are kept free from the voracious Natal grass by cultivating a strip six to eight feet wide along the tree row every two weeks. Once during the summer the cov¬ er crop is mowed. This cover crop is theoretically of beggar weed but some¬ how or other it always turns out to be Natal grass or else the very aggressive maiden cane. Shortly after the close of the rainy season, or surely before Feb¬ ruary first, all groves are plowed solid to a depth not to exceed four inches, thor¬ oughly disced and acmed.   On account of the fact that Natal grass is on the jump every day in the year it often becomes necessary to harrow be¬ fore February first, but it will usually be found that a winter warm enough to force the grass will also force the trees and after a tree has once started the with¬ holding of cultivation will not protect it from the cold. One must not regulate his grove work entirely by the calendar or by written rule. When we plead for a standardized citrus industry we do . not mean everything should be done by rote— we merely suggest the benefits accruing to the grower when he learns the correct reason for doing as he does and if he ap¬ plies this knowledge the standardization will be to a great extent automatic. If the industry were thus put upon a busi¬ ness-like basis our northern visitors would cease to comment upon the un¬ kempt condition of many of our groves and the inferior quality of our fruit, shipped when it has “70 per cent of color” and 30 per cent cholera morbus.  This paper is not meant to be an ex¬ haustive treatise on any phase of grove culture—it presupposes a general knowl¬ edge of the subject on the part of the au¬ dience. The title has been chosen largely in order to emphasize to the grower the necessity of analyzing his business with a view of eliminating inexpedient meth¬ ods and impractical notions, and it is be¬ lieved the methods in use on the Ridge demonstrate the present acme of Florida citrus culture, also the great success achieved there is due to the intensive ef¬ forts and uniform system of culture.@@   
 Suggestions for Increasing the Consumption of  Citrus Fruits@@   C. D. Kime@@ Orlando@@   It is human nature for us to seize upon a mole-hill, if you will pardon the abuse of the simile., and declare it the “moun¬ tain” that bars our path to success and higher prices. But calmer consideration makes us see that it is the multiplicity of “mole-hills” in our way that causes the trouble. One we can label exorbitant freight rates, another production costs, another cost of raw materials and sup¬ plies, and yet another lack of advertising to create a demand for our product. All of them are important, all of them big problems but none of them are the insur¬ mountable obstacle we are prone to think them to be.  Florida is no longer a collection of in¬ dividuals; it is a unity, a State. We are big enough to attack our problems to¬ gether. And what is more to the point we are so big in this year of 1921 that with the co-operation of the available agencies, there is not one of our prob¬ lems that cannot be solved. Let us for¬ get, for a few moments, ourselves, the individual, and think in terms of Florida the State. Let us attack our problems ac¬ cording to the old fable of the wagoner. This man was driving a very heavy load along a muddy way. At last he came to a part of the road so deep in mud his   wagon mired to the hubs. Every pull of the horses sank it deeper and deeper. So the wagoner threw down his whip and knelt and prayed to “Hercules, the Strong,” “O, Hercules, help me in this, my hour of distress.” But Hercules ap¬ peared to him and said: “Tut, tut, man, don’t sprawl there. Get up, put your shoulder to the wheel.”  Self help often comes along unexpected channels. I beg leave to submit for your approval and action the following propo¬ sition.  FLORIDA ORANGE WEEK  Let us have a real, big, full sized or¬ ange week , for the State of Florida.  Let us plan this week to open our win¬ ter season of 1921-22.  Let us usher in this week with a proc¬ lamation declaring the first annual “or¬ ange week” for the State of Florida, said proclamation to be duly signed and sealed by our Governor. Have this proc¬ lamation backed up by similar manifes¬ toes from the mayors of all towns within the State. Then let us secure the active co-operation of Chambers of Commerce, commercial bodies, newspapers, Rotari- ans, business houses, both local and State¬ wide, county commissioners, the Florida Citrus Exchange, fruit shipping compa-    130       nies, independent growers and shippers, hotel men, drug stores and soft drink dis¬ pensaries, Women’s Clubs, schools, rail¬ road development departments, and last but not least, and most important of all, the hearty support of every Floridian. A true Floridian is always with us on any proposition for the good of the State.  OBJECT OF ORANGE WEEK  First, to increase our knowledge con¬ cerning the use of citrus fruits at home.  Second, to increase the consumption of fruit and juice throughout the whole State during the shipping season.  HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTS  These objects to be accomplished by publicity through the press; by plac¬ ing of suitably colored advertising post¬ ers and designs in store windows, drug stores and fountains, in restaurants, and on sign boards; by using orange designs on letter heads, and special stamps de¬ signed to advertise orange uses. These posters should all illustrate the uses of orange juice, orange recipes, and the healthfulness of the juice as a drink. Let each town have an orange festival, with an orange “float” parade, orange week dances, orange week dinners by va¬ rious organizations and in the private home use the fruit daily.  As the movement grows, and it is bound to grow, let us plan for an orange show week, and usher in the “king of fruits ” with a pageant, making “orange week,” a real event of each year.   RESULTS THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED  Let us forecast for a moment what we may expect in the way of results from our efforts. During the winter our northern friends visit with us to enjoy our climate. The population of the larger towns of the State will show an increase of from five to forty thousand. It is not too much to say that for three months out of the year we have an increase of popula¬ tion in Florida of 100,000 people. In the land where fruit is produced by the mil¬ lions of boxes each season, these poten¬ tial consumers are actually denied the privilege of drinking orange juice. Good ripe fruit is secured with difficulty. Culls and drops are common. Here where fruit is plentiful these potential adver¬ tisers are neglected or are overcharged for a poor quality product.  At our drug stores and soda fountains the fresh juice is rarely to be had. We are neglecting an active demand amount¬ ing to thousands of boxes annually, that is already at hand. We are neglecting the development of a greater demand among the thousands that through habit or lack of interest are now drinking the poorer syrup and acid concoctions that have lit¬ erally taken our market by storm.  We are not alone in this position, as from the pages of the “California Cit- rograph,” we learn that the Fruit Grow¬ ers Exchange of that State is adopting the “See-It-Made” plan. They have in¬ stalled electric juice extractors in their experimental stands and instead of selling orange and lemon juice from large glass coolers the new way is to extract the juice from each orange in full view of the cus¬ tomer after he has ordered.       131   This “See-It-Made” way of serving pure fresh juice is the method they are urging for eastern fountains this year. The work is in charge of a Fresh Fruits Drink Department. It takes by this method only eleven seconds to prepare the fresh drink, brimful of ice and sweet¬ ened with pure sugar. The price has been raised from five, to ten cents and the size of the glass increased from six to ten ounces. Their reports indicate that busi¬ ness under the new method will be both popular and profitable.  That they are alive to the gravity of the situation in this western State, the following editorial from the California Citrograph will show.  “Orange drinks have appeared by the hundreds since prohibition. Either the public has developed a tremendous thirst for orange colored concoctions or the bottlers think they have. Unfortunately many of the preparations contain no or¬ ange juice and are lacking in organic salts and acids and the. vitamines which give the great health value to citrus fruits. In most instances they are made of sweet¬ ened carbonated water, flavored with oil extracts from orange peel, artificially col¬ ored and combined with a base of citric acid. It has recently come to the atten¬ tion of the Bureau of Chemistry that in some instances mothers, misled by the la¬ bels, are feeding these Take’ orange drinks to infants under the impression they were giving orange juice as recom¬ mended by physicians. The best way,' says the Literary Digest, ‘is to buy the fruit and squeeze out the juice.’ ”  In California the employees, salesmen and growers are urged to order orange¬   ade or lemonade and insist on getting a drink from the fresh fruit. For if you will allow another quotation: “It  does not take a majority to establish a preference. Any merchant knows that only a few of his customers specify brands. The others don’t specify any¬ thing. So he carries the goods preferred by the discriminating few with the assur¬ ance that these goods will satisfy the less particular.”  The very life of our industry in Flor¬ ida depends on increased consumption of fruit at a profitable price. Demanding limeades and orangeades is a sure way to increase fruit consumption enormously in our own State.  The California product is advertised tremendously. Every point is stressed and dwelt upon. Its defects are declared to be virtues. Even the thick skin is held up to the buying public as a virtue. Why ? Because it will easily peel. California does not hesitate to advertise “Sunkist” orange juice. They push it not only throughout the East but also at home. Yet we all know that the Florida product is without a rival in the quantity and fla¬ vor of the juice it contains. The. Florida orange is literally bursting with the de¬ licious fluid, so full indeed, that it cannot be cut without overflowing. Drinking the juice is a privilege, an aid to health for the invalid, a tonic for the weak, and a pleasure, and delight for the robust and healthy.  In order to forecast more accurately the results of an “orange week” repre¬ sentative soft drink dispensers were vis¬ ited in person from Tampa to Daytona and down the East Coast. A list of ques-   ll   132       tions were prepared to which the follow¬ ing is a summary of the answers.  Average price necessary for the pure juice drink in large glasses will be eleven cents with war tax included.  With the exception of those stores hav¬ ing a rush period it is better to extract the juice separately for each order in sight of the consumer.  With two exceptions (one at Tampa and another at Mt. Dora), no attempt has been made to advertise pure juice drinks on an extensive scale. These two stores have had wonderful results.  The demand for so-called orange drinks has been great or small in propor¬ tion to the attempt made to push the pure juice. In other words, where the pure drink has been pushed, the demand for artificially prepared stuff has materially lessened and disappeared entirely.  The motor-driven juice extractors have proven very satisfactory in those stands where the rush hour is not heavy and yet of sufficient volume to create a need for a faster method than the glass hand press. The glass hand press has been satisfac¬ tory in small towns having good trades but no rush hours of any volume.  In those stands having heavy rush hours, the electric driven extractor seems to be too slow. These places need a re¬ serve supply of juice from which to draw. In the larger towns a delivery service of the fresh juice, to such stands may be ad¬ visable, though the California result of eleven seconds per glass certainly de¬ serves consideration.  One stand from Tampa reports that they have had wonderful success with the motor-driven extractor, paying for   their machine in less than a month of ac¬ tual use. Their price for an exceptionally well prepared product is fifteen cents.  While many of the men feel that forty to fifty dollars is too high a price for a machine for juice-extracting purposes, not a one was found who was not deeply interested in the juice business and who was not heartily in favor of pushing in¬ creased consumption campaigns.  Sources of fruit supply varied accord¬ ing to locality. This means that in larger towns fluctuations in price are to be ex¬ pected, depending on distance from pack¬ ing houses, available groves, etc. One man with a nearby source of supply esti¬ mated total cost of drink including over¬ head, at four and one half cents per glass.  The method of squeezing juice out in advance and holding same in large glass containers has been tried repeatedly and invariably brought poor results and fail¬ ure of the attempt in the end.  With the exceptions mentioned above the only attempt to advertise orange drinks have been by local editorials in the press and by the Florida Citrus Ex¬ change. There is no question that these attempts, small as they have been, have brought results.  With one store in a small town, esti¬ mating a box and a half daily average for a four-months season, a very conservative estimate will give us a total consumption throughout South Florida of close to 400 cars of fruit, in drinks alone, to say noth¬ ing of the advertising value of such work and the. additional fruit that will be sold to tourists for home consumption.  The thoughts left with you herein are not new. They have been advanced be-       133   fore but never with the time as suitable for action as at present. We need these things, this advertising to the winter vis¬ itor, this greater interest among our own people. The glory of achievement be¬ longs to “us.” Let us then follow the ad¬ vice of this “Hercules, the Strong,” put our united shoulder to this problem and make progress.  “Squeeze out some golden orange juice, Stir in some sugar sweet,  Fill brimming full with fine chipped ice, Then drink—’Tis Florida’s finest treat.”  Dr. Fairchild: I would like to make a suggestion and I would like to preface it with an experience I had during the war trying to popularize dried vegetables. A Californian got into the game of market¬ ing dried vegetables and arrived in Wash¬ ington with a carload of all kinds of dried vegetables with the idea of having Pres¬ ident Wilson start the ball rolling. Some¬ how or another he. got into my office.  I said to Mr. H-, “You can’t get  President Wilson to eat your dried vege¬ tables.” The next idea he had was a luncheon to which he would invite the members of the. cabinet and others and this luncheon was to be entirely dried veg¬ etables. I had had some experience in trying to popularize some of these things and so I said, “Don’t serve more than three kinds anyway.” He thought that would be a good idea, but I saw him leav¬ ing the office where he. had these things stored with an “armful of vegetables. That luncheon remains in my memory and will always remain there. I was invited to it as a member of Mr. Hoover’s staff,   which was invited as a body. I was par¬ ticularly interested in dried vegetables be¬ cause there is such a promising field in dried vegetables. He started off with dried spinach, dried cabbage, dried Brus¬ sels sprouts, dried carrots and dried on¬ ions on the beefsteak. By this time even the waiters had become much amused over the situation. The people ate these things, but this particular friend of mine on Hoover’s staff, a young lady that I was very anxious to get interested in these things, went back and was deathly sick.  Speaking now as a man who comes down here every winter, I am heartily in favor of an orange, week. I have never been able to understand why Florida does not challenge California to get competi¬ tion of this orange business. There is no topic of conversation that is more in¬ teresting and more frequent among northern visitors than whether the Flor¬ ida or California orange is the best. Now, why is it not desirable during your or¬ ange week to pick out men whose veracity on this subject is as reliable as members of the Supreme Court, stage it in one of your citrus centers here and challenge California to sell their best citrus fruit to you and have a try out on this citrus business and let the northerner know whether the California or Florida orange is the best orange? You would get a tre¬ mendous amount of business out of it if properly handled and, personally speak¬ ing, I believe they would go down in de¬ feat.  Mr. -: Mr. Chairman, I would  like to ask Mr. Kime if he anticipates in¬ cluding grapefruit in his orange week?     134       Mr. Kime: Personally, I am very willing to include them both.  Mr. Sample: I have another sugges¬ tion and that is with reference to the speaker’s suggestion of 1921 and ’22. I would suggest that 1921 be eliminated and make, it ’22. It is the kind of fruit that is offered the visitors that is killing all the advertising that has been done. The northerner coming down here to eat ripe grapefruit and oranges goes into the stores and gets fruit that would not be of¬ fered by a Dago stand in the North and that is why they don’t like Florida fruit. Another thing, we don’t have fruit avail¬ able in September for orange week. Now everybody that is an actual grower and not just a commission man who wants big prices will agree, with me in this. Janu¬ ary or February is the time for a grape¬ fruit or orange week and I would like to see it a combination week.  Mr. Skinner: Undoubtedly this grape¬ fruit problem, as Mr. Sample has men¬ tioned it, is the real thing we are up against, because we are producing it so fast, but I want to relate an incident that has happened this winter in the Hillsbor- ough Hotel in Tampa and in St. Peters¬ burg. There is a professor there who is called a dietitian, who professes to cure certain diseases. He was arrested for using the mails to defraud. At his trial he, had as many men as are here present, men of my age and older whom he had surely cured, and the court threw the thing out without ever letting it go to the jury. It came out in the trial that each of these persons, these men and women, mostly men, were using the juice of four grapefruit every day and some   of them lemons in addition. I want to tell you it increased the consumption of grapefruit in the Hillsborough Hotel more than twice over and one of the gro¬ cery men told me that he just could not keep grapefruit in his store; they took them out as fast as he could get them in. Yesterday I heard some man make the remark that a physician at Lakeland had written some people that he had been fol lowing up the uses of grapefruit juice and that he had found that a grapefruit re¬ duced blood pressure. Now, if grapefruit is advertised to do that and if it does it, we are going to have, a big market for it if you will just let the market grow.  Mr. -: If people threatened with  influenza will simply undress and go to bed, abstaining from all food entirely for just two or three days and drink noth¬ ing but orange juice, they will be both sustained and cured and go out on the fourth day.  Mr.-: I think it may be of in¬  terest to members of the Society to know that within the past week we have had the first reports of scientific investiga¬ tions as to the vitamine content of grape¬ fruit. Those of you who read the Cali- fornia-Florida advertisements of citrus fruits know that during the last year or two we have been rather guarded in re¬ ferring to the vitamine part of the or¬ ange. We did it because we did not know very much; even the medical authorities at first themselves were just a little bit leery as to just how far claims could be made in that connection. Different state¬ ments were made as to the vitamine val¬ ue of oranges. You understand, of course, that the claim is that the vitamine         135   element is the health-giving element of fruit and that has been quite clear to me. but it was only by assumption that we could include grapefruit. There had been no definite experiments and we assumed a good deal in making grapefruit embrace the same qualities, trying to word our ad¬ vertisements so that we could escape what happened to Mr. Skinner’s friend. How¬ ever, some exhaustive experiments have recently been carried on, and, as I re¬ member them, they are almost uniform in showing that the vitamine content of grapefruit in proportion to that of or¬ anges is as 8 to 7, so that apparently we have been quite thoroughly justified in including grapefruit.  Now, Mr. President, if I may include just one word more, whenever there is an effort to increase the demand for Florida citrus fruit and I want to appeal to the members of the Florida Horticultural So¬ ciety as I have to a large number of com¬ mercial bodies in Florida, let us quit boosting California. Every time that we start to talk anything about a movement —this does not apply to citrus only—we hear a lot of talk about the spirited adver¬ tising of California as compared to Flor¬ ida. Now, I yield to no man in my admi¬ ration for California, the way she does things and so on, but Los Angeles does not have a thing on Miami and the Flor¬ ida advertisements for the popularizing of citrus fruits. I want to tell you this, which comes from the official record— the California Growers Exchange and the two next largest operators of fruit and fruit products have absolutely changed their plans of campaign made a year or two ago and have adopted almost in ex¬   act detail and substituted therefor a plan that the Florida co-operative growers have consistently followed for the last seven or eight years. I am proud of the fact that they have 1 done that for I think it is one thing that we ought not to fail to consider and that it ought in some de¬ gree to cause us to be just a little more proud of Florida and not quite so enthu¬ siastically boost California every time we start to talk advertising. I thank you.  Mr. C. D. Kime: Mr. President, I make a motion that the Florida Horticul¬ tural Society go on record as favoring an orange-grapefruit week during the year 1922.  It was moved, seconded and passed that the Florida Horticultural Society go on record as in favor of an orange-grape fruit week.  Mr. J. W. Sample: If I may at this time, I would like to introduce a resolu¬ tion. A year ago I am informed this So¬ ciety went on record as indorsing what at that time was known as the “No Fence League.” I would like to introduce to¬ day this resolution: (Reads resolution.)  I would like also to have a copy of this resolution sent to the Legislature — I should say to a member of each House. I should ask a reindorsement by this Soci ¬ ety and the indorsement of this bill. I have not read the bill but if the members of the Society want the bill read I will read it.  Mr. W. J. Krome: I doubt whether there is any member of this Society who individually, personally, more heartily endorses that resolution and the bill than I do but this is a meeting of the Florida State Horticultural Society. Under our   136       by-laws the meetings of this Society are to be devoted to the discussion of the practical and technical side of horticul¬ tural topics only and under our by-laws it is made mandatory upon officers to over-rule any motion or resolution which will tend to permit this Society to partic¬ ipate in partisan politics or mercantile ventures. By that by-law I am obliged to ask the chairman to rule that motion out of order.  C. E. Calkins: Will the gentleman who has just left the floor please, demon¬ strate to me what is more important to me than the destruction of my grove by cattle? I think this matter is perfectly incident to our consideration. (Ap¬ plause).  L. B. Skinner: I will have to side with Mr. Krome although I live in a county where the people have cut the fences into   about six inch pieces and are suffering from cattle like my friend over there and a lot of people do that, and while we could vote on that at a mass meeting I doubt as to the wisdom or the advisability of doing it as a Horticultural Society, although I am in favor of it.  H. H. Hume: I know that in commit¬ ting ourselves one way or the other today we are treading on very thin ice—I hap¬ pen to be one of those who are in pretty close contact with the Legislature and I would like for Mr. Sample to have, gotten his bill through without appealing to the Horticultural Society but I will have to rule against Mr. Krome. Those in favor of adopting resolutions read by Mr. Sam¬ ple will signify same by the show of the hand. Opposed same sign. Resolution as read by Mr. Sample was passed.   Some Problems in the Preservation of Citrus  Fruit Juices   Seth S. Walker, Tampa   Probably there is not a member of this distinguished Society who does not real¬ ize to some extent the importance of the fruit products industry to the citrus growers in particular and to the State at large. It has been freely predicted by those who are, in a position to know, that this is the real key to the situation; that the enormous increase in production each year is soon going to out-strip the in¬ crease in consumption of fresh fruits and that the only hope of keeping prices up to a profitable figure lies in the with¬ holding from the market of the low grade, off sized, and unattractive article which at present constitutes a large pro¬ portion of the, fruit shipped. Another, perhaps equally important, factor is the huge amount of drops and packing house culls which now go to the dump, a dead loss. It has been variously estimated that ten to twenty per cent of the entire crop will come under this head. Probably ninety per cent of this wasted fruit, if used at once, is perfectly suitable for manufacture into fruit products. In this ' connection let me emphasize that “cull” fruits are not as a rule “spoiled” fruits. In fact they are often the sweetest, juici¬ est fruits in the bins, and are culled out merely because of skin blemishes, thorn   pricks, or other minor defects which ren¬ der them unfit for shipping long dis¬ tances.  If the lower grades of fruit now ship¬ ped are withheld from the market there will be no difficulty in disposing of the higher grades; and if the dead loss of the cull pile is converted into money, there will be an enormous decrease of the over¬ head cost per box of fruit marketed, mak-. it actually possible to sell the good fruit at lower prices than are now necessary. Thus the consumer as well as the grower will benefit.  What then shall be done with the low grade fruit? The answer seems easy. “Convert it into fruit products,” every¬ body says in the same breath. But if it were as easy to do as it is to say the fu¬ ture of the citrus growers would loom up bright indeed.  There have been many different at¬ tempts made to solve the problem. Some have made marmalades, others jellies, and others candy; some have bottled the juice, and still others have extracted the essen¬ tial oil from the peel. A number of these endeavors, especially those in connection with marmalade, candy, and juice, have met with a gratifying degree of success, but it is evident to the most casual observ-    138       er that the. citrus fruit product industry in Florida is still in its infancy.  It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss, except in an indirect way, the various reasons why this industry is not better developed. I shall rather confine myself to my subject as it appears on the program and discuss some of the prob¬ lems which are met in the preservation of citrus fruit juices.  There are several reasons why it is desirable to produce juices, as well as the more usual products such as marmalade and candy. The volume of fruit to be utilized is so great that we need a variety of products in order to get better distri¬ bution. The juice is the, real, essential meat of the fruit—practically the only constituent for which the fresh fruit is eaten The bottled juice more nearly re¬ sembles the original flavor of the fruit than do any of the other products thus far produced commercially. The juice requires less sugar than do such products as marmalade, and candy. There is an enormous demand for all kinds of soft drinks, particularly in these days of des¬ ert dryness (of course this argument does not apply to Miami, thanks to its nearness to Bimini!). Not only are soft drinks in demand, but those with citrus fruit flavors are. especially popular, as evidenced by the large number of imita¬ tions on the market. These considera¬ tions leave little room to doubt that there is a real demand for citrus fruit juices.  What, then, are the characteristics of a desirable bottled juice, and what are the difficulties to be overcome in produc¬ ing it?   It would seem perfectly obvious that the desirable thing is to preserve the juice just as it comes from the fruit with all of its original flavor and appearance, so that the consumer may pour from the bottle the same identical juice that he might squeeze from fresh fruit. This has always been the high ideal of those scientists who have worked with other fruit juices, and it has been the ideal of most of those working with citrus juices. But the difficulties to be. overcome are much greater than those encountered with most of the other fruits.  First of all comes the mechanical prob¬ lem of extracting the juice. With grapes, apples, or berries, the fruit can be chop¬ ped up and placed directly in presses, but citrus fruits are built along different lines and have to be handled with more respect. Although there are a few au¬ thorities who recommend pressing the whole fruit, most of them agree that it is very desirable if not absolutely neces¬ sary to peel the fruit first. If the fruit is not peeled, the juice will contain large amounts of essential oil and of gluco- side, which in the case of grapefruit is ex¬ tremely bitter. A reasonable amount of the essential oil is not objectionable in the fresh squeezed juice, since it adds to the characteristic citrus fruit flavor, but in most cases such juice will, on keeping, develop a decidedly unpleasant “turpen- tiney” flavor due to changes which take place in the, oil. It may be possible to work out methods for treating the juice so as to destroy the bitterness and prevent changes in the oil. In that case it would doubtless be much more economical to omit the peeling process.       139   After the juice is extracted the next step is the clarification, or removal of cell membranes and other suspended solids. Some have attempted to accomplish this by filtration but in most cases have met with small success because the colloidal, gelatinous material contained in the juice immediately clogs up the filtering me¬ dium. I know of only one case where the filtration of freshly extracted juice appears to have been successful on a com¬ mercial scale. This company is said to have a special secret process which re¬ moves not only the. suspended solids but also the colloidal matter which is an in¬ herent constituent of the fresh juice.  Other methods of clarification depend on the use of centrifugal machines (something on the order of a cream sepa¬ rator) and in still other cases the juice is allowed to stand until the solids settle out and the clarified juice can be drawn off from the top. A very important point, on which opinions differ widely, is the degree of clarification which is most desirable. This point will be re¬ ferred to again later on.  The clarified juice must next be pas¬ teurized before it is ready for the market. The problem here consists of finding the happy medium between too much heat and not enough heat. And right here let me emphasize that the average person seems to have an absolutely wrong im¬ pression of the real problems involved in preserving citrus fruit juices. Most of them think that the main trouble is to prevent alcoholic fermentation, but this is a great mistake. In fact it is really astonishing how little heat is needed to accomplish this, particularly in the case   of grapefruit juice. However, there are other biological factors to contend with, such as mold growths and certain sec¬ ondary fermentations which produce a very unpleasant taste. On the other hand, if too much heat is used the del¬ icate fresh fruit flavor is injured and a “cooked” taste develops. Another impor¬ tant factor is the time of heating, and so we must find just the right combination of time and temperature and the best way to apply the heat, in order to secure per¬ fect results.  And now we come to the real troubles. A good many workers have solved the above mentioned problems in a more or less satisfactory way only to find that the. juice was not permanent. After keep¬ ing it for some time—anywhere from a few days to several months—the color turns dark, the colloidal solids precipitate out, and, as a rule, a stale, unpleasant flavor develops. This combination of dark color and precipitated solids ren¬ ders the product unsightly and unsaleable, for it is a well known fact that the sale of such products depends very largely upon their appearance. A few workers, especially in recent years, have met this situation by following the. line of least resistance. That is to say they have given up their efforts to produce a cloudy, natural colored juice and are recommend¬ ing a product from which all of the colloi¬ dal solids have been removed and which has more or less darkened in color.  This brings us right down to the heart of the matter—the real point of my pa¬ per—which is a discussion of cloudy, nat¬ ural colored juice versus clear, dark, un¬ natural juice. Which is the better prod-   140       uct? And, aside from the question of real merit, which is the more saleable product ?  It seems to me that there can be no serious doubt as to the first question. Surely the ideal thing in all such work is to imitate Nature as closely as possible. Nature has made citrus fruit juices cloudy and of certain definite colors, and any product which does not conform to this description is not fresh, natural juice, whatever else it may be. But the trouble goes deeper than that. For, although it does seem that the colloidal material— the material which gives the juice its nat¬ ural cloudiness—has little to do with the flavor or food value, the darkening of color is nothing more, or less than a mild form of decay and is always accompanied by injury to the flavor. If you should cut a fresh grapefruit and then let it stand around until the outer surface dark¬ ened ever so little, you would immediate¬ ly pronounce it “spoiled” and consign it to the garbage can. Why then, should you use any lower standards for judging the bottled juice?  Nevertheless, when it comes to a com¬ mercial proposition — particularly the soda fountain business—there is some¬ thing to be said in favor of a clear, dark juice. The argument is that the general public, not being acquainted with the ap¬ pearance of genuine fresh squeezed juice, will nine times out of ten choose a dark, clear liquid because of its resemblance to Coca-Cola and other popular drinks. There is no doubt much truth in this, at least so far as the first trial is concerned, but it seems probable that a customer who could be persuaded to sample both kinds   of juice, would specify the natural col¬ ored and flavored product on his repeat orders.  In fact, if a satisfactory product can be made to retain its natural color and cloud¬ iness indefinitely, it would seem to be merely a matter of judicious advertising to educate the public up to an apprecia¬ tion of its genuineness. It is a very sig¬ nificant thing that some of the largest advertisers of artificial and imitation cit¬ rus fruit drinks are laying great stress on the statement that their products are “cloudy like the natural fresh fruit juice.”  Please note that this last paragraph contains a big “if”—“if a satisfactory product can be made to retain its natural color and cloudiness indefinitely.” That's where the rub comes. Some very credi¬ table products are already on the market and they are getting better with the added knowledge gained from each season’s ex¬ perience, but I do not believe that even the most sanguine enthusiast would claim that perfection has yet been reached. There is still room for improve¬ ment. The laboratory of the Exchange Supply Company is attacking this prob¬ lem with the purpose of finding out the effect of various factors and conditions on the behavior of the juice, so that even¬ tually we can tell just what combination of conditions is necessary to obtain a giv¬ en result. We have set for ourselves the ambitious goal of producing a perfect natural juice, “Sealdsweet” in the bot¬ tle just as Nature sealed it in the fruit. We are making no predictions of the out¬ come. Other, more able scientists have given it up and said “it can’t be done.” It is at best a long-time problem, since       141   it is impossible to tell what a given sam¬ ple will be like in a year or two years ex¬ cept by keeping it that long to see.  In the meantime we are meeting with considerable discouragement from those who believe that a clear, dark juice, is a better commercial proposition than a nat¬ ural juice. They tell us that our labor is all in vain, since it is a relatively easy matter to produce, the first mentioned product. We, are open to conviction on this point and should like to get an ex¬ pression of opinion from those present as to what our goal should be. We have asked advice from many people but find ourselves almost as badly puzzled as a certain man about whom I have heard. This man had a little too much to drink— and it wasn’t grapefruit juice either. He approached a passerby with the query, “Misther, can you tell me where ish the other side of the street?” “Why, of course, you simpleton, its right over there!” “Ish that so?, the blanked fool over there told me thish was it!”  Dfr*. Fairchild: I hate to see an oppor¬ tunity go by to talk about so interesting   a subject as drinks. It is a fact that the manufacturers of beer for generations at¬ tempted and in many countries unsuccess¬ fully to get perfectly clear beer. The German beer very seldom kept at a low temperature, a temperature at which it is kept in this country. As I understand it, when the Americans went into the beer business they ran into the difficulty of a low temperature and it took a great deal of experimenting to get rid of that cloud¬ iness. I think you will find it pretty dif¬ ficult to get uniform cloudiness in drinks.  C. E. Calkins: I may say that we found a better sale for the clear than for the natural but I don’t recommend the drink. So many people say that “This is so weak and insipid looking—that is for women and children.” The public know nothing about what grapefruit juice looks like—don’t want it. That is not the stuff they want to drink and the real point it seems to me in this connection is that juice like this does not lose any of its flavor, but a clear juice without any coloring or cloudiness either, does look insipid, more so than the natural juice it seems to me.@@   
 The Commercial Possibilities of Florida Fruit   Products@@   Miss A. Webster@@ State College for Women, Tallahassee@@   Production without conservation is like a foundation without the house. Since the days of the ancients people have made use of two types of conservation, first that of marketing the fresh product, and second, that of preserving it before plac¬ ing it on the market. Too often, the Florida grower employs only the first method in disposing of his crop. Statis¬ tics show that Florida exported $80,000- 000 worth of food products last year and in return brought back $70,000,000 worth of these same products, a large per cent of which might have been produced with¬ in our own boundaries. And, more sur¬ prising than the knowledge that they might have been produced, is the fact that a large part of them were produced, and then allowed to go to waste.  Reliable authority states that some¬ times as much as ten per cent of the prod¬ ucts delivered to the packing house are discarded as culls. This loss sometimes measures the difference between profit¬ able and unprofitable production. Prod¬ ucts known as culls are. often so called only because of an external defect that does not injure their value for table or canning purposes. Year after year Flor¬ ida walks by her own packing houses, where these culls lie, on her way to buy similar products put up in containers in   other states, to distribute to her own peo¬ ple.  A visit to three grocery stores in as many localities in the State revealed the fact that only one Georgia and two Flor¬ ida firms were represented on the list of some seventy-five different factories whose fruit products found their way into the homes in the State. A visit of this kind is like a tour of America. From Washington with her loganberry fields and apple orchards, down the Pacific to the home of the famous Sunkist fruits, across the Rockies to Chicago, St. Louis and New York, with their factories to which center systems of transportation lined with carriers of fresh fruits and vegetables and from which radiate, car loads of containers that find their way into all sections of the country. A closer inspection of these shelves further dis¬ closed the fact that all of the products, with the exception of apples and cherries, could have been put up within our own State.  As unthrifty as the situation looks it is not as bad as it has been. About ten years ago commercial canning in this State developed simultaneously along two lines: the home proposition in which in¬ dividuals working on a small basis put up a fancy product for a fancy price; and   142        143   the factory proposition operating on a larger basis put up a commercial product to compete with similar products on the world’s market. The introduction of Home Demonstration work into the State in 1912 gave this industry tremendous impetus. During the intervening years there are many instances where exhibits of products made in the home have stim¬ ulated the commercial work on both a large and small scale.  A few of the many worthy examples of production for fancy trade from the home kitchen in one season, is the work of such people as:  Mrs. J. J. Willie, Lloyd, Florida, 2,000 containers of figs.  W. H. Haskins, Winter Haven, Flor¬ ida, 25 gallons of guava jelly.  Mrs. Ballentine, Ft. Myers, Florida, 2,000 glasses of guava jelly; 1,000 glasses of Cattley guava jelly.  Mrs. Barfield, Caxambus, Florida, 2,000 No. 3 cans of guavas; 100 No. 2 cans of mangos; 200 gallons of roselle juice; 2,000 glasses of guava jelly; 1,000 12-ounce jars of 'orange jelly.  Mrs. Hess, Ft. Myers, Florida, 200 12- ounce jars of kumquats; 400 lbs. of crys¬ tallized peel.  Calls constantly come to the Home Demonstration Agents and the Home Demonstration office at Tallahassee for the Florida State College Bulletin No. 34 on Jellies, Preserves and Marmalades. This bulletin has not only gone through¬ out our own State, but also into every State in the. Union. “If a penny saved be a penny earned,” then the filling of the home pantry by the girls and housewives is but another method of marketing Flor¬   ida products at home. Since the fall of 1918, through home demonstration work there has been reported 3,197,188 con¬ tainers filled with fruits and vegetables.  Although citrus fruits rank first in point of production they are but one of the many varieties that can be grown. In addition to the citrus, chief among those that lend themselves readily to com¬ mercial canning are the guavas, roselle or Florida cranberry, mangos, strawberries and others that grow in abundance throughout the middle and southern sec¬ tions of Florida, while, in the northern section of the State we find figs, musca¬ dine grapes and uncultivated blackberries growing in abundance. There are many others with promising possibilities, but these are grown at present in sufficient quantity to be utilized for commercial purposes. No less interesting in number and variety are the products to be made from these fruits, some, of which are, preserves, jams, jellies, marmalades, chutneys, juices, vinegars, pickles and confections. Plans are now under way for the development of a muscadine, vine¬ yard in North Florida with an idea of placing grape products on the market.  The demand within our State for soft drinks, such as pepsi-cola, cheri-cola, coca-cola and many other of similar na¬ ture is sufficient to pay a yearly revenue, of approximately $3,503,210.88, accord¬ ing to figures obtained from the Internal Revenue Director of the State Commer¬ cial production of the wholesome, juice of the muscadine grape and various citrus fruits would in all probability find not only a welcome, but also a ready demand from the public. The juice of the musca-   144       dine grape which is a native of the State need only to be known to make a place for itself on the market. A satisfactory method of putting up this product has been developed by Mr. Chas. Dearing of the United States Department of Agricul¬ ture.  The manufacture of satisfactory cit¬ rus products has been only partly solved, but the possibilities seem so great that, in spite of discouraging failures and par¬   tial successes the problem claims the time and thought of scientists and manufac¬ turers. The fact that in other sections of the country the commercial production of other fruit products has long since passed the experimental stage indicates that this industry backed by the required capital, necessary training and perseverance can be entered upon with a minimum chance of failure.   i   Bordeaux-Oil Emulsion Spray   J. R. Winston and W. W. Yothers, U. S. Department of Agriculture,  Orlando, Florida   Bordeaux mixture, one of the standard spray compounds, is generally conceded to be the most effective all-round spray that has been devised for the control of plant diseases. Co-existing with its desir¬ able qualities there are several undesir¬ able features and for this reason numer¬ ous substitute materials have been ex¬ ploited or otherwise introduced from time to time.  The experienced fruit growers of Flor¬ ida are too well acquainted with the va¬ rious sprays to need a discussion of the several types, especially their limitation, but for those who have taken up citrus growing more recently a few words of explanation may be justified.  In general, the copper sprays, such as Bordeaux, Burgundy, and ammoniacal copper carbonate, mixtures possess fungi¬ cidal properties of considerable potency which kill beneficial fungi or those which cause insect diseases as well as those caus¬ ing plant diseases. They possess no ma¬ terial insecticidal values, consequently scale insects increase rapidly after such sprays are applied, unless proper insecti¬ cides are used following these applica¬ tions. This is especially true where Bor¬ deaux mixture is used for this material  'Published by permission of the. Secre¬ tary of Agriculture.   is effective over a considerable length of time.  Sulphur sprays, for example, lime-sul¬ phur, soda-sulphur, and barium-sulphur solutions, possess both fungicidal and in¬ secticidal properties to a fair degree. They are much less effective, against fun¬ gi in general than copper sprays. The reaction of the sulphur compounds on fungi is milder than copper sprays and operate over a much shorter length of time. On the other hand, these sulphur compounds kill young scale insects and therefore these pests do not increase very rapidly following the application of such sprays.  Because of the very serious scale infes¬ tation which is almost sure to follow ap¬ plications of copper sprays, most fruit growers select the sulphur compounds as a means of controlling citrus diseases. However, conditions for severe infection frequently arise which warrant the use of Bordeaux mixture. Heretofore, when such was the case, several additional ap¬ plications of oil emulsion were necessary in order to reduce the scale infestation to a normal level, thereby adding no small amount to the annual cost of spray ma¬ terials and their application. Aside from the scale and white fly increase., rust mites are known to become more abun-   145     146       dant and the injury resulting from them more pronounced following applications of Bordeaux mixture than is the case where no sprays are used.  With this information at hand it was deemed advisable to determine whether or not Bordeaux mixture could be com¬ bined successfully with the present day oil emulsions and applied without injury on citrus trees and fruits at various stages of growth. Accordingly, a series of lab¬ oratory tests were commenced during the early fall of 1917 with the view of com¬ bining these two sprays. It was found that any dilution of the various oil emul¬ sions combined readily with any strength of Bordeaux likely to be. used and showed no detrimental effects upon either the Bordeaux mixture or oil emulsion. The first field test of this combination spray was made during the late fall of 1917 on a large, bearing citrus grove near Orlan¬ do, Florida.  The Bordeaux mixture was prepared in the usual manner, using three pounds of bluestone and four pounds of lime for each fifty gallons, and the oil emulsion was added afterwards to the spray solu¬ tion with the agitator running. Both “cold stirred” (1) and “boiled” (1) emulsions were used, each in quantities that would give one-half per cent and one per cent of oil in the diluted material. Three applications were made at intervals of two weeks.  i  (1) Farmer’s Bulletin 933, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. “Spraying for the Control of Insects and Mites Attacking Citrus Trees in Florida.”  ! - f" ~ . . i ;  i ' • i I  U ' I.  During the scab spraying seasons of 191 8 and 1919 this combination spray   was given rather thorough trials in bear- ing groves at various points in the State. During the execution of this work trees were sprayed at all stages of growth; on the tender flush, in the bloom and at in¬ tervals thereafter, but no one grove was sprayed more than three times with this Bordeaux-oil emulsion combination. Both the “cold stirred” and “boiled” emulsions were used in these tests.  In addition to these a more critical test was made in the experimental nur¬ sery at Orlando on seedling grapefruit, rough lemon, and sour orange nursery stock. A part of this nursery was spray¬ ed with 3-4-50 Bordeaux mixture and an¬ other part with Bordeaux oil emulsion (3-4-50 Bordeaux plus one-half per cent oil emulsion.) The applications were made at weekly intervals beginning in March and ending in October, 1919. Us¬ ually the ordinary “boiled” emulsion was used, but occasionally the proprietary emulsions, such as Schnarr’s Spray For¬ mula” and “Fico 60” were substituted. All of these emulsions served equally well.  Again in 1920 extensive experiments to prevent citrus scab were carried on in several sections of the State. Tests were conducted on both nursery trees and bear¬ ing groves. At Orlando a nursery con¬ sisting of sour orange, rough lemon, and grapefruit seedlings was sprayed twice a month from April until October with various strengths of Bordeaux combined with emulsion at the. rate of one-half per cent oil in the diluted material. The sul¬ phur sprays, such as Dry Lime Sulphur, Barium Tetri Sulphide, and Lime Sul¬ phur Solution, used on the basis of equal       147   amounts of sulphur in the diluted spray, were used along with the Bordeaux for comparison. Bearing trees were sprayed with 3-3-50 Bordeaux and one half per cent oil emulsion at intervals of one, two and four weeks during the. scab and mel- anose season. Both deep well and lake water were used in the spraiying. At Orlando and vicinity extensive experi¬ ments were carried on for the preven¬ tion of melanose and stem-end rot.  While this work was in progress cer¬ tain rather interesting and important ob¬ servations were made which may be sum¬ marized as follows:  All brands of commercial oil emulsions and miscible oils tested by us, and the government formulae “cold stirred” and “boiled” emulsions were found to com¬ bine readily with Bordeaux mixture.  Bordeaux-oil emulsion settled less rap¬ idly and spread more evenly than plain Bordeaux.  Bordeaux-oil emulsion adhered to the sprayed part's as well or better than plain Bordeaux. (2.)  (2) Department Bulletin 785, U. S. Depart¬ ment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. “The Field Testing of Copper-Spray Coatings”  This combination was successfully made with shallow well and lake waters and with various types of untreated deep well waters except on two properties where slight injuries to tender foliage followed the failure to secure a perfect mixture. Even plain Bordeaux gave in¬ jurious results on these properties. These failures were undoubtedly due to unusual chemicals in the water.   The presence of the oil neither increas¬ ed nor decreased the effectiveness of Bor¬ deaux against citrus scab. This combina¬ tion spray was very effective against mel¬ anose and indications are that it can be used with success against stem-end rot.  The presence of the Bordeaux neither increased nor decreased the effectiveness of the oil against the various species of white flies and scale insects present.  The. critical time for the application of the plain oil emulsion following the com¬ bination is during the last week in June when the second generation of purple scale have just hatched and are therefore more easily killed.  More than 50,000 gallons of this com¬ bination have been applied on fruit, twigs, and foliage of all commercial va¬ rieties, at all stages of growth, including the full bloom period, during all weather conditions which permit of spraying op¬ erations, and no spray injury was ob¬ served on trees receiving the normal num¬ ber of applications except as noted above. Where the bloom spray was applied, oil emulsion was used at the rate of one-half per cent oil in diluted spray. At all other times the emulsion was used at the rate of one per cent oil in the spray which is the. regular strength for scales and white flies. It thus appears that oil emulsion combined with Bordeaux mixture has less tendency to injure tender growth than oil emulsion alone.  Rust mites became much more abun¬ dant on trees sprayed with Bordeaux than on unsprayed trees. There was no appreciable difference in the number of rust mites following applications of Bor¬ deaux and following applications of Bor-  148       de.aux-oil emulsion. However, the maxi¬ mum infestation was reached from two to three weeks earlier than on unsprayed trees.  Scale insects became very abundant and did considerable damage following applications of plain Bordeaux. They became less abundant and did far less damage where the Bordeaux is combined with oil emulsion at the rate of one-half per cent, or one-half the strength usually used against scale insects and white fly. Where Bordeaux was combined with one per cent oil emulsion, followed by a straight oil emulsion spray, scale insects did not increase more rapidly than on un¬ sprayed trees, but became somewhat more numerous than where lime-sulphur was used, at the usual dilutions for con¬ trolling fungus diseases,.  Bordeaux-oil emulsion spray should never be expected to take the place of the oil emulsion spraying for white fly and scale during May and June and should always be followed by at least a single application of the latter.  Most of the commercial Bordeaux pastes and powders will give satisfactory results if used according to their copper content basis, and can be mixed with the various oil emulsions. Some of them, however, will not mix with the oil emul¬ sion without being treated. This objec¬ tion can be overcome by the addition of a small amount of lime after the Bor¬ deaux has been dissolved and put in the spray tank. Severe injury has been re¬ ported following the use of a commercial substitute for Bordeaux-oil emulsion. On investigation it was found that the arti¬ cle was in no sense a Bordeaux-oil emul¬   sion combination and should never have been used as such.  The results to date of tests with the Bordeaux-oil emulsion mixture, have been highly satisfactory and indicate that it will prove very effective in the control of certain fungus diseases of citrus and that its use is not followed by injury to the trees or fruit or by abnormal increase of scale insects such as follows plain Bor¬ deaux. While it may be too soon to make definite recommendations of it for exten¬ sive grove treatments, it seems proper at this time to inform growers on the sub¬ ject and suggest the desirability of their trying it out in a limited way in this sea¬ sons’s spraying. Since plain Bordeaux must be followed by an application of oil emulsion and since the combination of Bordeaux and oil emulsion is equally ef¬ fective as when these sprays are applied separately, there is no apparent reason why they should not be applied in com¬ bination, thereby reducing the cost of spraying operations. To this end the writers will be glad to give through cor¬ respondence any further details that may be. required by any individual.  W. W. Yothers (after reading paper) : I should say that this matter of spraying with Bordeaux-oil emulsion combination is, in my opinion, beyond all question the most serious one that confronts any or- chardist who practices spraying. There seems to be no other way of controlling some, citrus diseases except by Bordeaux and when you put Bordeaux on the trees then you practically eliminate the benefit which the grower receives from benefi¬ cial fungi. This then places the entire control of both diseases and insects on an       149   artificial basis and that is the real rea¬ son that we desire that the. horticulturists of Florida should help us out in this mat¬ ter. We want the growers to use the ma¬ terial three or four times and find out what results they get and see how they like it. Now, Mr. Nichols of Clearwater will follow me with a paper and I am very glad to know that he has a paper and will give you his experiences as a grower and I should say here that I admire Mr. Nich¬ ols very much; I think he is one of our very finest growers.  Mr. Hume: Is there any discussion of Mr. Yothers’ paper? Any question?  Mr. Skinner: I wish to say that we sprayed with Bordeaux-oil as Mr. Win¬ ston and Mr. Yothers have suggested and in one portion of our grove where we had had much stem end rot, during the fol¬ lowing year we had much less, hardly any for that matter, and we felt that the Bordeaux-oil did a great deal of good. We felt sure of it at all times but my experience does not prove anything. I want to ask Mr. Yothers how many times a year and at what times he would rec¬ ommend using Bordeaux-oil spray.  Mr. Yothers: I suppose it is a very   fortunate thing that I am not a patholo¬ gist, but last year Mr. Winston kept track of melanose by going out in the groves pretty nearly every week and I was very, very much pleased over the re¬ sult that we obtained with one spraying with Bordeaux-oil emulsion for melanose He seemed to know almost exactly the day and the week to spray for melanose and by applying it at that particular time I believe that was enough for melanose.  Mr. Skinner: Would you recommend the oil-Bordeaux spray for the last of April or just an oil spray?  Mr. Yothers: I think we sprayed for melanose as late as the last of May. One thing certain to remember: Anybody who puts Bordeaux on their trees in any shape will practically be compelled to spray the last week in June for scale and I would not wait until the last week in July for it is a critical time in June. I regret that Mr. Winston is not here for really he is a very, very brilliant, highly trained technical man and he has an enor¬ mous amount of information about this.  Mr. -: Will Lime. Sulphur So¬  lution mix with Bordeaux?  Mr. Yothers: No.@@    
 The Spraying of Citrus Trees@@   A. C. Nichols@@ Clearwater@@   This title might lead you to think that I was going to tell you all about this sub¬ ject. But actually all I have planned is to tell you how I handle the subject on my own grove, with no intention of offering advice to these experienced growers.  When I first began to spray, and this was when I first owned a grove, I start¬ ed out with one of these man-power lever 2-plunger pumps rigged up to a 50-gallon barrel and as an absolute novice, since I had never even seen any spraying done. The only reason I can see now for suc¬ cess with such inexperience and inade¬ quate outfit was the surprise on the part of the insects on these heretofore un¬ sprayed trees. I call this outfit inade¬ quate for, while it would handle two noz¬ zles, it was only at a pressure of 80 to 100 pounds, and because of its inability to get over any job at all sizeable and get it done quickly. My only excuse for its use. was lack of cash to get anything more expensive. My next effort was to hire power machines. This proved gen¬ erally unsatisfactory because there were few machines available, they were dif¬ ficult to get just when wanted and often the work of the operators did not suit me. Then I got a used machine myself but it was of small capacity and I finally grad¬ uated some two years ago to a new, large machine having a triplex pump ca¬   pable of handling four nozzles or two guns at 250 pounds pressure. Since then we have been able to get out and get a job done with certainty and dispatch.  But no matter what machine a man uses, I believe one of the most potent factors for results from spraying is in thorough work. I have seen a mist drift¬ ed around and through a tree which was called spraying. I think a better term for it would be a waste of money, for such work can not be expected to produce re¬ sults. In my own grove, though we try to spray thoroughly, I have seen where some bunches of oranges were mis¬ sed by an operator in a lime-sulphur spraying for rust, and this fruit continue to rust right on in spite of the known killing power of the fumes as well as of contact. Then what effective control can be expected of careless spraying, say with the emulsions, where only actual contact kills? In our own grove we first get inside of the trees and thoroughly spray there, then take the outside begin¬ ning on the side away from the machine and, if using rods, thoroughly working the nozzles in and out amongst the fo¬ liage. We generally go back inside the tree a second time on the opposite side in order to thoroughly cover. We normally spray under 225 pounds pressure. For the emulsions, at the beginning of each        151   spraying, I take it slow and send the men back repeatedly to see. for them¬ selves whether or not they are actually getting the under sides of all leaves. As to whether we use rods or guns depends upon the trees and what we are spraying for. We always use guns on seedlings and always for lime-sulphur sprayings on all trees but for the oil sprayings on bud¬ ded trees I believe rods with angle noz¬ zles give us more thorough results. On rust sprayings we are not quite so care¬ ful when covering the insides of the trees, but for our spring I to 40 lime- sulphur application on grapefruit we try to be as thorough inside as out, for only in this way can we get the fruit covered when the new growth hides and shields so much of the new fruit from outside work. As to the amount of liquid used I believe we cover a trifle more ground with guns when trying to do equally thorough work.  Now as to when to spray, we have the spray schedule admirably worked out for us by the several men and agencies that are helping us growers in the State. If completely followed, I have no doubt it will accomplish its purpose, that of giv¬ ing us high-grade fruit, and more of it, from clean trees. But, for my part, while I follow the schedule in a general way, I try to exercise some, judgment in its ap¬ plication to my own grove just as I sup¬ pose the rest of you do. For instance, I very seldom make any spraying in the bloom but follow it immediately with a lime-sulphur application, on both oranges and grapefruit. On grapefruit I use lime-sulphur solution 1 to 40 irrespective of weather conditions or whether I have   noted any scab on young growth. I do this because this preceding by only two or three weeks a spraying that would be necessary for red spider or rust mites or both, makes that unnecessary and the extra two gallons of lime-sulphur per tank is used as insurance against scab, should scab weather develop. (1.)  (1) Sometimes, by making only this one spraying, I do get some scab showing up on the young fruit, but it does not seem to develop and the fruit outgrows it. Of course, if serious scab infection should begin to show upon new growth, I should probably get out and spray in the bloom.  The application of lime-sulphur solu¬ tion on oranges at this time is 1 to 66. As to the reasons for making this appli¬ cation at this time instead of waiting until there are spiders or mites to jus¬ tify it, can only say I would rather do it when convenient than to drop everything else as a matter of necessity; that I would prefer to have no indication of spider at all; and as I believe lime-sulphur solution aids early maturity of fruit, I like to be¬ gin as early as possible. I also think it acts as a tree tonic and hence if applied at this time may cause a bit more fruit to stick. This one lime-sulphur spraying, thoroughly done, holds down rust gener¬ ally until the first part of July and in only one season that I can remember has any further spraying for rust mites been necessary. I have tried to reconcile the statements I have heard at times that for effective rust mite control a spraying* is necessary every six weeks with my own experience that two sprayings are ample, and the only answer I have been able to reach is that perhaps we spray more   152       thoroughly when we do spray than do others who spray oftener. (2.)  (2) Soluble sulphur I seldom use unless I hap¬ pen to need a sulphur spray at the same time as an oil spray and this does not prove often. In my own experience it does not begin to be as ef¬ fective in the control of rust mites as is lime- sulphur solution.  I invariably make the oil spraying in the fall, although if feasible I like to wait until the fruit is picked. Of course, if the fruit is badly sooted an earlier spray¬ ing is necessary. The spring application depends upon my need. I have been at outs with the spring application, especial¬ ly on grapefruit, because I have gener¬ ally gotten oil spotting or shadowing of the fruit and sometimes permanent in¬ jury in the form of burns. I have tried different insecticides but with no dif¬ ferent results in this respect. Often, when just the right time comes to spray for whitr-fly, the fruit is pretty small, and these considerations have led*me to omit the May spraying unless fly or scale is prevalent enough to make its application imperative. This past year, however, the use of a very weak Bordeaux in the oil spray, and in hard water, that is, at the. rate of not over one-half pound of blue- stone and lime each, to fifty gallons of water enabled me to make this spraying without producing so much as one oil spot on the fruit that I could discover. And I am perfectly satisfied that the result was due to the addition of the Bordeaux, for in a neighbor’s grove where our equipment was used, the same oil emulsion in soft water but without the Bordeaux produced very considerable oil shadowing.   Now sometimes things come up that are not mentioned in the schedule. For instance, some three years ago I had a very bad infestation of Mealy Bug on grapefruit. Wishing to do something, but not knowing what, I sprayed experi¬ mentally with lime-sulphur and Black Leaf 40, lime-sulphur and nicoticide, whale oil soap and nicoticide, and with a proprietary insecticide. While all of these combinations appeared to have some effect on the old bugs, shortly afterwards there were great numbers of crawlers so that I was satisfied that my spraying had been ineffective. Yet, in three to four weeks, all of this infestation appeared to be dead. But I never gave spraying any credit for it and learned later that doubt¬ less fungi that attack the Mealy Bug had overtaken and conquered the bugs at last.  Again, when experimenting last year with the Bordeaux-oil combination spray, I sprayed two rows through the seedling grove with it. The seedlings had shown serious ammoniation on the previous crop and in the fall of 1919 I had dosed the trees with twenty pounds of ashes and three pounds of Bluestone each. On the 1920 crop a little ammoniation showed up in July, a little of the young fruit split and fell off and that was the end of it. But on the two rows sprayed with the Bordeaux-oil, although through one of the worst ammoniated sections, no am¬ moniation showed up whatever at any time. A similar result was obtained on a few pineapple trees where the fruit had previously persistently shown some little ammoniation in spite of applications of bluestone and of ashes.       153   While mentioning this as one very def¬ inite and favorable result from the use of this combination spray, my principal use of it was on grapefruit. Here I did not obtain the results I had hoped for and I have been rather hesitant about discuss¬ ing them here. But I realize that the trouble might just as easily have been with myself as operator, and probably was, as with the material. And I decided that if you will understand that what I sav is not at all intended as any criti¬ cism of the spray but simply for discus¬ sion, I would tell you what I did. It was used first as a clean-up spray on a block of trees six years of age, before the spring growth came out and also on a few rows in the larger grove. We had a very long blooming season last year and my follow-up spray with lime-sulphur so¬ lution i to 40 was not put on until April when finally all the bloom had shed. Up until April comparatively little scab infec¬ tion was noted but just shortly after the April spraying there seemed to be consid¬ erable infection on the fruit. There seemed to be no difference, however, where the Bordeaux-oil had been used previously. Later, in June, I saw a few indications of Melanose and it occurred to me that this spray might protect the most of the crop from infection during the summer rains. So I put it on all grapefruit excepting about fifteen trees. This one spraying, but on some parts two if the clean-up spray is counted, did not prevent Melanose (perhaps I should have used more or infection may already have taken place), and the fruit on the un¬ sprayed fifteen trees was certainly just as good as that on the other trees. So,   because of the lack of results as I used it, the heavy dose of scale that followed on these trees, and of its cost, of which I will speak in a moment, I am not, at present at least, in favor of its further use on my grove.  As to cost, I figure the Bordeaux-oil spray cost me about one and three- fourths cents for material and one cent for application for each gallon of spray used. It took on an average ten gallons per tree or a cost for a single spraying of twenty-seven cents per tree. As these trees picked on an average just under six boxes to the tree—they had just a good average crop it gives a cost per box of four and one-half cents. It seems to me that if many sprayings are necessary for results that my need would have to be very serious much more so than it has ever been yet—to justify the expense. They would practically be entirely addi¬ tional to the regular four sprayings and which I figure, at present prices, at about twelve to fourteen cents per box total. I might add that, except for some Melan¬ ose, these normal four sprayings give me reasonably clean trees and crops of bright desirable fruit.  Another thing I might speak of in this connection, although it has no relation to the efficiency of the material. The Bor¬ deaux-oil was used in June and of course in July I had to use lime-sulphur for rust. The combination of these two sprays pro¬ duced a brilliant reddish brown spotting on leaves and fruit. This gradually weathered to a black and persisted on the fruit until picking. I had to explain to every prospective buyer what it was and show how easily it rubbed off, for it   154       made the fruit appear as though it need- hindered the coloring of the skin direct¬ ed explanation or apology. Actually too, ly beneath so that when rubbed off the in the early stages of coloring, these spots skin showed a mottled green and yellow.   Gummosis and Frenching   Eugene L. Pearce, Clearwater   This is not a scientific paper. I shall mention no measurement finer than the thousandth part of an inch; no time limit shorter than the. hundredth part of a sec¬ ond. I shall not differentiate sharply be¬ tween a fungus, a female bacteria and a group of pupae.  This paper will represent some part of the experience of a plain grower. I trust it will possess one quality worth while— brevity.  And now to business:  Gummosis is a serious matter, when neglected. If noted when tree is first at¬ tacked, it is one of the least difficult of citrus disorders to check. Whenever the grower sees gum breaking from the bark of a grapefruit tree or a tangerine—in my section it is chiefly these varieties of the citrus which are attacked—diagnose the trouble as Gummosis and go to work. Should the trouble prove not to be Gum¬ mosis, you have ordinarily done no par¬ ticular harm. If the gumming is caused by Gummosis, you have bettered the, sit¬ uation.  In the above advice, the writer is as¬ suming that Citrus Canker has been vir¬ tually eradicated in Florida and that Pso- rosis has not yet been listed as an incur¬ able disease.  The treatment for Gummosis is simple. Cut out all bark which seems to be af¬   fected by the disease, until bark is clear white where cut. The same rule applies to the sap surface beneath the bark. Scrape it until the wood is white and free of all discoloration, especially of those raised, pulpy spots which seem to be the seats of infection. Examine the tree carefully, the trunk and the limbs, for other evidence of the disease. Treat all gumming, even the slightest, as pre¬ scribed.  Three or four days after these surgi¬ cal operations, when sappy surface is en¬ tirely dry, paint all bared surfaces with Bordeaux paste or protexol (Aven^rius carbolineum). In rather young trees it is safest to dilute the protexol to half its pure strength by adding whaleoil soap and water. Every grower knows of this treatment. The only element in it which has never been sufficiently emphasized is prompt action. The work is trifling, if done in time. Vigilance and immediate treatment are the chief ingredients in the remedy.  While the “stitch in time” adage is the secret which usually marks the difference between the man who grows oranges for a profit and the man who grows them to look at, with Gummosis, let me repeat, prompt attention is the all-essential.  After such a treatment, inspect the trees attacked at intervals for a recur-   iS5    156       rence of the disease. Nip a recurrence at once. Should you fail to inspect your trees frequently and systematically, or should you neglect to treat them promptly when trouble is found, Gummosis will often become so firmly established, from lower trunk to upper branch and through¬ out the entire life-system of the tree, that it becomes impossible to check its work of destruction.  Gummosis seems to be a fungous dis¬ ease, but as this paper is merely in the nature of a few practical suggestions from one grower to other growers, I am only interested in effects and treatment and not in cause or causes. From my personal experience I should say Gummo¬ sis is contagious. Where a tree affected by Gummosis is not promptly treated, •other trees in the vicinity will often con¬ tract the disease. It is recommended that a cloth be spread around the trunk of a tree, about to receive treatment and that all bark and scrapings be gathered up carefully and burned.  A new and more deadly form of Gum¬ mosis in all probability must be added to the enemies of the citrus—the disease identified as Psorosis.  The writer has recently lost two vig¬ orous young seedling grapefruit, about twelve years old. One of these trees, in the judgment of several expert observ¬ ers, was killed by lightning. Tops of other trees close by were slightly affected. The bark about the tree from the crown to a distance of two feet above the ground was entirely dead.  The second tree at first showed no sign of wilting, but the bark about the crown was without life and had much the ap¬   pearance of the tree described. It was entirely girdled, but there seemed to be no gumming on trunk or limbs. Trees in the vicinity did not appear to be af¬ fected in the least.  Reasoning from the angle of elimina¬ tion, the tree in question did not seem to be affected by Blight, nor would the us¬ ual lightning tests apply. It did not have the appearance of Mal-di-goma. Also the seedling grapefruit is not subject to Mal-di-goma unless strongly exposed by contagious contact, which was not the condition in this case.  It may be that this new manifestation is a physiological disease. Certainly it seems to have the stealthy, deadly action of Blight, but as a preliminary the bark was killed above the crown. The tree was entirely girdled.  There is always the possibility, in the instance cited, of a single-track lightning stroke—somewhat like our ex-President’s mind—one of those strokes which had some place in particular to go and went right there.  FRENCHING  Under this head the practical grower is interested in cause, for Frenching in many cases is the, result of an overt act by the grower.  Frenching may be caused by any of a number of conditions unfavorable to the health of the citrus. Green vegetation in quantity, plowed under in the summer or early fall, inducing fermentation and greatly increasing the humic acid condi¬ tion of the soil, will bring about French¬ ing.  Dead leaves or grass in quantity bur¬ ied close about a tree will cause the same       157   condition. I know, for this was a per¬ sonal experiment.  Deep plowing, thereby breaking more roots than the trees can afford to lose when carrying a heavy top, will some¬ times produce Frenching. The working balance between root and branch is often upset by such a practice.  Removing the cover crop from a grove, for any purpose, or failing to grow such a crop once a year, until the humus be¬ comes insufficient, will result in depleted vitality and bring on an attack of French¬ ing in connection with Melanose and other diseases which are always associ¬ ated with trees whose reserve of strength is at low ebb.   In building up quickly and renewing the soil bacteria, use organic manures as well as chemical sources of food.  Land not properly drained will cause Frenching and in unusually wet times great and permanent damage to the trees.  Remedy: Avoid the bad practices and experiments suggested above. An orange grove is not a plaything. It is a business, and one that has its problems. There are, losses sufficient and unavoidable without courting new trouble. When in doubt, consult the Experiment Station. Let the State of Florida pay for the mis¬ takes which you hanker to make yourself.@@   
 Observations of Diseases and Insect Pests of Citrus@@   C. W. Lyons@@ Tampa@@   My observations have been confined more to foot-rot and gummosis than to other diseases. I have, however, found a great amount of withertip in old seed¬ ling trees and also in budded trees.  Withertip, It is important to cut back trees affected by withertip. I had occa¬ sion two years ago to visit a grove where I recommended that two trees affected with this disease be cut back. This was not done, and now there are about thirty- five trees affected, which will have to be cut back practically to the trunk to save them. This quite clearly demonstrates the importance of pruning and above ev¬ erything else, burning the limbs cut from these trees.  Foot-rot. I have encountered this dis¬ ease frequently among the old seedling trees, and the greatest benefits which have been derived from treatment have been accomplished by removing the dirt from the base of the tree, back about twenty-four inches, and down under the crown roots, allowing the air and sunlight to penetrate. I have seen more good re¬ sults from the air and sunlight cure than from any other method. A great many growers use some good disinfectant. However, if the. tree is badly affected there is no use treating the roots and al¬ lowing the dead and sick wood to remain in the top of the trees. I have seen this   tried, and it has proven a failure for the reason that you cannot expect live sap to circulate through half dead wood.  Sourness. Another disease that goes hand in hand with foot-rot is that of sourness, which is caused from the fer¬ mentation of leaves and trash, etc., which are allowed to accumulate and remain in the forks of old budded and seedling trees. If the hollows in the trunks of these trees are not taken care of, it is only a question of time until there will be no trees. I observed one grove where this rubbish or solid matter was removed with a small garden trowel, and a hole bored in the trunk of each tree, at the bottom of the cavity, thereby allowing the water to drain out. This treatment benefited the trees greatly, and in the same grove where there were trees that were not treated, a great many limbs were either blown off or fell down from being badly decayed. This is really a first aid method that costs very little, but naturally the cost of treat¬ ing a great many trees in a large grove has to be given some consideration. It should not be necessary to have a special man brought in to do this work, as it is very simple, and the grower should have very little trouble in doing it himself. Some growers may contend that this is only a makeshift and would not be a per¬ manent cure, for the tree, but from ob-   158        159   servation and experience I find it neces¬ sary to keep up the work to hold trees of this character in good condition, and keep them from going back.  Gummosis. I have seen some very bad cases of this disease on both young bud¬ ded trees and old seedlings. I saw one old grove in particular that was run down, and work was commenced in this grove by giving a very liberal application of fertilizer, and in addition there was applied about five pounds of nitrate soda to each tree. During the period, to use a common expression, I might say that the grove was almost “cultivated to death,” and was followed by a very bad case of gummosis. The, following rec¬ ommendations were carried out: Cultiva¬ tion was entirely stopped for a period of seven months, and the wounded places on each tree treated with crude, carbolic acid and soapy water, the mixture being made of equal parts. This was applied at least three times to the affected parts, and the results of this method have proved to be very beneficial, and the grove is now in what might be called normal condition.  The Hoeing of Trees, Especially Young Trees. Hoeing trees, especially young trees, is very important. It les¬ sens the chance of insects accumulating and doing harm. Great care should be taken to remove the banks from about the trees, and to see that the entire amount of dirt is taken away from the trunk of the trees down level with the crown roots. Any rubbish, dead wood, etc., which may have accumulated against the banks should be picked up for the reason that it lessens the accumulation of ants.   a few dont's  Don’t give your trees an unusual appli¬ cation of spray material when you are spraying, especially of the oil emulsion, and particularly when the trees are in bloom, as it will burn young growth.  Don’t dig a trench around your trees and put bluestone in it and then pour water in the trench thinking you will give your # tree.s a good application, and direct to the spot. This may kill your tree. I have seen this very thing happen twice. If you have occasion to put blue- stone into the tree, do not use more, than two small pieces, about the size of a pea, as this amount will inoculate them, and probably give you the desired results. I came across one grower who had given them what he called “a good dose” and now he has no trees.  Don’t paint the trunks of trees with oil insecticides to get rid of lichens without first diluting it. I saw some fine old trees absolutely killed by this method.  Don’t cut a ditch down the middles to the extent of two feet, to drain the land, and especially when trees are in bloom, as this may cause them to shed their bloom. One grower attributes the, cut¬ ting of these roots to this ditching, and I know of one grove where the trees were thick with bloom and the trees put on practically no fruit last year.  Don’t spray with a strong solution of Bluestone to cure dieback. I have seen this tried, and it defoliated the trees.  Don’t put Bluestone under the branches close up around the trunk of the trees; also don’t apply Bluestone during, the. rainy period.   160       Don’t fill up holes in old seedling trees with cement, without first having all the old dead and rotten wood taken out, for the reason that the cement will do abso¬ lutely no good. Dry rot will set in and you can accomplish nothing whatever, by simply putting a cover over the hole, while the real damage is being done un¬ derneath by decay on the inside. I have seen several groves where this cement work on trees has been provep a failure for the reason that from the surface ev¬ erything looked good and sound, but de¬ cay was fast rotting away the inside of the tree, I believe that the best method that I have seen has been to chisel or cut out all the affected parts and leave them exposed to the air and sunlight.  Hume: Is there any discussion of this paper at this time? I would like to appoint two committes at this time, first,  the Committee on Final Resolutions—  \  Messrs. Edgar A. Wright, R. L. Goodwin and S. F. Poole, and an Auditing Com¬ mittee to consist of M. G. Campbell, J. G. Grosse.nbacher and G. W. Peterkin. Be¬ fore going on with this morning’s pro¬ gram, Dr. Mark Sample has a matter which he wishes to present to the Society and I will give him an opportunity to do so at this time.  Dr. Mark Sample.: A number of months ago we growers of Polk County from Haines City to Sebring assembled together as the Association of Boards of Trade, and talked over a matter which finally resulted in a committee of three being appointed to draft a bill to be known as “Pest Control Act,” which we hoped to have passed in this Legislature, A number of years ago a bill very simi¬   lar to this was started but when the Plant Board learned that the functioning of this law if put into effect would come within the jurisdiction of the various County Boards of Commissioners of the counties they immediately took steps, which was right, to kill the bill. We have in this State perhaps the best func¬ tioning Plant Board in the United States. A little over a year ago in my travels in California I heard it very favorably spoken of by the Californians and when¬ ever they go to the limit to say anything good of any other country they are going some; and they certainly complimented the Plant Board of Florida in that they said they had watched it very closely and tried to follow. Being one of the com¬ mittee to draft this bill, I got in touch with the Plant Board and they tentatively drafted a bill which they thought would meet our requirements as growers and still bring it within the functioning of the Plant Board to put into effect.  Some may want to know why we didn’t include all the diseases and pests. You could not do that if you were going to have your county commissioners put it into effect or if you were going to leave it to your growers to exercise. There¬ fore, they have only included in this bill such pests and diseases as it is possible for the grower, under the instructions of the Plant Board, to eradicate or control. For instance, you could not, as a grower, eradicate citrus canker as has been done, nor the black fly and some others; so the Plant Board has seen fit to include in this bill only such as can be controlled by the grower himself under the instruc¬ tions from the. Plant Board. If we should       161   leave it to our county commissioners to put into effect we would be just where California is as that is their law and they have cautioned us not to make that mis¬ take because very few of our county com¬ missioners are plant men. Now, I am going to read this bill as tentatively drawn by Judge Hunter, the Florida Cit¬ rus Exchange attorney, who is interested in this kind of work, and then submitted to the Plant Board. They have made their corrections and again returned it to Judge Hunter for the final touches. This bill that I will read you here is the tenta¬ tive draft which has not the corrections of the Plant Board. However, the Plant Board drew the; original. (Reads bill.)  Growers, the time has arrived in the growing of our fruit when the quality of the fruit we are growing and are going to grow must be improved. This year there will be shipped thirteen million boxes of fruit and the crop for next year is estimated at twenty million. You can all certainly see the, necessity of growing good fruit or going out of business. Un¬ less we properly cultivate, fertilize and spray our fruit, keeping it clean and bright, we are certainly going to have to go out of business. It has been coming to that point and it is right on us—it is here now. We have seen during this year of cheap prices, that good desirable fruit has brought only fair prices. How¬ ever, considering the reconstruction pe¬ riod we have not fared nearly so poorly as some other lines of business.  If I did not spray my grove and you across the road did, it means that you have got to do more spraying and more cleaning up of your grove to bring it in a   proper sanitary condition than you would if I kept mine clean. So we want to see to the man who will not properly spray his grove. If he has insects or diseases sufficient to become a menace, which will be decided upon by the Plant Board, and that can be eradicated, or controlled, if he won’t do it, the authorities will go in and do it for him and charge it to his property. I would like to see this Society go on record as favoring this law. It will help us some. It gives each county the opportunity to vote on it. You, in a county, can have it or not, as you wish. We of Polk County believe, we want it and if given the opportunity we will have it. We believe if it is ever tried out the rest of you will have it. I am called away this morning and will have to leave now, but I want to leave this in your hands. I hope you will pass a resolution endors¬ ing the. passage of this bill. I thank you.  Hume: What is your pleasure in re¬ gard to this matter? Shall we leave it now and take it up later?  Mr. -: I move that we en¬  dorse the bill as read.  Mr. L. B. Skinner: This may not be called “compulsory spraying” but that is its name. I am in favor of a bill of this kind. I am in favor of spraying—there are many people who are not, and who are, in fact, absolutely opposed to it. It is a question to which there, are a good many sides. This Society is made up of all these different people. This Society has certain work to do and I don’t think that endorsing bills of this kind is the business of this Society. I think it is a great mistake, I think it is aside from the order of its business and it is an un-    162       wise thing to do just at this time. The Plant Board is going to have hard sled¬ ding this year to get along; it is going to have hard sledding to have the legislation passed that it needs and it is my idea that we have got to concentrate, that the Plant Board has got to concentrate on as large a program as they think they can carry through and stick to it. Every one of these things will make enemies and, be¬ lieve me, we haven’t too many friends. I think it is a serious mistake and it is not, to my mind, the policy of this Society and I think it is out of order.  H. H. Hume: I listened to the, reading of the bill very carefully myself while Dr. Sample was reading it and unless there were some modifications in it I would not be willing to endorse, it myself because it requires in that bill the de¬ struction of certain insects and pests which I know cannot be destroyed in Florida and yet that is plainly stated in that bill. It stands for established in¬ structions, names the pests that are to be destroyed or exterminated and I don’t think it can be done. Now, I am in favor of a bill of this type if properly drafted but I don’t believe this bill will fill the bill. It refers to the extermination of whitefly, to the extermination of pecan scab and refers to the extermination of a number of things that cannot possibly be exterminated, and that clause is so tied up in it that I know what we would be going up against. I know what we have gotten up against in our present Plant Act.  F. W. Raine: I am very much inter¬ ested in hearing the reading of this bill. I have been in public life about thirty   years in five different states and if there is anything it strikes me that you want to go carefully on it is the question of legis¬ lation. I am with a new organization that desires to go into various lines of horticulture and we are coming into the State where conditions such as tropical conditions, insects, diseases and all that sort of thing, are, different, although I have had actual training along these lines. Now, I am delighted to hear the Plant Board patted on the back, as it were, and I believe they are patting them¬ selves on the back, but, after all, the laws that we have already are not proper¬ ly carried out; they cannot be properly carried out. I know myself, having been a State official. To pass, the legislation is the last thing. The thing to do is to get something that will work out and give us the desired results. Now, not¬ withstanding the training and experience I have had, since I have come into Florida I have run into many little technical mis¬ givings here and I think those things ought to be cleared up rather than the passing of new legislation. Now, as a matter of fact in Palm Beach County we have many orchards there that doubtless have almost all the various pests or in¬ sects in them if you go after them with a microscope. The laws that have been passed by the State I believe don’t apply to many of these conditions and I believe you have got to go mighty careful in passing a bill of this kind. Throw our energies on what has already been done and get results from them. From talk¬ ing with practical men I think there is an undercurrent of feeling that the Plant Board, for instance, is too chesty and       163   that the laws are too sweeping and I tell you, gentlemen, while it appears in the State Horticultural Society as one of the finest laws being worked out, etc., under ground you will find that the strongest men and those we are looking up to, feel that there is a lot of red tape about it and we have got to all pull together and work out something satisfactory. I would by all means kill a proposition of this kind immediately.  H. H. Hume: I think, Mr. Raine, you are in a very unpopular place to be talk¬ ing against the Plant Board, for the most of us are well aware of the wonderful work which has been done and is being done by that institution.  Mr. Mark Sample: As I understand it, this is a tentative bill and the title of the bill is “Pest Control Act,” is it not? It is, as Mr. Skinner has just said to you, practically compulsory spraying. If there is anything we need in this State it is compulsory spraying. I believe all the best growers will agree with me that we must have spraying and the only way to have these things is by compulsory spray¬ ing. This particular bill is not the one that will be, presented perhaps, but is the bill prepared by the Plant Board to be corrected as deemed necessary. 11 is practically impossible to exterminate whitefly, but, Mr. Chairman, I do think it is very important that we have a bill enacted in our legislature called “Com¬ pulsory Spraying.”  Mr. M. G. Campbell: From my ex¬ perience in attending the legislature of this State in 1917 and 1919 I would say that that would be a bad bill for this as¬ sociation to indorse, although I person¬ ally am in favor of that bill. If the whole   State of Florida were a citrus-growing State instead of the southern part, it would be a different proposition but had that bill been in effect when we were asking for an appropriation for citrus canker you know what the legislature would have told us. They would have said, “Citrus canker is not included in that bill because you did not know it. We will include citrus canker in this bill and let each county pay for eradication.” If we should get black fly we would meet that same proposition in Tallahas¬ see, I am positive. We may have to go there for an appropriation for that pur¬ pose and if we do, you know what the legislature would say to us—“Black fly was not in Florida at that time; we will include it in your compulsory spraying bill and let each county handle it.” If that had been the case with citrus canker we would still have citrus canker. That is a good bill and I think every citrus man is in favor of it, but I think every citrus man who has had experience in Tallahassee knows what he is up against. When the entire citrus industry was threatened some thought it would be simply a matter of going to the legisla¬ ture and asking for an appropriation, but, take it from me, it was not such an easy matter to get it. The citrus industry was seriously threatened and if we had had a bill of this kind we would have citrus canker today, although it is a good bill.  Mr. H. H. Hume: I most thoroughly indorse what you have had to say, Mr. Campbell. Any further discussion?  Mr. Skinner: Moved that bill be laid on the table.  Moved and seconded that bill be laid on the table. Motion passed.@@     
 The Refrigeration of Citrus Fruits@@   Paul Mandeville@@ Orlando@@   Nothing is so dispiriting as to see a great opportunity passing unimproved. Never mind who said it, this is the dis¬ piriting part of the situation today. The greatest fortunes of the last generation were laid in the reconstruction period after the civil war. There, were in those days the hang-overs from the war days, the profiteers and the cunning men, Jim Fisk and Daniel Drew, but who hears of them today when the great fortunes are mentioned ?  And what was the foundation of the great fortunes? First of all a basic field of work, essentials, steel, oil, food and I might add drink. The names of the men who made these fortunes are too fa¬ miliar to recount them. Their methods were, on the whole, commercially sound and honest. Above all, they had vision.  Yet Carnegie said in the seventies that no man would ever make a large fortune in meat, and, behold, how soon was his vision out-run by the Armours, Swifts and the Morrises! And who can say that oranges and eggs are not the great oppor¬ tunities of today?  I mention eggs because I want, with your permission, to digress briefly from the subject given me, to say that I have observed an opportunity for profit in your groves that is not generally taken advantage of in Florida. I speak with a   broad and particular knowledge of both trade and farm conditions in the poultry industry when I say that there is not only a good profit in raising poultry and eggs for the Florida markets; but you have a wonderful natural range for poul¬ try in your groves, unexcelled anywhere for soil, shade and feed. And without my having much knowledge of the needs of your fruit trees I can see all about me the use of enormous quantities of fer¬ tilizers and enormous sums spent for spraying and fighting insects and I can tell you that poultry is an enemy to in¬ sects, feeding on them, and where poul¬ try ranges in sufficient numbers, the ground is constantly fertilized.  I also see the splendid groves and splendid poultry where these industries have been combined in Florida. And I have a suggestion to make that I believe is worth thinking about. You men who are used to co-operation should get to¬ gether in groups according to the size of your groves and the. number of head of poultry which one man can care for, and you should get specialists to introduce poultry into your groves. Some of you are good poultry-men and might turn to this development with profit; and there are thousands of skilled poultry-men in the North who would seize the opportun¬ ity to come to Florida, did they know the   164        165   conditions in their line and if you would see the need of their help and the profit you are letting slip out of your hands.  AGGRESSIVE ECONOMY  Tales of the Chicago fire were still fresh in my childhood. I remerrtber a neighbor who lost property in the heart of the city and who was found the morn¬ ing after with hammer in hand cleaning off the mortar from the smoking brick. This should not be. surprising, but it is human nature to talk a good deal, espec¬ ially after a great disaster. Our neigh¬ bor saw the bricks where his building be¬ fore stood and he entered at once into the spirit of his problem. Our neighbor died rich.  We have got to forget the aims of yes¬ terday and clean the. brick from our own house before we can build again. We have got to build with the bricks at hand. There have been changes too far-reach¬ ing for us all to begin with new materi¬ als. We. cannot borrow freely from one another. All have met the same turn to¬ gether and all have got to build anew. The sooner we get at this business the better. After glorious times of aggres¬ sive expansion, we have got to practice aggressive economy. Let us enter into the new spirit heartily, to win. Econ¬ omy is not a negative, thing. It means the investment of time and money. Econ¬ omy means husbandry and prevention of waste. As all have been liberal in times of expansion, so all now have got to economize and the. problem is a scientific one. We have a great work ahead.  Of the sum represented by the selling price of citrus fruit today, about a third   consists of freight; a third, of packing house charges; and a third, of the. grow¬ ers’ costs. There is no profit. If we are to get a profit in the future, we must get it out of these charges, or out of what we can save of the fruit that is spoiled.  What the buyer can pay for your fruit is all you have to work on, and you may be sure he will for some, time to come take advantage of every general economy which you can devise and will reduce his price. He is not looking out for your profit but is practicing economy like you. All are buyers and all are doing the same thing. So if growers and shippers are to make a profit, they have got to be aggressive, more aggressive than the buy¬ er and more aggressive than other grow¬ ers and shippers. You have got to get your brick cleaned first and be the first to build. That is what I mean by aggres¬ sive economy.  REDUCING THE FREIGHT AND OTHER  SAVINGS  I have said something about one chance for getting a profit or saving in the grove and I want to say something of the sav¬ ings to be made in the. freight, and from what we can prevent of the spoilage.  A great deal is said these days about high freight rates in connection with your costs. Like all the rest, we. are crying down the other fellow. But do we offer a constructive remedy? There is a constructive remedy for high freight rates and it is to get value for what you pay; better service and, above all, better cars. You need the very best refrigera¬ tors because of certain climatic condi¬ tions in Florida which I shall mention   1 66       later. You have had to stand for using poor and worn out cars which no other section of the country will consent to use. It is the belief of some railroad men that winter shipments do not require as good equipment as do summer crops, so you are asked to use up the old cars. I saw one last week that had a hole in the door large enough to throw a base ball through it. Whatever your needs, these cars are not right and are the cause of grave los¬ ses. They make uncertain the benefits of one of the greatest savings you can make today, the saving in ice. And they undo all fine work in refrigeration.  There are today enough refrigerator cars built to the so-called United States standard, and enough more building, to scrap some thousands of these cars that are not only worn out, but never were refrigerator cars in the right sense of the word. I believe it lies within your power to do this thing now. The railroads have taught you how to do it. They tell you how many nails you must put in your orange boxes before they can be used as standard and take the rate applying to oranges properly packed. Why do you not petition the. Interstate Commerce Commission for a tariff defining what is a standard refrigerator car, how it must be built and in what condition it must be before the railroad can charge you for refrigerator service? How can the Inter¬ state Commerce Commission refuse this demand for your protection with all the definitions now in the tariff put there on petition of the railroads for their protec¬ tion ? Why not outlaw these old cars and do it now?   Then there is the, saving in ice on fruit that has been pre-cooled. Ice will not be cheap for some years to come. That is one reason why your freight bills are high. The railroads rightly charge you for the ice, for the cost of icing the cars and for the interference to their sched¬ ules for frequent icing in transit. Pre¬ cooled fruit is not iced in transit. The cars are iced once before shipment. When pre.-cooling has become general, train schedules can be shortened and further savings made.  Fruit and vegetables that have been well pre-cooled enjoy all the benefits of full icing in transit at the cost of once icing before shipment. In dollars this means that five hundred cars of pre- cooled fruit will save sixty dollars a car in cost for ice. or thirty thousand dollars. And one of the pre-coolers completed last fall has done just that. And the pre¬ cooler is already paid for out of this sav¬ ing among others.  Another saving is in the price of the fruit and the prevention of decay. All citrus fruit is not equally perishable and some of it is quite hardy. But seedlings and late varieties that are shipped in warm weather are greatly benefited by pre-cooling. Some localities will never be able to solve their losses from decay in any other way. It is not possible to re¬ duce savings from benefits of this kind to dollars as we can in the case of ice be¬ cause such a figure would be mere guess work, but the savings are very great nev¬ ertheless and they are greater in some dis¬ tricts and for some fruit than in other districts and for other and hardier fruit.       167   Pre-cooling is beneficial to all shipments when the weather is wrong.  ACTION OF WATER  Now what do we mean by wrong weather? I have seen strong men in tears when the wind was in the east. You who grow vegetables know even better than do fruit growers that the warm, moist winds from the east carry sickness to these, products. Fungus and all kinds of parasites now appear to add to the grower’s risks. Just what happens is the very same phenomenon that we reverse when pre-cooling. The warm, moist winds, blowing over the fields and through the packing houses deposit their wetness on everything just as the cold dry air of the pre-cooler must take up that wetness again.  It is at this point that most of the past mistakes have been made in pre-cooling and in shipping after pre-cooling. But I shall explain. A simple illustration is this glass of ice water which you see is covered with dew. Now the dew is form¬ ing on the surface of the water even fast¬ er than it forms on the outside of the glass, but the dew on the surface of the zvater is dissolved in the water as fast as it forms , so it is not seen. Thus the cold water drinks up the moisture from the air and keeps on drinking it up as long as the water is colder than the air. In time, if the ice is not fenewed, the water will become as warm as the air of the room and will cease drinking up the moisture from the air. And should some¬ thing happen to make the water warmer than the air, or the air colder than the   water, then the water will give back its moisture to the air.  So you see that in a country surround¬ ed by the sea and full of lakes and rivers with winds blowing from everywhere, these changes from damp to dry and from dry to damp are constantly recurring. What we must do is to see. that they oc¬ cur the way we want them to. That is what proper refrigeration, properly ap¬ plied, enables us to do.  But we have to keep the principle of the evaporating and condensing waters al¬ ways in mind from the time we harvest until the vegetables or fruit are sold and eaten. And when once we commence to refrigerate, we. must carry these princi¬ ples in mind until the end of the journey for we are working with products that are colder than the air and that will at¬ tract moisture just as this glass of ice water.  Again, while our perishable, is being pre-cooled, it is warmer than the air in the pre-cooler and consequently is giving off its moisture. You can even see it steam, clouds of vapor appearing when the vegetable or fruit is quite warm. And without some provision to take away the vapor in the air, it loses its capacity to cool as well as to take up moisture be¬ cause, to cool freely, the product must evaporate. Fast pre-cooling is not only better for the product but it requires less of an investment in rooms in which to do the work, because more fruit is pre-cooled in an equal time. There are other sav¬ ings due to fast pre-cooling and some of them are important. I do not know of any advantages of pre-cooling slowly. The difference in this respect between   168       cold storing and pre-cooling, or getting the first heat out of a warm, fresh prod¬ uct, is frequently not well understood. It must be understood in order to make progress in the art of pre-cooling.  Now all successful methods that I know of for pre-cooling hot products that have moisture to give off, provide a way for removing the water given off. Citrus fruits, most deciduous fruits, ber¬ ries and watery vegetables contain a large amount of water and have to give, off part of it in pre-cooling. So we come back to our glass of ice water and say that modern practice has adopted the so- called open brine methods for pre-cool¬ ing, because they are much faster than methods which use brine or ammonia in pipes. Moisture does deposit on pipes in the form of frost, but not in the quanti¬ ties taken up by the finely atomized open brine. And as the pipes become encrust¬ ed with frost, they lose not only their power to take up water, but also their power to take up heat.  Open brine, pre-cooling has now been applied in Florida to citrus fruits and has been tried on celery with excellent re¬ sults.  WORK OF THE EXCHANGE  I need make no apologies for saying that without the backing of certain offi¬ cers and others interested in the Florida Citrus Exchange, this important develop¬ ment would not have been undertaken, and could not have been carried to the point where we have, arrived. I have had long experience in my line with so-called independent packers all over the country and I have met many progressive, and broad-minded men, some of whom would   not hesitate to go the limit, within their means, to advance the interests of their associates, and competitors, too, along with their own. All co-operation does not lie in co-operative movements. But I have been captivated by the enthusi¬ asm of these Florida men, and their vis¬ ion. The specialists working with them were encouraged to great efforts, and all will benefit. You will have to explain to me why it was. You may say that their relation to the original and final owners until your products reach the fi¬ nal market, enables them to do things which an independent cannot do and keep his head above water. I do not assume to explain. I simply say that the support given to our efforts by these men was bound to bring results and has brought results of the most far-reaching import¬ ance to Florida and the interests repre¬ sented here tonight. In the discussion that I understand is to follow this paper, I may have an opportunity to tell you some particular applications that have re¬ sulted from our recent work together.  I have, of course, only touched on the need for pre-cooling and the changes that will follow in trade practice. When we learned to ride a-horse-back, travelling on foot was a weary way. And when we learned to ride in a Pullman, the old day coach was somehow uncomfortable. I like to walk. No man can tell me that it is better to ride *n a Pullman than to walk in the original fashion of travelers. One sees more and feels better at the end of a day’s walk than at the end of a day~ in a Pullman car, at least I think so, but I ride in a Pullman because, my business.       169   is to get there in the work which it is my mission to do.  That is the way with refrigeration, when it comes, it stays. And it is not unlike the Pullman car either. Refriger¬ ation is an anaesthetic, it puts all the lit¬ tle parasites to sleep to the journey’s end and permits you to do in comfort and certainty what only the most skillful of you can do by watching the weather and governing your day-to-day practice ac¬ cording to the changing conditions. Like, an anaesthetic, too, refrigeration enables us to perform operations that without it would be impossible. So soon as refrig¬ eration appears, new trade practices fol¬   low in and before we know it, we all have to have it. The most profit is to the man who gets it first. This has been the experience with every product to which refrigeration has been applied; it will be your experience.  I have not been here long enough to speak with authority on some problems ahead of us. In the fifteen months since I came to Florida for this work, I have returned north seven times and have as promptly felt the pull and returned to Florida. Whitman would probably say that I am hooked and don’t know it. I mav have swallowed the hook; but I can truthfully say that it does not hurt a bit.@@   
 Going in Partnership With Nature@@   W. E. Sexton@@ Vero@@   Mr. Floyd has given me the subject of “Packing and Shipment of Citrus Fruit.” Why Mr. Floyd continues to put me on the program when he knows that I have only been in your State for seven years, to attempt to talk on a subject to men who have been living here for 25 and 30 years is something I cannot tell.  I do not pretend to know much about packing or shipment of citrus fruit, so you will please bear with me while I take up my lot of time on this program. I will try to make this talk as short as pos¬ sible. I feel like a “tender-foot” when I get among you men who have had many years of experience. While I am grow¬ ing some fruit and have a packing house at Vero, yet I am always conscious of my ignorance on certain lines of this work and it was never brought so forcibly be¬ fore me until last winter when one of the old “hard-boiled” growers in our county who had successfully out-guessed most of the buyers of citrus fruit for the past five or six years, sent word for me to come and buy his fruit. I have a man who works with me in the buying of fruit and picking and when I called on this “hard- boiled” customer I took my field man with me. We looked over the grove very carefully and after getting his idea of prices and number of boxes on the differ¬ ent groves we could tell from our own   estimates that this man had planned a fine trimming for us should we have taken the fruit at his figures. This we did not do and the next day, in talking to one of my friends this gentleman said, “I would like to know why that big tender-foot brought  that d- little ‘cracker’ with him.”  However, I believe that I have been able to get up some information in the past two years of operating our packing house, which might be of interest to the growers who are selling their fruit. First I want all the people who are actually growing citrus fruit to hold up their right hand. Now, I want the people who are selling fruit on the trees to hold up their right hand. Now, I would like to ask a few of these gentlemen who are selling fruit on the trees what percentage of their fruit grades fancy, what percent¬ age goes in the second grade, what per¬ centage in the third and what percentage in the plain. For your own information we have shipped during the past year, up until the time I had these figures pre¬ pared for me, 6,562 boxes of oranges. Out of this number of oranges 18 per cent were fancy; 47 per cent >vere F. G. brights; 21 per cent golden; 5 per cent russetts; 7 per cent plain. We shipped 27,067 boxes of grapefruit, which repre¬ sents the grapefruit from some of the best groves along the Indian River and  170         171   from groves whose owners would almost be willing to swear, if we were to talk to them about buying their fruit, that 50 per cent or more of their fruit would grade fancy. Our records show that only 5.5 per cent of this grapefruit packed out fancy; 23 per cent F. G. brights; 34 per cent goldens; 12 per cent russetts and 21 per cent plains, and I mean by plains that the fruit was so poor and indifferent that we did not want to place our brand on this fruit at all.  Now it is very easy to sell the fancy fruit, and I would be willing to pay a pre¬ mium of $1.00 a box for all fancy fruit that goes through my packing house, over any other price which I may pay for the general run of fruit. The result of our past experience with packing fruit is somewhat discouraging as far as buying is concerned, and I believe if the growers in our State, and particularly in our com¬ munity, do not use the very best method of spraying, the quality of our fruit will deteriorate to such an extent that it will be hard for them to market it at any price. A lot of this fruit does not run uniform and it looks to me like a hopeless proposition, to get a high grade of citrus fruit until some new groves are set, where men have taken some pains in selecting their bud wood with an idea of getting uniform color, size and quality.  It reminds me of the man in Indiana, the state from which I came, who took his children to the country to visit one of his friends. Arriving there he found four big, husky boys, and remarked to the farmer, “I am wondering if you can tell me how I can care for my boys in   such a way that they will grow up like your boys.” The farmer said, “I cannot help you out. If you want to grow boys like mine, you would have to begin with your grandfather.” I think that the growers of citrus fruit should have a standard of perfection in their minds and try to produce fruit as near this standard of perfection as possible. I have had some experience in improving corn and at one time was a corn judge in my state. You people here who are familiar with growing corn may know that Shelby county, Indiana, has for a number of years taken all the prizes at all the Na¬ tional Corn Shows; a great many of the State shows and some of the World Fairs. Growers there have a score card by which they judge corn, and all grow¬ ers of any importance keep these score cards before them in selecting their seed corn. They are always attempting to reach this standard of perfection which the score card represents and by doing this they have made wonderful progress in the development of corn in their com¬ munity.  With this in mind we advertised and encouraged the growers in our commu¬ nity to submit samples at our County Fair so that they might have their fruit judged and get some idea of a perfect fruit. Several of the growers got together and adopted a score card for judging citrus fruit. We gave the qualities which we considered the most important, a certain number of points according to their im¬ portance in judging the fruit, and I will read this score card to you in order that you may know what we are doing. The   172       growers got a lot of good from this little exhibit that we had and it gave them something from which to work and by which to judge their fruit. I believe that it will have a beneficial effect on the crops to be produced in the future.  Uniformity was given_io points  Color-io points  Trueness to type_io points  Quality -70 points  Under the heading of quality we had:   Texture and thickness of skin_io points  Percentage of juice_15 points  Sweetness _10 points  Acid-10 points  Seed: number and position_5 points  Flavor -10 points  Tissue -10 points   We gave quality 70 points because we figured that quality, from a market standpoint, is the most important thing to be considered in fruit. In describing these different points so that the growers would understand them we explained that Uniformity (10 points) takes into con¬ sideration color, uniform size and shape. You all know the Color (10 points) we look for in both grapefruit and oranges. Triteness to type (10 points) refers to the different varieties. Quality (70 points) takes into account thin skin with velvety texture, heavy per cent of well- flavored, sweet juice, with enough acid to keep it from being insipid. Seed should be nested near center with as lit¬ tle core and as few seed as possible. Fla¬ vor should be pleasing to the taste and   true to variety. Tissue should be free from excessive fibre and coarseness.  In regard to the packing of fruit and preparing it for the market, I think of grapefruit and oranges singly and as in¬ dividuals. You have, or should have, an ambition and that ambition is to have as nearly perfect fruit as possible for before the close of its career it should find its way into some of the finest homes in our country. In order to do this these fruits must be groomed and dressed up, if you please, the same as an individual, when getting ready to go to any of our large cities, would first think of seeing that his clothes and everything were in per¬ fect shape, in order that he might make as good a showing as possible. The man who overlooks this fact and allows his fruit to go into the market with its "‘heels” run down and in a shabby condi¬ tion will find his fruit will receive about the same reception as an individual would who attempted to go in under the same condition. It is very easy for the indi¬ vidual, who prepares himself before go- ing, to get most anything he wants when he gets into the large cities. If he does not prepare he will have a hard time and it is the same way with fruit. The fruit which is well-packed and dressed up and prepared for the big event of its exist¬ ence, finds open hands to receive it in the Northern markets and men eager to help it along and get it into the very best families. But the indifferent fruit is scoffed at and left standing in the street and as a result is a disappointment to the grower and also the man who has at¬ tempted to sell it and distribute it for the grower.@@            
 Problems in Shipping Citrus Fruits@@   A. R. Sandlin@@ Leesburg@@   This is a question which concerns more than the grower or shipper, for upon the final solution rests the success and pros¬ perity of the industry as a whole, and this prosperity will naturally spread in all di¬ rections and make for better times and conditions, not only for the grower but for the grove labor, packing house labor, the banks and the transportation compa¬ nies, etc.  The citrus industry has made a large growth within a comparatively short period, and with conditions promising a crop of from 15,000,000 to 18,000,000 boxes for the season of 1921-22 the growers, shippers, the many marketing agencies and the transportation compa¬ nies are thinking and discussing this ship¬ ping problem as much or more than they are the further development of the indus- try.  The grower is beginning to realize the vital importance of growing the very best quality of fruit possible to produce in his locality; and the time is not far distant when the grower who does not grow a higher grade fruit and does not better his shipping conditions, will be compelled to abandon his grove.  With all grades of fruit, it is important and necessary that the best care possible in picking and handling the fruit from the trees to and through the packing   house into the car be practiced. The once tough and leathery rind seems to be pass¬ ing to a more sappy and tender condition, and this together with the many different factors that shorten the carrying life of the fruit, has compelled our government and our better thinking people to set to work to better our shipping conditions. The result is better packing houses; bet¬ ter ventilation; better machinery, which is being improved from season to season; and what is probably of as much if not more importance, the pre-cooling plants are beginning to find their place where needed most. In the long warm and damp climate where we grow our fruit we can pack and cool it to that degree which will insure safe shipment under most any and all conditions.  The industry has grown to such a point that it is important that the growers and shippers keep well posted as to the daily shipments so as not to be forced to use improper cars until the transportation companies can furnish sufficient and proper equipment. It is also important not to pick the fruit in foggy, misty or rainy weather, which is too often done merely to hold the crews together. This invariably brings grief and especially so where a pre-cooling plant is not available.  All the above requires heavy expendi¬ tures but if judiciously handled, it is an 173    174       investment and not an expense and strengthens the confidence in all ship¬ ments.  Our crate material has received the most critical consideration during the past season, and rightly so, as the crates should be strong and capable of standing any reasonable punishment which is liable and will come to most any shipment. There¬ fore, it is necessary that the crate be made of the very best material, well stapled, and made with from four to five cement coated nails to the cleat. They should be loaded into cars, with each box on end, and tightly loaded so as to prevent shift¬ ing and breaking; with two strips on the top of the bottom tier, and with a nail in each strip to the box. The top tier should be loaded likewise, one strip to each tier and this strip should be against one side of the car and alternating for each tier. However, the safer loading would be two strips to each tier on the top with the ends of the strip in contact with one side of the car and the other to the opposite side of the car, leaving space for ventila¬ tion in each car and between each row of boxes.  As above stated, with the enormous amount of fruit to be shipped and taking into consideration the high cost of ma¬ terial such as boxes, nails, paper, etc., there is no doubt in my mind that the time has arrived when the lower grades of fruit will necessarily have to be ship¬ ped in bulk. During this season the pack¬ ing material and labor have cost in the neighborhood of from 90 cents to $1.00 per box, after the fruit reaches the pack¬ ing house, to place it aboard the cars   ready for shipment. The continual flow of this lower grade of fruit from the State in this manner only adds to the cost to the consumer without helping the qual¬ ity of the commodity. It is somewhat like going into a store and buying a dozen eggs for 50 cents and paying the mer¬ chant a dollar for a container in which to carry your eggs home. There has been possibly more bulk shipments from the State during the past season than during all other seasons combined and has prov¬ en to be a successful and satisfactory method of shipment. With the fast de¬ pletion of the forests and the increasing cost of manufacturing, crate material seems to be settling on a base of higher prices than ever known except during the war and yet the law of averages should bring the prices to a reasonable figure, and especially so if the crate manufactur¬ ers will permit the business to revert back to the old quality and on a competitive basis. The present prices only tend to make necessary the devising of some plan whereby the low grades and off quality of fruit must be handled with less expense, if the industry survives with this class of fruit.  In transporting our citrus fruits there are many problems in which we are all more or less concerned and the foremost thought in the minds of the growers and shippers is that freight rates must be re¬ duced. The rates are evidently slated for a reduction but just how much still re¬ mains to be figured out and settled on by the shippers, transportation people and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The transportation companies are in a       175   precarious condition for they fully realize the importance and the necessity of freight readjustment though they are not in a position to and cannot take action because they are hampered in every di¬ rection, either by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Labor Board. Re¬ cently the Southern railroads willingly agreed to allow unlimited diversions or re-consignments, after they were con¬ vinced that this practice was not being unnecessarily used and that the service for same was figured in with the freight rates, and that the right to divert cars would reduce the claims filed against the carriers. But when the matter was sub¬ mitted to the Interstate Commerce Com¬ mission it was refused.  The Labor Board in Washington has refused, and is refusing the transporta¬ tion companies the privilege to reduce la¬ bor on their respective lines. With the Labor Board dictating wages and the In¬ terstate Commerce Commission dictating rates, it leaves nothing for the officials of the transportation companies to do except try to survive the situation until such time as we growers and shippers will take hold of the situation with the view of having the Labor Board removed and bring the fact before the Interstate Commerce Commission that freight rates must nec¬ essarily be in proportion to the value of the commodities transported. About 50 per cent of the gross sales of our fruit, boxes, paper, nails and labor have gone to the transportation people as freight during the past season. For the growers to produce fruit requiring from ten to twelve months to make and to invest in   packing material, and then have 50 per cent of the gross sales deducted for a service of from six to ten days transpor¬ tation is nothing short of suicide for the industry and will bring conditions to such a point that transportation must neces¬ sarily be figured out in some other man¬ ner and on some other basis.  It seems to me that the time schedule of these cars in transit is also important as the transportation companies are now taking from 50 to 100 per cent more time to transport the cars to destination than they did five years ago. The more or less dilapidated condition of the equipment and cars together with the extra time for movement to destination, has caused the growers an almost inestimable loss, not only on specific shipments, but by poison¬ ing the minds of the receivers to the ex¬ tent that they fear Florida citrus fruits are weakening to such an extent that the elementary risk is more than they are willing to take, without an excessive al¬ lowance in this direction.  We must have more cars that are bet¬ ter equipped for the protection of the fruit in transportation, both during warm and cold weather. Our present refriger¬ ator cars are inadequate to move the bulk of fruit and are in a very bad physical condition and are not protecting the fruit as they should; neither are they holding or maintaining ice as outlined and plan¬ ned by the refrigerating engineers. Sta¬ tistics show that there is entirely too much difference in temperature between the first and second tiers of fruit. A car fully iced will refrigerate the contents un¬ til the ice has melted away one-third and   176       will retain that temperature until the ice has been reduced to one-half. After that the temperature of the contents will begin to rise and with the present equipment of cars and the long distance between the designated icing stations this does not seem to be sufficient to carry the fruit be¬ tween the regular icing points. Hence, we find on practically all shipments heavy extra icing charges which were necessary between the designated icing stations from the different orignial points of ship¬ ment.  The refrigerating car service people have placed orders for about 10,000 cars which will still be inadequate to handle the volume of fruit from the State and take care of the commodities from the other states that require refrigerator cars when our fruit is going forward. The situation has reached such a serious point that the growers on the Pacific coast are now trying an experiment with refriger¬ ator boat shipments through the Panama Canal to the Eastern markets. Two of these shipments have already arrived and their condition was highly satisfactory. The shippers of this State are watching the experiments very closely and I under¬ stand that there is a large company in the East which is now ready to figure with the growers and shippers of this State on the transportation problem, with the view   of building boats to carry such shipments, either under forced ventilation or under full iced refrigeration. If boat shipments meet their expectations and prove satis¬ factory to the receivers, there is no doubt that many boats will be converted and properly equipped for the handling of perishables; and if it were possible to se¬ cure reasonable rates from the different seaport points to the inland markets, it would relieve the congestion and would eventually expand into large export ship¬ ments which we will need within a very short time. And unless the transporta¬ tion people or the refrigerator car com¬ panies are more particular and come to the relief of the situation we will no doubt be compelled to encourage the water transportation in order to move the bulk of the different perishable products from our State.  If we will set to work to grow a better quality and a higher grade of fruit, using every discretion in the grade and pack, and insist upon a faster schedule and bet¬ ter equipment, cheaper rates and better shipping conditions, we will no doubt push forward and prosper and the indus¬ try continue to grow and expand and meet fully the expectations of all the growers who are operating and co-operat¬ ing economically for the betterment of the conditions of the industry.@@

 Resolutions@@   GOVERNMENT LABORATORIES AT ORLANDO   Whereas, The investigations of insect pests and diseases of sub-tropical fruits being carried on at the Government Lab¬ oratory at Orlando, Florida, are of in¬ estimable value to the citrus fruit indus¬ try of the State; and  Whereas, It is recognized that a care¬ ful study of the organisms causing scab, melanose and stem end rot of citrus and their reactions to varying conditions of weather, etc., is of vital importance in formulating economical and effective methods for their control; and  Whereas , The appropriations for the furtherance of this work have not been increased in a number of years, so that owing to lack of funds and insufficient personnel and the increasing amount of work resulting from the growth of pro¬ jects in hand and the taking up of new work, the output is unavoidably slow; and  Whereas, It is of increasing impor¬ tance that a thorough study be made of the life-history of the various insect pests of citrus to formulate more efficient and economical methods of controlling them; and that a study be made of the parasitic enemies, both insect and fungus, of the insects attacking citrus, with a view to their future introduction into the State; and   Whereas, It is of paramount impor¬ tance that increased funds be forthcoming immediately for the purpose of expedit¬ ing the work on the insect pests and dis¬ eases of citrus now under way so as to release reliable information at as early a date as possible;  Be it Resolved, That the Florida State Horticultural Society express its deep ap¬ preciation to the Hon. Secretary of Agri¬ culture for the valuable work being car¬ ried on in the State by the scientists of the Department of Agriculture and re¬ spectfully requests his support in obtain¬ ing increased funds for the furtherance of the work;  And Be it Further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be furnished the Congressmen and Senators from Florida.  H. H. Hume: At various times we have had before this Society Mr. Yothers and Mr. Winston. The moneys asked for under this resolution and the request for continuance of the work, is the work being handled by Mr. Yothers and Mr. Winston very largely and knowing that work as I have known it in the past, and knowing the quality of the men that they are, I am very sure you will agree with me when I say that no more important work has been carried on in the State of Florida and it has been of inestimable   180        181   value to the industries in which we are so deeply interested and in which we are en¬ gaged. You have heard the resolution as read—those in favor of its adoption will let it be known by saying “Aye,” op¬ posed “No.” The “Ayes” have it and the motion is carried.  H. H. Hume: Ladies and Gentlemen, there is a matter that I want to bring to your attention in connection with our membership at this time. For many years Prof, and Mrs. Rolfs labored very diligently in this State and very much of the upbuilding of our horticulture in Florida has been due to their efforts. He   is a life member of this Society and Mrs. Rolfs also has been a life member—mem¬ bers for at least twenty years. I think it would be a very nice thing as recognition of their connection with this Society dur¬ ing these many years to elect these two members to honorary membership in the Society. (Applause.) I believe that means that you approve taking care of the matter along this line.  Moved by Mr. Skinner and seconded by Mr. Goodwin that we elect Prof, and Mrs. Rolfs to honorary membership in the State Horticultural Society.  Motion carried.   APPROPRIATIONS FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING   Whereas, Florida’s State institutions of higher learning have not been financed adequately in the past to keep pace with the increasing numbers of young men and young women who wish to avail them¬ selves of the educational advantages for which those institutions were established, and has resulted in large numbers of our young people having to forego the educa¬ tion they had hoped to secure; and  Whereas, The same lack of financing by the State has seriously curtailed the work of the Agricultural Experiment Sta¬ tion, placing a great handicap on the de¬ velopment of the horticultural, agricul¬ tural and live stock industries; therefore be it  Resolved, By the Florida State Horti¬ cultural Society in convention at Miami   on April 14, 1921, that we urge upon the members of the 1921 Legislature, the ap¬ propriation of the full amounts recom¬ mended by the Board of Control for: The Florida State College for Women, Talla¬ hassee; the University of Florida, includ¬ ing the Agricultural College, the Agricul¬ tural Experiment Station, and the Exten¬ sion Work, Gainesville; Florida School for Deaf and the Blind, St. Augustine; and the Agricultural and Mechanical Col¬ lege for Negroes, Tallahassee; and  Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be furnished to Gover¬ nor Cary A. Hardee; to each member of the Senate and of the House of Repre¬ sentatives; and to each member of the Board of Control.  Passed.    182       NO-FENCE LAW   Be It Resolved, By the State Horti¬ cultural Society of Florida, comprising a membership of two thousand growers, at its thirty-fourth annual session in Miami, Florida, that;  Whereas, At the thirty-third session the platform of the Florida No-Fence League was unanimously indorsed, and Whereas, The Agricultural and Hor¬ ticultural interests of the State are of prime importance and are the hope of the State’s future greatness, and  Whereas, The encouragement and protection of the industry by proper and reasonable laws, respecting the prevention   of the roaming at large of live stock is the next step of prime importance; Now therefore  Be It Resolved, That we heartily in¬ dorse the proposed bill to prohibit the running at large of domestic animals within the State of Florida.  That a copy of this resolution be sent to Senator Oscar M. Eaton and Repre¬ sentative F. P. Foster and that telegrams be sent by the secretary to the Speaker of the House and to the President of the Senate of the present Legislature, evi¬ dencing this indorsement.  Passed.   Election of Officers   On Thursday evening, April 14, 1921, the following officers were elected for the year beginning January 1, 1922, and end¬ ing December 31, 1922.  President —H. Harold Hume.   Vice-Presidents —L. B. Skinner, W. J. Krome, S. F. Poole.  Secretary —Bayard F. Floyd. Treasurer —W. S. Hart.  Executive Committee —L. D. Niles, B. L. Hamner, Frank Stirling.   Selection of Next Meeting Place   At the evening session on April 14, 1921, Lakeland was selected as the meet¬ ing place for the thirty-fifth annual meet¬ ing of the Society in 1922. The exact time of meeting will be set by the Exec¬ utive Committee at its annual spring   meeting in 1922. The invitation for Lakeland was extended by Mrs. Geo. W. Peterkin. Invitations were extended by representatives from Gainesville, Tampa and Orlando, but were withdrawn in fa¬ vor of Lakeland.@@   183      
 Final Resolutions@@   Edgar A. Wright, Chairman@@   The Florida State Horticultural So¬ ciety, in thirty-fourth annual convention assembled, is mindful of obligations un¬ der which it rests, to numerous individ¬ uals, and others, and being grateful, wish¬ es to express such gratitude as is possible and adequate, and therefore be it  Resolved, That we thank the city of Miami for its hospitality and we lay our tribute at her feet in expression of amaze¬ ment and wonder at her marvelous growth and extreme beauty. That we thank the School Board of Miami for the generous offer for the use of the school building auditorium, where our meetings have been held, and we congratulate the citizens on the possession of such a build¬ ing. That we thank the officials of the Miami Beach Aquarium for throwing open their doors to members of our So¬ ciety, and we recommend them for the ex¬ cellent work that has been done in col¬ lecting rare specimens of sea life, believ¬ ing that this is the best aquarium south of New York City.  That we thank the managers of the Ex¬ otic Garden Exhibit, Messrs. Donn, Rea- soner and Soar, for the beautiful exhibit of exotic shrubs and flowering plants pre¬ sented by them in the auditorium of the Halcyon Hotel, believing that the equal of this exhibit of such exotic plants has probably never before been shown in this   country. And we also appreciate the ef¬ forts of packers and individuals for the display of citrus and other fruits, believ¬ ing that they are the superior in quality of any like fruit grown anywhere in the world.  We appreciate the efforts of the U. S. Plant Introduction Garden and of Dr. David Fairchild, and we commend the part he has personally taken in our pro¬ gram, and we recommend that the work of the Garden be continued and enlarged.  We thank J. S. Raney, county agent, for his efforts in our behalf in making all the detailed arrangements for the success¬ ful conduct of our proceedings and for our comfort, and we congratulate Dade county for having as agent a man so ef¬ ficient, courteous and untiring in his ef¬ forts in behalf of others.  We thank the railroads of Florida for giving us a rate and a half for the round trip to the convention.

ARNOLD   Mr. T. I. Arnold was born near Byron, Ga., June 16th, i860. At the age of twenty-four he came to Florida and en¬ gaged in orange culture near Anthony, Marion county. After the big freeze, be¬ cause of which he lost his grove, he be¬ came manager of a phosphate mine owned and operated by Mr. McDowell, in whose employ he remained for some years. Later he again took up orange cul¬ ture in the employ of H. B. Stevens, at Citra, Fla., where some of the finest or¬ anges in the State are grown.  Still in the employ of Mr. Stevens, some years later he moved to Orlando, where he entered the pineapple industry, in which he spent eight or ten years, dur¬ ing the last four or five years being asso¬ ciated with J. C. Talley in the business. Owing to the difficulty of competing with   the Cuban growers of pineapples, also those of the east coast of Florida, the work at Orlando had to be abandoned, be¬ cause the price received for fruit was not sufficient to compensate for trouble and expense of raising the fruit under cover.  During the first year of his stay in Or¬ lando, in January, 1896, he was married to Miss Pauline Pugh, a teacher in the Orlando High School, whom he had known ever since coming to the State.  In 1905 Mr. and Mrs. Arnold removed to Jacksonville, where they bought a home, and where Mrs. Arnold taught for years in the Duval High School.  During the remainder of his life he was engaged in the lumber business at Oak, being manager and part owner of the Arlo Box Company.    186       GEORGE WILLARD ADAMS   The subject of this sketch, familiar to many of the older members of the Flor¬ ida State Horticultural Society, for he and his wife were most enthusiastic mem¬ bers for many years, passed away on Jan¬ uary 3d, 1921, at the ripe age of eighty- three years and six months. In 1837 George W. Adams was born in North- bridge, Massachusetts, moving from there to Milford in his boyhood. Until young manhood he spent his time on his father’s farm. The call of business in Boston came to him and he went there to live prior to 1867.  In July, 1868, he married Miss Hattie S. Humphrey and they made their home in Chelsea for a few years; in 1873 Mrs. Adams died. For some years Mr. Adams and his older brother represented the Da¬ vis Sewing Machine Co., throughout the New England States, with headquarters in Boston. After a few years his health failed and his physicians ordered him away from the cold climate. In March, 1875, he married Miss Elizabeth Conant, and they immediately left for Florida, where they spent the remainder of the winter. Mr. Adams improved in health and their next move was to Iowa and Col¬ orado. In 1877 came to South Flor¬ ida to live.  Mr. Adams was the first Northern set¬ tler to get his homestead from the gov¬   ernment and settle at Lake Thonotosassa (Lake of Flints), Hillsboro county. He and another would-be settler traveled by wagon over a large portion of South Flor¬ ida but found nothing so beautiful as this lake. Here they became pioneers in earn¬ est. There was no railroad as far south as Tampa until 1883, so these travelers from the North went to Cedar Keys thence by boat to Tampa. When he had his land cleared so a house could be built, the lumber was ordered from Pensacola and one can imagine the wearisome days they were hauling this lumber sixteen miles through the pine woods to the pres¬ ent location. Mr. Adams said, “he could feel himself getting better every day,” and he did entirely recover from the tu¬ bercular trouble with which he was af¬ fected.  He set out orange trees, going miles to get trees or nursery stock to put in his grove, then he raised quite a stock of nur¬ sery trees, supplying many of the new¬ comers with trees for groves. Mr. Adams set out about twenty acres in grove but recently sold out all but five acres surrounding his house when he found his strength was not sufficient to care for so many trees. In 1892 he put in an irrigating system that gave the fin¬ est results in watering the grove, and gave him more uniform crops yearly.   JAMES C. CRAVER  Mr. James C. Craver was born at edge which lingered with him to the end. Jonesboro, Ill., December 27, 1849. He was a studious lad. Stories are still  Early in boyhood he gave evidence of that abundant of his taking his books to the eager desire for scholarship and knowl- field and resting his tired horse often   /       187   that the boy’s mind might gather some more gems of poetry from the book on the stump or fence corner before him. After reading all the books he could find in the neighborhood and passing through the public schools, he entered the Univer¬ sity of Illinois. Here he made fine prog¬ ress, and would have been graduated with honors but for the collapse of his health. In his senior year he was forced to aban¬ don his beloved studies and begin the fight for his life. After a second collapse he determined to seek a warmer climate and selected Florida.  He journeyed by boat and rail to New Orleans. From there he sailed May 18, 1877, f° r Tampa on the Lizzie Hender¬ son. He landed in Tampa, May 22, 1877, and soon thereafter settled at what is now called the Tampa-Ozona cross roads, where he took out a homestead in the midst of the piney woods. Here he un¬ dertook the colossal task of developing a home, without capital, without food and without strength. His diary, which he kept through life, bears most eloquent tes¬ timony to the hardships that he suffered during his early days and his humility at   times in having had to borrow the neces¬ sary food to sustain life until he could become established. With dauntless de¬ termination he struggled on and was re¬ warded by a great improvement in his health and by seeing the orange and lemon grove which he planted on his homestead develop into a property of value.  With the permanent recovery of his health, Mr. Craver began to prosper in business. He had the first postoffice at his homestead, which was called “Yellow Bluff” and was commissioned on Septem¬ ber 10, 1886. This name was afterwards changed to Ozona. After the town of Sutherland was started, he built a store and opened a mercantile establishment, added a line of drugs, became the post¬ master, a notary public and general con¬ sultant for the entire community. He was conservative and wise in investing his earnings and soon accumulated consider¬ able property. On February 25, 1920, he died, being survived by a nephew, David Craver, of Tampa, and two nieces, Miss Alice Craver and Mrs. Mary Williford, both of Sutherland, Fla.   JOSHUA PITT FELT   Mr. Joshua Pitt Felt was born in Bigg Flats, N. Y., December 7, 1844. Re¬ moved to Emporium, Pa., in early child¬ hood with his parents, where he spent the greater part of his life, being engaged chiefly in merchant milling. He became interested in citrus fruits in 1885 and came to Emporia, Volusia county., where   he planted his first orange grove, and where he built his winter home. His faith in the future of the orange business was never shaken by subsequent freezes and he was actively engaged in the grow¬ ing and shipping of citrus fruit from 1885 until his death in Eustis, July 3, 1919.   1   188       HENRY A  Mr. Henry A. Hempel, founder of Gotha, Orange county, Florida, and a former member of the State Horticul¬ tural Society, died March 31, 1920, at Buffalo, N. Y.  Mr. Hempel was born in Walters- hausen, Gotha, Germany, on October 21, 1836, and after the early death of his father, a weaver, he became an appren¬ tice in a large printing establishment. Coming to the United States in 1867 he followed his printer’s trade in several Western states, coming to Buffalo, N. Y., in 1876. He had in the meantime become an American citizen and decided to make Buffalo his home.  Mr. Hempel is the inventor of the printer’s metal quoin which is now used all over the civilized world in printing es¬ tablishments.  In 1879 Mr. Hempel took his first trip to Florida in a search for better health, and was so enchanted by the climate and  DR. T. G.  Dr. T. G. Julian was born Sept. 19, 1864, at the old home place near Frank¬ fort, Ky., which had been the home of the Julians for four generations. He attend¬ ed and graduated from the old Kentucky Military Institute, then studied pharmacy, graduating with high honors at the School of Pharmacy, Louisville, Ky. He then went into the drug business in Mt. Ster¬ ling, Ky., where he remained for eight years.  He had suffered with rheumatism for fifteen years so in 1894 he came to Flor-   . HEMPEL  natural beauties that he purchased a large tract of land in Orange county, near Or¬ lando. Here he established the village of Gotha, named in memory of his birth place, building himself a handsome resi¬ dence and bringing to it as permanent set¬ tlers many German-speaking families. For the next thirty years he continued to make Florida his home, going North to Buffalo each summer to look after the manufacture of his printer’s quoins.  Mr. Hempel was much interested in orange culture, establishing and operating a number of groves, and brought to southern Florida a number of improved varieties of economic plants and breeds of stock.  He is survived by his widow and four children, Mrs. F. L. Lewton, of Washing¬ ton, D. C.; Adolph Hempel, of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Mrs. J. C. Lang, and Otto F. Hempel, of Buffalo.   JULIAN  ida for his health. From that time he made a study of orange culture, devoting all of his time and attention to it. He came to Clearwater to locate in 1899 and purchased several orange groves which he owned at the time of his death.  I have heard Dr. Julian say many times that he owed his improved health to Flor¬ ida climate and wished to repay by doing something for the people of Florida. He made a special study of the disease in cit¬ rus trees called “foot-rot,” and was so successful in curing it in his own groves       189   that his friends and neighbors came to him for advice as to how to treat their trees for this disease. He wished to make a present of his discovery to the growers of Florida so that they all might be benefited by his study.  Dr. Julian has long been considered an authority on citrus culture in South Flor¬ ida and was known by growers all over the State as a man who, having made a success in the business was always glad to be of assistance to any one who went to   him for help or advice. The Pinellas County Growers’ Association at their an¬ nual meeting at Largo in 1918, passed unanimously a resolution thanking Dr. Julian for his work and advice for the growers of Pinellas county.  Dr. Julian died on April 26, 1920, at Clearwater, and is survived by his widow, Mrs. Pattie Chenault Julian, and two daughters, Mrs. S. C. Elbert, of Birming¬ ham, Ala., and Mrs. L. G. Abbott of Clearwater, Florida.   A. S. J. McKENNEY   Mr. A. S. J. McKenney, late of Stan¬ ton, Marion county, Florida, was born at Smarrs, Ga., April 6, 1862. In 1886 he went to Florida and was in mercantile business at Stanton for several years.  He was married in 1889 to Miss Lula Calhoun, of Macon, Ga.  He had an orange grove at Stanton which was cut down by the freeze of 1894 and 1895, which he afterwards rebuilt.  In 1900 he moved to Lakeland and was engaged in mercantile business again, but   as orange culture was what he liked best, he returned to Stanton in 1912, where he made orange growing a success. He g^ve his entire attention to horticulture and al¬ ways attended the annual meetings of the Horticultural Society whenever it was convenient.  He had just returned from the meet¬ ing at Orlando, May 8, 1919, and was taken ill the next day. On May nth he passed away, and is survived by his widow.   WALTER W. MANN   On April 30, 1920, Mr. Walter W. Mann of Winter Haven, Florida, died at Clayton, Georgia. Mr. Mann was one of the most prominent real estate men in the Winter Haven section and was in no small way responsible for the great devel¬ opment which has taken place in that sec¬ tion in recent years.  Mr. Mann was born in Jonesboro, Georgia, October 8, 1870. On August   12, 1896, he married Miss Lola Brassell in Marion county, Florida. About fif¬ teen years ago he moved to Winter Ha¬ ven, where he has been actively engaged ever since in the development of that sec¬ tion into the garden spot of Central Flor¬ ida. He is survived by his wife and three children, Walter Herman, his son, being the eldest.   190       JOHN SCHNARR   Mr. John Schnarr was born in Hessan Cassee, Germany, April 4, 1851. At the age of about two years he came with his parents to this country. The journey was made in a sail boat and they landed at New Orleans. From New Orleans they went by boat up the Mississippi River to Quincy, Illinois, where he grew to man¬ hood. For a while he was engaged in the mercantile business. From this employ¬ ment he entered the service of the Noxal Shirt Company, as a traveling salesman. During the next thirty-one years he trav¬ elled for this company and the Harga- dine-McKitrick Company. After this long period of service there came from exposure incident to the work a decline in health and he sought relief in Florida. He came to Seville about 1905, but very soon found his way to Orlando, where he lived until he died, October 28, 1919. He was married to Mrs. Laura Gilliam of Elgin, Illinois, January 5, 1912, who now survives him. Soon after arriving in Orange county he purchased a grove in the Conway section near Orlando. At this time the ravages of the white fly was  CHARLES  Mr. Charles Pugsley was born Decem¬ ber 5, 1851, in Athens County, Ohio. The family of eight moved west in 1855, settling in Harrison county, Iowa, on a farm, where he had the advantages of the. common school, high school being out of the financial reach of the small farm¬ er in that day and place.  At the age of twenty-one he associated Limself with his two older brothers in the   uppermost in the minds of the citrus growers not only in Orange county but the entire State. Mr. Schnarr, together with his nephew, Mr. Hahn, proceeded to develop an insecticide which would be es¬ pecially adapted for Florida conditions. After many years of experimental work they succeeded in compounding Schnarr’s Insecticide. This work alone would en¬ title him to a very prominent place in the history of citrus culture in Florida. He had many very amiable qualities and traits. He was intensely loyal and his honesty was never questioned. He pos¬ sessed a most marvelous faith in human¬ ity. To illustrate this particular quality of mind an incident should be mentioned. With possibly one or two exceptions, he never refused to ship insecticide to any¬ one who ordered it, regardless of their financial condition or standing. During all his business experience of about four¬ teen years, he lost practically no money from bad accounts.  Besides his wife, a brother, William Schnarr, survives him.  ■#  PUGSLEY  growing of nursery stock. After this experience he went to Texas, where he spent a season on a sheep ranch. During the years 1883-1884 he had his first res¬ idence in Florida, coming to Mannville with his father, who settled there on a tract near town.  In the. fall of 1884 after spending the summer traveling in the west he returned to Mannville, and made his home with       191   his father’s family. Here he planted an assortment of fruits which grew with va¬ rying degrees of success. His peaches bore a pleasing crop, but when the ex¬ press bills were paid, he would have been better off with a complete failure. He had a promising grove of oranges begin¬ ning to bear when the great freeze of 1894-1895 killed it to the ground. He immediately ordered scions from Cali¬ fornia, sawed off the trees at the ground, and inserted grafts into the stumps, which grew nicely, and were, beginning to bear when the freeze of 1899 came, and he found himself penniless.  The years 1901 to 1903 were spent at Cutler, Dade county, where he accumu¬ lated two thousand dollars raising truck. Then he and an older brother, George Pugsley, took a one-horse, camping outfit and started on a search for a good loca¬ tion for an orange grove, driving from Punta Gorda north. They finally chose   Winter Haven, where they planted forty acres to oranges and grapefruit. This grove, was coming into bearing when he engaged to manage the packing house of the Florida Citrus Exchange at Winter Haven. Failing health, however, com¬ pelled him to withdraw from hard work. The grove was sold, and he purchased a small tract near town.  During the last two years of his life he was engaged in experimenting with the avocado, planting the best and hardi¬ est of the Guatemalan type. He was meeting with encouraging success when he was called, on October 15th, 1919. In his death the State of Florida has suf¬ fered a distinct loss, for had he lived he would have settled the adaptability of the avocado to the latitude and vicinity of Winter Haven. He is survived by his brothers, Marcellus and George, and his sister, Frances E. Pugsley.   DAVID H. SCOTT   Mr. David H. Scott was born in On¬ tario, Canada, in 1868. He moved to Virginia with his parents in 1878. Came to Florida to engage in the fruit growing and shipping industry in 1893. He was a graduate of Richmond College. At   the time of his death, which occurred July 12, 1919, he owned 80 acres of bearing grove and ran a packing house in Arca¬ dia. He leaves a wife, a daughter and a son.   ED. SCOTT   Mr. Ed. Scott was born in July, 1866, and died at home, December 11, 1920. He was very active in promoting good roads and was a member 6f the State Road Department at the time of its or¬ ganization. At the time of his death he   owned about twelve acres of orange grove and his principal holding was the Scott Telephone System of Arcadia. He is survived by a wife and six daughters. He was a brother of David H. Scott.   192       WILLIAM NATHANIEL WILSON   Mr. William Nathaniel Wilson, the son of Col. Lemuel and Mrs. Rafaila Wilson, was born at Newnansville, Flor¬ ida, June. 18, 1864. At a very early age he moved with his parents to Gainesville, Florida. In 1886 he was married to Mrs. Ruth Scarratt, who with one child, Miss Rafaila, survive him. His death occurred March 15, 1920. Though prominent as   a dry goods merchant, he was intensely interested in horticulture and truck farm¬ ing and owned several large citrus groves in different parts of the State. He was also a member of the Standard Fertilizer Company of Gainesville, and Vice-Presi¬ dent of the Gulf Fertilizer Company of Tampa. @@
