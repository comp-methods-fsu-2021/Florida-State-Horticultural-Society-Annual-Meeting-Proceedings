PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 

EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING 


OF THE 

Florida State Horticultural Society. 


The Eighteenth Annual Meeting was held in the Board of Trade rooms, Jack¬ 
sonville, commencing Thursday evening at eight o’clock. The meeting had the largest attendance of any session held in 
Jacksonville; nearly two hundred mem^ 
bers having registered sometime between the first and the last day. The pro¬ 
gram was a very interesting one and the 


sessions were all well attended. The entertainment furnished by the Board of 
Trade, Ladies’ Friday Musicale and others was greatly enjoyed by the members. The members evidently thought that Jackson¬ 
ville was the home of the Society as when the question of the next place of meeting was brought up, Jacksonville was unanimously selected.

Address of Welcome. 


BY MAYOR G. M. NOLAN. 


Mr, President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In looking over this large audience I see a great many familiar faces, emphasizing the fact that you are not sojourners in our beautiful State nor strangers in its metro¬ 
polis, but one of the oldest organizations in the State and one of its staunchest pil¬ 
lars of prosperity. I am glad also to see so many ladies, fair daughters of Florida, 
present, and congratulate you and the 
Florida State Horticultural Society upon the large attendance at the opening of your eighteenth annual session. 

Mr. President, the city of Jacksonville as you know has now become one of the greatest convention and assembly meeting places in the country. I may tell you in advance, that the gentleman who will fol¬ 
low me in an address of welcome on be¬ 
half of the Board of Trade of this city, 
Captain C. E. Garner, will inform you that these annual meetings of societies and conventions keep the mayor almost con¬ 
stantly on his feet delivering welcoming addresses, and that I have a cut and dried speech which I deliver to every one of them. While it is true that it is one of the most important functions of the mayor¬ 
alty, these privileges are a great pleas¬ 
ure to me, and these annual meetings of the various societies are a great benefit not only to the city of Jacksonville, but to the State at large as well. I am not here to give you a cut and dried or second hand address of welcome, for of all the socie¬ 
ties that hold their annual sessions in this city, none of them are. I wish now and 


here to assure you, more heartily welcome than the Florida State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety, whose great work, past and future, 
for the interests of the great State of 
Florida, has been basic, and it is and will continue to remain one of the staunchest foundation-stones of the prosperity of this 
State. 

Mr. President, I must confess that I am not sufficiently versed in the nomenclature of Horticulture to know or define its limitations. My idea, however, is that horticulture embraces everything at least that would not properly come under the generic term of agriculture, and of neces¬ 
sity it must include some of the arts of agriculture, I therefore conclude that it is esthetic agriculture, it gives us the fruits and flowers of the gardens and orchards of the homes, rather than the products of the broad acres, and as the State of 
Florida is destined to become the garden and orchard of this country, the great work of your society is of the greatest in¬ 
terest to the prosperity of the State of 
Florida. Indeed Mr. President I have perceived and do perceive, as must every one with common knowledge of your great work, that upon your endeavor and achievement rests in a great degree the name and the fame of the great State of 
Florida. 

Now, Mr. President, should I attempt to catalogue the vast collections and varieties of the fruit of the orchard, the ornamen¬ 
tals of the garden, tropical and semi- 
tropical, with which every active member 







14 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


of your society is doubtless familiar, I 
should become bewildered. The greatest ancient achievement in horticulture was perhaps the hanging gardens of Babylon, 
from whence transplanted from Persia we know came the rose, apple, pear, quince, 
pomegranate and the peach—there, Mr. 
President, at the mention of the luscious peach I can proceed no further. I do not say this with any disparagement against any of the other of our great family of citrus fruit, the orange, the grapefruit, the plum, the apple, but the vision and aroma 


of peaches and cream makes oratory suc¬ 
cumb to appetite, and I must stop. (Ap¬ 
plause.) 

Mr. President, in conclusion, I have the great honor to tender to you the keys of the city, and to extend to you and each of you a double, thrice welcome to the City of 
Jacksonville, the Metropolis of your State, 
and bespeak for you a session of great benefit to the State as well as of pleasure and profit to each of you individually, and as a society. 


ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE. 

BY CAPT. C E. GARNER. 


Mr. President^ Ladie.s and Gentlemen: 

On behalf of the Board of Trade as its president, and as representative of the business interests of the City of Jackson¬ 
ville, I desire to extend to you, to the 
Florida State horticultural Society and to each of you individually and collective¬ 
ly a most hearty, cordial welcome to our 
City. I wish to reiterate what has been said by the Honorable Mayor who has just preceded me, that Jacksonville has become one of the greatest convention and assembly meeting places in this country. 
There are at the present moment several other organizations and societies holding their annual sessions in the city, moreover these conventions and gatherings are not confined to those of the State, they come here from all over the country to hold their annual meetings. Many of these dates being arranged for during the win¬ 
ter months in order that they may enjoy the balmy climate of our fair State for their deliverations, Mr. President, I wish 


here to assure you that, of all of these societies, none of them are more welcome than the Florida State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety, indeed we claim you as one of us, to you, to your great work, is due in a great measure the renown of our fair State. 

Mr. President, I wish at this time to invite the attention of your society to a movement in this State which in my judg¬ 
ment, if properly handled, will prove of much benefit to the State and to the Horti¬ 
cultural interests of this State. I refer to the effort now being made to the trans¬ 
planting of a Japanese Colony in Florida. 
The Japanese, Mr. President, as you know, 
are essentially a horticultural people, and 
I believe if this movement receives the encouragement it merits that the State will be greatly benefitted, especially the horticultural interests of the State. 

Now, Mr. President, after you have lis¬ 
tened to the eloquent address of the Hon¬ 
orable Mayor, you will perhaps be inclined to expect me to soar into similar flights of 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


15 


oratory, this I am unable to do, it has always been my portion to follow the 
Honorable Mayor, and he has the happy faculty of covering the very points on which I would address you. This he does with so much grace and elegance that it would be folly for me to undertake to improve upon it, therefore I crave your indulgence in that direction, but when it comes to the cordiality of the welcome that 
I am commissioned to extend to you, that is peculiarly my province, and where I 
may fail in eloquence, I hope to come up to the measure of a counterbalance in the fullness and completeness of this privilege. 


In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish to announce that the Board of Trade has planned and arranged for a portion of your entertainment, a trip upon the beauti¬ 
ful St. Johns river on the good Steamer 
May Garner, which is duly announced upon your program. 

Trusting that the deliberations of this your eighteenth annual session, will prove to be of much pleasure to the society and of benefit to the State, and with as¬ 
surances of .that welcome which is yours as of right as your home, I bid you again a most hearty, cordial welcome. 


Response for the Society* 


BY C T. McCARTY. 


Mr. Mayor and Mr. President of the 
Board of Trade, and Mr. President of the Florida State Horticultural Society, 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It affords me infinite pleasure to be given the opportunity to reply to the glow¬ 
ing and cordial words of welcome to which we have listened with so much pleas¬ 
ure, uttered by his Honor, the Mayor of the City of Jacksonville, on behalf of its citizens and the President of the Board of 
Trade, representing the great commercial interests of this Metropolis of the great 
State of Florida. The address of wel¬ 
come of modern times has become an ora¬ 
tion—a poem, and it has been made the occasion for the display of wit and wis¬ 
dom, oratory and rhetoric of some of the most brilliant and far-seeing of our fellow- 
countrymen. The responses to the ad¬ 


dresses of welcome have necessarily had to keep pace with the character of the ad¬ 
dresses themselves. This has imposed some hardship upon those who are called upon to respond to these eloquent ad¬ 
dresses of welcome. 

Jacksonville is to-day pre-eminently the 
Convention City of the State. Within her portals she has harbored and entertained during the last year the various Conven¬ 
tions that have represented the great Busi¬ 
ness, Commercial, Horticultural and 
Agricultural enterprises of the State. In the progress of these Conventions you have developed some trained Orators, in the persons of your magnetic and eloquent 
Mayor, and your sound and far-sighted 
President of the Board of Trade. Among the splendid efforts that they have made in the past, none, we think, exceeds those

i6 


glowing speeches to which we have to¬ 
night listened. 

The lover, whose eloquent words of en¬ 
dearment and encouragement are breath¬ 
ed into the ear of his beloved, tells but little that is new. He repeats the same old, 
old story, but it is always fraught with magnetism and poetry for the loved one who hears it. This shall always continue to be the case so long as Humanity shall continue to remain true to those high and holy instincts that have characterized it in the past. 

The mother standing on the threshold of the Home, who receives to her bosom the long-absent son, speaks a few broken words of welcome and receives in re¬ 
sponse a few words of gladness and com¬ 
fort, only an interchange of expressions of welcome of the mother and the response from the glowing heart of the son. In both of these cases the phrases spoken were reduced to the plain, ^^Thou art wel¬ 
come’’ and the response that the welcome 
‘‘is appreciated and reciprocated,” what¬ 
ever is said means the same. 

But in the evolution of these civic and fraternal gatherings these addresses of welcome and responses have grown to things of beauty and things of great pro¬ 
portion, and among the various illustra¬ 
tions of such beautiful addresses, those we have listened to, to-night stand pre¬ 
eminent. I do not hope to be able to give fit utterance to the feelings that well up within me in attempting to-night to re¬ 
spond to these eloquent addresses. I can only assure you, Mr. Mayor, and Mr. 
President of the Board of Trade, that what my words shall lack in oratory and logic they shall amply make up in sinceri¬ 
ty and cordiality. 

This Society in its travels about the 
State, has visited nearly all of the prin¬ 


cipal cities and towns. We have been to far-off Pensacola; we have been down to beautiful Tampa; we have enjoyed the hospitality of the young and lusty Miami by the Bay of Biscayne; we have dreamed in the historic old St. Augustine, and en¬ 
joyed its hospitality, we have enjoyed our visit to Ocala and Ormond and to many other places and at all of these towns and cities we have listened to glowing words of welcome by their distinguished sons, 
and the Mayors of those proud munici¬ 
palities. Our best efforts have been called in play to reply to these words of wel¬ 
come and show our appreciation of the hospitality extended to us everywhere we have gone. On none of these occasions have the words of welcome spoken, been sweeter to us, or more fittingly expressed than at this hour. Your eloquent Mayor is famous throughout the State for his witticisms, his profundity and his elo¬ 
quence. The President of your Board of 
Trade has in his analytical and business¬ 
like way nobly presented the sentiments of the business element of this fair city who have greeted us to-night. 

A few years ago we accepted your hos¬ 
pitality and before the meeting time the fiery demon ran riot through your fair city. The Fire-King added to his trophies the destruction of beautiful Jacksonville. 
He added your fire to the history of cele¬ 
brated fires, those of Moscow, Boston and 
Chicago. In your hour of fallen splendor and buried glory we accepted the hurried invitation of your sister City, St. Augus¬ 
tine. We came as close to Jacksonville as we could well come and be entertained. 
As soon as your recovery permitted, we again accepted your cordial invitation to hold our meeting in your midst. We came—and behold! a new city had arisen. 
The spires of your churches and school

A 


houses again pointed heavenward. Mam¬ 
moth business blocks had arisen, adding to your commercial prosperity and your noble river was crowded with the com¬ 
merce of the State, bound for the nations of the earth. Your magnificent railway systems were taxed to their fullest capacity in carrying to and from your busy marts the commerce that was to glad¬ 
den you and build up the entire state. V/e enjoyed on that occasion, and on every other when we accepted your hospitality, 
sessions of the greatest success, marking the greatest prosperity in the history of our Society. Your sons and daughters entertained us with excursions, with music, with receptions, with everything that became them and was worthy of the 
City they represent. We are again your guests. We see all around us new evidences of that prosperity which not only at this time characterizes Jackson¬ 
ville, but the whole State of Florida and the entire South. 

Mr. President: In viewing the pros¬ 
perity of this country at large we are prone to forget its real importance. We are likely to overlook the main things that are bringing to pass this commercial and business prosperity. To-day there are two great industrial enterprises on foot that shall stamp their impress upon this country, that shall give it new impetus. 1 
ref ere to the great Panama enterprise and the extension of the East Coast system of railroad to the distant island of Key 
AVest. Of the latter I wish especially to speak and in speaking of it I feel that 
I represent not only the people of the 
South and the people of the State of 
Florida, but in a special way, the business of the Florida State Horticultural Socie¬ 
ty. It has been well said that, ‘‘The his¬ 
tory of a country is the biography of her 


great men.’’ In dealing with this im¬ 
mense business enterprise the extension of railroad facilities to the Island of Key 
West, we must necessarily consider the part played in it by the Friend and Patron in the development of what was but a few years ago the wilderness known as the 
East Coast of Florida. That wilderness became the object of attention of one of the great Captains of Industry of the twentieth century. In it he beheld vast possibilities. Actively and indomitably he pushed forward step by step south¬ 
ward until the shores of the Indian 
River were reached. Onward, still on¬ 
ward, until beautiful Lake Worth was bound to Jacksonville by ribs of steel. 
Here a pause was made until the beauties of the Bay of Biscayne were brought to light by this indomitable developer. Then he pushed forward into the country of the 
Seminoles, the country of the everglades the faraway tropics of the State. Every¬ 
where palaces of beauty arose. The vari¬ 
ous industries of the sections touched were developed. Splendid facilities for trade and commerce were afforded and the East 
Coast became the Shibboleth of the Home- 
seeker, the Tourist for pleasure and those in search of health. And to-day the stu¬ 
pendous announcement is made that this 
Captain of Industry is determined to link the isolated Key West with the balance of tlie state and of the nation. At what cost of energy and of capital I dare scarcely guess. That it is one of the most stu¬ 
pendous enterprises of modern times is admitted by all, and yet the Wizard of the East Coast, with vision sharpened by experience and with the courage of the man of affairs, and above all with the love for his State which has strengthened with the passing years, is eager to under¬ 
take this great enterprise. A glance at the 


2

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


map of the State will show the splendid geographical situation of Key West as entrepot of the commerce of the West In¬ 
dies, of South and Central America, and the far-off Pacific Coast via the Panama 
Canal. It requires no prophet to foresee the prosperity and the development that will follow the completion of this enter¬ 
prise, and that it will be completed, and within the lifetime of its great originator 
I have no doubt. Where has that brain expended itself for the betterment of a locality, for the accomplishment of a great purpose—and ever failed ? On that progressive escutcheon only the word 
^‘SUCCESS” is engraved. In that great heart only sentiments of generosity find a lodgment. That ample purse is always open for the development of new enter¬ 
prises and the addition of new resources to the commerce and industries and en¬ 
lightenment of the age. 

Mr. Chairman: I know not what the generous people of Jacksomdlle have pro¬ 
vided in the way of entertainment-for this society, but if the experience of the past is tO' be the prophecy of the future that entertainment will be ample, delightful and worthy of the guests and of the hosts. 
On behalf of the Society I extend to the 


people of Jacksonville a cordial invita¬ 
tion to attend our sessions, to partake with us in the deliberations that shall come be¬ 
fore our Society. We are here, not alone for entertainment, and pleasure, but for work. In the every-day experiences of the Horticulturist there are problems to solve, questions to answer, that call for the wisdom of all of our members and in the solution of these problems will be found the key to our success. It will afford us extreme pleasure to see as many of the ladies and gentlemen of Jackson¬ 
ville present at our meetings as can con¬ 
veniently attend. 

Mr. President, in conclusion I desire to thank most cordially the people of Jack¬ 
sonville through their distinguished 
Mayor, and the business interests of Jack¬ 
sonville, through the President of the 
Board of Trade, for the cordial welcome they have g'iven us; the words of cheer they have spoken, the high and noble pur¬ 
poses to which they have called us, and when the Session of 1905 shall have pass¬ 
ed into history, we trust that the work done in this meeting, its joys and its pleas¬ 
ures will endure as a memento of the Pres¬ 
ent and a prophecy of the Future.

BY G. L. TABER. 


Members of the Florida State Horticul¬ 
tural Society; Ladies and Gentleme^i: 

The message that I bring you to-day is of the woods. It is written in the midst of what is, to me, a most interesting thicket, covering an area of some thirty acres, which for seventeen years has been protected from fire. The particular trees under which my impromptu seat is placed are Liquidambars; seventy-five to ninety feet tall and from eighteen to twenty-four inches in diameter. The four trees that remain of this older generation are the survivors of many protracted and unequal battles. At the ground, their still open wounds bear mute evidence of the ter¬ 
rible onslaught of fire that destroyed their comrades. Higher up, their trunks are covered, for the distance a boy can 
.reach, with healed-over scars, where youngsters of twenty years ago had made incisions for' the liquid amber to collect and harden into the prized chewing, or sweetgum—from which the common name of the tree is derived. 

Everywhere, individually and in clus¬ 
ters, throughout the basic pines of the thirty acre thicket, is a younger progeny of lusty trees of many species. As is fit¬ 
ting the giant Liquidambars, the largest deciduous tree in this .particular thicket, 
are rearing up a younger brood and their light green, starry, maple-shaped foliage, 
as it glints in the sunshine against the darker background of the pines, presents an effect no less pleasing than that of the 


tops of the giant parents as outlined against the sky. 

Less than fifty feet from the large 
Liquidambars, stands another gum but of a different genus—^the so-called black or sour gum, Nyssa sylvatica. This is also a stately tree but of a very different habit of growth from the Liquidambars; for while the former send out their branches at an oblique angle and are inclined to climb skyward, the latter sends out branches more nearly at a right angle, 
and often clustered, in such a wav as to offer the fantastic suggestion that one might cut from the trunk a succession of naturally grown wagon hubs in which the spokes are already set. 

A few feet farther on stands an Ameri¬ 
can Holly, the shiny broad-leaved, spiny- 
toothed Hex opaca. At all seasons of the year, this is a most beautiful tree but par¬ 
ticularly striking during the winter months when its smooth, light colored bark, bright green foliage and abundance of scarlet berries accentuate the fact that the most rigorous winters we ever get in the Southland possess no terrors for it. 
In speaking of hollies, this is the species that we naturally associate with the name, 
and yet it is much less frequently seen than other species of Ilex—many of which we pass by with but little thought other than that they are graceful shrubs or trees as the case mav be. In this thick- 
et, there are at least six different species of Ilex, as follows: Ilex opaca. as above

described. Ilex dalioon with oblong, 
pointed, smooth foliage, and which also bears an abundance of yellowish red berries. Ilex verticillata, with smooth but darker colored bark, foliage somewhat serrate, and, as its name indicates, of slen¬ 
der, upright growth. Ilex cassine, found in abundance in this section, around the edges of shallow ponds or bay heads; rang¬ 
ing in height from three to twenty feet, 
and, during the winter, covered with ber¬ 
ries of a color varying from scarlet to red¬ 
dish-yellow. This is the very small-leav¬ 
ed species sometimes called ‘‘Yaupon” 
and ‘Tlex vormitoria.” Its leaves are supposed to have a medicinal quality as in¬ 
dicated by the latter not particularly at¬ 
tractive name—or at least attractive, in its significance, only to one who might be possessed of a feeling that his stomach was overloaded. Equally in evidence, 
handsome shrubs when growing in clumps in congenial situations, are Ilex lucida and Ilex glabra. Some of you may think that nothing possessing the com¬ 
mon name of gall-berry should be men¬ 
tioned among desirable plants; and yet varieties which carry this distasteful name and that come under the above named species are, with their lustrous dark, ever¬ 
green foliage and shining black persistent berries, more attractive as a part of Na¬ 
ture’s handiwork than some of the less thirfty exotics—even if possessed of more euphonious names—with which the average horticultural gardener might be inclined to supplant them. 

In further reference to names, I would say that it is not the purpose of this ad¬ 
dress to pick a bone with the champion ol either botanical or common names; nor to air any slight amount of knowledge the writer may possess. Common names may be however, in some cases, very inade¬ 


quate. For instance, Small gives “Win- 
terberry” as the vernacular for three dif¬ 
ferent species of Ilex; the smallest of which. Ilex glabra, reaches a maximum height of about five feet and the largest. 
Ilex verticillata, a maximum height of about twenty feet. We therefore see that in gathering “Winterberries” we may either go to the woods empty handed, or carry along a twenty-foot ladder, accord¬ 
ing to our own interpretation of the name. 
On the other hand, gall-berry is not men¬ 
tioned, as a common name, in any botani¬ 
cal description I can find although it is a name commonly enough applied to several species of Ilex, including Ilex glabra and Ilex lucida. If we could forever disassociate the name of gall-ber¬ 
ry from the handsomer varieties of some of these species of Ilex it would be equally desirable with that of striking the com¬ 
mon, deprecatory name of stinking cedar from the beautiful Torreya taxifdlia of the Apalachicola River, or the inappropri¬ 
ate and entirely unauthoritative name of 
Judas tree from the handsome Cercis canadensis, or Red Bud. 

In speaking of shrubs, we must not. 
overlook the cornus or dogwood which, 
in its several varieties, is one of the first harbingers of spring. Its numerously clustered small flowers—which present the appearance of one large one—put in their appearance in advance of the foli¬ 
age ; as do also those of the handsome pink azalea or wild honeysuckle, the bo¬ 
tanical name of which is Rhododendron nudiflorum. Dogwood and pink azaleas are very much in evidence in this par¬ 
ticular thicket and it might be said that the pink azaleas were establishing sub¬ 
thickets of their own. 

But if the handsome pink azaleas are colonizing, our beautiful native yellow

jessamine, Gelsimium sempervirens, has already colonized; for, running into the fringe of the woodland, it has blanketed the smaller trees without respect to genera or species, and farther on, finding a com¬ 
paratively open glade, has covered it as with a carpet; although a carpet, it must be confessed, that is badly frayed at the edges and that displays a surprising ten¬ 
dency to climb up anything that would an¬ 
swer for chair or table legs. 

Equally at home with the yellow jessa¬ 
mine are the cat briars or sweet briars, 
one of which, Smilax Walteri, produces an abundance of coral red berries which, in winter, as they hang from the then in¬ 
conspicuous, leafless vines, give to the trees over which they run, the peculiar effect of having formed a trust and settled amongst their respective genera and species, upon one particular fruit that they will bear. The smilax, of which there are many species, together with wild grapes of the muscadine type, contest with each other and with the yellow jessamine for the honor of most quickly covering up de¬ 
caying or decayed matter as well as the heig'ht to which they will climb on any natural growth of trellis-like formation. 

I see I have wandered from large trees down to shrubs and vines. Let us return in the same way and, in passing, consider the haws. Of these, the botanists list no less than forty-seven species found grow¬ 
ing wild in this state, many of which are decidedly worth cultivating, either as in¬ 
dividual specimens or for hedges. In my thicket, I have at least three species, all handsome in flower and leaf. They be¬ 
long to the genus crataegus. It is one of the same family as pyrus—to which ap¬ 
ples and pears belong. 

Wild huckleberries, or vacciniums, are also very much in evidence and one 


species of these which assumes large, 
shrub-like proportions—often reaching a height of twelve feet—is very beautiful. 
This is particularly true when in early spring its delicate pink and white blos¬ 
soms, on slender branchlets, are putting in their appearance in advance of the foli¬ 
age. 

The bare mention of early spring brings us back to two different species oi prunus. One Prunus angustifolia, our common wild Chickasaw plum, with its abundance of snowv white blossoms; the other, Prunus serotina, our common wild cherry, with its smooth, dark glossy bark and beautiful, shining dark green leaves. 
Both of these are amongst the earliest trees to notify us that spring is at hand— 
the wild plum with its blossoms, the wild cherry with its foliage. 

Almost, in the same breath, as far as season of growth is concerned, we notice flames of scarlet, both isolated and in clusters throughout our woodland. 
These are the tiny young leaves and blos¬ 
soms of the scarlet maple, Acer rubrum, 
which furnishes a wealth of color during its season of initial spring growth; con¬ 
tinues it during the ripening of its keys, or samaras, and grandly accentuates it again later in the season when it begins to think of disrobing for its winter nap. ^ 

Although the sweet gum does not have the gorgeous spring coloring of the scar¬ 
let maple, it vies with it in the fall and both are surpassed, if such a thing is pos¬ 
sible, by the black or sour gum. One writer has said that if the leaves of sweet gum and scarlet maple are fiery in their fall redness those of black gum are a con¬ 
flagration. Of this, I have abundant proof for standing by itself just outside this thicket, and in plain sight of my office window, a magnificent black gum has, for 


22

many successive years, impressed all be¬ 
holders with the magnificence and per¬ 
sistence of its autumn color. 

And here I wish to insert a word as to character of growth—^and this applies not only to the Nyssas, or gums, but to many other genera—which is that one must bear in mind very closely the environment when he is tr3dng to identify a tree for his own satisfaction or to describe it to the satisfaction of others. The particular black gum just referred to has, for in¬ 
stance, a wide, spreading, well-rounded top with branches that would sweep the ground if, unfortunately, these lower branches did not have to be trimmed, an¬ 
nually, to keep open the road that runs be¬ 
neath it. The gums in the river swamp close at hand send up a sturdy bole for many feet before signs of the first decay¬ 
ing or decayed branches give intimation that the foliage, necessary to the tree’s life, 
has had to climb higher and still higher after air and sunshine. The crowding of many trees into a space where but one can fulfill its allotment of years offers an in¬ 
teresting study in the survival of the fit¬ 
test, as well as the scope allowed by Na^ 
ture in the form of growth the surviving species may assume in the struggle. 

If through dimness of vision, or ex- 
tr^ie height of our supposed black gum, 
we are unable to differentiate the foliage from that of the neighboring species, that interlace it, let us use the convenient hatchet we have brought along and cut out a small section of root. This, in the deep mold where alone our tree would have grown tall enough to require such proce¬ 
dure, will not materially injure it and, if we have been correct in our guess, we can take home a section of root so light and corky in character as to be a handy substi¬ 
tute for the bottle stoppers of commerce— 


which are made from the bark of a par¬ 
ticular species of oak. If, on the other hand, we should happen to run across a black gum in the open, its branches will be so close to the ground that no hatchet or root will be necessary to identify it; but, 
if our quest has been made in the fall, we may then carry home a few quarts of the bluish-black, cherry-like drupe, that is its fruit, and make it into a most excellent jelly. 

But I have strayed from my thicket into the clearing on the one side and into the river swamp on the other. Let us re¬ 
turn and for a few minutes examine the genus to which so many complimen¬ 
tary adjectives have been applied,— 
grand, sturdy, time-defying—Quercus, 
the oaks. They are here In abundance and, like the Liquidambars, preempting ground in the most lavish way. The outlines of their respective staked claims are but dimly marked ; and here again it will be a case of ‘‘might is right” unless some friendly hand decides in favor of one over the other. 

Which shall it be; shall we interfere or let them rustle for themselves? And again, if we do interfere, shall we do so without respect to families? Shall we tell Quercus aquatica that he is, and should recognize that he is, a water oak, 
and that it is both indecorous and ungaT- 
lant to flaunt his flaming spring habili¬ 
ments in the face of his more sedate and more permanently clothed relative, the live oak, Quercus virens, from Virginia? 
If we do tell him anything of this sort, let us do it in a kindly way and impress upon him that if he will take time to think it over, he will at least look cooler. 

However, perhaps it is best to say noth¬ 
ing but just lie low and await develop¬ 
ments. Our water oak will undoubtedly

show a hectic flush again in the fall but this may be one of either shame or choler at having to disrobe for the winter. At all events, his choler, if choler it is, will be surpassed by both the sweet gum and the scarlet maple, and all three of them out¬ 
classed in this respect by the black gum. 
But as even the dwarf, illy-developed sumach seems to vie with its o’ertopping neighbors in this direction, we will as¬ 
sume that they have all merely eaten and drunk to repletion and that the plethora of .fullness, as sometimes observed in their two-legged neighbors, shows in their faces. 

In this connection, I would say that the formerly accepted theory that highly colored autumn foliage is due to the action of frosts, has of late been widely disputed. Careful investigation seems to show that richness of tint in fall foliage is dependent, to quite a considerable extent at least, on the character of the preceding summer. If the summer and fall have been very dry, only low tints will be shown in the foliage. If wet, high tints will de¬ 
velop. 

Still, I know one man, at least, who will dispute the latter theory; the editor of a paper very properly called ‘‘Above the 
Clouds,’^ printed on top of Mount Wash¬ 
ington, New Hampshire. I had the good fortune to spend an evening with this editor, last summer, in his rocky eyrie, 
and he told me that the fall foliage was much more resplendent as seen from the top of the mountain than when viewed from the valley. As his point of vision was from an altitude of considerably over a mile above sea level, and he was there¬ 
fore above the trees, as well as, often, 
above the clouds, he was necessarily look¬ 
ing down into the tops of the trees instead of looking up into them like ordinary 


mortals. It may be that this inverted angle of vision may have a bearing on the subject. I did not think to ask his views on this point. At any rate, he would have seen more of the upper, and more highly colored, side of the foliage than the most of us, and with less intervening shadow to dim its splendor. 

But to go back to our thicket and our oaks. Here are not only water oaks and live oaks but the post oak, Quercus minor, 
with its beautiful large five-lobed leaf, and several other species besides, all of which show more difference in individual speci¬ 
mens than a casual observer would give them credit for. And indeed it is an in¬ 
teresting study to pick out varieties of these or in fact, any species of trees and note the latitude of form that Nature gives to her offspring. We must remem¬ 
ber that botany stops, for the most part, 
with species and that beyond these are in¬ 
dividual characteristics as varied in dif¬ 
ferent species of our forest trees as are those in any species of frift trees like the orange and peach. If these forest species produced edible, merchantable fruit, there would be the same necessity for varietiz- 
ing them as there is with the kinds we cul¬ 
tivate in groves and orchards; but as they do not, we simply pass them by with the general remark that such a tree is a live oak, the next a maple, and so on, without ever really becoming acquainted with tiie varietal characteristics of any particular individual of a species. 

Here, for instance, is a young sweet gum with comparatively smooth, light colored bark resembling a maple, and with foliage too that, at a little distance, might easily be confounded with that of the maple. The lighter tint of green of the sweet gum’s foliage might, however, 
strike us at once and lead us to identify 


24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


it as a sweet gum. A little farther on, 
we come to another tree, -the trunk of which is covered with peculiar, ridged, 
corky bark and the smaller limbs and twigs possessed of fantastically winged appendages—the bark apparently fasten¬ 
ed on edgewise—and we immediately know it for a sweet gum. 

Take also Ilex opaca, the spiny toothed one known as American holly, and close examination will show well accentuated varietal characteristics in individual speci¬ 
mens, some trees possessing much broad¬ 
er leaves than others and the leaves hav¬ 
ing much longer spines. I have mentioned this particular species not that it is distinct from others in the number of its varietal changes but that the species itself is so distinct as to be, we think, unmistakable. 
We had best handle this word unmistak¬ 
able with gloves, however, for its too free and careless use has, before now, gotten many a man into trouble. Indeed it is strange how lacking in astuteness some ot us can be at #nes—^or at least I know I 
can—and following is a case in point: 

There is a half acre of comparatively open ground in this thicket where tree growth is much more sparse than any¬ 
where else, and I have wondered, a dozen times, why it did not grow up as fast as the rest. But one day, all of a sudden, it flashed over me that, a few years ago, the man with the mowing machine had been there, appropriating bedding for the mules. Any succulent new tree growth that was mingled with the neavy crop of wire grass was not sufficient to make it¬ 
self apparent or to interfere with the mower, and the mowing machine and horse rake had denuded this particu¬ 
lar half-acre of several successive years’ accumulation, which would have, 
by this time, turned into a heavy mold and 


been recognized as a ready seed bed by the thousands of seeds that wait on proper conditions to develop. 

Just now, I am as interested as a boy, 
watching development on that particular half acre. What particular species will first assert itself? The black gums and sweet gums are pushing in from either side. The pink azaleas have thrown out skirmishers. A few scattering pines are holding up their unlighted candles as if awaiting instructions to proceed; and the scarlet maple, which holds its growing tips aflame all summer, in readiness for its fall conflagration, is apparently proclaim¬ 
ing “Come on, there is good footing here, 
I will lead the way.” 

I have not mentioned all the species to be found in my thicket and those named are not necessarily the same as would be produced in other portions of the state. 
Nature does not make exact reproduc¬ 
tions of herself over any large given area. 
Latitude, longitude, altitude, isothermal lines, soil formations, proximity to bodies of water, large or small, fresh or salt, run¬ 
ning or stagnant; all of these things have a bearing on what we may expect. The point however is that we may not only expect, but look forward with absolute certainty to a reforestation of our denud¬ 
ed lands if we will but keep fire out; and not only to reforestation of the land but enrichment of the soil; for Nature’s forc¬ 
es work continually toward conserving and building up, instead of dissipating, 
whenever they are allowed to do so. 

This is one application of my thicket story but by no means the only one; and to more fully illustrate the next one, I 
should like to take you with me, if we had time, just over the fence, across the road and into the borders of the fast run¬ 
ning creek that during the rainy season 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


25 


rises to its full river dignity. By follow¬ 
ing the crooks and turns of this creek and up a confluent that runs out of the ham¬ 
mock a few miles away, we should see the most of the species that we left, in the thicket and many more besides; innumer¬ 
ably more than the upland pines and low¬ 
land cypress which the traveler over our public highways gives us credit for. Here we should find chestnut oaks, with most magnificent, broad, and as their name in¬ 
dicates, chestnut-like foliage;" ash of several different species; the magnolia family including both grandiflora and the several varieties of bays; horn-beam or iron wood; poplar, myrtle, laurel, birch, 
alder, virburnum:, farkleberry or sparkle- 
berry, elm, several species of gums, includ¬ 
ing the so-called ogeche lime; red cedar, 
cabbage palmetto, and other species of trees, shrubs and plants, which in wealth of numbers or beauty of individuality might easily divert us from our search for those named. 

And herein lies the broader applica¬ 
tion of my thicket: Notwithstanding its attractions I did not keep myself within its confines, anymore than you will or can keep yourselves within the confines of a similar one, after you have become really interested in it. Once one becomes inter¬ 
ested in studying the various tree and plant growths, in all their wonderful varietal characteristics, he will not be con¬ 
tent with any stipulated boundaries, but will wander, as I have, over the fence, into the river swamp and nearby hammock. 
The more he investigates the more he will wonder why he himself, or his native town or village, has not drawn more free¬ 
ly on home-grown plants for the purposes of shade and embellishment—plants that are growing at his very door and a hundred times better adapted and more 


satisfactory than many of the high-priced exotics. 

Once having become really interested in the magnificent growths about us, the larger applications follow in rapid, 
natural sequence. We will transplant specimens that show natural advantages for the purpose wanted to our own home grounds. We will commence lining the streets that lead by our homes with other equally fine specimens. A little effort will induce others to become interested with us and our home village will have its streets lined with trees, and a village improve¬ 
ment association whose first thought will be for their welfare. The trees thus planted will themselves exert a salutary and benign influence, which will show it¬ 
self in many ways. Tin cans and other extraneous, undesirable village adorn¬ 
ments will be relegated to less conspicuous places than formerly and even the profes¬ 
sional village loafer with his perennial jack-knife and dry goods box, will be brought into line with those who have a higher conception of life’s duties—or pleasures. 

Civic pride is not hard to enlist and par¬ 
ticularly when that pride reaches out in a direction that is of equal benefit to all; 
but one must first become enthused him¬ 
self before he starts to enthuse others. 
This is a rule that applies to progress in any direction. And I speak from actual experience when I say that if in our re¬ 
spective localities, we demonstrate our tree-planting enthusiasm on our own grounds, we will not find it hard to in¬ 
terest others in the same direction. In our own little village, a few of us got to¬ 
gether this year and planted out over 400 
shade trees. I say few of us because the town itself is small. Not a single man but became immediately interested or soon fell 


26 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


• r 


into line. The trees we used were water oaks, live oaks, maples, sweet gums and wild cherry—all growing wild in this im¬ 
mediate neighborhood. Each street planted was set solid to one or the other of these species. Later on, other streets will be opened up and either set out with these or other species—plenty of which yet remain to be drawn on. In other sec¬ 
tions of the state, other species than those we have used might be preferable. We have them—^all of us^—in our respective localities. If we are interested we will find out what they are and, in finding out surprise ourselves with the quantity and suitableness of the material at hand. 

When we have come into contact with 
Nature’s plants and shrubs and vines in all their lavishness of form and color, and her native trees in all their stateliness and grandeur, and have become not merely superficially acquainted but have, so to speak, established friendly relations with them, as individuals—instead of meeting them as a collection of perfunctorily-in¬ 
troduced and soon-forgotten strangers—^ 
we shall experience a sense of loss in not sooner having come into direct fellowship with them; in not having earlier accepted their proffered, standing invitation of companionship. 

Some years ago, I had the good for¬ 
tune to drive through one of the most ma¬ 
jestic avenues of live oaks in this coun¬ 
try—situated at Audubon Park, New Or¬ 
leans. The remembrance of their gran¬ 
deur led me, a short time since, to obtain authentic information in relation to these 


Oaks. I find that there are one hundred of them in the park and that they are now approximately sixty feet high and have an approximate spread of one hundred feet, 
with a trunk diameter of four feet or over. 
These trees were planted in 1813 by Judge 
Gayerre and his grandfather, Etienne de 
Bore. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know anything more about Judge 
Gayerre and Etienne de Bore than the in¬ 
formation I have conveyed to you. They may have done other deeds for which they should be remembered but I submit to you that for this one deed they deserved, and in its accomplishment unwittingly erected to themselves, monuments, not one but a hundred of them, that will keep their memories green and their names revered, 
long after worthy expressions of their vir¬ 
tues in- costly stone or marble would have been forgotten. 

And so, to summarize, I would sav to you, get acquainted with the trees. In doing so, you will derive pleasure and benefit. Protect them from fire; in pro¬ 
tecting them, you will serve your own interests, together with those of the state. 
Plant them around your houses and along your highways; throughout the streets of your respective towns and villages. Erom a purely investment basis it will pay you in enhanced value of property. From the point of personal comfort, they will soon repay you in shade, beauty and compan¬ 
ionship. From a higher, beneficent, 
philanthropic standpoint, you will leave an inheritance for which future gene¬ 
rations will bless you. 


Reminiscent Remarks 


By Major George R, Fairbanks* 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I thought it might be of interest to some of you to hear a few reminiscences of one of the oldest citizens of Florida. I came to Florida in 1842. At that time there was no settlement on the east coast south of Palatka or south of Micanopy in the central portion of the State. The travel in those days was by stage coach from St. 
Augustine through Middle Florida to 
Pensacola. The stage coach ride to Tal¬ 
lahassee in those days was long and tedi¬ 
ous, and only accomplished by relays, and the best time that could be made was about thirty miles a day, quite a difference in the palatial travel now at thirty miles per hour as a maximum. I remember the first time I ever saw the city of Jackson¬ 
ville, it was a very small place, with four or five docks on the river front. The mail was brought by boat from St. Augustine by way of Picolata or brought over to St. 
Augustine on horseback, twice a week, 
and the arrival of the boat was the signal for every man in town to go down to the docks and get the news. 

Tampa was in those days a mere fishing village, and Tallahassee a small town. 
The principal industry in other than what is known as Middle Florida was the get¬ 


ting out of timber; in Middle Florida the chief crop was cotton. Commerce was carried on by schooner lines to and from 
New York in the east and New Orleans in the west. In those days the entire popula¬ 
tion of the State did not much exceed the population now claimed for the city of 
Jacksonville. This remarkable develop¬ 
ment of the State within the life-history of one of her citizens is a very impressive matter to reflect upon, and I doubt not but that some young citizen now within my hearing will find the same degree of de¬ 
velopment shall he live in the State as long as I have, for in my judgment we are to have one of the greatest and most densely populated States in the Union.. The questior^has often been asked, why is it that the State of Florida has developed with such rapidity, especially the city of 
Jacksonville, with no extensive back coun¬ 
try to support it. This question is easily answered. If you will take your globe or atlas and look the world over, ascertain the peninsulas, you find without ex¬ 
ception that the peninsulas contain the most dense populations on the earth, this you will find to be true without exception, 
take the peninsula of Italy as a notable ex¬ 
ample, and all other peninsulas. The 
State of Florida you will find is a very narrow peninsula compared to a great many of them, and it is my prediction that within the life of many of my hear- 



28

ers they will find Jacksonville grown to be a very large city and the State of Flori¬ 
da to be the most densely populated State in the Union. I say this because we have 


everything here necessary to sustain a large and dense population, besides the 
State has now come to be known as the world’s sanitarium. 


By George W. Wilson. 


After listening to the eloquent address¬ 
es that have been delivered you this even¬ 
ing, I feel unable to add thereto. I hope however to always be able to respond to anything that will be of interest to the 
Florida State Horticultural Society. I 
congratulate the society upon the large at¬ 
tendance at the opening of this it’s eigh¬ 
teenth annual session. I am not only in sympathy with the great work of this so¬ 
ciety, but I was once an ardent horticul¬ 
turist myself, until varying vicissitudes of life cast my lot in another direction, 
that of journalism, during all of which time I have never failed to take advantage of every opportunity to foster and en¬ 
courage your every welfare. I consider the history of the development of this 


State largely the history of the horticul¬ 
turist; that it is largely due to the en¬ 
deavor and achievement of the Horticul¬ 
tural Society that has given the great 
State of Florida the renown she to-day enjoys, and as it has justly been said, in your future endeavor and achievement rests in a great degree the name and fame of our State. When I speak in these terms I speak with a great deal of signifi¬ 
cance, for I am informed that nearly 85 
per cent of the horticulturists are college men, you are therefore prepared by ex¬ 
perience, education, and training to cope with the greatest interests for the welfare of the State unhampered by political affiliations or hurtful partisan motives. 



Report of Committee on Diseases of Citrus, 


By P. H. Rolfs. 


Wither Tip. 

This disease, which manifests itself in so many different ways on citrus fruits, 
continued to be exceedingly virulent dur¬ 
ing the past year. The total amount of damage done by this disease was, un¬ 
doubtedly, greater during the last season than any season heretofore. 

Work upon it has been prosecuted quite vigorously during the past year, and some new and interesting facts have been brought out. Considerable difficulty is encountered from time to time because this trouble is frequently complicated with other disturbances. Any condition of the orchard or of the fruit that low¬ 
ers the vitality renders it more sus¬ 
ceptible to attack 'from this fungus 
(Colletotrichum gloeosporoides), so that many trees and much fruit is found infect¬ 
ed. Though this disease must be con¬ 
sidered a secondary difficulty, in many cases, the primary difficulty would not have been sufficient to cause the destruc¬ 
tion of the plant or fruit. 

Late Rust. 

It is a well-known fact that the rust mite causes very considerable russeting of fruit. This may occur either during the early portion of the mid-season, or when the fruit has nearly matured. As a rule, 
when the fruit has passed mid-season there is very little danger of russeting. 
This year, however, many orchards have russeted severely after the fruit had reach¬ 
ed its full size, and in many cases after 


the fruit had begun to color. Vigorous spraying with the usual remedies for pre¬ 
venting russeting proved of no avail. 
This occurred on account of the presence of the wither tip fungus, which produced a form of russeting that in general ap¬ 
pearance resembles the rust mite russeting to a considerable extent, and in many cases is mistaken for it. 

This form of russeting can, however, be readily detected by rubbing the hand over the fruit. When it is due to the rust mite the fruit feels smooth, while when it is due to the wither tip fungus the surface will usually be rough, something like rub¬ 
bing the hand over sandpaper. Not in¬ 
frequently the two forms of-disease occur on the same fruit. 

Tear Stains. 

This peculiar form of russeting mani¬ 
fests itself by streaks running over the fruit from the side that hangs uppermost to the point which is nearest the ground. 

The cause of this peculiar form of rus¬ 
seting is that somewhere above the fruit a twig occurs which has been infested by the fungus, and which contains the hold-over spores. Whenever sufficient rain or dew occurs to cause a dripping from this disease infected twig onto the fruit, the disseminating spores are liberated from the twig and carried with the rain or dew over the epidermis of the fruit. Many of the spores are left along in different places and these produce sufficient irrita¬ 
tion to the epidermis to cause russeting

along in streaks, hence we have the peculiar form of tear staining or tear streaks. 

All of the fruits of the citrus family are more or less subject to this trouble. Bit¬ 
ter sweet, sour oranges, sweet seedlings, 
kumquats ^and lemons have been found affected in this way. 

Frequently this peculiar form of in¬ 
fection does not injure the keeping quali¬ 
ties of the fruit. Of course this fruit must go to market as russets, and consequently a very material loss in its selling quality is encountered. 

Kumqnats. 

Heretofore it was thought that kum¬ 
quats were quite free from the destructive attack of this disease, but during the past year many trees were discovered that had lost as high as 40 per cent, of the fruit. 
They were carried off by drops, directly or indirectly induced by this disease. In addition to a.number of drops occasioned by the presence of this fungus, a very con¬ 
siderable number of the fruits themselves were infested with the characteristic spot. 
This has been described a number of times in various publications, and has been il¬ 
lustrated by photographs before the 
Horticultural Society, so it will not be taken up again at this point. 

Remedy. 

All of these investigations, of course, 
have for their aim the determination of some practicable remedy. Different lines of treatment were started immediately upon commencing the investigations. 
The first line that suggested itself was of thoroughly spraying with Bordeaux mix¬ 
ture. This, however, proved to be insuffi¬ 
cient. The most thorough work possible was done upon an orchard of about four¬ 
teen acres in extent, and continued 


throughout the entire year of 1902. At the end of this time the fungus seemed to have as strong a foothold in the orchard as it had in the beginning of the work. 
This seemed to indicate that spraying with Bordeaux mixture was merely suffi¬ 
cient to hold it in check, and not sufficient to reduce the difficulty in the orchard. 
In 1903 the work of cutting out the diseased twigs was begun. During that season this same orchard was submitted to the treatment with Bordeaux mixture, 
and a thorough pruning out of the twigs which had become leafless and had lost their vitality. Before the end of the year this remedy showed itself to be thorojugh- 
ly successful. A more successful treat¬ 
ment could scarcely be expected to be found in any particular line. During the summer of 1904 still further investiga¬ 
tions were made as to the best time for cutting out the diseased twigs by divid¬ 
ing the orchard of some twenty acres in extent, into six different plots. These dif¬ 
ferent plots were subjected to treatment at different seasons of the year. From the experiments here we deduced the follow¬ 
ing facts : That the first time of the year for pruning is during the winter, just be¬ 
fore the spring growth occurs, which is some time before the first of February, 
and a second pruning is usually necessary. 
In the grove under experimentation it was found that the plot No. 4, which was pruned during Jul}^ that the remedy was as successful as where pruning had occurred earlier. In plot No. 6, where the pruning had not occurred until x\ugust, the increase in the amount of the wither tip disease was so severely marked that the point to which the pruning had been carried in July could be seen to the row. 

As a general rule we would say then 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


31 


that the proper line of treatment would be: First prune out all dead wood, or wood of low vitality, during January and then again during July. Second, spray thoroughly with Bordeaux mixture im¬ 
mediately after each pruning. 

This will, in a great measure, reduce the amount of fungus in the grove, and so very materially reduce the danger of infection. 
It may, however, be found necessary in the fall, when the fruit begins to ripen, to protect this against the characteristic 
Anthracnose spot. This has been done repeatedly last year in orchards of vary¬ 
ing size, from a few acres to twelve acres in extent. These characteristic spots do not occur until the fruit has practically matured, then they make their appearance, 
first about the size of a pinhead, from this they gradually enlarge until a consider¬ 
able portion of the fruit is involved. At the first appearance of the spots the fruit should be sprayed thoroughly with an ammoniacal solution of copper carbonate. 
If treatment has been delayed until the fruit has begun to drop off severely, it will take about two or three weeks to notice any perceptible diminution of the drop¬ 
ping. From that time, however, the sprayed trees show from 25 to 75 per cent reduction in the amount of the drops, and also show a similar amount of diminution in the spread of this spotting. 

Foot Rot. 

The past year, for some reason, seems to have been one in which this disease has been making its presence felt in many groves that previously had not been at all troubled by it. Just why this condition should occur is difficult to explain. We know, however, that many people whose groves have heretofore enjoyed freedom from this trouble have this vear found 


themselves in a position to enquire diligently for the best remedies. The remedy for this given by Mr. Waite a year ago is about the best that can be used. 
On page 53, of Report for 1904, Mr. 
Waite gives his formula for making the antiseptic wash, as one part swlphur and two parts of land plaster, or air slacked lime. Then this is made into a thick bat¬ 
ter by addition of water, and then painted on the tree, the soil having been removed from around the crown so as to permit a ready application of the remedy. Other remedies are also successful in keeping down this trouble. The one essential feat¬ 
ure in all remedies is that of removing the soil from around the crown and exposing the diseased area to the sun if possible, or where the limbs shade the trees too much, 
exposing it to the air. In some cases it has been found sufficient to expose the crown of the roots to the air. However, it is better not to take any chance, but to apply some antiseptic treatment, either that suggested by Mr. Waite, or a solu¬ 
tion of one part of crude carbolic acid to two parts of water, then cutting away the diseased patch and applying the antiseptic wash to the area exposed. 

Blight. 

This old disease is still with us, and will probably stay with us as long as citrus gi%wing is carried on in Florida. The studies upon it, and investigations in con¬ 
nection with it have been pushed as rapidly and as extensively as possible. 
The members of the Florticultural Society will realize that an immense amount of work has to be done on the study of this disease, and that observations confined to one section or one grove would scarcely be sufficient. When we remember that blight rarely, or 


32 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


never, occurs on trees under six years of age, and that the possibility of infection occurs at the time of setting the tree out, 
it is readily seen that to prove any particu¬ 
lar theory in regard to the matter will re¬ 
quire years of awiting. I am, however,* 
more hopeful of finding a practicable remedy for this disease than I have been at any time previous to this. Just what the line of treatment may be, and just what precautionary measures must be taken, I am yet unprepared to say. I may, 
however, be permitted to say that the in¬ 
vestigations in progress are indicative of finally securing a favorable and practic¬ 
able remedy. 

Scaly Bark of Orange Trees. 

This disease of the orange tree has been reported quite a number of times in the last three or four years, and specimens have been sent a time or two very recently. 

The name describes the disease fairly well. An attack of this disease causes the bark to peel off and look very shaggy and 


scaly. This, of course, is very unusual for citrus trees, and consequently is noticed at once. When anything of this kind occurs on the young¬ 
er limbs the disease causes round¬ 
ish or oblong brownish blotches, 
varying in size from one-fourth of an inch long to sometimes three or four inches long. Mrs. Flora W. Patterson, 
Mycologist in the Department of Agricul¬ 
ture, has identified the fungus as belong¬ 
ing to the genus Hysterographjum. 

As yet we know no convenient and practicable remedy, consequently where it occurs on the small twigs of the tree the orange grower will find it prudent to cut out the disease and burn it. 

Mention is made of this disease in this place to keep people on the lookout for the trouble, and so cut off its ravages in its incipiency. It very frequently occurs that a most innocent looking species causes a very considerable damage. As yet no serious consequences have fol¬ 
lowed an attack of this disease. 


Report by J* J* Beers* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

My first recollection of the war between man and the insect enemies of the orange was about twenty-five years ago. My father came to Florida from Pennsylvania in June 1878 and set the first tree the fol¬ 
lowing winter and a very short time after that the fight commenced. I recall seeing boxes of Whale Oil Soap in the barn and seeing the wash-boiler full of water and tobacco stems lx)iling on the kitchen stove. 
Don’t you know, friends, that my mother was a good-natured woman to stand that ? 


When the stock solution was ready, a jug full was taken to the grove and, while a boy carried water from a nearby pond or lake, my father added a little of the stock from the jug and on his knees with a scrubbing brush washed the bodies and even the faces and hands of the little trees. 
He soon discovered, however, that the bark on the trees was getting hard and the trees stunted and in casting about for a better method, found a brass syringe, holding about a quart, with fine holes for an out¬ 
let, with which the trees were sprayed.

Next came a little hand spray pump. 
With these pumps half a dozen men sprayed the trees from pails, while a horse hauled barrels of water from some con¬ 
venient lake. What was used for an in¬ 
secticide at this time, I do not know, but I 
remember seeing them churn ‘‘kerosene butter” with these little pumps and it was made of kerosene oil and “Eagle Brand” 
condensed milk. 

All this fighting appeared to do no good and the scale was still there, although 
I am not prepared to say that the spraying was properly done, or done at the proper time, for spraying orange trees was a comparatively new thing at that time. 

In 1884 I was sent away to school and when I returned three years later, I found that father had gotten up the rig which 
I am now using. This is a four-wheeled wagon, with a three barrel tank and a force pump geared to one hind wheel of the wagon. This throws a strong spray and I spray from five to twenty-five acres per day with one hose. 

Our main fight is against the rust mite and we use the sulphur solution, but when we spray regularly for that we have never been troubled with scale, except one of the wax scales which cause “smut” and this is always killed with one application of double strength. 

We start spraying the first of May and spray the first of every month for five months and the result, until last season, 
has been clean, healthy trees and bright fruit. Last spring we had purple mite enough to damage the trees and drop a large part of the fruit, therefore about the first of January of this year, seeing 


the mite starting again, we sprayed once and intended to continue it to keep them in check, but have found it unnecessary. 
The spraying destroyed a large per cent of the mites and this, followed by the cold of January 25th and later by an unusual amount of rain, has almost destroyed the mite. 

One of the finest groves in our section, 
well known as the “Pet Grove,” property of Mr. J. P. Felt, is greatly damaged by what appears to be “foot-rot.” We have many groves here which, like this one, are budded on sweet stock. In this grove a part of the bank was allowed to remain for two or three years, so that the earth close to the tree was six to ten inches above the natural collar even through the sum¬ 
mer and I have no doubt that this was the cause of the “foot-rot.” Mr. Felt is hav¬ 
ing this earth removed now and th’e trees will probably not be banked next winter to give them a chance to heal. 

Grape fruit trees have been damaged some by scab and the fruit made unfit for market. Spraying with Bordeaux Mix¬ 
ture appears to entirely prevent this, as trees badly affected two years ago were sprayed last spring and last season pro¬ 
duced fine fruit and the new growth was free from disease. 

My idea of combating diseases of trees is, first to prevent it if possible; then, if it appears, cure it if you can. Study the re¬ 
quirements of the trees and make the con¬ 
ditions suitable as far as possible and above all give them plenty of food of the very best quality, then watch your trees closely and be ready to meet trouble when it comes.

Report of A. B* Harringfton* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I confine myself to my own locality and citrus trees only. 

There has been nothing new to develop during the last year, therefore shall have to go to our subject in a way that many of us are already familiar with. 

We are beyond the worry of the com¬ 
mon scale, as this is easily kept under by use of fertilizer and an occasional spray¬ 
ing with Hammonds Thrip Juice. This is the best, cheapest, and most convenient to use of anything in my experience for scale. * 

It is usual to have a visit of the Red 
Spider during the Spring months. 
The Rust Mite is nearly ever present. 
For these insects I use the Sulphur spray. I have used the sulphur and Thrip 
Juice mixed and the combination seems to give equal results as when used separate- 
ly- 

The rust mite is the worst of all our troubles, causing more expense and time than all other insects and diseases com¬ 
bined. 

I do not believe it is possible to have ten percent bright fruit without spraying; 
but by being presistent, observing care¬ 
fully the conditions and following it up each year,we have about ninety percent bright fruit. As proof of this, trees, that have never been sprayed, (a few miles distant and all other conditions apparent¬ 
ly similar,) have scarcely any bright fruit, 
so little that no attempt is made to classi¬ 
fy or grade it and it is marketed from the 


trees without grading. These groves that are badly infested with Rust Mite seem to produce fruit one or two sizes smaller than do the groves thoroughly sprayed. • The 
White Fly, I am thankful to say, has not appeared here. 

As to disease, we have none. While we have some insects that cause us trouble, I 
do not think there is as yet a disease' of any description in our locality. 

Die back shows up occasionally but this is a condition rather than a disease, as 
I took upon it. There seemed to be some confusion on this subject of die back last year. My own experience is such that I 
am confident it is not so very easy to overcome. I have read where treatment showed an improvement in a few days and a cure in a few weeks or months. Trees can be helped in a year but I say three years is required for a cure if the case is anything bad. 

My views are to thoroughly under¬ 
stand your soil and fertilizer, as this is where the complete recovery is to start from. Much benefit is obtained by the use of Bordeaux. 

J have not tried the insertion of Blue 
Stone myself but have observed good re¬ 
sults where others have used this method of treatment. An orange tree will exist under the most adverse circumstances yet to grow and produce well, paying a profit each year to the owner, requires care, 
cultivation, and fertilizer. 

I use for applying spray, a good hand power pump, a double line of hose, requir¬ 
ing three men and a pair of mules to run

the outfit. It depends very much on the size of the grove as to what the investment in machinery should be. Begin with a bag of fertilizer and a hoe increasing with the 

number of trees. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, it seems that some legislation is at present pending at Tallahassee on the white fly and insects. 
A copy of the pending bill has been called for but it appears that none of the mem¬ 
bers have it, nor have many of them seen what the measure is. I am not personally interested in the white fly, as it has not yet appeared with us, but I am deeply inter¬ 
ested in behalf of the societ}^ in this pest and believe that if something is not done to stop its ravage the state will be over¬ 
run. However, we should be careful as to what character of measure is enacted. 
We should see that it shall be a measure as will not work a burden or hardship upon the growers. Yet, I conceive it to be essential that some measure be enacted that will control the ravages of the white 

fly- 

Dr. Richardson—I heartily concur in the remarks of Mr. Blackman. The white fly is a most destructive, pernicious pest, 
still we should carefully watch any meas¬ 
ure of legislation that is proposed, and should not endorse here any measure to be enacted unless we know what that measure is. It has been said that the the measure purports to provide that if the grower does not com- 
ply with the law that his proper¬ 
ty shall be taken in charge by the county commissioners and the ex¬ 
pense of dislodging the white fly taxed upon it by the county. This would in my judgment be very unwise and would work a hardship in many instances to a grower 


who was financially unable to protect his property and who was wholly irresponsi¬ 
ble for the introduction of the pest upon his property. It is well known that the white fly infests not only grove trees, but other trees, and shrubbery as well, 
especially hammock growths, and if we are going to legislate we ought first to legislate them out of the swamp before we tax the property of the grower for dis¬ 
lodging it from the grove property. I 
think this matter should go to our legis¬ 
lative committee with power to act in the premises, and with plenty of time to look into remedial measures of legislation. 
This is a very important matter and should receive the very best consideration, 
in all of its phases and in its operation after enactment, before we give it an endorsement upon the floor of this so¬ 
ciety. 

Dr. Kerr—^This is a very important matter touching the interest of every grower in the State. It should in my judgment go to our legislative committee, 
who should be granted plenty of time in the premises, bringing in its report to this society for further consideration.• 

Mr. Gillett—Mr. President, as a mem- 
ber of the legislative committee I agree with the gentlemen who have preceded me on this subject. I think the matter should go to the legislative committee and that it should have plenty of time to act in the premises. I have had some experience in formulating measures for enactment into laws and it requires time to look care^^*' 
into proposed measures of this kind, to calculate the effect of the operation of the law upon its enactment, comparing and weighing similar measures in other States^ 
so as to get the greatest good to the great-, 
est number as far as we can. 

The President—The matter of this 




36 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


preventative measure against the ravages of the white fly will go to the legislative committee with power to act. If any enactment is to be had at the present ses¬ 
sion of the legislature, no doubt the special legislative committee, which has been heretofore appointed at this session, will be of service to the committee in this re¬ 
gard. 

COTTON BUG. 

Dr. Richardson—I have been very much interested in these papers. I desire to call the attention of the society to an insect that I have so far been unable to find in any of our society literature, 
scientific or otherwise. He is a bug and is, I have lately learned, 
known to the • cotton planter as the cotton bug—and if any of you have never met him, I hope you never may. 
In markings and color he is beautiful, 
brown, green, red and gold with a diamond in the center of his back, his shape is some¬ 
thing like a common pumpkin bug but not so large. In numbers and rapacity he is a devastator. His appearance is sudden. I 
first n^et him in alxnit 1892 I think it was, 
with very disastrous results as I lost some 
10,000 or 12,000boxes of oranges through his depredations in the course of a few days’ time. I thought, as he had not ap¬ 
peared again, that I was free from his kind, and had nearly forgotten all about him until last fall, when my manager tele¬ 
phoned me he had found a strange bug on my tangerines. I went over and found the ground, the fruit and trees literally cover¬ 
ed with the bugs so thickly in fact that you could scarcely see the fruit—there were millions of them—^and I lost probably 
40 or 50 boxes of tangerines. Having met him before, I determined upon heroic ef¬ 
forts to get rid of him. After trying 


almost every insecticide known without success, I finally made a carbolinium whale oil soap mixture, rather as an experiment than anything else, knowing the virtue of the carbolinium on account of the percent¬ 
age of carbolic acid it contains. The mix¬ 
ture or emulsion was made of one quart of carbolinium to seven pounds of whale oil soap boiled and stirred into three gallons of water, pouring the same into about fifty gallons of water, making a solution with which I sprayed the fruit and leaves. 
To my agreeable surprise this completely routed and destroyed Mr. Cotton Bug. I 
mention this for what it may be worth. 

Mr. McCarty.—^^The gentleman’s expe¬ 
rience is very interesting and valuable. 
The bug he has described, is what is known as the common cotton stainer. 
They are a very prolific pest, but I think 
Dr. Richardson might modify his numbers to myriads instead of millions. The thanks of the society are due the doctor for his solution, the component parts of which the society will in all probability profit by remembering. 

Dr. Richardson—^Myriads may be all right, but anyone having experience with cotton bugs will agree to millions. Mod¬ 
ern scientists tell us that microbes repro¬ 
duce by binary division at the rate of sixteeen or more millions from a single specimen in twenty-four hours. The cot¬ 
ton bug will in the old-fashioned way of egg and hatching, it almost seems, do pretty nearly as well. I have a neighbor who examined his grove in the morning and found not a bug, but at four o’clock in the afternoon his large seedling trees were covered with them, and by the next day he had lost some four or five thousand boxes. This was Mr. Rogers, of Suther¬ 
land.

Mr. Boggs—The discussion in regard to insects reminds me of an experience 
I had a year or so' agO' with grasshoppers. 
It is well known that the grasshopper or locust in numbers is very voracious and on occasions he will attack a fruit tree as quickly as he will grass. Finding rnyself menaced by grasshoppers in such numbers as to cause some alarm, I wrote to Wash¬ 
ington for a culture which had been ex¬ 
perimented with for the extermination of the hopper. Receiving the same, I 
took an old darkey out with me tO' catch some of the hoppers, dip them and let them go on this way of self-destruction, 
as well as that of their ilk. After this per¬ 
formance was over, and we had dipped 
I suppose some 200 hoppers, I noticed the darkey in deej) meditation. Finally he said tO' me: 

“Boss, is yer after killing dem hop- 
pers ? 

I assured him that was the desired end, 
he then said: 

“Well, boss, why didn’t yer mash dem we kotched instead of dippin em and turn¬ 
in’ ’em loose? (Laughter.) 

I was never annoyed to such great extent after the experiment, and think it was of some benefit. I am informed that the Department at Washington has several cultures and that this was not what is con¬ 
sidered by the department the best. I do' 
not think the experiments, however, have proved entirely satisfactory, though to some degree helpful. I will here also say that the Department of Agriculture is also extensively engaged in the study of insect extermination by fungus. These fungus experiments have proved very satisfactory in a great many instances. While it is not claimed for the fungus process that it is a total eradicator or exterminator, it has proved to be of positive benefit. 


Mr. McCarty—have followed the ex¬ 
perimentation reports of the fungus pro¬ 
cess of extermination of insects for several years with a great deal of interest, and I 
am always glad to hear anything concern¬ 
ing it. It seems to me that it has already proven to be of great assistance, and I 
trust scientific research and experiment will further demonstrate its value as against spraying, which is always ac¬ 
companied with more or less deleterious effects, unless the utmost precaution is ob¬ 
served and followed. I believe there are many instances in which great harm has been done by ill advised spraying, which occurs both ways, sometimes through the strength and character of the solution, 
as well as the age and condition of the tree and fruit at times of application. 

Mr. Hampton—I have been very much interested in these discussions upon insect extermination and especially with refer¬ 
ence to the cotton stainer. I first met the cotton Stainer in 1897 and for the past several years I have seen him occasionally. 
In numbers he is voracious and devastat¬ 
ing, he is a sucker, and usually when you find him you have got to do something so quick that he has gotten through with his business before you get your solution mixed. I have never been able to find anything to kill him, and my previous ef¬ 
forts to get a preparation which would kill him were ineffectual for the reason that not knowing anything myself that would kill him off, I had to write to some one for information, and by the time I could get a reply to my inquiry he had finished up his business and gone. I am sure the society is much indebted to Dr. Richardson for his experiment in this direction and that they will profit by it should this pest show up upon their premises. 

Mr. Hart—I do not think sufficient at-

tention has been paid to blight, I am very much interested in the solution of the question of blight. Being desirous of see¬ 
ing an effective remedy for this tree disease, I offer the following resolutions which I trust the society may see fit to adopt. 

The resolutions were adopted and are as follows: 

Whereas, The orange growers of 
Florida are annually suffering the loss of many thousands of dollars in the reduc¬ 
tion of their fruit crop and still more in the market value of their groves through a disease known as orange tree blight, 
which usually selects the largest and most productive trees for attack; and 

Whereas, Though the desease has been carefully studied for many years by very able Department experts, it is not yer well enough known to allow of its positive identification, in many cases, before the second or third year after its appearance, 
while investigations pretty surely prove that the disease is contagious, which makes each diseased tree a nucleus from which it is carried to others when caring for or working the grove; and 

Whereas, Progress has been made that encourages the belief that if ad¬ 
ditional help with special fitness can be sent here and allowed to devote their whole time to assisting in this select work, 
we have reason to hope that the cause may be found for it; therefore, be it 

Pesolved, That the Secretary of this society be instructed to correspond with the Florida Representatives in Washing¬ 
ton and earnestly request them to call upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon. 
Wilson, and urge upon him the import¬ 
ance of this work and the pressing need that we feel for further assitance from his 
Department. Be it further 


Resolved, That each member of this society exert his or her infiuence as an in¬ 
dividual to secure increased appropriation for this work and its more vigorous prose¬ 
cution. . 

Member—^If I am correctly in¬ 
formed, and I believe I am, the 
Department of Agriculture at Wash¬ 
ington has always been able, ready and willing to lend any assistance within the power of the government to promote the interests of like societies in th^ 
various States, in never-ceasing scien¬ 
tific experiments to exterminate insects and eradicate disease from useful plant life. I think it all comes under the generic head of forestry preservation. However that may be, I know that the National 
Government has always met the various 
States half way in the matter of expense in this direction, that wherever the State will spend a dollar the Government will spend one in intelligent effort to this end, 
it therefore seems to me, Mr. President, 
that we should have the benefit of this 
National aid in this State, in order that the horticulturist of this State may have the benefit of all blight preventatives, the culture spore and fungus processes, scien¬ 
tific spraying as well as all known scien¬ 
tific research to stop the ravages of these diseases and insects of whatever kind. I 
trust that our legislative committee will hold this matter in mind and use their best endeavor to secure for the State her pro¬ 
rata share of this experimental scientific work. 

The President—The remarks of the member are timely^the chair has no doubt the special legislative committee will take the matter in charge and secure for the 
State these considerations. 



A Steam Boiling Plant for Insecticides* 


By H* A* Gossard* 


Where the lime-salt-sulphur wash, bi¬ 
sulphide of lime, resin spray, or any in¬ 
secticide requiring prolonged cooking is needed the most economical method of preparation is by boiling with steam. I 
prepared the accompanying diagram by combining the best features of two or three different Ohio boiling plants. By courtesy of the Ohio Experiment Sta¬ 
tion I give it to the Florida horticultur¬ 
ists before having used it in our own pub¬ 
lications. - 

A is a water tank into which water is raised by wind or steam power. In the plant from which the diagram was taken it is a 1,500 gallon tank of galvanized iron, sitting on the ui>- 
per or haymow floor of the barn, 
and water is pumped into it through the water pipe x by means of a windmill. 
The stopcock b is closed when the tank is full. A is a faucet from which cold water is drawn at will to meet the miscellaneous needs of farm and household. D is the boiler reservoir and, being connected with 
A by means of the water-pipe X is kept filled. In the plant represented, the boiler reservoir was a* galvanized iron cylinder, perhaps eight feet high and one foot in diameter, having a capacity of nearly 50 gallons. It was a discarded gas chamber, having once been part of a gas supply plant. Its bottom end sets just a few inches behind the boiler so that the water is kept moderately warm and can be safety turned into the boiler without ad¬ 
ditional heating. H is the boiler, the pipes 


w leading from it, being steam pipes. The stopcock V opens and closes a pipe leading

When it is desired to fill the boiler with water, the stopcocks v and u are both opened; the steam, passing through u into the top of the reservoir D, forces the water through V into the boiler H, doing away with the need of an injector. The steam in D soon condenses and water is drawn into the reservoir through x to fill the vacuum which would otherwise be pro¬ 
duced. V is a platform upon which sets the hot water tank B and the boiling cask

Report of Committee on Citrus. 


E* E. Hubbard, Chairman. 


Previous reports of this standing Com¬ 
mittee have pretty well threshed out the questions of commercial varieties, prop¬ 
agation, fertilization and culture, but there is still room for improvement in varieties, especially of early oranges, and 
I have thought it well on this occasion to review the work and conclusions of some of the foremost plant propagators of the country, with the view of stimulating ob¬ 
servation, selection and improvement of varieties by every intelligent fruit grower. 
As all know, the U. S. Department of Ag¬ 
riculture is working to develop early, 
hardy, oranges from hybrids and in this connection I will quote from Luther Bur¬ 
bank the foremost living authority on hybrids and crosses: 

“The main object of crossing genera, 
species or varieties is to combine various individual tendencies, thus producing a state of perturbation or partial antagonism bv which these tendencies are, in later generations, dissociated and recombined in new proportions, which gives the breed¬ 


er a wider field for selection; but this opens a much more difficult one—the selection, and fixing of the desired new types from the mass of heterogeneous tendencies produced, for by crossing, bad traits as well as good are always brought forth. The results now secured by the breeder will be in proportion to the ac¬ 
curacy and intensity of selection, and the length of time they are applied. By this means the best of fruits, grains, nuts and flowers are capable of still further im¬ 
provements in ways which to the thought¬ 
less often seem unnecessary, irrelevant or impossible.'' 

“The plant breeder before making com¬ 
binations should with great care select the individual plants which seem best adapted to his purpose, as by this course many years of experiment and much needless expense will be avoided. The difference in the individuals which the plant breeder has to work upon are sometimes extremely slight. The ordinary unpracticed person cannot by any possibility discover the ex-

ceedingly minute variations in form, size color, fragrance, precocity and a thousand other characters which the practiced breeder perceives by a lightning like glance. The work is not easy, requiring an exceedingly keen perception of minute differences, great practice, and extreme care in treating the organisms operated upon, and even with all the naturally acquired variations added to those secured by scientific crossing and numerous other means the careful accumulation of slight individual differences through many generations is imperative after which sev¬ 
eral generations are often but not always necessai*y to thoroughly “fix” the desired type for all practical purposes. 

The above applies to Anuuals. or those plants reproduced by seed. The breeder of plants which can be reproduced by div¬ 
ision has great advantage, for any valuable individual variation can be multiplied to any extent desired without the extreme care necessary in fixing by linear breeding the one which must be reproduced by seed. 
But even in breeding perennials the first deviations from the original form are often unappreciable to the perception, but by accumulating the most minute dif¬ 
ferences through many generations the deviation from the original form is often astounding.” 

“By crossing different species we can form more variations and mutations in half a dozen generations than will be de¬ 
veloped by ordinary variation in a hun¬ 
dred or even a thousand generations. 
The evolution of species is largely depend¬ 
ent on crossing the variations contained within it. Forms too closely bred soon run out, because generally only by cross¬ 
ing does variation appear. 

It is of great advantage to have the parents a certain distance apart in their 


hereditary tendencies. If too close to¬ 
gether, there is not range enough of varie¬ 
ty. If too far apart the developed forms are unfitted for existence because too un¬ 
stable. Radical changes of environment for a series of generations will produce a tendency to sport, but hybridization will bring it about far more abruptly and for practical plant or animal breeding or for scientific study of all these variations, far more satisfactorily.” 

Mr. Burbank asserts there is a close analogy l)etween hybridization and graft¬ 
ing. An instance is cited in which Primus myrobalana Var. Pissardi was imported from France and grafted on the Kelsey plum, a variety of Primus Triflora. The graft did not bloom, but its presence on the tree brought about a cross between tJie two species. Many hundred descendants of this cross are now living. 

These remarks of Mr. Burbank’s on other plants show how slow and difficult will be the process of developing early and hardy oranges from hybrids and crosses. The chances are very small of anything of market merit in the first seed¬ 
lings and selective crosses of the improved hybrids and testing of hundreds and even thousands of their successive offspring may be necessary before the object is achieved. 

I therefore turn to the w’ork of another 
Californian whose work was described some tim'e ago in the “Citrograph” in part as follows: 

“It has long been the popular feeling that the Washington navel orange is 
“good enough.” Consequently when Mr. 
A. C. Thomson, of Duarte, announced his 
Improved Navel there were many who doubted such a possibility. And when he told the modus operand! of its origin the doubters said “Oh, fie!” To produce a 


42 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


new hybrid by splitting buds and inserting a half bud each of two varieties in the slit sounds implausible; and yet that is just what this ingenious Scotchman says he did. 

There is a diversity of opinion as to the merits of Thomson’s Improved Navel, but all who are acquainted with it frankly con¬ 
cede that it is a distinct variety. The manner of its coming is immaterial, 
although there is no good reason for doubt¬ 
ing the narrative of its sponsor. Having placed the new orange in the race with its progenitors, both as regards earliness and quality, it occurred to Mr. Thomson that the next thing to be desired was a late navel—^^one which should lengthen the navel season even unto the coming of the 
Valencia. With this important possibility in mind our Scotchman again split buds taking them from the Improved Navel and the Late Valenicia. During a visit to his place recently he told me of the pro¬ 
cess and the difficulties involved. In the majority of cases the buds live and start, 
each half sends out an independent shoot, 
and not simultaneously. In other instances, even when, starting at the same time, they fail to unite properly in a perfect shoot or stem. As proof that even a perfect union is not necessarily produc¬ 
tive pf an improved fruit, Mr. Thomson showed me a freak tree, with long curved leaves in which olive green and white seemed struggling for control.' The few oranges on it were ribbed from stem to blossom end and were scarcely edible. Out of the many buds inserted in conjugal fashion from the Improved Navel and 
Late Valencia there came one tree which, 
as it stood in the nursery row, showed dis¬ 
tinct characteristics and habits of growth. 
Mr. Thomson relates that Alexander 
Craw visited his place at this time, and, 


being told that there was a tree of a new variety in the nursery, he went in and pointed it out. In due season it was set out in the orchard, where it now stands in one of two rows of its kind, these two rows of Navelencia extending through an orchard of Thomson’s Improved Na¬ 
vels of the same age. The Navelencia trees average about a foot higher than the Im¬ 
proved Navels. In the half-dozen years since it first fruited, it has become the par¬ 
ent of many trees, its progeny including the two rows in which it stands, as well as orchards and individual trees in nearly every orange growing section throughout the world.” "‘As regards lateness, it should be stated that the conditions of the fruit on the young trees about Highland and Redlands indicates that in this climate it promises to partially make good Mr. 
Thomson’s original claim and to length¬ 
en the navel season by at least a few weeks.” As further evidence of the feasibility of split bud grafting I will quote from an address delivered by Pro¬ 
fessor N. F. Murray before the annual meeting of the Kansas Horticultural So¬ 
ciety : 

‘‘Several years ago we began to experi¬ 
ment in hybrid grafting. We worked on apple, pear, and plum, root-grafting in the usual manner, except we cut out all the buds from the scion to be grafted, then split from end to end and with a sharp knife cut through the center of the top bud. Then Taking two half scions of two different varieties we spliced them to¬ 
gether, knowing full well that the desired union or cross of the two varieties must be accomplished by a union of the two buds. 
In part of our work we simply split the buds, always using a very sharp knife and a magnifying glass, and taking great care and pains, wrapping with fine thread and

then waxing. We operated on in this way, making quite a number of apple, 
pear, and plum. In the apple we used Ben 
Davis as a foundation and to this variety we united Johnathan, Wine sap and 
Grime’s Golden, our object being to infuse better quality into the Ben Davis. We planted all with care and watched results, 
eight per cent grew, and from the ap¬ 
pearance of the leaves we think we have at least three crosses out of loo in the apple and we are awaiting their fruiting with interest. We are much encouraged from the fact that one plum tree’out of twenty, crossed with Wild Goose and 
Abundance, fruited last year and shows a hybrid, or cross between the two. 

We shall continue our experiment, feel¬ 
ing confident that in hybrid grafting and budding we have the means to greatly im¬ 
prove our fine fruits, flowers, and shrubs. 
We shall select our scions and buds only from the most healthy and vigorous trees and plants and those that produce the larg¬ 
est and best fruit. Our fine American herds have been brought up to their pres¬ 
ent high standard by the most careful selecting and breeding for generations. 
We believe that in a similar manner our 
American horticulture must be improved.” 

I think it will also be of interest to con¬ 
sider the experience of Mr. O. W. Black- 
nail of Kittrell, N. C., with natural varia¬ 
tions of fruits. He says: “I will give my experience as to variation during the past forty years of three well known fruits, 
those are the Winesap apple, the Scupper- 
nong grape, and the Wilson’s Albany strawberry. Forty years ago the Wine- 
sap apples grown in this neighborhood were comparatively uniform in size and color. Since then a great many trees have been brought in and planted from widely 


separated nurseries in different parts of the 
United States. The result has been a wide variation in the size and color of the fruit; 
probably this variation has extended to the flavor and also to the shape of the ap¬ 
ple. But of this I am not sure. I am only stating what I know to be positively true. Then as to the Scuppernong grape: 
A very few if any Scuppernong grape vines have ever been brought into this neighborhood. It is fairly certain that nearly if not all, of the many vines now fruiting have originated from a few old vines growing in the neighborhood time out of mind, many of them certainly a cen¬ 
tury old. Still there is a variation in the size, quality, and time of ripening of the fruit of different vines which is most strik¬ 
ing. Some bear fruit fully twice as large as others and that when growing side by side, some have thick hulls, and some thin, 
some ripen at the beginning of September and some not till the last of October. Now it is barely possible that the most dis¬ 
similar vines may be seedlings. But this is extremely improbable, as according to my experience when the Scuppernong seed is planted it reverts to the black grape similar to the Muscadine or Bullace, the wild parent of the Scuppernong. But even admitting that the widest variation is the result of vines grown from seed, there is still such a wide variation in the fruit of vines known to be grown from cuttings that it fully establishes the case in point.” 

In order to give a comprehensive view of the field, opportunities and principles of fruit improvement I have given these brief extracts from the writings and ut¬ 
terances of men who are acknowledged to be authorities and experts in their several lines of effort. In the Citrus it seems to me there is great range for variations, and 
I would call attention in particular to one 


44 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


phase of probable variety variation that cannot occur in deciduous fruits. 

The graft of deciduous fruit trees must be taken and put in when dormant, though buds of the peach for instance like the orange are put in during the growing sea¬ 
son. Before blooming in the spring or late in the fall when the summer growth is used, for budding oranges, I think we may expect the new trees to be true to the parent, but budwood taken just after blooming in the spring is liable to show variations if taken from twigs on which the bloom has been cross pollenated from other varieties. Rev. Lyman Phelps work¬ 
ed on this line before the ’95 freeze with artificial pollenation and produced several modified oranges of which all were lost so far as I know except Tephi, a Jaffa im¬ 
proved with Malta Blood. The first ex¬ 
ample of this kind I discovered was 
Botelha navel, a bud sport from May bud¬ 
ding about 1885, a round, nearly seedless, 
midseason navel that overbore so persist¬ 
ently as to be undesirable. It was lost in 
1895. I think most orange growers have noticed variations in standard varieties and I think if these could be traced they would be found to result from effects of cross pollenation on bud wood used just after blooming. 

All will concede that the foreign pollen cells are the only cause of hybrids and crosses in the seeds of fruits. The jx)llen cells are the only motile cells in the higher orders of plants. A single grain attached to the pistil of an orange flower for in¬ 
stance sends its cells down that pistil into the ovary or embryo fruit and the mature 


seeds of that fruit make trees with fruits differing from the parent tree. 

Mr. Phelps contended that the influence of these motile pollen cells not only af¬ 
fected the embryo fruit and seeds, but for a short time, at least, affected a leaf axil bud or two adjacent to the flower. 

For any person who has the time and patience the method of taking a bud next an artificially pollenated bloom' offers a short cut to variety improvement. I am also of opinion that the split-bud and cross pollenation bud methods offer quicker and surer means of obtaining thin skinned, fine grained, seedless or nearly seedless fruits of high quality, by combining varieties that are already high bred or superior, 
than the growing of crosses from seed. 

In conclusion I would call attention to a difficulty in producing high grade, early, 
hardy oranges. The hardy trait must be derived from the Citrus Trifoliata while the sweetness of juice and tissue with fine flavor must be derived from fruits that have derived these qualities from the ten¬ 
der citron. In my experience the Tan- 
gerona and Early Oblong, for instance, 
are not so resistant to cold as the Satsuma and Mandarin which clearly show traces of Trifoliata ancestry. The Citrus prob¬ 
ably more than any other fruits have the predisposition to throw to excess in cross¬ 
ing, some one characteristic of form, 
structure, color or flavor, with the odds enormously in favor of monstrosities, and a happy combination of desirable qualities will be as much a matter of chance as of scientific management.

By O* W. Conner, Tangerine* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

There are so many subjects that must be taken up, in making a report on ‘‘Citrus 
Fruits” that I hardly know where to be¬ 
gin, but I trust you will be patient with me, and that what I have to say will be of some benefit, to the beginners, if not to those older in experience. The cultivation of Citrus Fruits in Florida has, within the past few years, advanced to first place, of all Horticultural pursuits, and vast amounts of capital have been invested in large, and small groves all over the state, 
but most particularly, in the central and southern portions. And where ten or twelve years ago, a grove of fifty, or one hundred acres was considered a big thing, 
we now have many groves planted, that cover anywhere from one hundred to five hundred acres, and more going out every year, so I feel well assured, that in a very short time, we will enjoy the distinction of having the largest acreage of citrus groves, of any state in the Union and per¬ 
haps of any area of equal size in the world, 
and as the success of citrus fruits depends largely on these new groves, I trust you will pardon me for giving them so much attention in this paper. 

With the increase in acreage, it becomes a necessity to so distribute the varieties planted as to reduce to a minimum the chances of overproduction, in any one class of fruit. And by reviewing the 
Grapefruit situation, we can surely learn the disadvantage of even partial overpro¬ 
duction. There is no question in my mind, but that there have been too many 
Grapefruit trees budded, and planted in 


Florida in proportion to the fruits of other varieties, and we have seen excellent fruit drop from almost fabulous prices three years ago, to about cost of production, the past season, and it was chiefly due to the fact that the demand was not sufficient to clean up at any time, the excess of fruit shipped. It is true that in some cases, good prices were realized, but this was not a rule, and the average was far below what the leadirig growers ex¬ 
pected to receive. The demand is cer¬ 
tainly limited. If the Pomelo was such a 

fruit as it is customarv to eat out of hand, 

- 

it would be different. But its uses are almost entirely limited to table, or dessert purposes, while the round oranges are eaten by almost everyone, on all occasions, 
from one end of the world to the other. 
And even when making up the lunch for outing parties, this delicious fruit almost invariably finds its way into the hamper. 

It is true that the demand is in a small way increasing, for Grapefruit, but not rapidly enough to keep up with the in¬ 
creasing output of Florida, California, 
Cuba, Jamaica, and Porto Rico, all of which, except California, produce nearly the same quality of fruit that we do. 

I have no way of determining the ex¬ 
act proportion of Pomelo, that are already planted, but believe that fully one third of the whole number of Citrus fruit trees now growing in this state, are Grapefruit, and as the majority of these trees have not as yet come into bearing the results of over¬ 
production have not as yet been felt, and 1 
feel perfectly safe in saying that ten years hence (if all the Grapefruit now planted come into bearing, and barring freezes) 


46 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that the price will be so low, that it will be a difficult matter to find a market for this fruit that will pay for production, and packing, to say nothing about transporta¬ 
tion charges^ to market. ‘ 

Citrus fruit groves, if properly arrang¬ 
ed as to variety, and intelligently cultiva¬ 
ted, and fertilized, and in other ways scientifically, and methodically managed, 
are now, and will continue to be a good in¬ 
vestment in Florida, and I do not want to say anything, that will have a tendency to discourage anyone from making such an investment, for I believe that the future holds many gratuitous results to reward intelligent labor in this vocation, but Hor¬ 
ticultural progress has made many rapid strides during the past few years, in the way of determining the best thing to have for good results, and getting it, and to those who are beginning, I would most earnestly urge the necessity of getting the right thing, particularly in the way of variety, as a starter, and then to be sure to take good care of it. 

There is no question but that in all sec¬ 
tions where citrus fruits are grown, there are some varieties, that do better than others, and in planting new groves in any of these localities it would invariably, be the better to consult those who have already planted and fruited budded trees, 
before deciding on what you will plant, 
and not depend on something that you knew as a fine fruit which was grown a hundred or more miles distant. 

I believe one of the results of ‘‘The 
Freeze” was to weed out many varieties that had been propagated extensively in the early days of citrus fruit growing in 
Florida, because they were not profitable, 
and we now have in our list of good varieties as compiled by our committee, 
and published in last year’s yearbook, a 


catalogue of Citrus fruits, each with its distinctive marks^ and so arranged, that even a novice can pick out the winners, 
with a little local aid, and research, as to adapability to location, etc. and I believe every variety listed, is a good one for some locality, and among the best of them, 
for universal use, I believe the following are entirely safe: Early Boones, Parson 
Brown (Carney) Satsuma; Midseason: 
Pineapple, Homosassa, Majorca, Ruby; 
Late: Hart’s (Tardiff) Valencia Late; 
Very Late: Lamb’s Summer. Novelties: 
Dancy (Tangierine;) King, Mandarin, 
Kumquats. I prefer the Parson Brown, 
to all others on the list of early varieties. 
The Boone will color up earlier in the season, but its appearance is against it, and it is inclined to roughness, and a thick rind, and is of a very uninviting color, 
even when fully ripe. 

For midseason varieties, there is noth¬ 
ing on the list, that quite equals the Pine¬ 
apple, and it dilfers from other varieties, 
inasmuch that it can safely be depended on, in any, and all localities, where any kind, or varieties of citrus can be grown 
It is the most profitable sort for high pine lands, and is perfection on hammock and other rich, or heavy soils. This variety, 
like the Parson Brown, has made a reputa¬ 
tion for itself, on the different markets, 
and I believe I am perfectly safe in saying that it has netted the growers fully a dol¬ 
lar a box more than any other variety, the past season. Next to the Pineapple, is the 
Homosassa, and as a midseason, to medium late variety, I believe there is a good chance for the Ruby. Ruby should always be classified, and shipped as a 
Blood and it should be put up in as attract¬ 
ive a manner as possible. The Hart’s and Valencia Late, I have found to be of about equal merits as to quality of fruit. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


47 


However, if there is any variation, it is in favor of the Valencia Late in evenly coloring up, and smoothness, and texture of peel. The Tardiff will hang on the trees a little later in the season, but I am not sure that the quality of the fruit improves as it is apt, especially so on lemon stock, 
to get greener after rainy season com¬ 
mences. I have noted the past winter, 
that late varieties, owing to their im¬ 
mature condition probably recover from the effect of cold weather better than any of the midseason, or early varieties. A 
neighbor shipped in good condition April 
15th Tardiff oranges that were seeming¬ 
ly ruined by a temperature of 22 degrees, 
two nights about January 20th. 

I believe, too, that there is a good mar¬ 
ket waiting for a good navel orange. This variety, when of good quality, has always brought good prices, and as there have been some improvements made on the old 
Washington Navel during the past five or six years, there is good reason to believe that we will yet be able to produce the best navels to be had anywhere, and if the new varieties prove to be prolific bearers on sour, and sweet stock, and of good quality on lemon, and generally successful in most sections of the state, instead of cer¬ 
tain restricted localities, as heretofore, 
they will be a most profitable variety■*'to plant, and propagate. 

By planting the varieties as listed above, 
or others of equal merit, and so dividing the different classes of fruit, as to give early, midseason, late, and novelties, about an equal share, or area in the new groves, 
one could pretty well cover the entire ship¬ 
ping, or marketing season, and in this way get an average of season’s prices, 
which ought to bring the account out on the right side of the ledger. 


The subject. Stocks, was pretty well covered by Prof. Rolfs, in his paper “Re¬ 
lation of Science to Horticulture” See pages 56 to 66 last year’s year book; but, 
I want to say that there is probably no other state in the Union that shows such a diversity of soil, as Florida, and while 
I agree with most others here, that the sour orange is the best stock to use and that it is this stock that has been used to produce m^st of the prize winners at vari- 
'ous exhibitions etc., there are soils upon which it would hardly produce a leaf, on account of their extremely light, sandy composition. If we, in the larger portion of Orange county, on our high sandy, hilly lands depended altogether on the sour stock, we would not have* a very good show for the money invested, and a large portion of our groves are on sweet, and rough lemon stock. The sour stock is a favorite in all localities, where a good quality of soil is to be had, and there can be no doubt, that fruit will carry longer, in good condition, on this stock than on any other, but on light, or high thirsty pine lands, it would be cultivated chiefly, at a loss. The Citrus Trifoliata stock has been tried, and proven an absolute failure, and the pomelo, or grapefruit stock grows off well until it has been budded to some variety of round oranges, and after that it usually loses its thrift, and does not do any better than the sour stock. There¬ 
fore, about all that we have to depend on is the rough lemon as a stock. 

This stock is a very rank feeder, and rarely suffers from the effects of dry weather, as other stocks do. It is healthy, 
and will thrive with us, under most ad¬ 
verse circumstances, and can always be counted on to produce a good crop of fruit, when treated fairly, and properly 


48

fertilized. It is folly to expect that trees worked on this stock over-supplied with nitrogen, will produce good fruit, and especially is this true, if organic materials are used, with an excess of nitrogen, and a deficiency of phosphoric acid, and pot¬ 
ash. This is not only true of lemon stock, 
but it has been my observation, that every grove so treated will produce a poor grade of fruit, and sooner or later, develop that most trying disease, *‘diebacl#,'’ which might truly be called indigestion of the orange tree. There are many growers who have fine looking groves, that are bearing large quantities of a poor quality of fruit, who blame it all to the stock, 
when they might by taking into considera¬ 
tion the fact that this stock is an immense feeder, and does not require the same amount of nitrogen that the sour stock does, nor the same methods of cultivation as other stocks, and cultivating, and fer¬ 
tilizing them accordingly, produce a good quality of fruit. 

I do not advocate the use of this stock on any but light soils, and by those who have had experience in cultivating citrus fruits, and who understand the require¬ 
ments of their soils but those who have this stock already planted, and developed to a bearing stage, can do much to im¬ 
prove the quality of their fruit by regulat¬ 
ing their formula of fertilizer in such a way as to most accurately meet the re¬ 
quirements of their soils as, well as their methods of cultivation, etc. 

I would like to add that the late D. W. 
Adams, who was for many years president of this Society, and during his residence in this state one of our most practical Hor¬ 
ticulturists, and one who was noted for his success with citrus fruits, had before his death, decided in favor of the lemon stock for all his new groves, not because it 


was the best stock for universal use of course, but because he had solved the problem of its successful cultivation, and fertilization. His methods of cultivation are too well known to make mention of here, except to say that they mainly con¬ 
sisted of very light working with hoes, and plenty of mulching. I think his plan of mulching might have been improved upon, 
but the fact remains, that he produced the best fruit grown in the state, and it was 
'Seldom that a box of his Navels, or Tar- 
diffs went out of his packing house, that he did not get back from $5 to $10 for it. No matter where the lemon stock is used, it cannot be cultivated, and fertilized in same manner that other stocks can, with¬ 
out producing coarse ungainly fruit, and if kept highly cultivated, and fertilized with a formula containing over 4 per cent ammonia, and less than 7 to 8 per cent Phosphoric Acid, and 10 to 12 per cent potash it will naturally follow, that the fruit will be insipid, flavorless, coarse, 
and of light weight. 

In 'localities where sour stock thrives, 
no other stock is to be considered, and the less fertilizer required, the more gratifying will be the success of the grower, but in all cases I would warn you to beware of, and fight shy of a fertilizer formula, consist¬ 
ing of any but pure chemicals, and if once you are tempted, and fall into the use of a cheap source of the different requisite elements, or an organic form of fertilizer, 
you at the same time put yourself into a position to regret it later on, when your trees begin to bear, if not before. I am sorry to have to say that in many portions of Florida the balance will show up on the wrong side of the account this year, for with the condition of our markets, and the general falling off in quality of fruit pro¬ 
duced, the net earnings of our groves have 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


49 


fallen many thousands of dollars behind what most of us confidently expected to receive for our fruits, and in the main, I 
fear it is the growers’ fault this time in many ways. First, in quality of fruit pro¬ 
duced, Second, in poor packing. Third, 
in rushing green fruit to the market very early in the season, with the result of hope¬ 
lessly glutting the markets with slow sell¬ 
ing fruit, and so demoralizing the market, 
that there was no settling to real values, at any time during the season; and added to all this, was the effects of the cold of Jan¬ 
uary and the consequent loss of large quantities of fruit, waiting to be shipped, 
when the market once got settled. Such good fruit as was left on the trees in many localities has brought very low prices, in consequence of frozen, or partially in¬ 
jured fruit having been shipped, usually at a loss, but I trust all these hard luck ex¬ 
periences, have carried with them their lit¬ 
tle lessons, relative to properly sorting, 
and packing fruit, etc., as well as bringing to the minds of all growers, the necessity of producing a good article to offer to the consumer if good prices are expected in return. 

I trust I will not be encroaching on the privileges of some other committee, if I 
say a word or so about insects, and spray¬ 
ing, for I believe a great deal depends on spraying, that is essential to producing good fruit, for good fruit must have a good appearance, as well as a sweet, aro¬ 
matic interior. From the time the bloom drops off the young fruit in the spring, 
there are enemies lying in wait to prey upon it, during every stage of its develop¬ 
ment, and while there are many locations, 
where soil, and atmospheric conditions are at enmity with these insects, and fungus diseases, and work wonders as prevent¬ 
ives of damage to the fruit and trees by 


their effects on them, I believe the rule is that these insects, and fungus diseases do a great deal of damage, and spraying be^ 
comes a necessity, in order that a good quality of fruit may be produced, not¬ 
withstanding opinions held to the con¬ 
trary. However, I have learned of cases during the past season where beginners 
(at spraying I mean) had done as much damage, with their spraying ,or more per¬ 
haps, than the insects sprayed for would have done, if left alone. This was because they did not use the spray at the right time, or used it too strong, or too often. 
While I believe that it is absolutely neces¬ 
sary at all interior points, to spra}^, I would caution those who do it, to be sure they are right, before they go ahead. Use the right thing, at the right time etc. As there are numerous bulletins to be had for the asking, from the Experiment Station at Lake City, besides which advice will be gladly furnished by the Station director. 
Dr. Sellards, I would recommend that growers avail themselves of all the knowl¬ 
edge these sources afford and thus equip themselves with perfect knowledge of their enemy before entering the arena. 

White Fly. 

I believe the mention of this little in¬ 
sect is sufficient cause to make every grower, who has the well being of his grove nearest his heart, look himself over, 
and brush his clothes well before thinking of entering his grove again, and if we were all as careful as this assertion would indicate, I believe it would be a simple matter to keep the insect in check. During the past two or three years we have all be¬ 
gun to realize what a serious menace this insect is to our orange groves, and* many plans have been suggested, for fighting it successfully, and keeping it in check, and

W€ cannot afford to get careless. If you would keep free of their damage, keep free of them. Never go near them and then into your own grove, without first making sure that you carry none with you on your clothes, in your carriage, etc., and in¬ 
sist on the same consideration of anyone else who enters your grounds. The benefits to be derived from local protective organizations are too manifest to need more than a passing remark here, and those neighborhoods that can do so, would be more benefitted by this method of pro¬ 
tection than by any other. It is cheaper to keep this insect out of a community than it is to fight it after it has gained a foot¬ 
hold. We have kept it out of our neigh¬ 
borhood for several years by spraying it at the nearest points, and cutting down all food plants in its path, and now the fly is not as near us, as it was at the beginning of our fight to keep it out. 

There is nobmuch danger of getting the fly from any of the leading nurserymen, 
for I believe they have a scruple in the direction of spreading so damaging a pest, 
but there is danger of shipping nursery stock through the country, either by ex¬ 
press, or freight when the fly is on the wing, unless it is packed very tight, and no chance for the insect to get to the con¬ 
tents of the package. The express and freight cars gather them up, when passing through infested places, and often carry them many miles from their original breeding places. I have seen flies at Wild¬ 
wood, which came all the way from Or¬ 
lando, in the express car, a distance of fifty miles. You can imagine what would have occurred if there had been an open top case of citrus trees in that car. 

And now in conclusion, I want to say that if we bend all our energies to the point of breaking, and strive to keep our pro¬ 


duct up to its known standard of excel¬ 
lence I can see no reason why we cannot succeed in keeping the reputation of Flori¬ 
da oranges at the head of the list, believ¬ 
ing that there is only one thing that we can do, one that will be of lasting benefit to our organization, and that is, to strive every way possible to make our product better each year, until we have well earned the reputation that we now enjoy, that of producing the best citrus fruit grown in the world, and then by untiring effort keep its reputation right there. Regretting that I cannot give you anything l>etter in the way of a report, as an aid in that direction, I am. 

Yours respectfully, 

O. W. Conner.

Mr. President—I have a letter that was intended to have reached me in time to have been incorporated in my report, but it did not do so and I beg to have the same received and attached as a part of report of the Committee on Citrus Fruits. 

On motion duly seconded and carried, 
the following paper referred to by Mr. 
Conner was received as a part of the report on citrus fruits: 

• May 9th, 1905. 

O. W. Conner, 

Jacksonville, Fla., 

Dear Sir: 

I have your letter of recent date stating that you are preparing a paper on citrus fruits, and that you would like me to write you something regarding the situa¬ 
tion in Cuba, knowing that I am entirely familiar with it while you are not. You also say that you would like to have a gen-

eral statement from me as to my opinion as to the future of the citrus and nursery business. I fear very much that it will not be possible for me to attend the meeting at 
Jacksonville much as I would like to do so. 
I had expected to be in Cuba, but was able to get away somewhat sooner than usual, but find that I must go to New 
York at once, which will prevent my at¬ 
tendance at the meeting. I do not suppose you will have much time for a lengthy statement from me, and will therefore en¬ 
deavor to make it brief. 

Orange growing in Cuba, up to com¬ 
paratively recent date, was merely inciden¬ 
tal. None of the groves had ever been planted with the idea of shipping fruit to market, but such fruit as was grown came from trees which happened to be planted in one place or another by accident. These trees are found growing all over the 
Island, and have never received any care worth mentioning. In many parts of the 
Island there are many wild trees growing in the forest, just about as they did in the hammocks around Orange Lake, except¬ 
ing that they are not quite as plentiful. 
There are also a great many bitter sweet trees growing throughout the Island, and the fruit on these trees, as well as that on the sour trees, seems to be identical with the fruit grown in Florida. In regard to the quality of the sweet orange I will say that there is as wide a range as there is in 
Florida, and while I have eaten oranges in Cuba which I consider to be as good as any I have ever tasted, I have also eaten many which were very poor. There is nothing very surprising about this, how¬ 
ever, when the circumstances under which they were grown are taken into con¬ 
sideration. The trees are generally stand¬ 
ing where there is no chance whatever to cultivate them, and in many instances the 


entire ground surrounding the trees is choked with a dense growth of other trees and plants. Many of the trees are grow¬ 
ing in what is called Guinea grass land, 
and this grass grows very rank, and often attains the height of eig'ht to ten feet. 
During the many wars which have pre¬ 
vailed on the island, either one army or the other persisted in setting fire to anything that would burn, in order to burn out or smoke out the enemy. This was, of course, pretty tough on the orangp trees, 
as many of them were burned to the ground, while others were badly injured. 
A great many people who have been to the 
Island have told me that they never saw a large orange tree, but had the trees in 
Florida been burned as they have in 
Cuba, the same statement might truthfully be made here. If we were to have a freeze which cut our trees to the ground about every four 3^ears I doubt if anyone would ever see a large orange tree in 
Florida. There has been practically no shipment of oranges from the Island of 
Cuba for many years. The entire product of these scattering trees being consumed at home. Within the last two or three years, 
however, several Ameifrcan Syndicates have planted large groves of oranges and grapefruit in Cuba, and the prospect is that within a very few years Cuba will be known as a factor in the citrus fruit busi¬ 
ness. While it is true that oranges will grow in any part of the Island it is also true that a great deal of the soil of Cuba is not well adapted to citrus fruit culture, 
owing to the fact that it is very heavy and almost impossible to cultivate. Such land will produce magnificent sugar cane, as during the rainy season they do not ex¬ 
pect nor is it necessary to cultivate sugar cane, and at such time as I have descrilDed it is impossible to work a horse for the 


52

reason that it would soon sink out of sight. 
The lands with which I am most familiar are located at Ceballos in Porto Principe, 
Province. Here I found the soil very similar to that in our best Florida Ham¬ 
mocks, except that it is red instead of black. The land is covered with a dense growth of hardwood timber, and it stands so thick that a cat can hardly crawl into it. When I went to inspect this land for the Development Company of Cuba I 
found that where wells had been dug the soil was twenty-six feet deep before they struck sub-soil, and it seems to be just as good at the bottom as it is at the top. 
There is 29 per cent of silica in the soil and this makes it porous enough so that when a heavy rain falls it soon soaks through it. I have seen it rain steadily for nearly twenty-four hours, and within two hours after it stopped I could ride a horse all over the well-cultivated field with out any discomfort whatever, and the ploughs and cultivators could be operated next day. I think all things considered this is the finest soil for orange growing that I have ever seen. The time may come when we will have to fertilize, but I think it is a long way off. The Development 
Company of Cuba, of which I am the 
General Manager, determined to plant or¬ 
anges on an extensive scale, and we be¬ 
gan operations there two years ago. Our first planting was about 10,000 trees and we finished on the fifteenth of February. 
1903. To anyone who has not visited 
Cuba, it would seem almost incredible if they were told that trees planted at that time are now, many of them, 12 feet high, 
and the stocks three to four inches in diameter with a corresponding spread of branches, that they bloomed in March, and that many of them are now carrying three to four boxes of fruit. Whether this will 


shed or not I cannot say, but I never saw healthier looking fruit in all my life. Thus it was when I left there a week ago. I do not wish to convey the idea that every tree is twelve feet high, or that every tree has three to four boxes of fruit, but I believe the grove will average nine feet in height, 
and unless they drop very badly, the pres¬ 
ent indications are that we will have more than an average of one box per tree. It must be taken into con¬ 
sideration, however, that these trees grow the entire season, and there is never a day in the year but what you can go into the grove and find plenty of new growth on them. In Florida, you are all aware that there trees generally rest for three or four months each year, 
and then if they have been fortunate enough to escape Jack Frost, they con¬ 
tinue to increase in size, but you can readily see that this is a much slower pro¬ 
cess than when the growth is continuous, 
and where the land is so rich that they never lack for a square meal. The De¬ 
velopment Company in connection with the colonists who have settled there have now planted about 2,000 acres to citrus fruits, and these will probably be increased from five to eight hundred acres per year for several years, as it is the intention of the Company to plant at least 3,000 acres. 

I never saw trees anywhere that seemed to be in any more healthy condition, and I 
can see no reason why the production of citrus fruits in Cuba should not be car¬ 
ried on successfully, and on an enormous scale. We have had some little trouble with gumming, but this has entirely yield¬ 
ed to treatment and the affected trees seem to be in perfect con¬ 
dition at the present time. We have also had more or less scale to con¬ 
tend with, but I do not anticipate much 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


53 


trouble on this score. We were never troubled much on the rich Hammock 

lands here in Florida for the reason that the trees grew so rapidly that the scale could not seem to do much damage. I 
had several hammock land groves be¬ 
fore the freeze, and do not recollect ever having sprayed one for insects, but on the pine lands we always had troubles of our own. The soil in Cuba being so very much richer than any in Florida, I do not apprehend much trouble from scale in¬ 
sects for the reasons above given. We have not, as yet, had any white fly to con¬ 
tend with, and I sincerely hope that we will be able to keep them out. Judging from the growth the trees already plant¬ 
ed have made, and by the prospect we have for fruit this year, I think I am safe in saying that the present planting at 
Ceballos in the course of five or six years ought to yield easily one and a half mil¬ 
lions of boxes. We are located on the line of the Cuba Railroad, and this Com¬ 
pany is building enormous docks at its 
.terminus at Nipe Bay, which will be our 
^shipping port, and we expect to deliver 
'fruit from our packing house tO' the wharf in New York in five days or less. 
There is one great advantage in ship¬ 
ping from Cuba, and that is, after the fruit is loaded onto the vessels, there are no way stations or side tracks, but it goes direct to its destination without stopping. I am satisfied that thousands of trees will be planted in unfavorable lo¬ 
cations in Cuba, and do not believe such trees will ever amount to anything. I 
have seen trees grown on heavy black lands which produced beautiful fruit, 
but upon examination I found them bad¬ 
ly creased and would not stand shipment. 
This land is very similar to some I own at Silver Springs Run, and while my fruit was very handsome to look at it was al¬ 


ways badly creased, and it put me to lots of trouble to market it, as I could never sell the crop to the same man twice, for the reasons above stated. There are bound to be failures in Cuba just as there have been in Florida and Califor¬ 
nia, but in my opinion where careful and intelligent selection of land and location has been made there ought to- be no trou¬ 
ble to succeed in growing as good citrus fruit in Cuba, as in any other place in the world, and I believe when our im¬ 
proved budded varieties begin to fruit there will be no question about its quality. 
Many people in Florida have an erroneous idea that good oranges can not be grown anywhere else. I think, however, that you will all agree with me that tl^iere are some mighty poor oranges grown in Flor¬ 
ida, especially on lands which are not well adapted and which are not properly fertilized. It is doubtful if any better fruit than is grown in some parts of Flor¬ 
ida will ever be produced anywhere, and it would be an unreasonable man who would ask for anything better, but with the experience I have already had in 
Cuba I feel perfectly satisfied that we will produce a great deal of good fruit that will compete with the best in Flor¬ 
ida and California. 

In regard to the nursery business I 
do not suppose this will interest your hearers, but will say briefly that I have never yet seen any trees grown in Cuba which compared to those produced in the sandy lands of Florida. Any one who is at all familiar with the propagation of trees or plants knows very well that a light sandy soil is much more desirable for the reason that it will produce a much better root system. In the rich lands of 
Cuba there is so much plant food always present in the soil that the young plant does not find it necessary to throw out any 


54 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


large quantity of roots as a comparative¬ 
ly few seem tO' suffice for its needs, while in the sandy lands of Florida the young plant must hustle for food as soon as the seed sprouts, and this continual hustling gloves our trees the magnificent root system for which they are so justly not¬ 
ed. In planting our trees if proper care is taken by the nurserymen in digging and by the planters when setting there should not be a loss of one per cent, and 
I have known several instances where several thousands of trees were planted without the loss of a single one. On the other hand with the Cuban grown tree, if the same precautions are used as in the other case there is often a loss of from twenty-five tO' fifty per cent, ow¬ 
ing undfoubtedly to the lack of roots on the tree grown in the rich soil. I have seen nursery stock grown in California, 
Jamaica and Cuba, but have never seen anything that could “hold a candle” to the tree grown in the sandy soil of Flor¬ 
ida. A great many of my friends have talked with me on this subject of orange growing in Cuba, and seem to fear that 
Cuba would soon put Florida out of business. I do not think we need to have any fears on this score, as there will be but little competition. I have always advocated the planting of late varieties in Cuba, claiming that we should take advantageof the climatic conditions there and grow something that could not be grown in Florida. About 90 per cent of the orange trees I have sold in Cuba are of the late varieties, and will not get into the market until after the first of Feb¬ 
ruary, at which time practically every¬ 
thing has left Florida. I have advised against planting the early varieties for the reason that we can not get them in¬ 
to' the market any earlier than can be done from Florida, and as oiir growers 


have a bad habit of rushing their fruit into the market regardless of the fact that it is green and unfit for use, and without any reference tO' the demands of the market, I thought it would be bad policy to get our fruit in at the same time, as we would all go down together. 
There will of course be some fruit ship^ 
ped during December and January, but 
I do not think these shipments will have much effect on the market, as the bulk of the fruit will come later. 

There is much more that might be said, but I have already made this letter much longer than I intended. 

Trusting that it may be of some inter- 
est to your hearers, I remain. 

Yours very truly.

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Boggs—Mr. President, there is es¬ 
pecially one important point in my judg¬ 
ment contained in the committee report that should be fully discussed by the so¬ 
ciety. That point is the question rof overproduction of grapefruit. There has been a great deal of complaint this sea¬ 
son of the prevailing low price of grape¬ 
fruit and it behooves us to inquire into the cause. While I must admit that I 
have myself seen but a small portion of the state and am not entirely familiar with the acreage or output of grapefruit, 
I have gained the impression from the press throughout the state that it is now large and still growing ; in fact, it seems, 
that everybody is planting grapefruit. 
Mr. President, this is a very important subject to this society and to the citrus fruit industry of this state. The market conditions on this crop are decidedly bad. 
There seems to be no let up in the plant¬ 
ing of grapefruit trees and there seems to 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


55 


be no let up in depression of prices, so far as my observation goes and I would like very much indeed to have the views of other members of the society upon this very important matter. 

Mr. Carroll—Mr. President, before I 
could entirely agree with the gentleman 
I think we should first look tO' the mar¬ 
ketable condition of the fruit, picking handling, packing and shipping and the proper distribution before we come to the conclusion that we ar?^ approaching an overproduction in this handsome new fruit. Grapefruit, Mr. President, is a new fruit, a comparatively new citrus prod¬ 
uct. There are thousands of people in this country who do not know what grapefruit is. They never saw the fruit, 
and when they see it they have to be edu¬ 
cated how to eat it. Further than this my observation is that the condition of the marketable crop up to this time has * 
been positively bad. The handling and packing has been bad, shipment and dis¬ 
tribution has not been the best. I be¬ 
lieve I can safely say, Mr. President, that fully one-third of the fruit shipped out of the state this season has been shipped out in a green, immature and decidedly unmarketable condition. Such condi¬ 
tions as these will make the market 
♦ slump on anything. Another thing, Mr. 
President, the hue and cry was raised some years ago that we were on the verge of overproduction in oranges. 
We do not hear any more about it now. The proper handling, picking, pack¬ 
ing and shipment of the orange crop se¬ 
cures good prices on the market. I believe it will be the same with grapefruit. Let us rather make improvement first in these important conditions, Mr. President, and give the great markets of this country a taste of the delicious grapefruit before we 


indulge in the pessimistic views of over¬ 
production. I am an optimist in the matter of the grapefruit industry, as I 
am with regard to almost the entire fam¬ 
ily of Florida citrus fruits. Give us some legislation if it is needed in the matter of crateage and package and rates. Let us send our fruit to market in prime con¬ 
dition and I believe the low prices will abate and vanish. 

Mr. Connor—I think you will find, Mr. 
President, that attention is called in my paper tO' marketable conditions. These conditions must be bettered before we can expect to realize better prices. The matter is a very serious one and we must seek the cause. I am inclined to believe myself that there is now a partial over¬ 
production of grapefruit, or to put it transversely, under-consumption. The conditions exist and they should be met if it is possible to meet them or suffer disastrous consequences. 

Mr. Blackman — Mr. President. I 
heartily concur in the remarks of Mr. 
Carroll. During my travels last summer 
I came across scores of people who had never heard of grapefruit and did not know what it was, and didn’t know how to eat it when they saw it, but who weie all delighted with the fruit when it was offered them and they liad once tasted it. If this be true, and it most assuredly is true, how can we apprehend overpro¬ 
duction in this comparati\ely new citrus fruit? The great majority of the pec.ple of this country as yet do not know what grapefruit is. They have never seen it. 
It has never been offered to them. It has never been placed upon their market. 
In my judgment, Mr. President, we cer¬ 
tainly should not apprehend overproduc¬ 
tion until we have at least put the fruit 


56 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


properly upon the market in good con¬ 
dition. I found this state of things at the St. Louis Exposition. There wasn’t a man in ten who had ever heard of grapefruit. I had some of the fruit with me. I induced a commission merchant to take a shipment of it, and exhibiting the fruit there,* I told the people where it could be procured. The consequence was, the merchant sold out his entire shipment in a few days. Mr. President, 
we have not overproduction of grape¬ 
fruit at all in my judgment. It is rather a lack of systematic marketing. I do not fear overproduction. I have always been able to dispose of my fruit on the trees in many instances at good prices, and 
I believe with proper systematic manage¬ 
ment, the same good results can be had now from the fruit of every grapefruit tree in the state. You can not get good prices for an inferior, green, immature, 
badly handled, packed or shipped fruit on a glutted market. The grapefruit in my judgment has as bright a future be¬ 
fore it as the orange. I therefore can not believe that there are any grounds of apprehension or fear of overproduc¬ 
tion of this delicious, comparatively new fruit, which as yet has barely been in¬ 
troduced to the markets of this coun¬ 
try. 

Mr. Boggs—I feel unwilling to leave the subject without another word or two. 
The comparison has been made here be¬ 
tween the grapefruit and the orange. 
There is no comparison, Mr. President, in my opinion, between the two fruits—at least so far as market results are con¬ 
cerned. In the first place, the grapefruit has to be eaten at the table after prepara¬ 
tion in the culinary deartment. It there¬ 
fore requires too much handling before it reaches the point of consumption. It 


is a large fruit and can not be handled in the same manner as the orange. There¬ 
fore, it will never have a very large sale, 

as a notable instance on trains, which alone is an important channel of consump¬ 
tion. It is well known, or if it is not it is time it was becoming known, that the average patron of the fruitstand, where the two fruits are displayed, the orange and the grapefruit, will buy ten oranges to one grapefruit. He' can eat the one on the spot, ^if he chooses ; the other he has to take home with him and have it prepared before he eats it. I 
want to say here and now, Mr. Presi¬ 
dent, that those of us, and I believe there are many, who indulge the delusion that the grapefruit is ever to rival the orange on the market, are doomed to disappoint¬ 
ment and despair. That can, in the very nature of the two fruits, never be. It is, 
in my opinion, the utmost folly to en¬ 
tertain such a thought. The gentleman from Miami, Mr. Blackman, is the only person that I have heard of who has this season received what he thought he ought to have gotten for his grapefruit. 
Let us, for a single moment, consider his conditions. The grove of which he speaks is within a short distance of the 
Royal Palm Hotel, and situated upon a favorite driveway for tourists. The owner sells entirely to this class of trade, and gets twice as much per box in his grove as the fruit could be bought for in New 
York City. How many of us have a grapefruit orchard in the shadow of a palatial winter resort hotel, where the fruit may be picked from the trees for the break¬ 
fast table? The gentleman is to be con¬ 
gratulated Upon his situation and upon the fancy prices he has obtained for his fruit, 
but that situation, Mr. President, is a very different one from the average grape-

fruit grower in this state. In conclusion, 
I must reiterate that my observation is, 
that we have even now, or we soon shall have in this state, a very large overproduc¬ 
tion of grapefruit. I would not be un¬ 


derstood as discouraging its culture en¬ 
tirely, but it should certainly be made subservient to the real condition of things as regards its scope and its market. 


T ropical Fruits. 


By Mrs* E* E* Ankcncy, Eldred^ Fla. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In the recent reports of this committee 
I find that those reporting gave you a wide outlook upon the pineapple industry, 
its history, increase and desirability as an investment. One committeeman says: 
“To go into the details of pineapple cul¬ 
ture would be entirely foreign to this re¬ 
port,” and another says “I should hate very much to feel called upon to relate 

* * * the details * * * ^nd I 

take it that people generally care little for such information.” As I have neither a 

• wide experience nor extended observation, 
I must necessarily confine myself .to my smaller knowledge which covers only the methods of culture employed by myself and some others in my own vicinity. 

I have been a member of this society and read its reports for six years past, but have never had the pleasure of attending a meeting where I could ask questions; 
so that when I read that Mr. Porcher has found a new bug on his orange trees, 
which he got rid of by spraying, I am glad if he describes it so that I may know it should it come down our way; or when 
Mr. Hart says there is a fungus which 


will take care of that bug just as well, and does not tell what that fungus looks like, 
whether green, brown, or yellow, or where it grows, how shall I know that 1 
have the panacea on hand when the dread enemy appears? I am sure the facts and minute details are what make the Annual 
Reports of this society valuable. 

PINEAPPLES. 

Pineapples have as yet only one great enemy and he is the, hitherto, unconquer¬ 
able Jack Frost. He has laid them low several times but, like Truth, though crushed to earth they rise again and grow and grow. In the hope of making my paper practical, therefore, to those newly starting in the business, I will tell you how some of us grow Red Spanish pineapples out of doors at Eldred on the East Coast. 

Our land is spruce pine and high ham¬ 
mock. It is cleared, grubbed deeply and raked as for a garden. The slips which form around the base of the apple are allowed to grow after the fruit is picked until mature, and are considered the most desirable to plant, although suckers usual¬ 
ly bring a higher price per thousand. 




58 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 


Good plants should be eight inches or more in length. These are cut off slightly at the base and enough of the leaves or boot peeled off to expose the root system and planted with a dibble or trowel, 
twenty inches each way and in beds twenty to forty feet wide being found most satisfactory. At this distance it will require about twelve thousand per acre, 
more or less, according to the space given to paths. Some, immediately after plant¬ 
ing, put a pinch of cottonseed meal, or cottonseed meal and tobacco into the heart of each plant, but generally this is not done until the plant begins to root. From this time till the plants bloom, the scuffle- 
hoe is the grower’s best friend, and its constant use without fertilizer will make better plants than the feicilizer without the scuffle-hoe. Neither should be used sparingly if the best results are to be se¬ 
cured. When well rooted an application of five hundred pounds to the acre of cot¬ 
tonseed meal and tobacco or of high grade blood and bone will keep them growing nicely. If the weather does not become cold enough to check growth, still another application of the same kind, say one thousand pounds per acre, may be applied in the late fall or winter though this may be delayed till February or March. 

By mid-summer the plants should be nearly full grown and stocky at the base. 
Until recently it has been usual to apply at this stage simply an ammoniated fer¬ 
tilizer and if they are at all backward that will be best, but otherwise I prefer to add a slight percentage of phosphoric acid and potash to the ammoniate. One hundred pounds of fertilizer to each one thousand plants is sufficient. The plants will then need nothing further until they are ready to fruit and this is applied any time be¬ 
tween September and March, owing to the 


condition of the fields, the weather or the ideas of the individual grower. A for¬ 
mula for this last application often used is 
3 to 4 per cent of ammonia, 7 to 8 per cent phosphoric acid and 10 to 12 per cent pot¬ 
ash. 

I have thus outlined as briefly as pos¬ 
sible one system of cultivation which has given good results, but of course there are many variations from this, both in the amount of fertilizer, proportions, and time of application. The pineapple is tenacious of life and lives to fruit so it does its level best with whatever comes to it, but repays richly for good feeding and care. An acre well cared for will, if the plants were vigorous and all conditions favorable, produce go per cent or from 
300 to 400 crates the first crop, but as neither slips nor suckers are uniformly good and "some years are all below par, 
the average yield is not so high. After plants cover the ground, cultivation ceases and fertilizer is applied broadcast, two applications a year being considered suffi¬ 
cient in our locality. Formerly cotton¬ 
seed meal and tobacco dust was the uni¬ 
versal summer fertilizer, but recently a more or less complete one of high grade materials is growing in favor, especially when there is much fall fruit. 

Believing that those who have never seen a pineapple field or seen the fruit handled would be interested, the writer takes pleasure in showing some pineap¬ 
ple views taken in the East Coast pineap¬ 
ple belt in St. Lucie county. The pack¬ 
ing of the fruit will be of especial inter¬ 
est to many. 

The growing of pineapples is no longer an experiment. The problems remaining to be solved are largely economical and commercial. Increased production means smaller profits and must induce better

business methods by the growetrs;? less waste and the obtaining by combination or otherwise, wholesale prices on needed supplies. We need a wider distribution and cheaper rates, particularly to near-by markets; and above all quicker transpor¬ 
tation and more careful handltng. Six days to New York, and eight to Boston, 
will never enable us to compete with 
Havana fruit should our seasons be iden¬ 
tical. 

The freeze of January 25 to 26 left our fields brown as stubble fields in Autumn. 
But the wonderful vitality and recupera¬ 
tive power of the pineapple plant has again been demonstrated and our fields are rapidly renewing thernselves. The yield from the older fields will be cut down 60 to 70 per cent but those coming into bearing for the first time will produce almost as many pines, but unless weather conditions are perfect, they will average much smaller than if they had not been frozen. A strange characteristic of this freeze was, that the newly planted fields were practically uninjured. A white frost has often done more damage to young plants than did those two nights of freez¬ 
ing w^eather. 

We have no sheds in Eldred so I cannot 


report upon their efficiency, but suppose that now, if ever, their owners will realize upon their investment. 

At your last meeting the question most persistently pressed was: “Do pineapples pay?” To which I answer, “If they do not, why do we grow them?” For pine¬ 
apple fields unlike an orange grove do not appeal to the sentimental side of one’s na¬ 
ture. When I look over their green slopes 
I involuntarily begin to figure on the number of crates and probable profits, but when I turn from: these and walk down through our small and not very produc¬ 
tive orange grove, which has cost much pains and money, and has never brought a dollar of profit, there is a fascination and a compensating satisfaction in the beauty of the trees alone, and a certain charm of mystery and expectancy, as well. 
The late Mr. Joseph Jefferson is reported to have remarked to a caller at his Palm 
Beach home that one of the disadvantages of old people was that they had nothing to expect, so this winter he has been gardenr¬ 
ing. In the spirit of this bit of philosophy 
I grow orange trees, that I may cherish expectation and so keep ever the enthusi¬ 
asm of youth, but I grow pineapples be¬ 
cause they are profitable. 


The Government Viticultural Experiment Station, 


By H. von Lutichau. 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Two seasons have passed since my last report on Viticultural Experiment Sta¬ 
tion in my charge at Earleton. The time allotted to this experiment has now passed and we are in a position to recom¬ 
mend a few successful varieties of this class of finest table grapes. Not much difficulty will be experienced by a care¬ 
ful grower to get a good supply of excel¬ 
lent fruit, superior to any native kind. 

Varieties recommendable are: 

White Grapes.—Admirable de Cour- 
tiller, Chasselas Besson, Florence, Mon- 
tauban, Dore, Parc de Versailles, Satin 
Blanc, Muscat Saint Laurent. 

Black Grapes. — Black Alicante, 
Frankenthal prexose. 

Red Grapes.—^Chasselas rouge. Rose de Fallowx, Tsien-Tsien, and Chasselas rose. 

By application I think the United 
States Department of Agriculture, Mr. 
Husmann in charge of grape investiga¬ 
tions, will supply a few scions of these varieties for grafting. For stock, our wild blue bunch grape is likely as good as any and easy to get; otherwise Ru- 
pestris in different forms. Personally, I 
like the Taylor, a small cultivated grape 
Riparia X. 

It is not advisable to plant these grapes on a large scale for distant mar¬ 
kets ; but for home use, for the lover of beautiful fruit, they will prove most satisfactory and a great enjoyment. 

I have raised the best crops in the 


third, fourth and fifth year—after that a decline is noted—but this may yet be prevented by different forms of prun¬ 
ing, governed by variety, as well as soil and locality. A good plan would be to graft and plant new young vines every six or seven years and the old vines may be kept or discarded accordingly. After planting, let vine grow at will first year— 
by winter cut back to two eyes—permit but one to grow—the strongest—pinch leader when about 3 to4 feet high—let all laterals grow and next winter trim to two eyes spur system. I say “two eyes” for 
I have found this preferable to the short one eye spur trimming. ToO' close trim¬ 
ming should be avoided, as well as the growing of long spurless canes—and short ones as well, which would at best only bear fruit on the end, even when a hundred feet long. Summer pruning must not be done,except shortening in a very strong and long growing ^ane. 
For fertilizer blood, bone and potash is best applied March or April; if possible nothing but the cultivator should be used; if plowed, then very shallow, keep clean culture all the time. 

Guard against overbearing. This will ruin a vine quicker than anything else. 
The wonder stories I used to hear occa¬ 
sionally at our meetings testify but to the ignorance of the grower. It is bet¬ 
ter for the grower and especially better for the vine to have a reasonable number of fine large bunches, than a display of a great number of “berries.” Localities where Anthracnose, rot or mildew is

found, Bordeaux spraying has to be done; 
begin early, as soon as bloom is over, 
not forgetting one spray just before buds are swelling. Preventive is better than cure. 

Bagging the bunches is necessary 
Birds and wasps prefer such sweet grapes to all others, and if done as soon as ber¬ 
ries are formed, will almost prevent rot and mildew on the fruit. Common pa¬ 
per bags are used, large enough to hold the full grown bunch, and fastened with copper wire. A small hole or slit is to be cut at the bottom. 

Of insects, the steel blue beetle will do the most harm, their destructive work comes in when buds are first swelling, 
even before, and should be picked off by hand. 

I have often seen growers cut their grapes when they should have remained twO' weeks or longer on the vine; 
let fruit hang as long as possible. Sweet¬ 
ness and aroma will then come to per¬ 
fection. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Painter—I would like to know if any member of the society has any in¬ 
formation he can offer on what is known as the St. Augustine Grape. I 
know of one or two vines, one of which has been bearing for the last twenty years. I know of but the two vines. The grapes are small, something like the 
Delaware, though not quite so large, and grow in very large clusters. I think it a good grape to get better acquainted with. 


Mr. Hampton—I have seen this grape quite frequently in St. Augustine. It is a prolific grape, grqwing in large clus-. 
ters, somewhat smaller than the Dela¬ 
ware, which it resembles. It is a hardy vine long lived and a good bearer. It is a nice table grape and is a grape that ought to be and could be without trouble grown anywhere in the state. I agree with Mr. 
Painter that it is a grape that we should get better acquainted with. 

Mir. Hart—I should like to ask the gentleman what measures, if any, are taken to prevent the depredations of birds, or if they are subject to such depradations in liis experience. 

Mr. Hampton—I suppose they are to some extent, but depredations of birds are very easily remedied. I have been bothered by birds in times gone by, but am not any more. I have found that an easy matter to remedy. Simply take a small looking glass, tie a string to the edge of it and fasten it up in the top of the tree or vine where it can have some room to whirl or turn, and I can guaran¬ 
tee that that particular vine or tree will never be troubled with birds. 

Member—^I would like to ask if that applies also to lady birds? (laughter). 

Mr. Hampton—I regret to have to in¬ 
form the member that it does not. This will be found to be a cheap but most effec¬ 
tive remedy against depredations by birds. 



Report on Figs and Kaki, 


By J. H* Wylie. 


Mr. President and Members of the State 
Horticultural Society: 

Having been made one of the commit¬ 
tee on Grapes, Figs and Kaki, I feel it my duty to contribute what I can. The other two members of this committee are well known to this society, and their practical experience in the past has been of an instructive character in this state. 
Hence my little report will be confined tO' our section and county. In grapes we have fruited several varieties of the Mus¬ 
cadine class quite successfully, and be¬ 
lieve them perfectly at home in any part of this state. We consider the following kinds the best, viz.: Thomas, Scupper- 
nong, James and Flowers. We find that the James at two' years old will begin fruiting at the same time not retarding the growth, the fruit holds on until late in the season. We have also succeeded in getting very fine specimen bunches of some of the trellis varieties, such as 
Niagara, Concord, Moore’s Early and 
Delaware. 

r Figs. 

My experience with figs has been mostly with the native varieties of Ce¬ 
lestial, Lemon and Brunswick. These seem to be the leading kinds. While these all do well in our section I consider the Celestial the most valuable, as the tree seems to be hardier and is the most prolific and regular bearer. The fruit, 
though not so large, is very sweet and excellent for preserves. 

One of my neighbors, Mr. Charles 
Francis, has succeeded in working up 


quite a trade on fig preserves. About two years ago he began in a small way putting them up in fancy glass jars, and sending to friends in the North. The re¬ 
sult is that his business has increased so until now he is unable to fill his orders; 
he finds it profitable and is thinking of going into the business on a larger scale. 

If we can succeed in producing an abundance of fine fruit I believe there will be great possibilities in canning; al¬ 
so in fresh fruit for nearby markets. I 
feel sure that if we would give the fig culture as much attention as we do oth¬ 
er fruit trees, the time will not be far distant when we will have as good figs in our market here as any that we can import from any other part of the world. 

Kaki. 

The Kaki or Japan persimmon is cer¬ 
tainly a fine fruit for home use, and also has considerable market value, as they are found in all our large fruit markets in their season, and practically all of these are raised in Florida. 

In conversation with a man not long ago, whO' has been the means of estab¬ 
lishing a colony in Putnam county, he remarked that the different varieties of the Japan persimmon were grand, and after testing the different kinds as to flavor, quality, etc., has become so in¬ 
terested in the matter that now he in¬ 
tends to plant quite an orchard, at least 
40 acres to begin with, and in the future work up a special trade on the fruit. 

The right soil for persimmons is quite an important thing to consider, for while 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


63 


the native persimmon seems to thrive well in almost any place, we have noticed that the Japanese varieties on sandy soil last much better. 

For home use there is no better va¬ 
riety than Zengi, the most of its fruit is good, while hard, and improves as it gets soft, it makes the best tree and is the most prolific, and regular bearer. 
The Hyakume, Hachia, Tane-Nashi, 
Yemon, and Okame, are the favorite 


market sorts; they must be thoroughly ripe and soft before they are good to eat. 

We must all agree that the Kaki is most delicious fruit, beautiful in coloring and shape, has fine keeping and curing qualities and is sure to become a favorite in this country when our people become educated up to its peculiar characteris¬ 
tics. 


The Kaki. 


By Mr* Wm* Macklm^ Dinsmore^ Fla* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Mark Twain tells of himself that he was once suddenly and unexpectedly, in¬ 
troduced to President Grant, and the only thing he could find to say was, ‘‘Mr. 
President, I am embarrassed, are you?’^ 
That describes my case exactly, as it is only a month since I sent your secretary my initial subscription to the Florida 
Horticultural Society, and, before I could get rny breath, he launched upon me the news that I must prepare a paper on the 
Japanese persimmon. I wilted im¬ 
mediately and wondered if there was any way by which I could get that dollar back, 
but decided it was gone beyond recall, and that I must do my best with regard to the paper, so I hope my immature effort will taste better than an immature persimmon. 

The Japanese Persimmon. 

From all the information I have been able to gather I believe that I have the 


largest orchard of Japanese persimmons in 
America. It consists of about 2,500 trees, 
planted in the years 1899, 1900? iQOIj 
1902 and the remarks that follow are con¬ 
fined to observations of my own trees. 

I have found the persimmon a very interesting study, as it has qualities not common to any other fruit tree with which I have had experience, and a knowledge of its habits is not widely dis¬ 
seminated, or very easy to obtain, as in the case of the more familiar fruits. 

To begin with the matter of culti¬ 
vation : I have long ago come to the con¬ 
clusion that the persimmon is better with¬ 
out what is generally understood by that term. For the first two years after I 
started planting I kept my trees clean cul¬ 
tivated, but as they grew I found that the entire surface of the ground was literally full of very fine hair-like roots, and that no matter how lightly the ground was scratched quantities of these were torn up 




64 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


so I abandoned tillage altogether and for several years past merely run the mower through the orchards during the late sum¬ 
mer and again in the fall, using the cut- 
grass weeds to mulch the trees. During the first season or two there was not suffi¬ 
cient grass to make a heavy enough mulch, and I had to cut over some twenty acres or so of old fields and haul in suffi¬ 
cient to make up a coating about six in¬ 
ches deep and cover an area as large as the limbs of the tree. I found this more ex¬ 
pensive than cultivation, while it lasted, 
but now that the sod in the orchard has become older and produces heavier grass¬ 
es, such as broom grass, there is enough to mulch heavily. The ground under this mulch is looser and more friable than it could be made by any system of cultiva¬ 
tion, being protected continually from the packing effect of rains, while at the same time the fibrous roots remain undisturbed. 
The trees are vigorous and healthy and make a good growth each season. No other fertilizer except this rotting mass of vegetation is given, and its slow and con¬ 
tinuous effect as a fertilizer seems more suitable to bearing persimmon trees than any other I have tried, for reasons which 
I will explain later. 

In large quantities for commercial pur¬ 
poses I have only three varieties. The 
‘‘Hyakume,” “Tane-nashi,’’ and “Hache- 
ya,” though I have also a few trees of 
‘‘Yemon” and “Taber’s No. 129.” Of these “Tane-nashi” is the best market kind; of good size and appearance; nearly always seedless and holding its fruit better than the others. 

The “Hyakume” produces larger fruit, 
is more juicy and of a better flavor than 
“Tane-nashi” but not so clean and bright in appearance, and sheds its fruit badly. 
“Hacheya” is also very large, with a fine 


flavor, but must be kept, till very ripe, as the astringency common to nearly all un¬ 
ripe persimmons is more marked in this variety than the others. 

The persimmon seems very free from diseases and insect pests. I started plant¬ 
ing my first trees in peach orchards that were badly infested with “San Jose” scale and although the persimmon tree is class¬ 
ed among those on which this scale can exist, I could never find the slightest trace of any attack by the “San Jose” from the surrounding peach trees. Twig girdlers and borers give them some attention but 
1 have not had sufficient trouble from them to make treatment necessary. My orchards are on pine land. In hammock districts where there are probably larger quantities of these insects they would per¬ 
haps work more injury. The greatest evil that the persimmon grower has to contend with is the extraordinary propen¬ 
sity that most varieties have for shedding their fruit. The cause is unexplained in any existing literature on persimmons that I have seen, but I have formed my own conclusions on this subject and whether correct or not they may be of in¬ 
terest. The varieties having a very deep cavity at the stem and a hard stiffs calyx, 
such as “Hyakume” shed much more than those with shallow cavity and thin more pliable calyx like “Tane-nashi.” I fre¬ 
quently have “Hyakume” trees which after setting thousands of fruits, shed them all, while the “Tane-nashi” bears a fair crop. The preliminary shedding just after the fruit is formed is common to most deciduous trees that habitually set more fruit than they could possibly bear. 
It is not to this that I refer, but to the con¬ 
tinuous dropping that takes place after¬ 
wards during the growing season right up to the time the fruit is mature. After 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


65 


shedding it will be found that the stem and calyx is always left on the tree, 01 
in other words; separation takes place only between the fruit and calyx. In the deep cavitied kinds the calyx will always be seen to be dragged down into the cavity before the shedding occurs. My theory therefore, is, that the strain produced by the resistance of a very hard calyx against being dragged into the narrow, deep cavity, tears the fruit off. Whether this solution of the mystery is correct or not, I 
am not prepared to say, but after several years of close observation, it is the only one I have been able to arrive at and it is borne out by the following reasons: 

1. The deep cavitied and hard calyx- 
ed kinds shed most. 

2. Any' sudden stimulus, such as a heavy rain, or an application of com¬ 
mercial fertilizers, causing a rapid ex¬ 
pansion of the fruit is immediately fol¬ 
lowed by greatly increased shedding, and 

3. A sickly or unhealthy tree on which the fruit makes slow growth will in¬ 
variably hold a full crop and vice-versa a very vigorous tree will strip itself of every specimen. 

It is for the above reasons that I aban¬ 
doned the use of fertilizers on my trees. 
If applied at all it should only be done during the winter, so as to give the stimu¬ 
lus time to abate before the fruit is set. 

The Hyakume has a peculiarity—a good one too—that I have never seen in any other fruit tree. The larger the crop on the tree, the greater the size of the fruit, 
and, on the other hand, where a tree has only one or two specimens^ they are usual¬ 
ly under the average size. 

Regarding picking, packing and mark¬ 
eting fruit must be clipped from the tree like oranges, and should be fairly well coloredbut still quite hard. A suitable pack¬ 


age is hard to find, as the fruit varies so much in size. When possible, the six basket carriers should be used, and are best liked by the trade, but some of the fruit runs so large that more than two or three cannot be packed in the four quart basket used in these crates. For fruit of that size I use the crate without the baskets or sometimes the square cucumber crate. 
Fruit should be wrapped and in each crate 
I always put about a dozen copies of plainly printed instructions as to using the fruit only when perfectly ripe. These in¬ 
structions I now have printed on paper bags, which the retailer can use in de¬ 
livering the fruit to his customers. 

Japanese persimmons are slowly mak¬ 
ing headway in Northern markets. New 
York taking them a little more freely than other places, but the demand is still very limited and large plantings would easily glut the markets. In London, England they are coming into considerable favor and one small shipment I made there by express, sold well, but the express rate was prohibitive. The following season 
I shipped fifty crates, in two lots, by freight, and they arrived in bad or¬ 
der which can only have been due to bad handling on the Atlantic steamships as 
1 kept samples of both lots here, till two weeks after the bulk had arrived in Lon¬ 
don, and they were still in perfect condi¬ 
tion, though packed the same as the others and kept in our ordinary September tem¬ 
perature. I can see no reason why per¬ 
simmons, should require refrigeration, 
even on such a long trip. Moderately good ventilation would probably be far better. Specimens will keep for several weeks while the temperature is still in the seventies and eighties. 

A point in favor of the Japanese per¬ 
simmon is, that it will exist and thrive on 


5

flat-woods land underlaid with hard-pan, 
where other fruit trees fail. 

Their handsome appearance is another great recommendation. An orchard when in full leaf, outshines in beauty, even the far-famed orange grove. 


I believe I have covered most of the points necessary to a grower, but I will be pleased to answer questions, or give any information in my possession either now or by correspondence with anyone who is interested. 


Report of Committee on Vegetables. 


By C* G* White* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Hastings is in the last quarter of ship¬ 
ping a one-hundred thousand barrel crop of potatoes. The biggest day’s shipment reached over thirty-nine cars, all heavily loaded. 

It has been a season of big yields and low prices. Prices have been kept no worse than they are by the distribution of our association. The potato crop in this state is too large to be dumped into the North hit or miss fashion. Every barrel that leaves the state should have its proper destination and must have if the grower is to have the full reward of his labor and risk. 

It takes a big yield to pay expenses when New York prices are under four dollars a barrel. Two days last week the quotations touched three dollars. This price means a net return of about one dollar and a half per barrel as the crop runs, and requires a yield of sixty barrels to the acre to make five dollars profit. 
However, prices have so far run better than this, and the majority of the grow¬ 
ers will probably clear up even or better. 

There are many yields of fifty barrels 


and some of seventy and eighty. These are field runs, not favored corners, and are unusual with us. 

The railroad service has been bad. 
Day after day, when there were empty cars on an inaccessible track, hauling has had to stop to the demoralization of our working forces, and barrels have been piled up on the platform because all the cars on the switch were overloaded al¬ 
ready. Finally, these cars have gone forward at irregular times, and it was a lucky shipper that got his car out of 
Jacksonville short of twenty-four hours later than the time taken last year. The railway ^‘shares our prosperity” as the of¬ 
ficials put it, at the rate of sixteen cents per barrel to Jacksonville. 

The potato methods are much the same as of old. An effective machine dig¬ 
ger is much needed. And another rail¬ 
road. 

Late blight made its general appear¬ 
ance too late to be of material damage to the yield, and the resulting rot has not set in because weather conditions have have not been suitable for its develop¬ 
ment in that way.

So there are many people claiming that it is useless to spray. Some that have sprayed will spray more efficiently next year than this. 

Prof. Conner has just dug some suc¬ 
cessful experiments with fertilizers and varieties. Prof. Rolfs is conducting for the government a test of fifty-one for¬ 
eign varieties, hoping to find a disease resistant variety on which to build a new and healthy sort. The foliage on some of these varieties is immense and peculiar. 


One or two varieties cost large sums. 
None of us wanted the responsibility of knowing which these are, for fear it would get out and the patches be raided. 
It is interesting to know that the Eu¬ 
ropean taste is for a yellow-fleshed po¬ 
tato. 

Concerning other vegetables I am not conversant, having but lately returned to the state. 

This is my busy time, or I should ap¬ 
pear with you at the meeting. 


Celery and Egg Plant Report. 


By F* C Armstrong* 


As the Florida State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety has placed me on the Standing 
Committee to make a report on vegeta¬ 
bles, I will confine my remarks to the growth, culture and marketing of celery and egg plants, only, thinking that my brother committeeman, Mr. C. G. 
White, of Hastings, would tell us how to cultivate, grow and dispose of the 
Irish j.otatO' to the best advantage and that Mr. E. V. Blackman of Miami, 
would give us the methods used on the 
East coast. 

Now, in Manatee county, we have thousands of acres of land well adapted to the culture of celery, it requiring a rich, moist loam for the best results. 

The culture of this crop bids fair to become one of the leading and staple crops in the county. We have been es¬ 
pecially favored by having had not 


enough cold to injure our crop or in marketing it. 

The seed of the celery is very small and delicate, requiring, when young and tender, to be protected by a framework to keep the young plants from being scorched by the hot rays of the sun. 

Seeds must be planted very shallow, 
beds must be kept wet daily, and other¬ 
wise properly cared for, that they may develop early and be good and thrifty plants. 

In setting plants we put about forty thousand plants to the acre, double rows, 
four or five feet apart, using from one to two' tons of best fertilizer to the acre according to the nature of the soil, which necessitates moist, well drained land. To insure a good crop we must have irri¬ 
gation, which can be had at a very small cost from artesian wells. 

The average crop per acre is about 




68 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


from five hundred tO' one thousand crates per acre; some instances going much higher. 

The plants must be boarded at a cer¬ 
tain growth and kept there till well bleached, and ready for market. It re¬ 
quires about thirty-two thousand feet of lumber per acre to board it properly. Af¬ 
ter the celery crop is marketed, the land is then followed by egg plant. In the meantime the seed of the egg plant has been placed in the hot beds and is now ready for transplanting. Here again ir¬ 
rigation is very desirable, although not absolutely necessary. The cultivation of the egg plant is much like the cultivation of any ordinary plant, move the soil fre¬ 
quently, and keep clear of grass and weeds. 

Urtider ordinary circumstances and con¬ 
ditions by May 15th the fruit is ready for 


shipment and continues till up to July, 
when the Jersy crop comes in. 

From six hundred to one thousand crates of egg plants are produced per acre with us. 

What we need most is a uniform pack¬ 
age for celery. As it stands now, we have three different sizes, one 12x18x22, and the Sandford 8x20x27 and one 10x20x25, 
this last, we think, should be the state standard. 

California uses standard barrel crates, 
and of course it is regulated through the association of that state, ar.d they have secured a rate which is equal to ours^ we having the small poney crate. 

I therefore, recommend that this as¬ 
sociation take some action looking to the procuring of a standard crat:, and that a better and more equal freight rate be obtained. 


Vegetable Report from East Coast* 


By Mr. Blackman. 


Mr. President, as a member of the com¬ 
mittee on vegetables, I will submit an in¬ 
formal verbal report from my section of the state, the lower East Coast. Taking it all in all, we have had a most success¬ 
ful season in our section of the state, the truck growers in better condition gen¬ 
erally, and have gotten more for their truck than ever before in the history of the lower East Coast section. Mr. 
President, I desire to emphasize this great and important subject, the import¬ 
ance of the vegetable traffic in this state 


It is, or it ought to be, a matter of com¬ 
mon knowledge that the truck industry of Florida is the greatest industry in the state. It is, or ought to be, a matter of common knowledge that the truck in¬ 
dustry of Florida amounts to a great deal more than all of the citrus fruit crops combined. Vegetables are the staple products of Florida, and an industry that should receive at all times the highest consideration and attention. I could, Mr. 
President, give you instances of enor¬ 
mous yields and fancy prices for this sea-

son’s vegetable and truck crop from our section of the state. This traffic is taken from our section of the state by the train¬ 
load, to say nothing of the other sec¬ 
tions. The tomatO' crop this season has been the best in the history of that sec¬ 
tion and tomato growers as a rule have made lots and cords of money. There has also been good money made in Irish potatoes. I recall one notable instance where a trucker made nearly $2,000 from his Irish potato patch. Altogether, the lower East Coast country has enjoyed an unprecedented season in the vegeta¬ 
ble business. Of course, the early cold snap set ?ome of the truckers back but replanting soon recuperated them and 


they got their crops to market ahead of everything else, and sold at good prices. 

I would particularly call the attention of the society ^r-nd the truck growers of the state to the Bermuda onion. It was . 
at one time thought that this onion could not be grown successfully in Florida. 
This is a great fallacy, as has been de¬ 
monstrated by later experiments with this crop, especially with last season’s crop. 

It was also contended that it would com¬ 
pete with the Bermuda crop and this has also been dispelled. The onion thrives well on the lower East Coast. It gets to market before the Bermuda crop of the 
Bermuda Island and is a big money maker. 


Report of Committee on Ornamentals. 


By Mrs. C. T. McCarty. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In our school days, long ago—so long ago that I dread counting the years which have since passed—we learned that one proof of man’s superiority over all other animals lies in his ability to rise above the limitations of locality. To the far ends of the earth, north, south, 
east and west, he reaches out, and brings unto himself, what is called for, either by his fancy or by his complex needs. Look¬ 
ing about with a critical eye he grasps the suggested possibilities of nature and turns the knowledge to his own account; 
he sees on one hand a scarcity which he makes abundance; on the other a su¬ 


perfluity which he modifies. He, of course, puts forth the greater effort for material return, but at the same time la¬ 
bors, faithfully and continuously to ex¬ 
press, in an alliance with Nature, the artist love, in-born in human hearts; that desire to create “a fairer creation than we know,” 
to omit the prose, the details of nature and produce the spirit and splendor. 

It has been truly said that “he who knows the most, he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the waters, the plants, * * and how to come at these enchantments—is the rich and royal man. Only so far as the masters of the world have called in Nature to

their aid, can they reach the height of magnificence. This is the meaning of their hanging gardens, villas, garden- 
houses, islands, parks.” 

Before us in this fair southland, lie stretched out upon all sides, materials for attaining easily to a degree of that mag¬ 
nificence, for which these masters have struggled. It is my privilege to speak to you concerning certain of these materi¬ 
als, and to lay before you such facts as a non-professional can glean from the ups and downs of several years’ experi¬ 
ence with ornamentals. What I have to offer may not be new to you, neither may it seem of value, but if such be the case 
I can only comfort myself with the say¬ 
ing of Daniel Webster, that “What is valuable is not new, and what is new is not valuable.” The territory concern¬ 
ing which I speak lies on the west side of 
Indian River from Wabasso on the north, to Palm Beach on the south. Oth¬ 
er localities will be covered by other pa¬ 
pers, and moreover I wish to be quite certain of my statements, that my words may carry conviction, as did those of the old German who invariably clinched every argument with the emphatic re¬ 
mark : “I knows vot I knows, und dats vot I knows.” 

I shall also call things by their good, 
common, every-day names, not, of course, that I may be the more readily understood, but that I may save myself some embarrassment. The foundation for all successful ornamentation is, of course, grass, and it is a very difficult foundation to lay. For the grass goes, 
“creeping, creeping, everywhere,” ex¬ 
cept in Florida. Here it must be coaxed, 
pushed, and carefully nurtured, and then perhaps it may not creep far. I can with the clearest conscience, recommend St. 


Augustine grass. It grows readily in shade as well as sun, is a brilliant green all the year, and makes a velvety sod when close-cropped. Can be cut with a lawn-mower. St. Lucie grass is a finer bladed grass, but is much shorter lived. 
Of Bermuda grass I will not speak, be¬ 
cause I am peaceably inclined, and know full well the war-like possibilities of the 
Bermuda grass question. No doubt there are some among you who fully catch my meaning when I say that there is always doubt, when you plant Ber¬ 
muda grass, as to whether you have the grass or the grass has you. 

# 

Passing on to the fencing-in of the grass covered lawn, nothing is prettier than a well-kept hedge. If you want a low, thick, square-trimmed hedge, you will find satisfaction in the Amoor River 
Privet. It stands, untouched, a tem¬ 
perature of 24 degrees above zero, is evergreen and grows rapidly. It can be planted in single or double rows, 
plants being from 12 to 18 inches apart. 
The time for planting is between No¬ 
vember 1st and February ist. The hedge must be worked in spring and fall, 
and orange tree manure used for fer¬ 
tilizing. Some good results have been obtained with Arborvitae, but it is of slow growth, and while, according to 
Longfellow, “patience is powerful,” it is not equal to an arborvitae hedge in 
Florida. 

A row of Philanthus, bright-hued and graceful, is good to look upon, but it is with you today and gone tomorrow, if the thermometer takes a tumble in the night. Bignonia, sometimes despised be¬ 
cause of its cheerful contentment under all sorts of conditions, can be made effec¬ 
tive either in clumps, or trained over a frame to form a hedge or screet\ its bright scarlet flowers smiling from their

background of dark green leaves, all the year round. 

For windbreak, or tall hedge pur¬ 
poses, the camphor tree is a friend in¬ 
deed, while, grown apart, and trimmed to tree shape, it is a joy forever, because it is a thing of great beauty. The ocean winds can not blast it, nor the cold, such as we have, shrivel it. It grows in poor soil, not even disdaining our white sand, 
which some say is no soil at all. It is neither a great eater nor a great drinker, 
and is graceful, glossy, and evergreen and moreover can more than pay its way by furnishing the camphor of com¬ 
merce. 

Mango and avocado pear trees can be made to please the eye as well as tempt the palate. Both can be raised from seed, 
provided you plant the proper end of the seed down, the pear preferring to stand where planted, the mango yielding more gracefully to change of location. 
Both can get along without fertilizer, 
but they do eat when they are able to dine with friends, the mango preferring to eat with the pineapples, the pear lik¬ 
ing better the fare of the orange trees. 
Neither tree can stand our cold weather, 
so when your thermometer has registered 
24 degrees and the “eager and nipping air” has been “biting shrewdly” take your little saw and go out and saw off your mangoes and “alligator” pear trees 
—short—if you ever want to see them again. ^ 

Judging from the frequent recurrence of the name Royal Poinciana in Florida geography and literature generally, the outsider might reasonably expect to find this famous tree as plentiful as golden rod. But the fact is, that while many are planted, but few are seen, in the gorgeous perfection possible to the tree. 
The Royal Poinciana is hedged about with enemies. The cold is fatal to it. In 


1895 I a tree having a trunk twelve inches in diameter and a spread of six¬ 
ty feet, go down in a temperature of 28 
degrees; and while a temperature of 28 
degrees is rare, the winds we have al¬ 
ways with us, and a strong wind makes a Royal Poinciana tree look like “Polly after her celebrated tussle with the monkey. The Dwarf Poinciana is less of a trial than its Royal kinsman, yet carries much of the family beauty. It reaches the height of twelve feet, and, 
planted in a hedge or in a circle, with the red and yellow alternating, produces a truly gorgeous effect. An every-day acquaintance which can be used with tell¬ 
ing results is the Kumquat. It is hardy and grows rapidly, and in two years’ 
time its glossy foliage will be dotted here and there with those miniature oranges which never fail to elicit admiration and arouse curiosity. 

Palms, of course, are the distinctive and characteristic glory of this section, 
and the natural impulse is, to plant them in profusion regardless of everything but the dictates of fancy. This is es¬ 
pecially the case among those who are fresh from the land where a palm is a possibility only to the millionaire or the florist. My advice to palm enthusiasts who are just starting on their mad ca¬ 
reer is this: “Stick to palmettoes, date palms and sago palms.” If, in this latitude you rely upon cocoanuts, royal palms, 
and other fancy varieties, for yard ef¬ 
fects, some real cold, wintry day will leave you with nothing of beauty where¬ 
on to rest your eye, after it tires of con¬ 
templating the frozen emptiness of your * 
pocketbook.

seen, in true Japanese relief, against a clear green-blue, western, evening sky. 
Toward this corner your glance will of¬ 
ten stray. The bamboo can be rooted from cuttings, buried about two inches beneath the surface of the ground, in the month of Januai*y. But, as you value your bamboo corner, don’t let it have one dry moment for two years. 

Like the children, I have kept for the last the best of all the game, and in closing will say a few words concern¬ 
ing my favorite ornamental—the rose. 

Queen of the garden, she is yet with¬ 
in reach of all, for any one who has a pump can have at least half a dozen vigorous, flowering rose bushes. That is, provided the pump is united with muscle, patience and a high resolve to rise above the pleasantries of an unbe¬ 
lieving family. I have had roses on my breakfast table for fifteen years, dur¬ 
ing the greater part of which time they were the result of the aforesaid combina¬ 
tion of pump and patience. 

A rose bed 9x14 feet will hold ten bushes and do well. In preparing the bed, first dig out the earth to a depth of from 2 1-2 to 3 feet. Over the bot¬ 
tom of this excavation lay a floor of old boards; fill in above this, for two- 
thirds of the depth, a mixture of old chips and leaf mold; then finish with about one foot of well rotted stable ma¬ 
nure and sand mixed. Soak down thor¬ 
oughly. 

The best time for planting is Decem¬ 
ber. I have never lost a plant set out in this month. 

Never let the rose bed get dry and hard, yet do not keep too wet. Re¬ 
member that one soaking is better than a dozen sprinkles, and, when bushes are well established, one weekly soaking is better than seven soakings. 

I always set out two-year-old budded 


roses. Some of my friends prefer roses grown on their own roots. We do not argue the question—I just keep on pick¬ 
ing roses! 

Once a month I give my 9x14 foot bed eight quarts of hard wood ashes. 
Once every month I also give two tablespoonfuls of Painter’s Special Rose fertilizer, to each bush, working it care¬ 
fully into the soil and wetting down well. Once a year, in the fall, I cover the bed with a 3-inch mulching of to¬ 
bacco stems, bought by the bale. In picking the flowers cut every rose stem so as to leave one leaf next the parent stem from which the flower stalk has sprung. Leave one leaf, not more and not less. Then the new growth comes quickly, and new growth, with roses, 
means flowers. There are no pests, in particular, to be feared, but there is no harm in an annual spraying with either water and whale oil soap, or water and pearline, using one package of pearline to ten gallons of water. Generally speak¬ 
ing, tea-roses give the best satisfaction; 
that is, they bloom most continuously, 
in this climate, though certain others, 
such as Chromatella and Clothilde 
Soupert can always be depended upon. 
The following list comprises the names of those roses which I hold as ‘^tried and true

Report of Mrs* P* H. Rolfs* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In selecting a subject, for the paper in hand I have not been as partial to the 
East Coast of Florida as were the gentle¬ 
men who made up the program for this meeting when they selected the entire committee on ornamentals from among the East Coast members, but will briefly mention a few plants that can be success¬ 
fully grown in any part of the state. 

Angelonia Gardner!, Hook. 

This plant is generally, but incorrectly, 
known in the trade catalogues as An¬ 
gelonia grandiflora. Although there is a species, Angelonia grandiflora, this is quite rare. The plant has been in cultiva¬ 
tion for many years in the green-houses of the North, and has, to a limited extent, 
been introduced to the South, especially in 
Florida. Its original home is in South 
America. In the green-houses of the 


North it is planted out in pots and then placed on benches, where it blooms con¬ 
tinuously and profusely. 

I wish, however, to speak of this plant more especially as a border plant, and bed¬ 
ding plant for outdoor work in our state. 
It is one of the hardy and very promising recent acquisitions that will come into general favor very rapidly. It is unusual¬ 
ly free from disease and stands all diffi¬ 
culties which ordinarily surround decora¬ 
tive plants remarkably well. The color of the flowers is dark purple with white spots in the throat. This makes it a very hand¬ 
some, attractive bedder. It blooms pro¬ 
fusely, and rarely attains a size higher than a foot or eighteen inches. It is bet¬ 
ter, however, to keep it cut back so as to have it from eight inches to a foot high. 
Side shoots are constantly being pro¬ 
duced, from which new flower spikes are thrown in.

Propagation.. 

Where plants can be secured from some other bed or by purchase, it is better to get them in this way. If this is not practica¬ 
ble, seed may be obtained from reliable seedsmen at about twenty-five cents a package. The difficulty in securing plants in this way is that which usually befalls seedlings, especially when planted in a small way. If one has merely a package of seed, these are often placed in flower pots, carefully attended and watered for a few days, and possibly before one knows they are over watered, and the soil be¬ 
comes water-logged. Then again, in the busy rush of the ordinary day, with fruit growers, there will be some days when the seed are forgotten. By the time one re¬ 
turns, the seed bed will be found as dry as sawdust. Even if the seed should not really be overlooked or forgotten, when the seedlings come up there is always the constant danger of damping off. All of these difficulties are avoided by securing large plants, which can be set directly into the bed. 

By taking cuttings from a hardened wood, they may be struck and grown from cuttings. A much more preferable way, however, is to divide the old plants. 
In this way little difficulty is experienced in securing a good start. 

Planting in Beds. 

In preparing a bed it should be thoroughly worked over and a generous supply of compost spaded in. There is really no danger of getting too much of it, or too much vegetable matter into the bed. After this has been thoroughly in¬ 
corporated into the soil, it is well to wet it down, so that every particle of it is thoroughly soaked. The ground ma} 
then be firmed down by treading over the 


bed, and left for some time, possibly ten days to two weeks. This will give the fertilizer in the compost an opportunity to become thoroughly incorporated with the soil, and avoid the danger of scalding the roots. The top of the bed at the end of this time can be worked over with a garden rake or small tool, and the plants set into place. If abundance of plants arc on hand they may be set in rows six to ten inches apart. If one has but few plants, 
they may be set a foot, or even two feet, 
apart. Then as the bushes grow large they may be divided and the spaces be¬ 
tween filled in. 

During extremely dry weather it is de¬ 
sirable to give themi an application of water once a week, or at intervals as the bed becomes somewhat dry. 

Protection of the Bed. 

This plant is of unusual interest to us because it will stand slight cold weather. 
It has been known to pass, practically un¬ 
injured, through thirty degrees Fahren¬ 
heit. Where there is danger of the cold becoming more severe than this it is necessary to provide some protection. 
This would be especially so in northern, 
middle, and western Florida. The pro¬ 
tection can be given by banking the soil about the plants to a considerable height, 
so that a large number of the lower buds are underground. Then during severe cold weather, a covering of straw mat. or with straw will tide them over the severe weather. In central and south Florida the plants will need protection onl}'^ rarely if at all. 

This plant begins blooming very early, 
even when only a few inches high, and from that time on it continues without in¬ 
termission until the beds are exhausted which may be a year, or even longer. For 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

this reason a bed of Angelonia Gardneri is always a beautiful sight. 

Hibiscus (Hibiscus Rosa Sinensis Linn). 

There are a number of varieties belong¬ 
ing to this species, the single flowered, 
double flowered, pink, magenta, salmon- 
colored, and even nearly white. In some cases the foliage is variously mottled, in others the corolla is of varied shapes. To the average fruit growers in Florida only a few of these varieties are known. They are all, however, equally decorative and equally easily grown. Cuttings of ma¬ 
ture wood strike very readily so that they may be propagated in endless numbers. 

I wish particularly to call attention to one fact that is very generally overlooked by people who live north of South Florida, 
and that is that it is quite as easy to have these beautiful blooming plants in the dooryard during the summer months as many of the other forms, such as geraniums, fuchsias, etc. The difficulty has been that they have not been consider¬ 
ed pot plants, consequently after growing during the summer, they have been allow¬ 
ed to freeze in fall. On the other hand, 
those who have considered them pot plants have not been aware of the fact that they may be set out of doors during the summer time, and then taken back to cover for protection duriqg the winter. This is a point I wish to bring out especially. The 
Hibiscus plants should be grown in large pots, say about eight or ten inch ones. 
These pots are then set out in summer, 
‘‘plunged,’’ as the gardeners say, and the pots covered with garden soil so as to pro¬ 
tect them from being broken, and to hide their unsightliness. The Hibiscus will then grow and bloom profusely during the summer. It will do no particular harm for the roots to run through the bot¬ 


tom or over the sides of the pots. In the fall when there is danger of frost or freez¬ 
ing weather, the pots with the plants in them should be lifted and the plants cut back to within a foot or two, and then placed in a moderately dry house. Here the plants need but little protection. They should be watered sparingly, but not per¬ 
mitted to dry out. Then as soon as the danger of freezing is past, the pots can be plunged again in the bed, and the plants will go merrily on blooming as before. 
When the next winter comes the same operation may be repeated. 

The Hibiscus which is usually called the Chinese Hibiscus, that is Hibiscus 
SchizopetelouSj is grown to a very large extent in pots throughout northern and central Florida. It requires a great deal of petting and many times as much care as the common Hibiscus, and does not give one-tenth of the return in bloom and pleasure. 

I would not be loyal to my home place, 
Palmhurst, did I not include palms in this paper. 

Palms. 

Biologically speaking, the palm trees are among the highest of the plant crea¬ 
tions. They are, likewise, the most beau¬ 
tiful and aesthetic of plants. A fine palm adds more value to the selling price of a place than an}^ other single tree, not ex¬ 
cepting the fruit-bearing ones. Of course we should not expect a grove of palm trees to sell for the same price as a grove of grape fruit trees. A reasonable number of palm trees, however, distributed at the proper locations about the home place, 
adds immensely to the desirability of the location. In fact, very few palms come to their grandest stature before twenty-five to fifty years of age. They, however. 


76 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


show off remarkably well at four or five years old, and at ten or fifteen years of age they will cause many a passer-by to wish that he ^‘owned that tree.’' 

The difficulty heretofore experienced in planting palm trees has been that we have not known just what to select, nor how to set them out after they have been selected. We are apt to treat a palm tree very much as we would a jardiniere of ferns, that is, sticking it in some house corner where it can get only a peep of sun¬ 
light now and then. The palms about which I wish to speak later are such as can stand the full glare of the sun without injury; they can be left out in the most tempestuous winds that we have; they can stand months of neglect, and come out smiling from this course of treatment. 
Like every other cultivated specimen, 
they, however, take very good naturedly to kiifd treatment. They differ from most trees in that the position of their leaves permits the free circulation of air, and the broad leaved, fan palms afford a good and cool shade. 

With all these good qualities they have the still further excellent ones of being remarkably free from fungus and insect attacks. In addition to this, they do not harbor ^that most annoying pest with which we have to deal at times, the Flori¬ 
da mosquito. 

In setting out these trees due regard should be had for the landscape effect. 
One of these trees when once set out is almost never transplanted. Not that they are so exceedingly difficult to transplant, 
but their beauty being once realized, they are so valued that no one has the courage to hazard the chance of losing a fine speci¬ 
men. If the trees are planted with a view of avenue setting, they should be placed far enouo'h back from the road to allow a 


full development of the leaves without the necessity of cutting back. For planting about the door yard or open lawn due re¬ 
gard should be had for the point of view, 
so that when these have grown to be tall trees the view may not be obstructed. The contour of a piece of land should also be had in mind, and the general character of the trees and other ornamentals about the door yard. 

In discussing these trees I have confined myself to a very limited number, and have taken those that will be perfectly hardy in all parts of the State. A few nice plants of hardy species, well selected, 
will be found more pleasing than a great variety jumbled together in a sort of horticultural museum. 

The three palms that I wish to consider are able to withstand freezing tempera¬ 
tures, and live out of doors on the Atlantic coast as far north as Charleston, and on the Gulf coast to New Orleans. Conse¬ 
quently, every land owner in the state of 
Florida should have one or more of each of these palms in his possession. 

In general it may be said that palms need an abundance of sunshine, and an abundance of fertile soil although they will thrive remarkably well on sandy soils that have been moderately fertilized. 

Cabbage Palmetto (Sabal Palmetto.) 
—^^I mention this one first because it is a native. And here I may be permitted to digress a moment and preach a curtain lecture on the fact that we do not ap¬ 
preciate our native decorative plants suffix ciently. We have in our flora many speci¬ 
mens which make the handsomest of decorative specimens, but simply over¬ 
look them and cast about us for something that has been imported from distant and little known lands. I see that illustrated constantly at my own home, where many 



THE PALMETTO AS A STREET TREE. 












FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


native decorative plants grow in pro¬ 
fusion, and our visitors pass these by without any particular attention or com¬ 
mendatory remark. We are growing here, also, quite abundantly, a plant known as Australian pine, although it is not a pine at all. It, however, in a way resembles that group of trees. It is a straight, ugly, sprawling tree that scarce¬ 
ly throws a shadow, and litters the ground with needles, and when it is done littering the ground with needles, it scat¬ 
ters the cones or burrs all over the ground. This tree, because of its want of decorative qualities, intrudes upon our vision constantly, and because it happens to be from Australia, it elicits many com¬ 
mendatory remarks. 

The Cabbage Palmetto has been used to some extent, but not at all sufficiently, as a decorative plant for avenues and for the home grounds. Sometimes transplanting has not proved successful, in other cases the transplanting has been uniformly so. 
It is one of the handsomest trees that can • 
be used for avenue planting. It will stand an unusual amount of abuse after it has once been established, and has been put to all sorts of purposes, such as a hitching post for horses, stringing telephone and telegraph wires, and various other barbarisms that might be perpetrated upon it. Properly cared for it casts a very delightful shade and is always green. 

Trees of this species can be obtained everywhere in the state of Florida. The most certain way of transplanting them is to prepare for transplanting six months or a year in advance. The tree being chosen that is to be transplanted, the laborer is in¬ 
structed to cut away all the roots on one side of it, so as to sever about one-half of them, permitting those on the other side to remain unharmed. In the course 


77 ‘ 

of six months numerous new roots will be formed on the side where the old ones have been cut. Those on the other side may then be cut, and the tree transplant¬ 
ed. At the time of transplanting it is well to remove all of the foliage, leaving only the bud leaves. 

The best size for setting out is one with a trunk only a few feet tall. A great many cities and individuals make the mistake of transplanting trees that have a trunk of twelve or fourteen feet. When this is done the tree has become pretty well set in its habits, and it fails to produce as fine a top as a small tree would. When a small one is planted it adapts itself to the sur¬ 
roundings^ much more quicklj, and large leaves and longer petioles are produced. 

In preparing the place for one of these trees it is well to use as much well rotted compost as your conscience will permit, 
and then have some one else come and add as much more. 

George Wa^ington Palm {Neozvashr- 
ingtonia Mifera.) —This palm is known by various common names other than the one given above. Among them are Cali¬ 
fornia Thread Palm, Weeping Palm, etc. 

Even scientifically it is not always call¬ 
ed by the same name. In nurserymen’s catalogues it is usually listed as Prichardia dlifera. Bailey’s Cyclopedia calls it 
Washingtonia illifera. It is a native of 
California, where it is one of the most striking and characteristic of trees. In 
Florida it grows remarkably well for an introduced species. It is especially desir¬ 
able from the fact that it will stand severe cold. Fine specimens of this species may be seen in Charleston, S. C., and in New 
Orleans, La. It, therefore, goes without questioning that it will survive any degree of cold which may be experienced in our state.

The photograph which I present here¬ 
with is taken from young specimens that are about six years old. These have been grown under fairly favorable condi¬ 
tions, but specimens fully as beautiful are produced in many other places, at the same age. From this it will be seen that this makes a very handsome ornamental very early in its history. When grown to full size its trunk reaches up to fifty or more feet. 

These plants can be obtained from nurserymen at so reasonable a cost that no one need be without several specimens. 
Small seedlings can be had at ten cents each, while large plants, showing charac¬ 
ter of leaves, cost only thirty-five cents each. It is, therefore, most desirable to secure the largest sized specimens and plant these out directly where they are to grow, so that they may become established and grow up with that portion of the door yard. 

They should be plantedjin a rich, moist place, where the leaves can have a spread of at least twenty-five feet. In planting palms most of us are apt to be a little nig¬ 
gardly about the space. This is probably due to the fact that we have been brought up to regard palms as conservatory plants, 
where we see these specimens in a pot- 
bound and dwarfed condition. 

Before setting out, the place where the plant is to stand should be dug out and a liberal quantity of compost or rich soil placed in the holes unless, indeed, the soil is already very fertile, as occurs in a few of the hammocks and along our water courses. 

When the plant has become thoroughly established, it should be regularly and lib¬ 
erally fertilized with a brand of good nursery tree fertilizer. As the foliage of these plants is the desirable portion, the 


fertilizer formula should be high in am¬ 
monia. Liberal applications of compost continue to be advantageous after the plant has become thoroughly established, 
and even after it has grown into a large tree. 

Canary Date Palm. 

This • palm is technically known as 
Phoenix Canariensis. I take the follow¬ 
ing quotation from Bailey’s Cyclopedia of 
Horticulture: Canariensis is the 

noblest of all Phoenixes, and one of the most majestic palms in cultivation. Its rate of growth is astonishing; a tree sup¬ 
posed to be only ten years old had a trunk four feet high, three feet in diameter at the base, with about one hundred leaves, 
forming a head twenty-five feet across. 
Another specimen of about the same size bore eight bunches of fruit, each weighing about fifty pounds.” This is one of the very best of the palm family for planting in the open lawn. When two or three feet high it begins to make a very pleasing and pleasant object, and never lessens in attractiveness. If the plant be well cared for and grown to its proper proportion it will increase in beauty from year to year, 
and we need have very little or no fear of losing it from the incursion of occasional frost or cold weather. 

This plant adapts itself remarkably well to the various locations in the state. Fine specimens of this species are growing on 
Cape Florida, open to the direct wind from the ocean, and only a few feet above the tide. In spite of the fact that the sea breezes constantly sweep across these plants they are always looking most heal¬ 
thy and beautiful. It has been reported that during the recent hurricane the sea water was driven entirely around the roots of these trees, and yet they show no 


79 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


signs of injury from the inundation. I 
learn also, from trustworthy sources, that 
President Taber has some fine specimens growing on his lawn. As Mr. Taber knows a good thing when he sees it and always secures his share of the good things as they come along, we should take a hint from his example. Specimens of this speicies are growing also on high, 
sandy land, which is ordinarily consider¬ 
ed to be very low in the elements necessary to plant food. In the pineapple belt of 
Florida we find these plants very frequent¬ 
ly used. It is probable, therefore, that there is no portion of the state in which they cannot be grown successfully and beautifully. 


Like all members of the palm family, it is particularly partial to locations with rich soil. When planted out it should be put in such a place that it can have a spread of at least thirty feet. Plants may be secured from nurserymen for twenty- 
five to fifty cents, each. These, when well treated, will soon be out of the way of the ordinary dangers that are apt to be met with on lawns or in front yards. The roots should be gil^en plenty of room to spread, and if the soil is not already fer¬ 
tile, an abundance of compost should be put in the hole before the tree is set out. 
After it has become thoroughly estab¬ 
lished, regular applications of a brand of good nursery fertilizer should be applied. 


. Report by George A* Purdy. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Having been requested to prepare a paper on Ornamentals fOr Florida, I 
have complied, though with some misgiv¬ 
ing as to my adequacy for a subject so wide in its scope and one which has al¬ 
ready been so ably treated in previous meetings. 

My actual horticultural education in this state having extended over but a few years and in one location, I shall not attempt to give any general account of ornamentals, but will only describe rny success or failure with a few shrubs and trees that I have experimented with on a very poor, sandy soil at Ormond Pe¬ 
ninsula. 

To you who have had years of experi¬ 
ence and success on fertile lands, these 


notes will sound trite and commonplace, 
but they may be suggestive to some who are wrestling with the problem of how to beautify their surroundings un¬ 
der adverse conditions. 

To' begin with roses: To make these grow with any vigor in such a location, 
I dig holes about four feet in diameter and two feet in depth. A floor of clayey, 
marsh mud is put down, building up on the sides with the same, giving the bush what may be described as a large clayey bowl to grow in. This is filled with a mixture of surface soil, marsh mud and well rotted barn or stable manure when available, or with any good all around fertilizer, the surrounding bowl keep¬ 
ing within reach of the roots much of what is apt to leach away on our light lands. Planted in this way and with

abundant water through droughty sea¬ 
sons, the bushes grow strongly with vig¬ 
orous foliage and bloom. 

Besides the usual insects, powerful enemies are the roots of the Live and 
Water Oaks. With some labor these have been measurably kept out by an¬ 
nually cutting a trench about the bowl, 
but this is an onerous task and some careless year I fear the roots will break in and strangle the ^roses. Therefore, 
plant roses many feet from any oak tree. 
I wish to say a word here for one of the most beautiful garden roses, one rarely seen in our Flopda gardens. Fortunes 
Yellow. There has been some confusion about its nomenclature. It is the fa¬ 
mous rose of Pasadena, California, that has long been the admiration of tourists, 
popularly, but erroneously called. Gold of Ophir, the* true Gold of Ophir being the old French rose, Ophirie, a more nearly perpetual bloomer but with com¬ 
paratively insignificant flowers. 

Fortunes Yellow is perhaps better known in California by its synonym. 
Beauty of Glazenwood, but by the law of priority the first name is entitled to precedence, this rose having been found and sent home from China in 1845 
Robert Fortune. It is of a pale yellow, 
shading into delicate salmon pink and quite unlike any other rose I am ac¬ 
quainted with. Unfortunately it is al¬ 
most deciduous in winter and it blossoms once a year, just as the Cherokee is go¬ 
ing off, but it makes such a unique and lovely display of color—for it is a pro¬ 
fuse bloomer—^that it is worth taking any reasonable amount of pains to pos¬ 
sess. 

Speaking of the Cherokee Rose, one of its seedlings, originating in Europe a few years since, is said to be a worthy companion for it. 


I only know of this novelty by hear¬ 
say, but Rosa sinica Anemone is de¬ 
scribed by the eminent rosarian, Edward 
Mawley, as promising to be even more beautiful than the Cherokee, being of a bright rose pink, unlike any other climb¬ 
er and, like its parent, a profuse bloom¬ 
er, of clean, strong foliage and a good grower. 

As to Conifers. We have had but lim¬ 
ited experience with these. The Deodar 
Cedar is said to grow well about Jack¬ 
sonville and would probably succeed at 
Ormond on good soil, planted on the usual sand, a tree lived for a few years, 
tried to look well, but finally starved to death. 

Cupressus Knightiana, a Mexican evergreen Cypress of vigorous growth and elegant habit, with drooping, fern¬ 
like, feathery branchlets and bluish- 
green foliage, grew about twenty-five feet high in ten years and looked well for a long time, but when cut down to make room for a building, showed signs of starvation. 

Cupressus excelsa, a Cypress native of the mountains of Guatemala, grew much the same way, but succumbed to the winter of ’94. 

Cupressus torulosa, a Himalayan Cy¬ 
press, grew rapidly but was finally starv¬ 
ed out. 

Cupressus funebris, an elegant, droop¬ 
ing Cypress from China, promised well, 
but gave out in a few years, probable cause, poor soil and perhaps cold snaps. 

We need for landscape effect in Flor¬ 
ida, a tall fastigiate tree like a Lombardy 
Poplar but evergreen, possibly Cupres¬ 
sus sempervirens, the Cypress of the 
Orient may serve our purpose. Those who have visited Mediterranean regions, 
or noticed pictures of Italian and oriental scenery will remember the stately effect

of these trees either isolated or in groves. A group of three, indifferently planted in poor soil at Ormond, only lived a few years, attaining a height of ten feet, but Prof. Nehrling of Gotha, 
Florida, informs me that he has several beautiful young specimens, perfect col¬ 
umns of dark green, the tallest of them at least twenty-five feet high. They re¬ 
quire good fertilization. 

Evidently a number of the evergreen cypress will grow well in Florida if plant- 
in good ground or soil made good. 

Retinosporas or Japan Cypress do not flourish, probably we are too far south. 

Oriental Arborvitaes, of which hand¬ 
some specimens may be seen in Jack¬ 
sonville parks and elsewhere, have grown well at Ormond on well prepared soil, es¬ 
pecially the variety known as Aurea 
Nana. Rosedale Arborvitae, said to be a hybrid of Retinospora and Oriental 
Arborvitae. Though planted in half shade, does no better with us than the 
Retinosporas. 

Some species of the genus Podocar- 
pus may do well in Florida. They are evergreen trees and shrubs, yewlike in their appearance. 

The late Edmund H. Hart, of Federal 
Point, had a fine specimen of the broad leaved Podocarpus. With its dark green foliage it was strikingly ornamental. He reported it as very hardy against sun and frost. Podocarpus Japonica and 
Podocarpus Koraensis were planted No¬ 
vember, 1903, at Ormond, in well pre¬ 
pared soil and partial shade. They have grown slowly but thriftily and look healthy and happy. 

Of evergreen shrubs, I have had ex¬ 
perience with but few and those quite well known. 

Pittosporum Tobira—the dark green and the variegated varieties grow well 
6 


with us as thoroughout the lower south, 
making the air heavy with fragrance the latter part of March and early April. 
A strong grower, the root area of a large bush extending fifty feet from the plant. 
It is perhaps our best exotic shrub, 
growing rampantly on a rather poor soil with Oaks in close proximity. 

Jasminum humile or revolutum from 
Northern India, puts forth its yellow fragrant blossoms early and often and grows well in spite of rabbits which gnaw the bark occasionally. 

Rhaphiolepis ovata. This Chinese shrub, with almost circular coriaceous leaves and white blossoms—not fragrant 
—blooms in March and April. It grows slowly but surely and promises well. 

Viburnum odoratissimum, makes a dense, compact bush, with leaves of a light, vivid green and white, fragrant flowers in April. A specimen growing here for many years was badly scorched in freezes of 94-5 but does not appear to have suffered since with plenty of clay in the soil it is one of our best ornamen¬ 
tals. 

Illicium anisatum or Anise Seed Tree, 
native of Japan, makes a tall, stately shrub with fragrant leaves of sassafras odor, the small saffron-colored blooms are not conspicuous. This shrub threat¬ 
ens to become naturalized, some speci- 
ments more than holding their own in the midst of oak scrub. 

Illicium Floridanum is mentioned in 
English publications as the finest and most showy of the Illiciums said to be a native of Florida, but I have never hap¬ 
pened to meet any one who^ had seen it. Prof. Nehrling had a fine specimen planted on the shore of Lake Audubon, 
but it was destroyed a few years since by overflow from the lake. 

Acacia Farnesiana, the well known 


82 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Popinac. As frequently seen this is a lanky, straggling little tree or bush, but if carefully pruned and stimulated with fertilizer, it may be made a very hand- 
*some small tree, suitable to overhang a footpath. Looking up from under the branches its delicate pinnate foliage, out¬ 
lined against the blue of the sky, has a fairylike effect. This effect is enhanced by its yellow flowerballs, which are not only very fragrant, but are put forth several times a year. In hard freezes the foliage will scorch, but it rapidly re¬ 
covers. We should make the most of this tree as it is absolutely the only one of the Acacias that thrives here. The long list which appeared in Reasoner’s first catalogue is now reduced to two or three. The famous Acacia dealbata of the South France, with masses of yellow bloom, will grow but poorly in Florida. 
At Federal Point, the late Mr. E. H. 
Hart had a specimen twenty-five feet high, but it never blossomed and nev¬ 
er seemed satisfied with its environment. 
It was finally lost. Acacias it is said will 


not grow in a calcareous soil. Lime seems to poison them. 

This paper has about reached the time limit and yet I have only briefly touched on a very few of the ornamentals for 
Florida. I have said nothing about the herbaceous perennials, annuals or bulbs, 
having had but little experience with them. The subject of Palms and other tropical and sub-tropical plant-life is a large one. Something has been learned as to the most suitable species or varie¬ 
ties since the time years ago when those earnest workers and pioneers in Florida ornamental horticulture, E. H. Hart and 
P. W. Reasoner, now passed on, and T. 
L. Mead, still with us, gave those admira¬ 
ble essays on Palms, Yuccas, Agaves and 
Bamboos. 

The interesting ‘‘message of the woods,” brought by President Taber, 
emphasizes the potentiality for beauty of our native flora. Prof. Nehrling on his estate at Gotha has demonstrated the value of indigenous shrubs and much mav yet be developed in this direction. 


Home Grown Products for the Table. 


By Mrs* H* H* Harvey. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

To one our state is a playground, to another a workshop, and again it is a haven of rest and recreation, where the soft winds, unlike any other on earth, 
soothe the tired nerves and give one that feeling of— 

“Nothing to do in'this world of ours 
Where weeds spring up with fairest flowers.” 


that we all get after the proverbial ten years that entitles us to the name Crack¬ 
er ; but to the homemaker who must pre¬ 
pare food three times a day for appetites whetted by the health-giving ozone of our fair state^—Florida is a reality. 

The tin can is sometimes a Godsend. 
Let’s not condemn it entirely, but let us see how much of a variety we can grow here, that with some careful preparation 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 



can be made food fit for an American to eat. Milk, butter and eggs with all their accessories are to be had here in abundance and the best the world af¬ 
fords. The sweet potato is at home with us; aside from the ordinary methods of preparation, we have the sweet potato pone and the sweet potato custard pie, 
so nearly like the far-famed pumpkin pie, we scarce need raise that vegetable. 

Cassava has many possibilities. Wash, 
peel, grate, wash in much water, 
use the coarse part for pudding, prepare the cassava the same way for griddle cakes, using only a small amount of flour, 
and it is a change to use one-half a cup of same in custard pie, using only two eggs instead of three. 

Then the starch that settles in pan, 
when it is washed, can be dried and used for starch and for flour; for light bread, 
one-third cassava flour and two-thirds wheat flour make a nice bread. 

Arrow root I am told can be used the same as cassava. 

Both rye and oats raised in Florida are parched and ground and used in the place of coffee to the entire satisfaction of many. 

The Yukon plant is raised and the leaves used for tea. 

The Jamaica sorrel grows to perfec¬ 
tion here. The calyx of the pods, when made into jelly, gives one of the finest products in this line. 

The kumquat, after being soaked over night in soda water, makes a delicious preserve jelly and marmalade, and cry¬ 
stallized it is much sought. 

The orange, the still unsolved problem in our state, is never so fine in any way as eaten fresh from the tree. Yet, there are a few months in the year when we can not have it fresh, hence we extract juice, 
bring to a boil and can. Oranges are 


nice preserved and jellied, and a marma¬ 
lade made of the juice and pulp is nice to eat with meats. A confection manufac¬ 
tured from the peel of either orange or grapefruit is relished by all. We must not omit the orange short cake and the orange pudding so nice in the orange season. Sliced oranges with pulp of grape¬ 
fruit and sugar an hour before serving, 
gives a toothsome sauce; then adding to this sauce sliced bananas and pineapples and grated cocoanut we have ambrosia that truly is a dish for an honest Ameri¬ 
can. A cup of grapefruit juice in a cus¬ 
tard for cake-filling is fine. The grape¬ 
fruit can be used in all ways we use the orange. 

The loquats (if the freeze don’t take them) are a great addition to the table, 
dried, preserved, canned with or without sugar they can be used for sauce, pies, 
short cake or jelly. 

The peach is largely raised and all know its possibilities. 

The Kelsey plums, peeled, halved and pitted can be canned so one can hardly tell them from peaches. 

And the sweet, wild plum is used in many ways with us. 

The fig grows in luxuriance in certain spots in our state and is much used for canning and preserving and the finest vinegar is made from the fig. Also yeast from the leaves. 

Three months of the year we can have the Kaki or Japan persimmon, smother¬ 
ed in sugar and cream for breakfast. 

Pineapples, we can preserve, make into marmalade and with the aid of yellow cattley guava juice make fine jelly; the peel washed and covered with slightly sweetened water will, in a day or two, 
be a refreshing drink that soothes but does not inebriate. The guava is so com- 


84 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


mon that we scarce need dwell upon its uses—jelly, paste, marmalade, etc. 

The Avocado pear for salads and again cooked a little and made into marmalade is highly prized by the cultivated taste. 

The citron we only preserve. 

Surinam cherries we can and jelly. 

The LeConte pear is canned, pre¬ 
served and dried here to quite an ex¬ 
tent. 

The grape grows in most healthy luxuriance, and could we but extermi¬ 
nate the mocking bird, bluejay and woodpecker we could grow the finest varieties such as Delaware, Concord, 
Brighton, etc., but the thick skinned scuppernong in several varieties gives us a chance for preserves and jellies and the juice of the grape brought to a boiling and sealed will keep indefinitely as a refreshing drink. 


Honey is largely produced in the state. 

Sugar and syrup from cane are manu¬ 
factured extensively. 

Bananas are raised to a limited extent 
(it is Jack frost who limits the extent) 
but we have enough for a delicious ba¬ 
nana pudding once in a while. 

The raising of strawberries is quite an industry in our section and who does not enjoy a strawberry short cake? 

Our subject as you see, is too' far- 
reaching—vegetables we have left for some one else tO' write about. 

We are indebted tO' Mrs. Chas. Lewis, 
of St. Petersburg, for suggestions re¬ 
garding fruits raised in that delightful part of the state. 

With many misgivings have we pre¬ 
pared these few notes. You know much that I have omitted, but if you kindly say ‘She hath done what she could,^’ we will feel repaid. 


DISCUSSION. 


(The discussion of Ornamentals was postponed to give way to the musicale tendered the society by the Ladies’ Fri¬ 
day Musicale and was taken up Thursday morning.—Secretary.) 

Mr. Blackman — I was particularly pleased with the postponement at our last evening’s session, of the further re¬ 
port and discussion of the report of the committee on ornamentals. The society is to be congratulated upon the able papers prepared with so much care and presented at this session on ornamentals. 
We have heard here a great deal on the strenuous side of the many questions and topics engaging our attention. It is just and fitting now that we should 


turn for a moment to the amenities of life, and to the ornamentation of our 

homes. I have been around over the state a great deal, and I am impelled to say and it is with much regret, that there is not enough attention paid to ornamentals. This committe deserves the thanks of this society for their en¬ 
deavor and work. It is a great work, a lovely, beautiful theme and a woman’s sphere. I am very much interested per¬ 
sonally, I may be pardoned for saying, 
for there is no greater pleasure at my own home than the morning’s stroll through my ornamental garden, where, 
in company with my wife and daughter, 
we gather morning after morning the lovely flowers, the mignonette for the

lapel of my coat, as I go to the busy cares of the day at my office, garlands for the vases of the festal hall and per¬ 
haps to the sick chamber of the invalid, 
carrying with them a fragrance and sen¬ 
timent that can not be expressed in words. It would be impossible for me to enumerate all of our lovely flowers or the ones most dear to us. We love them all, as their sweet fragrance is wafted from waving branch or clinging vine. Personally, however, I do not con¬ 
sider that the vine, at least in our sec¬ 
tion, should be encouraged near the dwelling, as I have found them to be an harbor for the mosquito. For this rea¬ 
son, I have set all of my vines at a dis¬ 
tance, ornamenting some old stump or tree for instance, on the lawn or away from the dwelling. Again, Mr. Presi¬ 
dent, permit me to say that the women of this committee are to be congratula¬ 
ted by the society for their unceasing, 
untiring work and achievement in or¬ 
namental lawn and garden work. 

Dr. Richardson—Mr. President, I can heartily second the sentiments of the gentleman for the lower East Coast. I 
do not think we pay half enough at¬ 
tention to the ornamentation of the home; the home is the haven of rest. In there we seek and enjoy the sweet com¬ 
panionship of wife, children and all of our loved ones. No time or money should be spared to make the home at¬ 
tractive, and there is no' surer way of doing this than the ornamentation of the garden and the lawn. The thanks of the society is due the women of this committee for their noble work. 

Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, this is a topic I am extremely interested in. I 
do not arise again to make any extended remarks, merely to say that we would very much like to hear from some of the 


85 

ladies present as this subject is one pe¬ 
culiarly their own. 

The President—The chair heartily en¬ 
dorses the sentiments expressed on the subject of ornamentals, and begs to assure the committee on ornamentals that their noble work is most heartily appreciated and endorsed, not only by this society but by the state at large as well. 

Mrs. Geo. S. Gates—Mr. President, on behalf of the women I can assure the so¬ 
ciety of our appreciation of the enconium 
On woman’s work as also at all times of your co-operation. I must say, how¬ 
ever, Mr. President, that I can not agree with the gentleman from Miami, Mr. 
Blackman, in regard to the ostracism of the vine. A vine is too near and dear to a woman’s heart as an ornamental, to be permitted to receive such treatment without a protest. (Applause and laughter.) 

I am president of a little village improve¬ 
ment society Welaka, Putnam county, 
and we have been for several years very much interested in the matter of shade trees. Our stand-by has been the Water Oak, but experience has shown that the Water Oak is a com¬ 
paratively short-lived tree. It is, in my judgment, best to transplant the Live 
Oak and Water Oak alternately, the Wa¬ 
ter Oak, which is the quickest growth, will give the quickest shade, later resigning in favor of the long-lived Live Oak which in 15 to 20 years will have become a thick spreading tree with a great gnarled future before it, under whose grateful shade and luxuriant foliage, festooned with great strands of waving Spanish moss, our great grandchildren may play upon the village green. The prere¬ 
quisite of the lawn is grass and shade. It is here again that I would urge the trans¬ 
planting of the Water Oak and the Live 




86 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Oak alternately, as suggested for the roadside and lane. Where there is a will there is a way. We have found the fol¬ 
lowing wild plants to give joy and grati¬ 
fication with small care. The Pawpaw a small bush, with greenish, poppy-like flowers transplanted in December and cared for and fed just a little will make a very showy plant especially in masses. 

The coral plant (local name) a spike of coral blossoms with beautiful ivy leaf-like foliage. 

A tall bush with blossoms like a lily of the valley sort of a huckleberry. 

Wax myrtle beautiful for an evergreen. 
Shrub or a mass of greenery to shut off some unsightly object. 

The beautiful Koontie a fern-like ever¬ 
green and many others with the treatment of the paw paw will at the expense of labor, make any abode a home. 

To insure this atmosphere in our towns and villages we must urge women to take up this question of ornamentals. Men have never, as a man studied beauty— 
it is a woman’s training to beautify and purify. You must have irrigation or you can not have flowers, and this is partic¬ 
ularly true of the thirsty, sandy soils of 
Florida, but it has truly been said that 
“Where there is a will there is a way.” 

Mrs. McCarty—Mr. President, I on¬ 
ly desire to be permitted tO' offer a word or two further upon this important work. 
1 most heartily endorse the sentiments of the speakers who have preceded me. 
Th is work is (as it has truly been said) 
woman’s work. It is woman’s sphere, 
and (while we appreciate the strenuous side of the question, as much as we ap¬ 
preciate the full larder and wherewithal to buy things) yet it is but a matter of 


right that we should have an occasional half-day of the hired man’s time to help us in the great work of beautifying our homes. I wish also to endorse the pro¬ 
test of Mrs. Gates against the banish¬ 
ment of the vine. Mr. President, the home is not complete without a vine. As to the objection to the vine urged by the gentleman from Miami, Mr. Blackman, 
that they harbor mosquitoes, I would say that I do not think the vine offers more of an abidin^'; place for mosquitoes than other shrubbery of the lawn or gar¬ 
den. They certainly do not at our home, 
for I have vines, and would not think of giving them up, and as for mosquitoes, 
we have them too, plenty of them, all sorts, sizes and conditions. Why, Mr. 
President, the mosquitoes we have are so large and so numerous that they '^sit on a log and bark, and many of them weigh a pound.” (Prolonged laughter and applause.) 

Member—How many? 

Mrs. McCarty—O, I don’t know; never counted them. They are there though, 
and all over the state for that matter, 
but do not think they are any more par¬ 
tial to a vine for an abiding place than other foliage. We could never think of giving up the vine as an ornamental. 

Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, I only desire a word— 

Dr. Richardson—Mr. President, I rise to a point of order. The gentleman is out of order. It is the parliamentary right of the committee to close the debate. 

Mr. Blackman—^Mr. President, I only desired to capitulate and get as good terms as possible. The committee has entwined the vine around me, and I am ready to surrender. (Laughter.) 


Peaches and Plums* 




By J* ?♦ Mace* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I make this attempt with a feeling of inability to say anything new or worthy of record, after all that has been said here¬ 
tofore in these meetings and printed in the transactions of the society on the sub¬ 
ject of Peaches, Pears and Plums. 

My experience with pears and plums is very limited indeed and what little I 
may have to say will apply almost entirely to peaches. In our section pears and plums are very uncertain, making a crop about once in three years. The Excelsior plum occasionally will do fairly well. I 
hope other memibers of the committee can give you more light on these fruits than I 
am able to do. 

Beginning away back in 1886, the year in which I set my first three hundred peach trees, I have been growing and shipping peaches ever since these trees tegan fruit¬ 
ing—some seasons quite profitably, others a failure on account of severe freeze kill¬ 
ing trees back to stump, or a late cold snap or heavy frost destroying the fruit. 

Peach growers have their troubles as well as orange growers. In our section last season, severe drought through May and June greatly reduced the crop. Fruit small, cutting prices much below the usual figures on this account. Root-knot, root- 
gall, borers and San Jose scale we have had to contend with regularly for the past few years. This season’s crop is not 


regular with us—many trees full, others enough, some light, a few none, perhaps due to January freeze. 

The warm month of March with good rains gave fruit a good send-off and at this writing (April loth) prospects are excellent for fine fruit. Young peach trees set in January of this year have start¬ 
ed off remarkably well. I am of the opinion that wider planting than is us¬ 
ually practiced is best. Most of my trees are set about 21x23 feet. The orchard set this winter I decided to try closer plant¬ 
ing, setting them 18x22 feet, always planting the wide way of the rows, east and west. When possible to get them, 
take standard sized trees, four to six feet, 
cut back to about twelve inches. Cut off all lateral roots to not over two inches. 
Set, if any change, a little deeper than grown in nursery in land well broken, if possible, sixty to ninety days before set¬ 
ting time. Frequent cultivation, with light applications of orange tree grade, or 
No. 2 Simon Pure Fertilizer from three- 
fourths to one pound at a time every six to eight weeks, or say five times fon the season. Keep all*but three to five sprouts rubbed off and, if season is favorable, you will have trees six to eight feet high and spread in proportion by the last of Novem¬ 
ber and these will be capable of giving you some fruit the following summer. I 
usually cut these young trees back from 



88 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


twelve to thirty inches the following win¬ 
ter, deciding by character of growth and shape of tree how much to cut back. The second season I usually make two applica¬ 
tions of fertilizer, in February and June. 
Cultivate land until June or beginning of rainy season, when middles may be allow¬ 
ed to grow beggarweed, keeping a good- 
sized circle hoed clean around trees. 

For the past two years I have been using pure kerosene oil for San Jose scale, 
applying with small hand or mist pumps. 
As I have only an occasional tree affected, 
I find this method effective. When prun¬ 
ing or digging out borers, the men carry one of these pumps along with other tools and where a jcaley tree or limb is found, 
use it. So far I have seen no bad effects from use of pure oil. 

Some trees affected with root- gall, I 
carefully cleaned out, cutting away badly affected parts, and sprayed with a very strong solution of Whale Oil Soap, just as heavy as it would work through the pumps, then put about two quarts un¬ 
leached hardwood ashes right about base of trees, where earth had been removed. 
This is an experiment. Present indica¬ 
tions look favorable, but too soon to arrive at a conclusion. 


I am growing principally BidwelFs 
Early, Suber, Maggie and Jewels, all early varieties. Have lately put out about two thousand trees of the new yellow varieties, 
such as Hall’s Yellow, Dorothy, Coope’s 
Golden Free and Hayward’s Rival, as an experiment for the Florida summer markets. 

Up to this time I have shipped by ex¬ 
press only. We hope to be able to try a few refrigerator cars this season. For best results much depends on careful han¬ 
dling and packing. One of the problems is to get careful and intelligent help for pickers. A peach that should be picked to-day, if left on the tree until tomorrow will be too ripe for northern markets. Or we may err in the other direction and pick too green. Peaches arriving without color, tough and but little flavor, go beg¬ 
ging and the grower will be fortunate if he gets back expense of picking, packing and shipping, to say nothing of the ex¬ 
penses of growing. 

I believe peach growing in Florida, if carefully looked after, when orchards are planted in suitable location, will prove to be fairly profitable. And I also have no doubt that new and better varieties will be developed in time. 


Report of Mr* H* Fred Hole. 


^Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I approach the subject of Peaches, 
Plums and Pears with a great deal of dif¬ 
fidence. So much has been written on them, and as the soil on which they are grown varies, so also vary the opinions as to their treatment. Therefore, before readingthis paper, I would like members to 


bear in mind that my remarks are not to be considered as an infallible guide for others in any respect, but are merely the results of observation taken from our own orchards and similar lands adjoining. 

We began growing peaches at Fulton on the lower St. John’s river four miles from the sea-coast, in the spring of 1897 
on moderately high Hammock land, 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

where the soil is of good sandy loam and rather dry, with a good proportion of humus, as the land was newly cleared for the purpose and trees were planted right away at a distance of 13 feet by 13 feet. 
An old five acre field was also planted in peaches—15 feet by 15 feet, and we con¬ 
sider this latter distance iDCst, giving more room for cultivation and fruit picking than the former and still having a large number of trees to the acre. This seems desirable as the profitable life of the peach tree does not often exceed seven years, if as long. We would advocate pushing the young trees along the first two years by thorough cultivation and careful, though liberal, fertilization. Varieties planted in our orchards were Jewel, Waldo, Angel, 
Pallas, Oviedo and Dwarf Japan Blood. 
Of these we have been most successful with the Jewel, Waldo and Oviedo and, 
in a lesser degree the Pallas. The Japan 
Blood and Angel varieties have draw- 
backs which will eliminate them from any further planting on our part. The only recommendations to the Japan Blood are its late blooming and early ripening, in other respects it is unsatisfactory, being shy bearer, of 10 per cent flavor and a bad shipper. As to the Angel, it is an early bloomer, courting disaster, without the compensating quality of early ripen¬ 
ing, of good flavor, but rather too acid to be a favorite on markets. 

With regard to cultivation of the bear¬ 
ing tree, our practice has been shallow plowing during late fall and clean cultivation during spring, and especial¬ 
ly during dry weather to conserve moisture, continued as long as pos¬ 
sible without knocking off the fruit. 
After that time orchards are allow¬ 
ed to go to crab-grass for hay and the trees rest, after picking, till fall. Of 


later years we have put off fertilizing, till safety of bloom has been assured, not be¬ 
cause we consider this the best treatment for the tree, but because in growing peach¬ 
es commercially one cannot afford to fer¬ 
tilize trees which will be unproductive that year, nor does it seem very necessary, as the trees are relieved, for that season, 
from the exhaustion consequent upon the production of a crop of fruit. The safety of the crop being reasonably certain, we have been accustomed to apply from five to ten pounds or more per tree of a well- 
balanced fertilizer. 

As to pruning, the young trees had a careful and somewhat heavy pruning of, 
say a quarter of a season’s growth, for two or three years. ^ After several bearing seasons, we found it advantage¬ 
ous to cut back the trees heavily, forcing them to make almost an entire new head. 
This temporarily reduces the crop of fruit, 
but the following season a much finer quality is produced and the profitable life of the tree thereby lengthened. 

The peach tre)e has about as many insect enemies and diseases as any fruit tree we know of and it unfortunately, 
seems to have a less vigorous constitution to resist disease than most of our com¬ 
mercial fruit, a peach-tree succumbing en¬ 
tirely, when the orange tree will exist for years in a more or less healthy condition. 
Some of these diseases can be easily man¬ 
aged, others are difficult. I will only men¬ 
tion three or four of the latter. San Jose 
Scale —In our case this was naturally ful¬ 
ly controlled by the orange colored 
Spharostilbe Cocophila, so we did not have to treat the trees. The crude oil treatment was very successfully used by 
Mr. Wm. Macklin of Dinsmore, nine miles north of Jacksonville. His orchards were on pine land. An extended report

of that treatment will be found in Bulletin 
No. 61, Florida Experiment Station, Lake 
City. 

Curculis —For this enemy we tried jarring'—without much benefit—then de¬ 
stroyed all stung fruit for two years, but gave that up, as not a large proportion' 
was stung and it did not appear to increase or diminish, though showing more on a light crop. 

Root knot —We have not been able to make much headway with this and so far it is only bad on land which has been crop¬ 
ped for years before planting with peaches. We have tried several remedies, 
but pruning and heavier fertilizing seem¬ 
ed to do most good, though not always ef¬ 
fective. 

Broim Rot is perhaps the most serious disease, interfering with commercial suc¬ 
cess. While we have not yet treated our trees for this disease, beyond destroying all affected fruit, what opportunities we have had of observing the results of the 
Bordeaux Spray lead us to believe that good results are not always to be relied on. 

A less commonly known fungus dis¬ 
ease, called by Professor H. Harold 
Hume, Clitocybe Parasitica, is worse still, 
as up to the present no cure for it is known. This disease is to be found in wild hammock, primarily on oaks of ma¬ 
ture growth, especially water-oaks. It is much more rarely found in old cleared hammock land. Its first appearance on peach trees might easily be mistaken for borers, as gum is seen exuding from the tree just above the ground. On examina¬ 
tion no borer is to be found, but from this ’ 
point downwards dead bark and wood are in evidence and lead to one or more roots which are discovered to be completely dead. The disease soon spreads to other 


roots and upwards into the trunk of the tree, the limbs being apparently the last to die. The tree appears to bleed to death from wounds caused by this disease. On our applying to the Lake City Experi¬ 
ment Station for a remedy. Professor 
Hume kindly came down to investigate. 
On examination of the roots of the diseas¬ 
ed trees he found the fungus and pro¬ 
nounced it to be Clitocybe Parasitica. He explained that it traveled from tree to tree underground, spreading from the ends of the roots of one to the root tips of an¬ 
other. He gave us no hope of successfully fighting this disease, owing to the diffi¬ 
culty of treating the roots. We found that taking the soil away from the infected part of the root-crown and removing dead roots, allowing the sun to dry it out, to¬ 
gether with heavy top-pruning, was some¬ 
times helpful, if it could be done in the fall and when the disease was not too far advanced. We have had instances of trees bearing some fruit after above treatment, 
which generally fails to mature and the tree succumbs to the disease. 

The peach requires very careful hand¬ 
ling to put it on the market in good con¬ 
dition, and too much care cannot be taken to avoid bruises. Good grading, neat packing and well filled crates are most es¬ 
sential, but with these conditions fulfilled, 
to get it to its destination in prime con¬ 
dition, owing to its bad keeping qualities 
(in some varieties more than others) also to picking season being often hot and rainy. This is the time when Brown Rot gives proof of its presence, no sign of it showing when the crate is being packed, 
yet twelve hours later under favorable conditions, most of the fruit will be found specked. The most careful handling of the crate is also most important and there is much to be desired in that respect after 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

the crate leaves the packing house. This however, is practically beyond the grow¬ 
er’s control and about all he can do is to take his medicine cheerfully. We have tried both express and refrigerator and do not find much difference to us. They both generally run a close race for the lion’s share of the proceeds. Mr. Chas. Ed¬ 
wards Russell’s article in the April num¬ 
ber of ‘‘Everybody’s Magazine” gives some interesting information on shipping peaches in refrigerator cars, which is es¬ 
pecially enlightening to the grower and is well worth his reading and considering. 

It does not appear that the peach crop will be heavy in our neighborhood this season. We account for it by the large 


amount of fall bloom last year and the presence of Thrip in the bloom this spring. 

In conclusion I would remark that the old idea of one crop of peaches in three years paying the grower is entirely ex¬ 
ploded and further that unless he can put fruit on an early market and get the best prices, he will find it a hard task to cover the expenses of growing and marketing them. Perhaps the latter is the worst to contend with, for then the fruit passes more or less out of the ordinary grower’s control and he must take what he can get. The fruit is moved very quick¬ 
ly, a good market will often go to pieces in a few hours and the grower is lucky if this does not happen to his heaviest and finest shipments. 


Fertilizers and Irrigation. 


By Df. Wm* C* Richardson. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The subject of fertilizers and irrigation are possibly the two most important mat¬ 
ters connected with horticultural pur¬ 
suits in the State of Florida. 

Some years since the writer made a visit to California and from obser\^ations of the field there, reached the conclusion that the California grower had to pay as much for irrigation, which was an absolute necessity, as the Florida grower had to pay for fertilizers. Since that time it has been found that for success and best results the 
California producer must fertilize, and 


the Florida producer must, in order to get the best returns, irrigate. 

It seems that the merest tyro needs only to keep his eyes and ears open to learn all about the subject of fertilization. The ubiquitous fertilizer expert and agent is ever ready and anxious to impart all and even more than can possibly be known on the subject. The writer has no desire or intention to belittle or underestimate the fertilizer man who spends all of his time, and much of his money, to learn by study, experience and observation all that may be discoverable in his business, but at the same time it may be well to discount 




92 


•FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


his enthusiasm, as well as his bills, just a little. Any one who does not feel compe¬ 
tent, after listening to the ever ready rep¬ 
resentatives of the numerous fertilizing concerns, to make the proper selection has only to refer to the state bulletin, furnish¬ 
ed free, and he will find out all about it in the tables that have been published and republished from time immemorial, until they are, to some ‘of us perhaps, more familiar than the writings brought down from Moses. 

This committee cannot and will not 

V 

undertake to lay down any rules of fer¬ 
tilization, believing that every intelligent grower, after a study of his soil and a consideration of his stocks, can make a proper selection for his own individual wants. It may be well, however, to say that the committee believes it is a well established fact that to^ fertilize abundant¬ 
ly, and to fertilize frequently with the right kind of fertilizer and at the right time is essential to successful and profita¬ 
ble production. Fertilizers containing a high percentage of ammonia during the wood and foliage growing seasons of 
Spring and Summer, and fertilizers hav¬ 
ing a high percentage of potash and phos¬ 
phoric acid during the fruit maturing seasons of Fall and Winter, are requisite to the fruitfulness of all kinds of trees and plants. 

Some very successful growers cling to the plan of applying fertilizers only twice a year, but a large preponderance of evi¬ 
dence is in favor of not less than three ap¬ 
plications. By a judicious rotation and alternation of the ready-make mixtures offered by the various fertilizer concerns. 


nearly all necessary requirements can be met. Sometimes, however, there are con¬ 
ditions arising from environment, soil, 
stocks, previous neglect, starvation or overfeeding etc., that may require special formulas, and in such cases the combined experience of the grower and chemical knowledge of the manufacturer are neces¬ 
sary to produce the best results. 

Irrigation. 

The matter of irrigation is not a new one in Florida, and was practiced by many progressive growers prior to the dis¬ 
astrous freezes of ten years ago. 

With modern, up-to-date improve¬ 
ments in pumps and power, we can now irrigate successfully and economically. 
Notwithstanding what has been done and is now being done, irrigation is still large¬ 
ly in the experimental stage. Exactly what effect irrigation will have on insect plagues is not yet known to a certainty, 
but it is believed that it will be beneficial. 
The over-cautious, or hesitating grower reasons that there are in Florida only six or eight weeks in the Spring when irriga¬ 
tion is at all necessary, overlooking, or disregarding the fact that sometimes one or two rains during this period saves his crop. In the arid regions of the West in¬ 
telligent irrigation has removed all un¬ 
certainty and the grower knows he can always year after year have uniform re¬ 
sults. Plant growth and fruitfulness are so dependent on a proper supply of mois¬ 
ture that no one can question the useful¬ 
ness of irrigation, and the only question in the whole matter is—will it pay? We believe it will.

Report by Cyrus W* Butler* 


In the line of irrigation my experience amounts to nothing, and I therefore have nothing to say. 

Fertilizers for Orange Groves. 

It is customary to approach this subject with the remark that we *'know nothing of it,’’ which, though much nearer the truth than to say that we ^‘know all about it,” is still not in accordance with the just laws of Nature, who, we know, yields her secrets slowly but surely to all who seek her earnestly and faithfully. And who among us will deny that the orange grow¬ 
ers of Florida have sought earnestly and faithfully for an answer to the question as to what my Lady Orange Tree will have for her breakfast this spring, her lunch this summer and dinner this fall?—and who among the growers, of all that portion of the world known to us, have been able to produce an orange so nearly perfect as the best of the products of our own sun¬ 
ny skies, sandy soil and carefully blended food. Not that we would ascribe the peculiar excellence of our Florida oranges to fertilizer alone, for some of our best fruit has been produced entirely without artificial food; but to produce this fruit in abundance and, at the same time, maintain its quality is the question that has taxed the brains of our orange growers for the last fifty years, with results that have placed the better class of our fruit upon the highest pinnacle of citrus fame. So, 
theoretically, we conclude that the orange growers of Florida should know some¬ 
thing of an orange tree’s food require¬ 
ments, while, practically, the orange de¬ 
monstrates the correctness of the con¬ 
clusion. 


Without going into the theoretically scientific, which is often more theoretical than scientific, I will give my present course, which is the result of twenty years of experience, involving some midnight oil reflection, but much more midday sun¬ 
shine and observation—not to mention sweat and sandspurs; but the latter are for|fotten as we recall the beautiful green trees, the sweet odor of the blossoms and the exquisite flavor of the golden fruit. 

While soil analysis may give us some partial pointers, practical^ we may con¬ 
sider the average pine land of Florida as simply a lodging place for the tree, as its meals must be furnished from outside sources, that is, so far as the elements of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash are concerned; and, as these elemjents are generally considered the only ones neces¬ 
sary to purchase, the question of composi¬ 
tion resolves itself into the best sources and relative proportions of these elements. 

Proportion. 

However widely the different brands of fertilizers varied twenty years ago, to-day nearly all of them will run between two to four per cent, ammonia, with six to eight per cent, phosphoric acid and ten to twelve per cent, potash; and it is probable that, within these limits, the necessities of the average grove, in normal condition, 
can best be supplied; but it has long been a question with me as to whether the same proportions of these elements should pre¬ 
vail in the three applications that most growers make during the year. 

So I will give my present method, 
even though it contains nothing new to most old growers. 


94 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


First Application. 

Just before or about the time that the first blossoms appear we make a light ap¬ 
plication or not over one-half of the usual amount of fertilizer, containing about six per cent, each of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash—^the nitrogen being from nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia, 
the phosphoric acid from acid phosphate, 
and the potash from a sulphate. 

The object of this heavy percentage of nitrogen is that, while the trees need a maximum amount of this element dur¬ 
ing the spring months, owing to our usual drought during these months, they as a rule get less than during any other warm months of the year; hence, I apply more and apply it in a shape that is available at once—the nitrate of soda first and the sul¬ 
phate of ammonia to last until the next application. I find that trees so treated with this extra amount of nitrogen at this time will hold their fruit better and stand the drought better than if only the usual amount of nitrogen was used. Nor do I find die-back to follow this plan, or fear it, provided that there is no excess of ammonia left in the ground when the rainy season sets in. 

Second Application. 

During May we make a liberal applica¬ 
tion analyzing from two and one-half to three and one-half per cent, ammonia, 
seven to ten per cent, phosphoric acid and twelve per cent, potash, composed of sul¬ 
phate of ammonia, steamed bone flour and sulphate of potash. Whether the trees get the two and one-half or the three and one-hart per cent, of ammonia depends upon their color—the lighter in color the more ammonia, and vice versa; also upon variety, as a tangerine will not only stand one-third more nitrogen than a 


round orange on the same stock, but really requires it, in order to produce the highly colored fruit necessary to command high prices. 

Third Application. 

If trees are heavily loaded with fruit, 
by July we make a light application of equal parts of low grade potash and acid phosphate, but use no nitrogen unless leaves are light in color and fruit small, 
and even then a very light per cent., as all ammoniates in the ground during the rainy season are by the heat and mois¬ 
ture rapidly nitrified and carried into the tree. In short, the rainy months are the die-back producing ones, and hence all excess of nitrogen should then be guard¬ 
ed against. If trees do not have a heavy crop, omit this July application. 

Fonrtli Application. 

During November we use a liberal amount of fertilizer, running three per cent, ammonia, seven per cent phosphoric acid and twelve per cent, potash, compos¬ 
ed of sulphate of ammonia, acid phos¬ 
phate and sulphate of potash, which com¬ 
pletes the bill of fare for the year. While the trees may not be able to use as high a percentage of nitrogen during November and December as during May and June, 
on the other hand, owing to the cooler weather prevailing during the former months, nitrification of the ammoniates also proceeds less rapidly and, therefore, 
the tree gets less, even though the same amount be applied. 

Of course, the above is for healthy trees, 
abnormal conditions requiring modified formulas, and for rough lemon stock one- 
third less nitrogen than for sweet seedling stock. At all times we keep a close watch on the condition of the tree and vary the 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


95 


percentage of nitrogen accordingly, using enough potash to combine with the nitro¬ 
gen, w'hich for the average of the year would be a little over three times the amount of the nitrogen, as all growers soon learn that, without the necessary percentage of potash, the wood is soft, 
the orange lacks juice and what there is is insipid, to say nothing of the probable die- 
back and possible gum disease and foot rot later on. 

As to the indications for phosphoric acid, excepting so far as the thinness or plumpness of the seed are concerned, I 
must confess to being in the dark. Judg¬ 
ing from analysis of tree and fruit, we are using more of this element than neces¬ 
sary, but at least, in some cases, we have evidences to the effect that even larger percentages are applied with good results, 
so far as amount of fruit is concerned; 
and as yet we have not met with any evidence of injury, even from its ex¬ 
cessive use. though we think that it hastens maturity. The good results attending the use of more of this element than analysis of fruit and tree would call for, may in part be accounted for by the fact, that much of the free phosphoric acid applied to our soil is probably soon com¬ 
bined with lime, iron or aluminum, thus becoming, in the first case, of questionable availability, and, in the second case, non- 
available to the tree. 

Source of Nitrogen. 

With the exception of what nitrogen is contained in the steamed bone and the small amount of nitrate of soda used in the early spring, sulphate of ammonia is almost our only source of nitrogen. 
Guano, we find from repeated experiences, 
at least when applied during warm weath¬ 
er, will cause fniit to drop badly. Blood 


and bone, cotton seed meal, etc., gives a thick bark with large pores into which the young scale easily get their sucking tubes and multiply rapidly; while later on comes die-back, to say nothing of the in¬ 
ferior quality of fruit. The same ob¬ 
jection holds good for stable manure ; but, 
as its possession has not been avoidable with us, and not wanting to waste it, we compost it with equal parts of low grade sulphate of potash and acid phosphate and allow it to thoroughly rot before using, 
by which time the ammonia is probably nitrified and combined with the potash, 
forming a nitrate of potash, or combined directly with sulphur, giving a sulphate of ammonia. When so treated, we have used the small amount of four shovel¬ 
fuls per tree, scattered outside of the branches, with good results only; but care should be exercised in its use and a watch kept for an increase of scale,. 

We use at least one hundred pounds each of the sulphate of potash and acid phosphate per ton of manure. 

The rotting process can be greatly hur¬ 
ried by keeping the pile moist and making holes with a crowbar for admission of air. 

As for gathering a part of the nitrogen from the air by growing leguminoid plants in grove, we have given it a thorough trial, resulting only in financial loss and humiliation. Whenever we got a heavy growth of beggarweed, the rapid nitrification going on in the roots of the weed among the orange tree roots, has invariably caused The fruit to become ammoniated and split, regardless of our best efforts to balance the debt by use of potash and phosphoric acid. ‘ 

Sources of Fotasli. 

As the carbonates of potash are too ex¬ 
pensive and the muriates contain so much 


96 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


salt, we have confined ourselves to the sulphates using either the high or low grade, as percentage was indicated in the desired mixture, but usually the low grade. 

Sources of Phosphoric Acid. 

While we have not made any conclusive tests as to the relative merits of bone and acid phosphate as a source of phosphoric acid, we have been using and watching others who have been using both sources, 
and so far find no difference in value be¬ 
tween the two when made available with acid. Moreover, we note that the preju¬ 
dice against the use of acid phosphate is rapidly losing ground, especially with growers who are finding out that they have been using it for years under the name of “dissolved bone.” 


The pretended point against acid phos¬ 
phate made by some fertilizer catalogues, 
to the effect that the sulphuric acid used in its manufacture sours the ground, is, we think, simply a matter of words, used to sell goods that contain just about the same amount of sulphur; the truth of which is easily demonstrated, but requires too much space to give here. 

In conclusion, as the average Florida orange grower influences and largely governs by fertilization, not only the amount of oranges produced, but the size of fruit, thickness of peeling, amount of and character of juice, therefore, I repeat that he has learned at least a little of a desirable bill of fare for the orange tree; 
and speed the day when he can say as much of his own stomach. 


DISCUSSION. 


Mr. 'Pettigrew—Mr. President, in the matter of irrigation I have had consider¬ 
able experience with artesian well water, 
I had a good strong flowing artesian well, 
with a capacity at the well of 150 gallons per minute. This would cover twelve acres an inch deep in twenty-four hours, 
but upon practical application I could not get half of it. I do consider that for prac¬ 
tical purposes I got an inch of water on four acres from my supply in twenty-four hours. I have about three thousand feet of cement irrigation pipe, with a hydrant at about every 200 feet. I also have 100 
feet of hose and with ^he supply of water 
I can get the water tolerably quickly on the land. This artesian water is a sulphur water, but I consider it very good for irri¬ 
gation purposes if you can get a sufficient supply, but in the sandy soil of Florida you can not receive the benefit of the water to 


anything like near the extent you could on hard lands, such for instance as in Cali¬ 
fornia. Iron piping is not best for irriga¬ 
tion purposes in my judgment especially down where I am it is too near the salt water. They rust out too quickly. I have some Giant Bamboo which would make good irrigating pipes if I could get the joints bored out, so the water would run through them. My longest bamboo is forty-nine feet after cutting off the top to where the hole is one and one-fourth inches in diameter. The question of irri¬ 
gation is quite an important subject, and there is in some directions objections to it on account of the cost of a plant, yet there is no question but that a properly equipped irrigation plant will pay in the long run, for you are always thus sure of your water, and the water is what makes a sure crop. 


Secretary's Report, 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Before reading my report, I wish to read (and I also wish to have printed in our minutes) the report of Mr. Aubrey 
Frink, who acted as Assistant Secretary last year and whose report was inadver¬ 
tently omitted from last year’s Report, 
which is as follows: 

Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

As I had been appointed assistant secre¬ 
tary to serve during the last meeting of our society, at Miami, in May, 1903, I of¬ 
fered to assist Mr. Powers with the work in connection with the present meeting when he became ill a short time prior to his death. This I did by getting out a circular to members for last year. This circular was dated March 30th. On April 
2nd, Mr. Powers died and I was then ap¬ 
pointed by President Taber as secretary to serve until the present meeting. On April 
14th, I sent out another circular to mem¬ 
bers for last year and also to a number of other parties. President Taber had also ap¬ 
pointed Mr. E. O. Painter, of Jackson¬ 
ville, assistant secretary. This last cir¬ 
cular was signed by both myself and Mr. 
Painter. My account stands as follows:

Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In making this my first report I regret to have to state that the Society has again sustained a loss through its secretary. 
We all remember what a lamentable loss the Society suffered when our worthy 
Secretary A. H. Manville ceased to meet with us as his service had been invaluable. 
We considered ourselves fortunate in se¬ 
curing the help of Mr. Stephen Powers, 
whose residence was unfortunate enougFi to be in the track of the resistless fire which destroyed the greater part of 
Jacksonville four years ago. Part of the 
Society’s effects were burned during the fire at that time but this misfortune was small compared with the loss of Secretary 
Powers who passed to his reward on April 
2nd, 1904. 

Your present incumbent, on the 23d of last October, had the misfortune of los¬ 
ing his office and its entire contents through fire, taking all the Society effects then in my possession and leaving me without any record as to the memberships sent in after last year’s report had gone to press. My cash book, however, shows that 
I had to the credit of the Society $90. fo at that time. 

I am glad to report that the library be¬ 
longing to the Society is still in existence as it was in the office of the Times-Union at the time of the Jacksonville conflagra¬ 
tion, and had not been removed at the time of my fire. So though we have been un¬ 
fortunate we have some things to be thankful for. 

The membership of the Society has kept up very well although we are somewhat behind last year. I take pleasure in re¬ 
porting as follows:

Of the new annual members for which remittance is shown above, 20 were turned in by Mr. F. D. Waite, Palmetto and 8 by Mrs. C. T. McCarty of Eldred. 
There were quite a number of our other members who kindly assisted in getting new members. 

I would like to make a motion that the name of Mrs. A. H. Manville be added to the list of our Life Members. This is a small recognition of the services ren¬ 
dered the Society by our former Secretary. 
We all appreciate the work he did and I 
believe the Society will consider it a privilege to place the name of Mrs. Man¬ 
ville on our Life Membership list. 

The Societv is indebted to the Board of 
Trade who kindly paid the bill for the badges.

Painter and Mr. Taber, and Mr. Taber held the proxy for Mr. Phelps. 

Report of the Auditing Committee on settlement with Mr. Power’s heirs, was received and Secretary Painter instructed to make settlement with them. 

The members and personnel of the 


Standing Committee were decided upon. 
In making up the committees we had alphabetical lists and also county lists showing members, to work from. It was the idea in making up these Conimittees that we should not only put on the Com¬ 
mittees members who were acquainted with the subjects with which they had to deal, but that the counties and divisions of the State should be properly represented. *

Secretary Painter was authorized to prepare special features for the next meet¬ 
ing. The number of reports authorized to be printed was one thousand, and Mr. 
Painter was authorized to pf int them, pay for the same to be based on last year's price per^page, number of pages not to ex¬ 
ceed those in 1903 report. 

President Taber was instructed to take up the Kerr resolution with the respective railroads, toward procuring transporta¬ 
tion for officers connected with the Ex¬ 
periment Station and Government in their work of Horticulture research. 

President Taber took up this matter with the railroads of the State and was not successful in getting the* desired annual transportation. 

The Florida East Coast Railway had furnished Prof. P. H. Rolfs annual trans¬ 
portation for these purposes. The L. & 
N. Railway replied that they were pro¬ 
hibited from issuing this transportation; 
the G. S. & F., the A. C. L., and the S. 
A. L. Ry., offered to issue a limited num¬ 
ber of trip passes on the application of the 
President of the Society some days in advance of its issuance. These latter con¬ 
ditions largely bar the usefulness of fur¬ 
ther pursuing this subject. 

Meeting adjourned.

Minutes of last meeting read and ap¬ 
proved. Secretary and Treasurer's ac¬ 
counts were examined and approved. 

Mr. Painter reported settlement with 
Mr. Powers' heirs as follows: 

I wish to report that the committee ap¬ 
pointed to take up this matter made out a statement as near as it could from the data obtained, which showed a balance of something over $80 due the Society, after allowing Mr. Powers' expenses for post¬ 
age, etc. This account was sent to Dr. 
Powers at Ocala and a short time ago received $80.00 from him, which I 
receipted him for in full. The records which I had were all destroyed in the fire. The $80 check was turned over to our Treasurer, which closes up this mat¬ 
ter.

Election of Officers^. 


The President—The regular order be¬ 
ing the election of officers for the ensuing year, the chair will request Mr. F. D. 
Waite, third vice-president, to preside. 

Mr. Waite takes the chair. 

Mr. Taber—^^Mr. President, Ladies and 
Gentlemen: The hour has arrived to make nominations for your presiding officers for the ensuing year. I take this occasion to profoundly thank the Florida State 
Horticultural Society for the honor it has successively conferred upon me, in mak¬ 
ing me your chief presiding officer for nine years. I desire now to say that I 
believe the time has arrived when you should make another selection for your chief presiding officer, I believe it will be of benefit to the society to do so, and I de¬ 
sire to present to you, for your considera¬ 
tion and for your unanimous support, a gentleman well known to you as one of the strongest and ablest members of this so¬ 
ciety. I refer to Mr. C. T. McCarty of 
Eldred, Florida, and bespeak for him your hearty, royal support. 

Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, this so¬ 
ciety would most reluctantly, in my judg¬ 
ment, consider the resignation of its presi¬ 
dent Mr. G. L. Taber, under whose guid¬ 
ance the society has prospered so long, and 
I desire to place in nomination the name of Mr. Taber for re-election to that office. 

Mr. Jones—Mr. President, I wish most heartily to second the nomination of Mr. 
Taber. 

Mr. Taber—Mr. President, I beg the gentlemen who do me the kindness to pre¬ 
sent mv name, in the best interests of the 

^ 7 


society to withdraw it. It is my belief that the time has arrived when you should make another selection, and I 
would ask the unanimous consent of this society to consider the nomination of the gentleman I have just presented to you, 
Mr. C. T. McCarty. 

Mr. Blackman—It appears that Mr. ' 
Taber desires and wishes,that his name be withdrawn and in doing so I will also move that the nomination be closed and that the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for Mr. 
C. T. McCarty of Eldred, for president. 

Mr. Waite—The nomination prevails, 
the secretary will cast the vote. 

Mr. Painter—The secretary casts the unanimous vote of the society for Mr. 
C. T. McCarty for president. 

Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a great 

honor you have conferred upon me to succeed our worthy president, 
Mr. Taber, whom we have all learned to honor and to love for his untiring devo¬ 
tion to the interests f this society. If there had been an intention to urge my- name be¬ 
fore this society for any office in opposi¬ 
tion to the interests of this society. If there 
Mr. Taber, and you should entertain the opinion that I would have permitted it, I 
wish to assure you that it is a mistaken idea. I could never have allowed my name to have been presented had I not known that the determination of Mr. 
Taber not to further accept this honor at your hands, was irrevocable. I shall en¬ 
deavor to the best of my ability to make 




102 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


you a fair and impartial presiding officer. 
My chief aim shall at all times be the ad¬ 
vancement of the interests of your wel¬ 
fare and that of this society, at least for the year for which I have been elected for 
I wish now to assure you that I have no ambition to serve for such a great length of time as has been the case with our esteem¬ 
ed ex-president. Again I thank you. 
(Applause.) 

The names of Dr. C. W. Richardson, 
G. W. Wilson and G. F. Kerr being placed in nomination, the secretary cast the unanimous vote of the society for their election. 


The name of Mr. E. O. Painter was placed in nomination for secretary and the assistant secretarv was instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for his election. 

The name of W. S. Hart was placed in nomination for treasurer and the secretary was instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for his election. 

The names of Rev. Lyman Phelps, E. 
S. Hubbard and G. L. Taber were placed in nomination for the executive committee and the secretary instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the society for their election. 


Next Place of Meeting. 


Mr. Blackman—Mr. President, the next order of business must of necessity be the fixing of the time and place of holding our next annual session. I wish to extend to the society a most cordial invitation to hold its next annual session on the lower east coast, in that magic little city Miami. 
I am authorized and commissioned by the 
Mayor and Board of Trade of the city of Miami to urge upon your consideration this invitation. We want you to come down to Miami. We want to show you what we have been doing down there, and 
(as a measure of what you may expect) 
I stand here to assure you that your mem¬ 
bership will be increased by this selection, 
and you will have more money in your treasury than you ever did have. ‘ This was the case when you held your session in Miami once and it will be so again. I 


am here to promise you, in addition, the lowest railroad rates that you ever heard of to enable you to reach Miami, and to promise you one of the finest excursions on our bays and rivers, and through our deep sea channel out to the broad ex¬ 
panse of the Atlantic, besides many other good things too numerous to mention in detail at this time. I want to say though, 
Mr. President, that Miami wants this so¬ 
ciety to hold its next annual session within her hospitable gates, and I sincerely hope you will accept her invitation. 

Mr. Richardson (of Miami.)—Mr. 
President, I rise to second the invitation of Mr. Blackman, we desire this society to hold its next annual session at Miami, 
and will use our utmost endeavor to make your session a pleasurable and profitable one.

The President—The chair would like to announce that we have with us Capt. 
Garner, president of the Jacksonville 
Board of Trade, who desires to offer a few remarks upon the question before the so¬ 
ciety. 

Capt Garner—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen. On behalf of the Jack¬ 
sonville Board of Trade and business in¬ 
terests of the city of Jacksonville, I desire to extend to you a most cordial invitation to hold your next annual session in the city of Jacksonville, in the auditoriumi of the Board of Trade. Jacksonville has been in the past, as she will ever will be in the future, your sincere friend, a friend to your every interest. She appreciates the great work you are doing for our fair 
State, and we promise you the best and cheapest rates of transportation that can be offered. Jacksonville is the geographi¬ 
cal center of the state; as in ancient days it was said that all roads led to Rome, so it is with Jacksonville, all roads of Florida lead to Jacksonville. It is the most central point you could select, we extend to you always a hearty welcome; Jacksonville is essentially a convention meeting city. 
When the time arrives that you can con¬ 
sider the adoption of a permanent place for your annual meetings we would gladly welcome you, and rejoice with you should 


you determine to erect for yourself a building in the city of Jacksonville and have your own permanent home with us. 
However, Mr. President, I wish to say that your best interests should first be consid¬ 
ered. If (in the judgment of the society) 
its interests would be enhanced by meeting at some other of our sister cities, we should have nought to say detrimental to- 
such a course, for we do not wish to ap¬ 
pear selfish. All that we desire is for yoir to know and feel that we want you to meet with us, and we will at all times use our best endeavor to make your sojourn with us of profit as well as pleasure. Of one thing be assured; that the latch string of the folding doors of the auditorium hangs on the outside, and you are always welcome. 

The President—The society begs to ex¬ 
press its appreciation of the kind invita¬ 
tions extended for the holding of its next annual session. There are two candidates before you, Jacksonville and Miami, a mo¬ 
tion to close the nomination prevails. You will prepare your ballots. 

Mr. Painter—Mr. President, the ballots, 
have been prepared, cast and counted.. 
Jacksonville receives 41 and Miami 24. ■ 

The President—It has been decided by ballot that our next annual session will be held in Jacksonville. The date will be fixed by the executive committee.

Report of Committee on Transportation. 


Mr, President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Your committee begs to submit the fol¬ 
lowing report; 

First—Owing to absence from the state of one of the committee, and the inability to locate the other, there was no advisory action. 

Second—We took up the matter of transportation by asking all the several roads centering here for a rate of one cent per mile each way for actual miles traveled. These several requests were all referred to the General Committee on 


Transportation at Atlanta and was replied to by Mr. Jos. Richardson, secretary. 

We spent two months trying to get some concessions to the members of our so¬ 
ciety, but all to no effect. We asked final¬ 
ly to make the rate available only to the members holding certificates of 1905, but this too was rejected. We are sorry that our efforts have not brought better re¬ 
sults. 

All of which is respectfully submitted, 

T. A. Carroll, 
Chairman Commiifee. 


Resolutions. 


Mr. Blackman—The report of the 
Special Committee on our retiring Presi¬ 
dent is submitted as follows; 

solutions Adopted.” 

^‘Whereas, George L. Taber, who has served this society for nine consecutive 


years as president, has declined to further serve in that capacity, preferring that an¬ 
other should have the honor and respon¬ 
sibilities of the office; be it 

“Resolved^ That the society heartily thanks the retiring president for his long and successful administration of the so-

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ciety’s affairs, his uniform courtesy and fairness when presiding, his earnest labor for the advancement of the society’s in¬ 
terests at all times, believing that the high position attained by the Florida Horticul¬ 
tural Society among similar societies un¬ 
der his administration, has been largely, if not mainly, due to his constant efforts in its behalf. 

The resolution was adopted unanimous¬ 
ly by a rising vote of the members of the society. 


Dr. Kerr, chairman of the Committee of Legislation introduced the following resolution which was adopted: 

Whereas : The attention of the Flori¬ 
da State Horticultural Society has been called to the serious menace to the citrus interests of the State by the unchecked ravages of the White Fly in some locali¬ 
ties and the danger of its introduction throughout the State; Therefore, be it 

Resolved ; that the Florida State 
Horticultural Society heartily endorses all reasonable measures for the eradication of the White Fly. 

Geo. Kerr, 

M. E. Gillett, 

C. T. McCarty. 

Mr. Connor—move that the Secre- 
taiy be empowered to secure a copy of the pending law in regard to the White Fly and incorporate in his annual report of the proceedings so that we may know something of what this mieasure is. 
Carried. This l^iw will be found printed in full in the last pages of this report. 


Mr. C. T. McCarty—Mr. President, I 
have here a resolution which I have been 


requested to offer which I hope the So¬ 
ciety will see perfectly right and proper to adopt. The following resolutions were then adopted: 

Whereas, The Cuban Reciprocity has had the effect of increasing the price of sugar to the American Consumer, and and not increased the price paid the Cuban 
Producer,—and 

Whereas, The reciprocal treaty has had the same effect upon fruits and vege¬ 
tables produced in Cuba, and sold in 
America, and 

Whereas, Florida is largely engaged in the production of similar fruits and vegetables, and believing the Reciprocal treaty reduces the price to the producer of American or Cuban Agricultural or 
Horticultural products, and increases the cost of same to the American Consumer, 

Therefore, Be it resolved: That we request our Representatives in Congress to use their best efforts and influence to repeal the Cuban reciprocal treaty. 

Be it Further Resolved: That a copy of these resolutions be sent to each of our Representatives and Sena¬ 
tors. 


Mr. W. H. Jones offered the following resolutions which were adopted : 

Whereas; Owing to the many com¬ 
plaints made as to the rough handling and delay caused by the employees of the 
Southern Express Company in handling the output of the shippers of this Society and State at large, therefore, be it 

Resolved; That this Committee as a body do respectfully ask that The South¬ 
ern Express Company take such steps as

may be required to furnish such equip¬ 
ment and help in their service as will enable them to handle with care and dispatch such fruits and vegetables as may be entrusted to their care. 

W. H. Jones, Chairman, 

F. D. Waite, 

B. F. Chilton. 


Dr. Kerr—Mr. President, your Legis¬ 
lative Committee to whom was referred the matter of pending legislation in re¬ 
gard to an Annual State Fair makes the following report in the form of a resolu¬ 
tion which it asks to have adopted: 

Be it Resolved : That it is the sense of of the Florida State Horticultural Society now in session that there should be held annually a State Fair and that the Legis¬ 
lature should appropriate a liberal amount of money to aid this worthy object. 

Geo. Kerr, 

C. T. MicCarty, 

M. E. Gillett. 

The above resolution was adopted. 


The following resolution was introduc¬ 
ed by Mt. Boggs, which on being read and discussed was adopted: 

Whereas: The proper regulation of rates of transportation is essential to the prosperity of Horticulture as an industry, 
be it 

Resolved : That this Society express its appreciation of the support given by the the Florida delegation in Congress to the effort to confer rate-making power on the Inter-State Commerce Commission and does hereby urge our Senators and 


107 

Representatives to a vigorous renewal of their efforts in the next session and also in future sessions of Congress, until said 
Commission is granted full power to pro¬ 
tect commerce from unreasonable charges by common carriers, private car lines and express companies. 

Resolved: That the Secretary be in¬ 
structed to forward copies of these resolu¬ 
tions to each of the Florida Senators and 
Congressmen and to the Chairman of the 
Inter-State Commerce Commission. 


Dr. Richardson—Mr. President, the re¬ 
port of your Special Committee in final resolutions beg leave to submit the fol¬ 
lowing resolution of thanks and ask that the same be adopted by a rising vote of this Society. 

Jacksonville, Fla., May nth, 1905.

The undersigned, your Committee ap¬ 
pointed to prepare final resolutions, re¬ 
spectfully submit the following:

For the Preservation of Our Forests. 


Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, I would like to ask the unanimous consent of the society for permission to present out of the regular order, a matter now in the hands of Mr. G. W. Wilson, our second vice-president, pertaining to the important matter of forestry preservation. This is a matter that very properly comes before this society. It is an important matter upon which every State is seeking needed legislation. 

The President—There is no objection, 
by unanimous consent the rules are waived. The society will hear Mr. Wil¬ 
son. 

Mr. Wilson—Mr. President. The mat¬ 
ter of legislation upon forest preservation has been before the various legislatures of the several States for several years. 
The time has arrived when it is almost im¬ 
perative that some needful legislation shall be enacted if possible in our State. 
The reason that I have asked permission to appear before you in this behalf at this time, is because the Florida legislature is now in session, there remaining only about three more weeks of the session, and it is important that this matter be pressed 


as urgently as may be to the enactment of some measure into a forestry law. 
This matter is urgently pressed by the Ag¬ 
ricultural Department at Washington in all States where there has not been a for¬ 
estry law enacted. Some good measure is also called for in our State by the lumber¬ 
man, the cattleman and the naval stores people. I will now read you this com¬ 
munication and proposed measure and ask for such endorsement by the society as the same merits. 

Titusville, Fla., May 9, 1905. 

Pres. Fla. Horticultural Society^ 

Jacksonville^ Fla. 

Dear Sir: 

It seems to me that steps should be taken to urge the present State Legislature to pass laws to protect the pine trees and other trees from foolish destruction. It seems foolish to allow the turpentine men from other states, who have little real in¬ 
terests in the welfare of Florida, to come here and put more than one box in a tree and to box trees under 5 or 6 inches in diameter. We criticise other countries for allowing destruction of the rubber and 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


109 


chincona trees, and at the same time we allow the destruction of our useful pines by turpentine and lumber men who are looking only to their present gains. All organizations interested in the prosperity of the state should combine in efforts to regulate these matters and protect the trees. 

Very sincerely, 

Louis A. Lyman. 

Address : 

Melbourne, Fla. 

The President—LFpon discussion of this matter, it appears to be the sense of 


of the society that the matter should be referred to a special committee on legisla¬ 
tion, to be composed of the present legis¬ 
lative committee with two members added thereto, with power to act. The chair will therefore name as those additional mem^ 
bers, Mil*. G. W. Wilson and Mr. C. T. 
McCarty. The chair believes that this special committee of five, as now con¬ 
stituted, with Mr. Wilson as its chair¬ 
man be able, not only to handle this meas¬ 
ure, but any other effecting the interests of the Florida State Horticultural Society now before'^the legislature to the best in¬ 
terests of the society and State as well. 


Grove Protection at Time of Cold Waves. 

» 


By W. S, Hart* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Can we protect our groves, crop and trees, from injury when, as some one has put it, ‘‘a cold wave a thousand miles wide and ten miles deep sweeps down on us from the far Dakotas?’’ Can we do this profitably? 

If so, how? 

Nearly every orange grower of this state, except in the extreme southern por¬ 
tion, has asked himself and others these questions yet, until well within the present decade, the answer has been uncertain and accompanied with many ‘hf’s.” 

I believe it is now possible to cite a suf¬ 
ficient number of successful cases, under widely varying conditions, to warrant the 


assertion that- the first two can be an¬ 
swered with a single affirmative. 

The third may be answered differently by different people but I feel sure that the method I shall advocate, though not per¬ 
fect, may still be made to answer our needs until a better one is discovered. As evi¬ 
dence best known to me I will cite some of my own experience in support of the first two propositions. 

During the winter of 1901-2 I saved 
$2,000 worth of fruit at an expense of not over $65.00 and during the past win¬ 
ter, fighting four nights in succession with mercury ranging as low as 18 degrees above, and a gale of wind from the north all the first night, a heavy wind from the south much of the second night and light 




no 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


northwest winds the other two, 1 saved much of the fruit that still remained on the trees in a perfectly sound condition, 
to a still greater value at an expense of about $i6o as nearly as I can figure it. 

Nor is this all as my trees were fully protected from injury and now bearing heavy crops of fruit while the unprotected trees lost all their foliage and some of their wood and are now but scantily cov¬ 
ered and carying but light crops, many trees no fruit at all. 

I am satisfied that by firing my groves 
I have saved more of value in the coming crop than in that of the past season. 

But, figuring on what has already been realized, I can safely say that after all pro¬ 
tective measures up to date have been al¬ 
lowed for, and I still have fuel to last a week in case of cold spells, I have cleared at least several thousand dollars on ripe fruit alone. 

Just bear in mind that comparatively few people save a surplus of even one or two thousand dollars in a whole lifetime of struggle and hardships, that the cost of protection is no more than any energetic man can easily meet in one, two or three years and he may do the work of prepara¬ 
tion himself, bear in mind that the orange tree retains its leaves three years under normal conditions and that even if the wood and fruit could escape injury the loss of all this foliage at one time is a heavy shock that means less profit for the coming year, don’t forget the peace of mind that comes of being prepared and the assurance that you may safely hold at least a portion of your fruit for the high prices late in the season rather than take desperate chances between the Devil of a cold wave and the deep sea of glutted markets that may rob the improvident of their season’s income, or even the rewards 


of years of strenuous effort, by killing their trees to the ground while they mean but profit to you if you but act your part vigorously at the right time. Bear in mind that in most parts of the orange belt of this state years may intervene between the seasons calling for protection, even for the fruit, giving a chance to spread the expense of preparation over a considerable time. 

Bear in mind that the ablest and most successful business men of the world deem it good business prudence to take liberal advantage of insurance opportunities both on person and property. Bear in mind the chagrin as well as hardship, that comes to him who fails, while others with like opportunities succeed about him. Bear in mindvthat realty values, the prosperity of the state and every interest in it are deeply involved. 

Yes, let us carefully consider all these things and the many more that will sug¬ 
gest themselves to us and then ask our¬ 
selves if it does not promise fair returns in any case and splendid profit in some to prepare for the cold waves that are sure to come sooner or later and when they do come be ready and on the spot to put up a good fight for our own ? 

Twenty acres protected means a whole lot if others lose their trees, ten acres of good bearing trees when Florida’s crop is mostly cut off means a good income, an acre, or even a half acre, means much to the man too poor or feeble to protect more. 

How shall we do it? 

I will not stop to describe the many more or less effective plans that have been tried throughout this state and California, 
as even the best of them, with the ex¬ 
ception of that of building small fires in and about the groves possess drawbacks that must yet be overcome to bring either 


FLORIDA S-TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


one into common use among grove own¬ 
ers. 

• Let us then consider this plan, of prepar¬ 
ing to build a small fire to each tree so as to warm all the air in the groves as the, 
in my opinion, only effective one with large trees within the reach of all growers, 
though small trees I would bank with clean earth and leave them to take their chances without fires. 

At our meeting here in Jacksonville in 
1896 Rev. D. O. Davies enthusiastically reported a very good measure of success in saving a portion of his grove at 
Micanopy from destruction in the winter of 1894-95 by building a ‘‘conflagration” 
on the north and west sides and smaller fires here and there through it. 

He named his plan “The plan of the three P's, Preparation, Promptness, 
Perseverance.” Mr. Kinney of Pierson carried some of his trees and fruit through the same winter in sound condition though the state lost fifty to eighty mil¬ 
lions of dollars’ worth of property value in citrus groves by the cold of a few hours. 
Mr. Kinney’s plan was far mere economi¬ 
cal than that of Rev. Davies as he used smaller fires but more of them. By his request his success at that time, and dur¬ 
ing the two following seasons, were re¬ 
ported to this society at its meeting in 
1898 they being the most notable ever attained in this country in that line of effort up to that date. 

Both of these lamented friends and fel¬ 
low members have passed on to their re¬ 
ward but their work lives after them. 

Prof. J. G. McKinney gave us a very valuable paper on grove protection at our meeting here in Jacksonville in 1900 in which, among other good things, he gave us his experiments with small fires to the leeward of each tree with a windbreak on 


the other side so constructed as to cause wind eddies that drew the heat through 
;.the tree and upward to its top. 

Mr. S. C. Warner, whom I hope is here present, has this plan in effective operation and with marked success during the cold spell of January last. 

California has given us much of value through her work and careful reports in this line and there these small fires, in what¬ 
ever way they may be made, have proven most effective in warding off injury from cold. 

Through results obtained from the practice of this method of protection has come new courage and new confidence to those who realize that only by effective protective measures could we hope to put orange growing on a basis of safety that would more surely warrant the investment of capital than at any time in the'- past, 
throughout the section of the old “Orange 
Belt” of this state that has heretofore produced the highest quality and the major portion of its crop. 

Through-it the worthy and energetic president of this society is making orange culture profitable within eight or ten miles of the Georgia line. 

Now, as otherwise this paper promises to become much too long, I will give, as briefly as possible, a few suggestions on the practical working of this method of protection that my experience tells me are of value, and also offer some that, though not yet sufficiently tested, may on further study, prove to be of value. 

The key note of Messrs. Kinney and 
Davies’ teaching was, to use the formers words, “Be ready when the cold comes.” 

Have your fuel in place, kindlings laid, 
men engaged, plan of lighting all worked out, a surplus of fuel near by to replenish from and as soon as this is used up rush

in more before you rest, even though the mercury is rising, otherwise you may have worked in vain. 

If practicable it is best to have a large supply stored in the groves where it is easily accessible. 

If wood is used make it four feet long and leave it coarse. This is a saving in several ways. Part should be lightwood to start with. Lay it right so that it will not waste by burning too rapidly. 

The right way is in the form of a capitol 
V with its point towards the tree to the southeast and resting on the middle of a stick at right angles with its axis. Place the kindlings in the acute angle of the top sticks and cover with a dry palmetto leaf if such is handy. 

Where fires are to be built banking is not necessary and the holes are a nuisance in the night, where it is done. 

To save oranges start fires when the mercury gets down to 27 degrees above zero. For the trees up to time of starting growth, 25 degrees. After growth has started make it 29 or 30 degrees. 

Don’t trust to long distance weather predictions or to the ringing of electric 
IdcIIs attached to thermometers outside. 
Don’t trust to high-priced thermometers after the first year of their service. 

Get a dozen or two of the 15 to 25 cent ones, test them and mark the variations and they will be the most reliable that you are likely to find. Put them about in the groves, as far from the effects of the fires as possible, and go to them often. Put one or two way outside to windward. 

Watch the Weather Bureau reports closely. It seldom fails to give notice of the worst that is likely to come, and to do it well ahead of the arrival of the cold wave, but don’t trust absolutely even.to it 


as it is possible for cold to come from a point outside its range of observation. 

When it predicts a degree of cold below the danger point have some one watching the mercury even after it may have gone up a little because of the dew point hav¬ 
ing been reached. It may go down later. 

Call out the men in good time and start a fire here and there even before real dan¬ 
ger has arrived, if mercury is steadily fall¬ 
ing. 

Pay them good wages for night work, 
more than for day work unless their em¬ 
ployment depends upon success so that they are interested as well as their em- ' 
ployer in preserving your property. 

Hire by the hour and give them plenty of hot coffee and a good lunch in the mid¬ 
dle of the night. 

Trees do not burn easily in a cold night but better put the fires in the middles as the heat is radiated in all directions. 

Be sure that mulching is kept out from under the trees and away from the fires. 

Have help enough and have the fires looked to often. 

Call on your friends if short of help. 
You will be surprised to find how ready even wealthy tourists are to help a man who shows energy and foresight in caring for his property. 

Watch the fires closely on a windy night. On calm nights the job is a de¬ 
lightful one after you once get at it. 

Windbreaks, if such there be, should not be tight ones except they be of the Prof. 
McKinney kind. 

Smoke and the hot sand under the fires, 
both help to protect in the morning and if the sun comes up bright throw the wood apart so as to make all the smoke possible if you think any of the fruit is frosted. 

Chunks that have been partly burned make good kindlings for next time or they

start up easily if left whole when the char¬ 
red ends are put together. Donh leave the groves alone, if there be any combustible material in or about it, until every fire has been extinguished. Then you may go to rest with a satisfied mind, so far as your own interests are concerned; but with a deq) feeling of sympathy for those who have trusted to luck and hoping against hope have lost wholly or in part, 
for, I know of no more vexing experience than that of rebuilding a grove that has been killed to the ground or even the ef¬ 
fort to realize some return from a partly frozen crop of fruit. 

Though wood is comparatively plentiful in this state at present it will not always be available in sufficient quantities to allow of its use to the extent of our needs and considering the amount of work to pre¬ 
pare it, place it, keep up the fires, replace it with more when that in the groves is used up, the difficulty of hauling it among closely planted, large trees and the neces¬ 
sity of getting it out and covering it when danger of- cold is past, the difficulty of getting the needed help to do all this just when it is needed, it is well for us to care¬ 
fully consider the matter of the use of other fuels that will soon be, if they are not now, more economical for our pur¬ 
pose. 

It may be that the use of some kind of stove would give us more economical pro¬ 
tection, even with the use of wood, after their first cost was met, as they give out more lateral heat with less upward waste. 
The use of coal or coke in stoves or baskets should be tried until we learn more fully their protective worth. 

The Griffiths, Munson Briquettes are giving good results in California but there they do not have as low extremes of tem¬ 
perature as we experience. 


113 

While in that state last year I talked with Mr. James Mills of Riverside who has had 200 tons of them, and other users. 
I met Mr. M. L. Wicks of Los Angeles president of the company, was shown through the works where they are made and I am encouraged to believe that they will answer our needs better than any¬ 
thing else on the market if they can be made in this state as cheaply as there and 
I see no reason why this may not be done. 
The plant need not be an expensive one, 
the materials are not costly, the briquettes can be moved on a low freight rate, they are exceedingly convenient to handle, take little room in the grove, can be stored there under the trees where most handy for years with but little, if any, loss of value, need no stove or basket when in use and each replenishing will last from five to six hours, so I am told by those who have used them. 

In size they are there made 12x6x5 
ches for grove use but much smaller for household purposes. In France where wood is scarce, briquettes are in common use for all heating purposes and may be seen in great piles about the railroad sta¬ 
tions almost as plentiful as coal in this country. 

There are yet, and always will be, 
problems to work out in successful citrus culture and the most effective and economical protection from injury by cold is one of them*. I am inclined to Mieve it to be best, in the future setting of or- 
ange groves, to plant the rows running north and south far enough apart to allow of the easy hauling of fuel and fruit and the building of fires after the trees, get large without danger of injury to them or their crop. All this means work but nature demands that man shall work, hap¬ 
pily and in affluence if he will, unhappy

and in poverty if he attempts to shirk, but by working up to Dr. Davies’ rule of the three P’s we may never now assure our¬ 
selves that we have gotten grove protec¬ 
tion down to a plan of profitable practice 


that makes orange growing here as safe and profitable an investment of money, 
time and labor as foresight and energy may hope to find in the whole range of horticulture. 


Agriculture* 


By T* A* Carroll. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Agriculture, the original, natural, 
necessary, and almost universal business of man, was planted in the Garden of 
Eden with mankind, and from this one line of industry come all others. Every art, trade or profession whatsoever is secondary to this parent industry, and de¬ 
pendent upon it,—and is useful only when and in such a degree as may contribute to the one great universal business—agricul¬ 
ture. 

Agriculture in its great volume is the social, political and economic salvation of the world. 

There are too many young men brought to. look upon Horticulture and Agricul¬ 
ture as being only an earthly (or earthy) 
existence, with the result that the flower of our farmers are flocking to the towns and cities—where the professions are already overcrowded, thus creating a social as well as economic menace. What is to be done to obviate this? There is no single remedy, but I do believe that much can and may be done in a more scientific agriculture, whereby this 


most necessary calling might be made more attractive to our young men, whose ambitions now carry them to the univer¬ 
sities of art and letters. 

The life of the agriculturist is not so dull as many suppose. It will not compare with that of the clerk in the store or bank for ennui. 

He has a chance in season and out of season for recreation, and for enjoy¬ 
ment in the work of his own hands— 
whereas the clerk and mechanic are only the human handle in the pick through which others perform a task. What more can he hope for but existence? What per cent of the suicides occur upon the farm? 
(not two per cent.) What per cent from those who left the farm for other call¬ 
ings? (more than eighty per cent). Is it necessary to further comment upon this point? 

With advanced Agriculture and Horti¬ 
culture we cannot see why they should not be as attractive to the intelligent man as 
I.aw or Physics, or any of the other pro¬ 
fessions. 

We have only to turn to any one of our 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

many Horticulturists and Agriculturists to-day to prove that it is not only as profi¬ 
table but equally elevating and independ¬ 
ent, besides more genteel. I want to make the prediction that fifty years hence will see more independent farmers than merchants, doctors and lawyers combined in Florida,^ or in this whole Southland of ours. 

Someone said recently: 

*‘What we need now is men of well trained brains, who will organize and diversify agricultural industry,^’ and it is true. We have greater need of men than plowmen. 

One need only to watch the real estate transfers to learn that all the most de¬ 
sirable properties are being taken by the 
‘‘New Comer.” Men who know a good thing when they see it, yet our young men are daily leaving these identical farms seeking to better their positions socially morally and financially, with what results ? 
How soon do they realize their mistake, 
some soon enough to get back before the 
Old Home passes into new hands. Then watch with what tenacity they cling to that Home and farm. But then there are those who cannot see the mistake in time, 
and to him there is nothing left but to 


drift with the tide of Human Pick Hands until his days are no more. 

Then what shall we do ? 

There ought to be and there is a remedy, 
and that remedy is at hand—teach the Agriculturist Agriculture. Require every public school to teach agriculture, 
not only the rudiments of agriculture, but horticulture, forestry, and all its other kindred subjects. Let it be one of the es¬ 
tablished studies in all public schools, and if necessai*}^ make the study attractive by offering premiums for a complete course. 
But do not understand me to cast a single straw or deprecating word against the work of our present established institu¬ 
tions. They are doing all they can, be¬ 
ing handicapped as they are, but they cannot reach the element we want, we want the farmers’ sons. To be “like father like son,” and we can only have this so by making the farm life interesting to our young men and boys, get their hearts interested in this work, teach them the science of horticulture, the business of agriculture. Show them the independ¬ 
ence, the comfort, the profit, of the life of agricultural science and you have won a crown of glory for the noblest calling of man. 


The Diseases of the Irish Potato. 


By Professor F. M* Rolfs* 


.(The following paper was lavishly il¬ 
lustrated with stereopticon views of the different forms of fungus growth and we very much regret our inability to re¬ 
produce these views in this report.—Sec¬ 
retary. ) 

Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Our potato industry frequently suffers severely from the invasions of various plant organisms which are more or less common to the potato fields of this State. 
The object of this paper is to describe the most destructive diseases, and suggest such methods of treatment as have been successfully employed in holding these diseases in check. It is often difficult to distinguish some of these diseases without the aid of a miscroscope, still it is well to know the symptoms of the principal ones so as to be able to use rational methods of treatment. Doubtful cases may be referred to the Experiment 
Station. 

Altenaria solani (E. and M.) Sorour. 

Early Blight —^^This is a wide-spread disease. It attacks both leaves and stems. 
Plants usually show no signs of the dis¬ 
ease until they are six inches high. The first indication of its presence is the ap¬ 
pearance of small circular, brown spots on the older leaves. The spots gradually ex¬ 
tend and form large areas of dead tissue. 
The younger leaves soon show signs of invasion, and unless the plants are spray¬ 


ed at once the entire foliage soon becomes involved. In the advance stage the tips and margin of the leaves roll up. The large -spots frequently show concentric markings. Because of its slow progress it is usually mistaken for the natural ripen¬ 
ing of the plants. The development of the tubers stop as soon as the leaves become thoroughly involved, and the yield is often cut short as much as 20 barrels per acre. 
Plants which are weakened from any cause are liable to be invaded by this fun¬ 
gus. Bordeaux mixture will hold this disease in check. Applications of this mix¬ 
ture should be made when the plants are four inches high, and repeated at inter¬ 
vals of about ten days until six applica¬ 
tions have been made. 

Phytoplitliora infestens (De By.) 

Late Blight —This disease invades all parts of the plants and tubers"! The first sign of its presence is the appearance of small brownish or black areas on the leav¬ 
es. These areas which rapidly increase in size followed by the curling of the leaves. 
If a spell of warm, moist weather follows, 
the leaves and stems turn black and decay within a few days, giving off a disagree¬ 
able odor. Badly infected plants have only small tufts of green leaves at tips of stalks. 
Many of the leaves hang shriveled as if scorched by fire. The under surface of the diseased leaves are covered with mildew. 
This mildew is composed of minute, tree¬ 
like, branching structures which support a

minute, egg-shaped spore (seed) at the tip of each branch. When a spore falls on the moist surface of a leaf it pushes out a slender, colorless thread which soon enters the leaf, and if the weather conditions are favorable, it soon completely penetrates and kills the leaf. It usually takes about five days from the time the spores germinate until a new crop of spores are formed. This explains why the disease spreads so rapid¬ 
ly. The tubers of infected fields may, or may not, rot. This depends largely upon soil and weather conditions. This rot is worst on heavy soils. The fungus has no winter spores. It is believed to pass the winter in the tissue of the tubers, con¬ 
sequently too much care cannot be ex¬ 
ercised in selecting clean, healthy seed. 
Thoroughly sprayng the plants with Bor¬ 
deaux mixture will hold the disease in check. 

Fnsarium Oxysporiniu (Schlechtendal). 

Dry Rot —Attacks all parts of the po¬ 
tato plant below ground. The first in¬ 
dication of the disease is a change in the appearance of the leaves, which take on a lighter green color and roll up, followed by a gradual drying up and premature death of the plant. However, if the plants are not attacked until they have about com¬ 
pleted their growth these early symptoms are often lacking. The upper part of the shoots become flabby, droop and die, 
usually taking on a dark brown color. 
When infected tubers are first dug they appear sound, but while they are stored the fungus gradually works inward, fol¬ 
lowing the vascular ring. (This ring soon takes on a brown or black color). 
The fungus usually gains entrance at the stem end. Black streaks extending from the stem into the flesh is a reliable symptom of this disease. Infected ends 


rot and shrivel, and because of this pecu¬ 
liarity the disease is often spoken of as dry end rot. The hyphae (feeding threads) 
which occur abundantly in the diseased tissue, often appear on the surface of the tubers in dense, white tufts. These soon bear small oval spores (seeds) and later a larger, curved, septate form. If these spores fall on the moist, injured sur¬ 
face of tubers and plants, they germinate and develop new points of infection. 

This is a wide-spread and destructive disease. It is a difficult matter to find a lot of seed which is not more or less in¬ 
fected with it, and it is not uncommon to find as high as 25 per cent of our seed com¬ 
pletely rotted by it. Frequently tubers which are healthy when they are cut, are completely rotted by this fungus beforethe plants reach the surface of the ground. 
This is especially noticeable when the ger¬ 
mination of the seed is checked by un¬ 
favorable weather conditions. In such cases the fungus gains entrance through the cut surface. The rotting of the seed in various sections of the State during the past winter was due largely to the work of this organism. In a number of fields which came under our observation, as much as 
60 per cent of the seed was rotted by this fungus after it had been cut for planting. 

The infection in most cases was largely due to carelessness in mixing diseased seed pieces with healthy ones. The spores falling on the cut, moist surface soon ger¬ 
minated and invaded the tuber. The planting was followed by a spell of cold weather which retarded the germination of the seed, thus enabling the fungus to consume the tuber before the young plants reached the surface of the ground. In fields where the planting was followed by more favorable weather conditions, the stand was much better, still many of the 


ii8 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


seed tubers were sooner or later complete¬ 
ly destroyed by the fungus, but the plants were fairly well established before the destruction of the seed. When the disease is once introduced in the field it is apt to remain in the soil for a number of years, 
hence it is desirable to practice a syste¬ 
matic rotation of crops. 

Carefully selecting clear smooth seed and rejecting from time to time all tubers showing any sign of rot, also aids material¬ 
ly in checking the spread of the disease. 
Exposing the seed to the light from four to five weeks before planting is an ex¬ 
cellent practice. Ths treatment tends to hasten the germination of the tubers after planting and enables the plarit to become established before the seed tuber is en¬ 
tirely destroyed. 

Bacillus Solanacernm (Smitli.) 

Bacterial Wilt —A very common and destructive disease. This disease causes the foliage to wilt, and later, the stems and branches become discolored and die. In¬ 
fection rnay occur either above or below the ground. The disease also produces a brown or black rot of the tubers. This organism also attacks egg plants and to¬ 
matoes. 

Select clean, smooth seed, rejecting all those showing black end vascular bundles. 
Expose the seed to the light four or five weeks before planting. 

Corticinm Vagnm Var. Solani (Burt). 

Rhizoctonia —A wide-spread disease. 
It is usually most troublesome on low lands but during excessive wet weather it also causes more or less loss on the higher lands. The young plants suffer most, and many of the young shoots are completely cut off before they reach the surface of 


the ground. This disease also frequently produces injuries which bring about an abnormal development of small tubers. It is also injurious to the surface of growing tubers and freguently produces a rough surface known as scab. 

This fungus forms a white felt-like fruiting membrane on the green stems just above the surface of the ground, often covering the stems for a distance of three inches. This membrane is composed of a network of hyphae which produce many short, club-shaped branches (basidae) on which small stalks (strigmata) develop. 
At the end of each strigmata a single, 
brown spore (seed) develops. These spores fall as soon as they mature. If they fall on a moist surface they ger¬ 
minate in a few hours and thus may start new areas of infection. It is also pro¬ 
pagated by black scale-like bodies called sclerotia. These form freely on the stems and tubers below the surface of the ground. The sclerotia are composed of large, closely packed cells. When dry, 
the sclerotia are hard to detect, but when wet, they are dark brown and easily seen. 
Tubers which are more or less covered with these bodies ought not to be used for seed, since the cells of these sclerotia de¬ 
velop into long, feeding threads, which, 
under favorable conditions, soon invade and frequently destroy the young shoots. 
A diseased tuber in a sack of clean ones under favorable conditions of heat and moisture, may spread the disease to ad¬ 
joining tubers and in time infect the entire lot. Carefully selecting clean, smooth tubers and exposing them to the light from four to five weeks before planting, 
gives excellent results. When the fungus is once introduced into a field it remains in the soil a number of years. Good drainage and careful cultivation aids ma-

terially in checking the progress of the disease. Burning all old stems and tubers, 
after the harvest, is an excellent practice. 
A systematic rotation of crops is strongly recommended. 

Oospora scabies (Thaxter). 

Scab —Attacks only the tubers. The skin of the tubers becomes pitted and fre¬ 
quently cracks. These injuries form a gateway for an invasion of various fungi and insects, which in many cases extend the injury. Beets are also attacked by this organism. Infected tubers are the principal means of spreading this disease. 
When once introduced into a field it re¬ 
mains in the soil for years. 

Treating infested seed with a solution of one ounce of corrosive sublimate to eight gallons of water for one and one- 
half hours, and one week before planting, 
gives good results, provided the treated seed are planted in soil free from the organism. A systematic rotation of crops gives good results. 

V ermicnlaria. 

Anthracnose —Quite destructive to our summer crop. The first account of this fungus was given by Dr. Halstead. It attacks the stems and may cause pre¬ 
mature death of the plant. Spraying with 
Bordeaux mixture would probably hold this disease in check. Burning all of the diseased vines as soon as the crop is har¬ 
vested is strongly recommended. 

Bordeaux Mixture —Has proved the most efiicient spray for both Early and 
Late Blight, but it is simply a preventive, 
and not a cure for these diseases. It is very essential that the spraying be done at the right time. If the treatment is de¬ 
layed until signs of damage appear, very 


119 

little good will result. Spraying, to be ef¬ 
fective must be done before any signs of disease api>ear, and it must be done thoroughly, for unless the entire surface of the plant is covered by the mixture some of the spores of the fungus will fall on the unprotected spots and gain entrance to the plants. Frequent applications are necessary, especially if sufficient rain falls to wash off the mixture. The following is the standard formula for Bordeaux mixture: 

Copper Sulphate.6 lbs. 

Fresh Lime. 4 lbs. 

Water .. ... 50 gals. 

Potato vines require from 2 to 6 barrels of this mixture per acre, according to the size of the plants. When spraying is done on an extensive scale it is usually convenient to make up a stock solution of copper sulphate. Suspend a coarse sack containing 45 pounds of copper sulphate into a barrel containing 45 gallons of 
‘water. The copper sulphate should be plac¬ 
ed near the surface of the water a day or two before it is to be used. Stir this solu¬ 
tion thoroughly before using, and one gal¬ 
lon of it will contain one pound of copper sulphate. 

A quantity of fresh lime may also be slackened and placed In a barrel, and if it is covered with a few inches of water it can be kept in an excellent condition for some time. 

To prepare a mixture from these solu¬ 
tions, take six gallons of copper sulphate and place it in the spray barrel, and add 19 
gallons of water. From the slackened lime take four pounds of the paste, dilute it with 25 gallons of water and add it to the copper sulphate solution. All the ma¬ 
terials ought to be passed through a sieve so as to exclude the particles which might clog the nozzles. 





120 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


If the ^‘bugs” are plentiful add one pound of Paris Green to 50 gallons of the above mixture. A paste should be made of the Paris Green by mixing it with a small amount of water before putting it into the sprayer. 

Potassium ferro-cyanide, is used to de¬ 
termine if enough lime has been added to combine with all the copper sulphate. It is a yellow poisonous salt which dissolves readily in water. Ten cents’ worth dis¬ 
solved in about ten times its bulk of water will ordinarily be enough for one season. 
In using this test, pour into your spray barrel 25 gallons of the milk of lime. Stir the mixture thoroughly and add a drop of the potassium ferro-cyanide. If enough lime has been added the drop will not change color when it strikes the mixture; 
however, if sufficient lime has not been added it will immediately change to a dark reddish brown color and more lime must be added. Even after the test shows no color it is best to add a little more lime. 

Corrosive Sublimate Treatment for 
Scab—Covrosive Sublimate or bichloride of mercury is sold in form of white crys¬ 


tals. ^ It may be bought at any drug store for about fifteen cents an ounce. The cost of material for treating the seed for an acre will not exceed fifty cents. The solution is made by placing one ounce of this chemical in an earthem or wooden dish containing one gallon of hot water. 
As soon as it i^all dissolved pour the con¬ 
tents of the dish into a wooden vessel con¬ 
taining seven gallons of water. Put the potatoes into this solution, and let them remain an hour and a half. The solution may be used a number of times. The disinfection may be done at any time. Ex¬ 
periments indicate, however, that treating the tubers about a week before planting, 
and spreading them on the floor or ground where they will be fully exposed to the light, greatly facilitates their growth after planting. Corrosive sublimate is a deadly poison to both man and animal when tak¬ 
en internally, but the solution and treated potatoes may be handled freely without experiencing any ill results.

Commercial Stock Food Law, 


By R* E* Rose* 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The necessity for a ‘‘Commercial Stock 
Food Law'^ similar to our fertilizer law in this State, has been recognized by re¬ 
tail dealers and consumers for years. 

The fact that other States have enacted such laws, requiring the analysis, inspec¬ 
tion, and guarantee, of commercial feed stuffs, while Florida has not, has caused this State to become the dumping ground of large quantities of material which could not find a market in other States. 
During the past four years, while I have had the honor to serve the State as State 
Chemist, numerous samples of feed stuff, 
good, bad, and indiffierent, have been sent to the State Laboratory for examination. 
My predecessor informs me, and the rec¬ 
ords of the office show, that for years, 
complaints have been made as to the quality of commercial feed stuff sold in the State; while at all times the informa¬ 
tion required, as to quality and value of samples sent in has been given, it has been simply as personal information, no relief could be given officially, and the party defrauded had no resource, except a suit at common law for damages. Ad¬ 
ulterated or inferior commercial feed not being prohibited, na penalty for false statements or misrepresentations be- 
ing provided, the retail dealer and con¬ 
sumer were at the mercy of the manufac¬ 
turers, brokers, importers, or wholesale dealers. To such an extent had this evil 


grown, that a general protest from the retail dealer and consumer, created a de¬ 
mand for a law regulating the sale of com¬ 
mercial feeding stuffs in this State. While the State chemist has received and ex¬ 
amined numerous samples of inferior feeding stuff from various parts of the 
State, there has also been analyzed by the chemist of the State Experiment Station, 
a number of samples taken from various parts of the‘ State, with results confirming those made by the State Chemist, showing the general inferiority of the stock feed sold throughout the State. This inves¬ 
tigation made the State Experimental Sta¬ 
tion, and the State Agricultural Depart¬ 
ment, while along the same lines, and caused by the same general protest and popular demand, was entirely independ¬ 
ent; in fact, neither Department knew of the other’s work, until the bill now before the Legislature had been presented. It is gratifying to myself, and certainly must also be to Prof. A. W. Blair, to know that the labors of each, for the benefit of the feeder and other citizen of the State, has lead to a concerted effort to remedy the evil, borne long and patiently by the peo¬ 
ple of the State. 

Special Bulletin number 30, of the 
Elorida Experiment Station, by A. W. 
Blair, M. A., Assistant Chemist. “The composition of some of the concentrated feeding stuffs on sale in Elorida,” so ably and logically states the general conditions, 
and so fully confirms my opinion, and

position, on this most important subject, 
that I take the liberty of quoting largely therefrom, and suggest to all consumers of feeding stuffs in the State, to send to the Experiment Station at Lake City, for a copy of this ‘^Special Bulletin, No. 30.” 
Professor Blair says, ‘‘The fact that 
Florida is largely a vegetable and fruit growing State, has seemed to render necessary the importation, from other 
States, of large quantities of concentrated feeding stuffs. I have no means of veri¬ 
fying the statement, but I believe that I 
am safe in saying that in proportion to the population and the number of farm ani¬ 
mals, no other State in the Union imports such large quantities of these materials for home consumption. 

Tlie Necessity for a Feeding Stuffs Inspec¬ 
tion Ijaw. 

The question as to the quality of these goods seems never to have troubled us seriously. We have been content to take what the manufacturer is pleased to send us, and if the quality has been poor, cither the animals have suffered or we have been compelled to buy an additional quantity to compensate for the inferior quality, or both. On the other hand we have not been content thus to accept what the manu¬ 
facturers of fertilizers were sending us, 
but have required them to state the in¬ 
gredients used in the manufacture of the goods, and guarantee that they will, on analysis, show a certain percentage of the fertilizing constituents—plant food; and we have further clothed the State Chemist with power to collect and analyse samples and publish to the State the results of his work, in order that the farmer and fruit¬ 
grower may be protected from the sale of adulterated goods. 

But a large quantity of commercial fer¬ 


tilizers used in the State is manufactured . 
here, and to say to the fertilizer manufac¬ 
turers of this State, “You must make your fertilizers, which you furnish us for grow¬ 
ing our crops, come up to a definite guarantee,” while we say to the manufac¬ 
turers of concentrated feeding stuffs in other States (for practically all the ground products on the market come from other States.) “You may send to us for feeding our stock whatever grade of goods you choose,” does not seem en¬ 
tirely just to the manufacturers of fer¬ 
tilizers. 

It is perhaps, true that greater loss would result from the use of inferior fer¬ 
tilizers than from the use of inferior feed¬ 
ing stuffs, and that it is easier to practice • 
deception with the former than with the latter, still this does not make it less imn portant that he who buys feeding stuffs should be protected from inferior and fraudulent goods. The great variety of mixed feeds, and proprietary feeds makes it comparatively easy to deceive even those who have had considerable ex¬ 
perience in handling such goods. How many of those who buy feeding stuffs can say that they do not contain ground corn cobs, rice hulls, corn bran, etc.^ any more than the farmer can say that his fertilizers do not contain low grade materials worth but little more than half the price asked for them? The fact that the following 
State viz.: Maine Vermont, Massa¬ 
chusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, 
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Maryland, Tennessee, Indiana, Wiscon¬ 
sin, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Ohio, 
now have feeding stuff laws in operation, 
would seem to indicate pretty clearly that there is need to gug,rd against adulteration and fraudulent practice. This fact in it¬ 
self ought to be sufficient to bring us to

our senses; for we need not think for one moment that the manufacturers will stop placing upon the market inferior goods, 
so long as there are places like South 
Carolina, Geg^rgia, Florida and Alabama to be used as dumping grounds for what more than half the States east of the Mis¬ 
sissippi will not have. 

Believing that this condition existed, 
the Chemical Department of the Experi¬ 
ment Station began, last November, an in¬ 
vestigation with a view to ascertaining the exact extent to which low grade and adul¬ 
terated feeding stuffs are being placed up¬ 
on the market. 

Samples were secured from the various sections of the State, largely through students of the University who went to their homes at the Thanksgiving and 
Christmas vacations. 

They were instructed to secure samples of the different concentrated feeds, which should, so far as possible, represent the whole lot from which they were taken, 
and also to secure the trade name, name and location of the manufacturer, and the selling price per sack of 100 pounds, or per ton, in the case of wholesale dealers. 
The names of dealers are reserved, since it is not intended to work any hardship to the wholesaler or retailer, so long as there is no law requiring them to maintain a certain standard. 

As a result of this, forty-three samples, 
representing a considerable variety of feeding stuffs, and collected from differ¬ 
ent parts of the State, have been analyzed. 
It would have been much better could the number of samples and localities rep¬ 
resented been greater, but the limited time and pressure of other work did not permit this. 

It is believed, however, that the work represents, fairly well, the feeding stuffs 


on sale throughout the State. 

Taking up first the brans and compar¬ 
ing their protein and fat content with the standard we find that all of the samples examined fail to come up to the minimum standard requirement in pro¬ 
tein—^15 per cent. 

Number 1799 is very low in protein and fat, while the fibre—^^indigestible part—is over 17 per cent, whereas, in good wheat bran it should not much exceed 9 per cent. This sample was highly adulterated with ground corn cobs and screenings. 

Number 1714 contained wheat chaff, 
corn bran, and various pieces of foreign matter, indicating mill sweepings. Num¬ 
bers 1726, 1730, and 1731 contained corn bran; 1807, dirt and oat chaff, and 1831, 
chaff, corn bran, and other foreign matter, 
probably mill sweepings. The average retail price for eight of the twelve samples is $1.38 per sack of 100 pounds, (27.60 
per ton,) which is undoubtedly excessive when it is remembered that not one of the samples comes up to the minimum stand¬ 
ard for pure wheat bran. 

Six samples of Purina, four of Victor and one each of Boss, Parcell and Mack’s 
Mule Feed, are corn and oat feeds, and are composed of cracked corn, ground or crushed oats and oat hulls, the oat hulls in most cases predominating. These are no doubt, the product of cereal food mills, 
and furnish a means of disposing of the oat hull at a good profit. They have a fair feeding value, though in most cases this is not in proportion to the price asked for them. Certainly this can be said of those obtained at Dania and Hallandale. 

The average protein content of the four samples of Victor Feed is only 7.62 per cent, while the fat is 3.05 per cent, and in this connection it is interesting to note that five samples of Victor Corn and oats 


124 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


feed manufactured by the American 
Cereal Company and analyzed at the New 
Jersey Station, have an average of 8.64 
per cent of protein and 4.50 per cent of fat, 
and five samples analyzed at the Con¬ 
necticut Station gave 8.26 per cent protein and 3.93 per cent of fat, and sold at an average price of $25.40 per ton. Both 
New Jersey and Connecticut have inspec¬ 
tion laws. 

The sample of Mack’s Mule Feed is very low in protein and fat, and high in crude fiber and ash, indicating clearly the predominance of oat hulls. 

Number 1805, sold under the name of 
Yellow Meal, is cotton seed meal adulter¬ 
ated with hulls, making the protein con¬ 
tent about 13 per cent lower than it should be, for the price asked—$27.00 per ton. 

Atlas Dairy Feed, number 1738, is a product of the sugar factories, and is made by drying and grinding the bagasse, 
soaking in molasses, and again drying. 
Its value as a feeding material, is probably not yet well established in this State. 

Marsden Food, number 1829, is ground straw, probably oat straw, and has about the feeding value of oat straw. 

The wiregrass hay which grows abun¬ 
dantly in the pine woods of Florida, con¬ 
tains more protein, and more than twice as much fat, as does this material, and would no doubt be about as easily digest¬ 
ed. But either beggarweed, cow pea, or velvet bean hay contains anywhere from two to five times as much protein, and would certainly not cost any more, if as much, as does this high-sounding “Mars¬ 
den Food.” Judged by the samples ex¬ 
amined, a large proportion of the concen¬ 
trated feeling stuffs on the Florida market is of an inferior quality. 

All of the samples of wheat bran ex¬ 


amined are below the minimum standard for good wheat bran. 

Some materials, as “Marsden Food,” 
are sold at unreasonably high prices. 

The adulterants found were rice chaff, 
wheat chaff, oat hulls, ground corn cobs, 
corn bran, screenings, weed seeds, dirt and other foreign matter, indicating mill sweepings. 

Practically all the concentrated feed¬ 
ing stuffs used in this State are imported, 
and this constitutes a constant drain upon the wealth of the State. 

Florida can and should produce much more of her feeding materials than she is producing, and thus save to the State thousands of dollars. Where the farm crops furnish sufficient carbohydrates, 
only feed stuffs rich in protein should be purchased. The mixtures of com and oats, containing as they do, large quanti¬ 
ties of oat hulls are not economical pro¬ 
tein feeds. 

There is so much profit in selling ground corn cobs, wheat chaff, oat hulls, 
corn bran, rice hulls, etc., and at the price of wheat bran, that the consumer must ever be on the watch. A careful examina¬ 
tion with the eye or with the help of a small magnifying glass will often reveal these adulterants. 

Those who buy feeding stuffs should have the same protection as those who buy fertilizers. Such protection would pro¬ 
mote the interests of the honest manufac¬ 
turer and dealer, diminish the sale of worthless materials, and instruct the peo¬ 
ple in regard to the composition of feed¬ 
ing stuffs and their comparative value.” 

While Professor Blair’s samples were average samples, those examined by the 
State Chemist were generally inferior samples, naturally the purchaser finding an unusually poor result, or evident adul-

teration, sends his sample to the State 
Chemist; which he would not do were the goods at all satisfactory. The conse¬ 
quence has been that all the samples ex¬ 
amined by the State Chemist have been of inferior value as compared to those taken generally throughout the State. 

As an example, I quote the analysis of a popular feed sent for examination by a 
Jacksonville wholesale dealer, whose cus¬ 
tomers had complained of the quality of the feed, and suspecting it of causing the death of his live stock, which is possibly did, an account of the large amount of in¬ 
digestible fibre: 

“Number 332 Stock Feed 

Protein ..10.50 per cent. 

Fats. 1.31 per cent. 

Starch and Sugar .. ..31.95 per cent. 

Fibre. 53-25 per cent.'’ 


More than half this feed was fibre, 
largely indigestible. The commercial value of this sample compared to standard feeds is not to exceed $17.15 per ton, while it is quoted in Jacksonville to-day at $26.- 
00 per ton. 


[The law advocated above was passed by the last legislature. A law similar to and with same provisions as to guarantee of valuable ingredients, as our fertilizer law, with similar penalty and method of execution, drawing of samples and analy¬ 
sis by State Chemist.— Secretary.'] 


Some Invitations. 


The Florida State Horticultural Society is always the recipient of numerous invi¬ 
tations, some of which it cannot accept on account of time, and others are accepted because time is so arranged that the meet¬ 
ings are not interfered with, and the in¬ 
terest, instruction and social functions of the society are thus broadened and en¬ 
joyed by all. 

E. O. Fainter Fertilizer Co.’s Invitation. 

Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Knowing that many of the horticultur¬ 
ists have never had the opportunity of inspecting an acid-making plant, and be¬ 


lieving it would be of interest to them, I, 
therefore, invite your honorable body to visit our plant, in South Jacksonville, on 
Wednesday, May loth, at noon. I have arranged with the ferryboat, which leaves at the foot of Main street at 12 o’clock sharp, to take over all members. It will be necessary for the meeting to adjourn at ten or fifteen minutes to 12 o’clock to give the members ample time to reach the ferry¬ 
boat, which will take them across to the plant. 

I will add, that somewhere on the route a lunch will be served so that the members can return in plenty of time to open the 









126

afternoon session at 2 o'clock. Ladies are especially invited. 

Yours respectfully, 

E. O. Painter, 

President E. O. Painter Fertilizer Co. 

Mr. McCarty—Mr. President, I move that the society accept Mr. Painter’s kind invitation, under the provision, however, 
that he fumigate the acid chambers, throw a tarpaulin over his blood and bone, and will agree not to give us any dissertations upon fertilizers, for we should all I am sure like to visit this large establishment, 
and see for ourselves where and how the fertilizer manufacturers get such euphon¬ 
ious and sweet-sounding if not fragrant names as “Simon Pure,” “Gem” and 
“Ideal” as applied to some of these goods we pay the handsome price of $40 to $45 
per ton for. 

Mr. E. O. Painter—Mr. President, I 
can assure Mr. McCarty that the bad odors will be kept under subjection, and the most fastidious will have no cause for offense, 
but whether he will enjoy the ammonia, 
potash and phosphoric acid that he will partake of during the lunch remains to be seen. 

The invitation was unanimously ac¬ 
cepted. 


Captain Gamer’s Invitation. 

The President—The chair desires to an¬ 
nounce to the society that Captain C. E. 
Garner is with us, and desires to extend personally an invitation for some enter¬ 
tainment of the society. 

Captain Garner—^Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen; The Jacksonville Board of Trade has arranged, as a portion of your entertainment during your delibera¬ 
tions, an excursion on the St. Johns river 


on the Steamer May Garner. The steamer will leave her docks at 10130 a . m ., and I 
wish to extend to you one and all a cordial invitation to go on this little river trip, 
which I trust you will find pleasant and refresh you for your afternoon’s session. 

The President—The chair, for the so¬ 
ciety, extends to Captain Garner and the 
Jacksonville Board of Trade the heartfelt thanks of the society for his kind invita¬ 
tion, which is accepted. 


Wilson Sa Toomer’s Invitation. 

Mk President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The excursion planned by the Board of 
Trade to-morrow on the St. Johns river does not provide for any objective point, 
and if it should meet your pleasure we should like very much indeed to have you stop at “Idealia,” and look over our new modem fertilizer factory, which we believe would prove instructive as well as interest¬ 
ing to a great many members. And while you are in that locality you would also see the new improvements being made along the river front, the large export yards of the Atlantic Coast Line and also the Flor¬ 
ida Naval Stores Co., as well as other industries that are being started in that section. 

Trusting we may have the pleasure of showing you through our factory, we are. 
Yours respectfully, 

Lorenzo A. Wilson, 
President Wilson & Toomer 

Fertilizer Co. 

Mr. Painter—^As the excursion has no objective point to which to take the mem¬ 
bers, I move that the society accept Mr. 
Wilson’s invitation so that the members can see the improvements made in that section.

From the Elks. 

The President—The chair desires to anounce that we have with us his Honor 
Mayor Nolan, who wishes to extend to the society an invitation. 

Mayor Nolan—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Jacksonville Elks 
Lodge has arranged for an illustrated lec¬ 
ture to-night at the Windsor Hotel Audi¬ 
torium, and I am commissioned by the 
Jacksonville Lodge of B. O. E. to extend to you one and all an invitation to attend the lecture. Mr. President, should I not have the pleasure of meeting with you again during the deliberations of this ses¬ 


sion, I trust I may have that pleasure at your next annual session. Jacksonville, as she has always in the past, desires to ex¬ 
tend to you at all times a most cordial invitation to hold your annual sessions in this city, the metropolis of your State. 

Mayor Nolan’s remarks and invitations were received with applause. 

The President—The Florida State Hor¬ 
ticultural Society, through its President and presiding officer, desires to tender the heartfelt thanks of the society for the kind invitations just extended, and particularly to the invitation touching the holding of the next annual session of this society in the city of Jacksonville. 


For Betterment of Report. 


Mr. Hart—Mr. President, before we proceed to the reading and discussion of papers, I desire to call the attention of the society to the unsatisfactory steno¬ 
graphic report of the proceedings of the last annual meeting of the society. 
I assume it is unsatisfactory, it is very much so to myself, as I have been very incorrectly reported, and will not stand for anything in the last report under my name except the Treasurer’s account. 
I note similar complaints from other mem¬ 
bers. I have been an officer of the society for a good many years, and was Secre¬ 
tary, either by election or as assistant, for seven years, and know that a stenogra¬ 
pher’s report is a strange and wonderful thing to deal with. I have always found it very difficult to get a satisfactory report 


of our proceedings, and one that is mis¬ 
leading I consider very hurtful to the society. I would like to have some sug¬ 
gestion from other members as to the befg- 
terment of the service we have heretofore had in this very important matter. 

Sending proof to each one for correc¬ 
tion who takes part in the discussions seems to be the surest means of improve¬ 
ment, and I would recommend it. 

The President—The chair concurs in the remarks of Mr. Hart; it is the opinion of the chair, however, that the Secretary has had the matter of betterment of this very important service under consideration for some time. It seems to be a very dif¬ 
ficult matter to secure competent service. 
While I believe the society has at all times availed itself of the very best assistance in 




128 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


this direction that could be secured for the money we have paid for it, I believe proper steps have been taken by the Secretary in conjunction with the Executive Committee to secure the future betterment of this very important work. At a later hour during the session, the Secretary will bring the matter of his action in the premises before the society, which the chair believes will meet with the approval of the society. 

Mr. Painter—Reverting to the matter of reports of our annual meeting, I believe 
I have been able to arrange for a report that will be satisfactory to the society. I 
find it to be a hard matter to get anyone to take these proceedings at any price, 
or at least at a price the society could af¬ 
ford to pay. The gentleman, Mr. W. G. 
Powell, now with us, who undertakes this important work for the society, at this session was reported to me to be one of the most experienced men in the State, 
and upon careful investigation I was con¬ 
vinced that if he would undertake the report for the society he was able to give us a good, comprehensive report. Mr. 
Powell at first declined to accept this work, 
knowing, as he put it, what he would be tip against, but reconsidered and accepted it. I am assured that this report of our annual proceedings will be the best that can be had. I would therefore move that the Secretary be empowered to pay for this service as per contract agreed upon with him by and with the approval of the 
Executive Committee. 

The President—^The society would be pleased to have any suggestion that Mr. 
Powell may be able to offer for the better¬ 
ment of this important service. 

Mr. Powell—Mr. President, I have had a long experience in reporting the proceed¬ 
ings of deliberative bodies and assemblies in this State, during which time I have 


handled the annual proceedings and report of a great many deliberative societies, in¬ 
cluding our legislative proceedings from time to time, and I beg to assure you that the most arduous duties devolving upon any member of your society is the work of your secretaries and scribes. It has ever been and ever will be from the notes of the scribe that history is written. An old 
Egyptian proverb says: “The scribe gets everything.’’ He does, but he can’t use it, (and an afterthought also reminds me that recent investigations reveal a literal translation from ancient cuniform tables that “scape-goat” could easily be rendered 
“scribe!”) Seriously, though, Mr. Presi¬ 
dent, it is impossible for a reporter single- 
handed to make a verbatim report of a large deliberative body. Such a service would cost a great deal of money. It would take a corps of three reporters and three scribes, therefore the best that can be done is to take as full note of the pro¬ 
ceedings as may be. From such full data a competent scribe may with facility tran¬ 
scribe and compile a very comprehensive and satisfactory report. Indeed this is the way the history of all deliberative bodies is written. To be able to do this even the reporter must have at his fingers’ ends a fund of general encyclopedic knowledge. 
To be able to perfectly report the proceed¬ 
ings of a society of this character he should know the faintest sound of every technical term in Bailey’s work; he should be a fcotanist, a chemist, and know Cush¬ 
ing by heart. If he would report the pro¬ 
ceedings of a medical society, he must know medical jurisprudence and the gen¬ 
eral history of hygiene. If he would report legislative proceedings, he must know political economy and the history of the world. If he would report a bankers' 
association, he ought to be the composite

129 


of a John Law, a Lawson and a national bank examiner. As a rule, Mr. President, 
he is rarely, if ever, any of them. If he were he would not be a scribe, but he must at least have some intuition of what he is to report, some general knowledge of the work undertaken. This alone, Mr. Presi¬ 
dent, is all that I possess, which, with my long experience and the assistance of the officers of your societies, has enabled us to write the history of many of the delibera¬ 
tive bodies of our great and growing State, 
and gives rne the assurance to say that the report of this session of your society will be one of the best it has ever had. 


The President—The society has had considerable trouble in the matter of its reports, but the chair believes that the ar¬ 
rangement now made by the Secretary and 
Executive Committee has been for the bet¬ 
terment of that service, and that the report of the present session will be all that could be desired. The question comes upon the motion of the Secretary that he be em¬ 
powered to pay for this service as per contract for same made by and with the consent of the Executive Committee. All in favor of the motion will say aye; those opposed, no; the ayes have it. It is so ordered. 


Legal Size of the Orange Box. 


The following law relating to the size of the orange box was passed by our last legislature: 

Chapter 5485—(No. 114). 

An Act to Fix and Establish a Legal and 
Standard Box or Crate for Oranges. 

Be it Enacted by the Legislature of the 
State of Florida: 

Section i. That hereafter the legal and standard box or crate for oranges shall measure twelve (12) inches in width and twelve (12) inches in depth on the inside, 
making each end or compartment of said box or crate, whenever the same contains a middle partition, twelve (12) inches in length, twelve (12) inches in depth, and twelve (12) inches in width. No crate or box intended for the sale br shipment, or 


delivery for sale or shipment of oranges, 
except of the standard measure herein specified shall be manufactured or sold. 

Sec. 2. Every box or crate used for the sale or delivery of oranges shall be of the 
Florida standard measure, as above pro¬ 
vided. No person shall use any crate or box for such sale, shipment or delivery, 
except the same be of such standard meas¬ 
ure. Any person violating any of the pro¬ 
visions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) 
or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Provided, 
that nothing herein contained shall prevent the shipment or delivery of oranges for

sale in half boxes as herein described; 
Provided, that nothing in this act shall prevent any person shipping oranges in barrels or other crates over standard size. 
Sec. 3. All laws and parts of laws in 


conflict with the provisions of this act be, 
and the same are hereby repealed. 

Sec. 4. This act shall take effect Janu¬ 
ary I, 1906. 

Approved June 5, 1905. 


The White Fly Act. 


The following act was passed by the last legislature relative to groves, orchards and fruit trees in Orange county: 

Chapter 5551—(No. 180). 

An Act for the Protection of the Groves, 
Orchards and Fruit Trees of Orange 
County from Injurious Insects, and 
Providing for a Horticultural Commis¬ 
sion for Said County for that Purpose. 

Be’ it Enacted by the Legislature of the 
State of Florida: 

Section i. That if there shall be pre¬ 
sented to the Board of County Commis¬ 
sioners of Orange county a petition signed by at least twenty-five freeholders of citrus grove property situate in said county, and setting forth that citrus groves, orchards, 
nursery stock, or fruit trees in said county are infested with white fly, and praying for the appointment of a horticultural commission, the Board of County Com¬ 
missioners, if it has reason to believe the allegations of the petition to be true, shall appoint a horticultural commission for said county within thirty days after the presenting of the petition. 

The horticultural commission shall con¬ 
sist of three commissioners who shall be 


citizens of the State, resident in Orange county, and men well skilled and expe¬ 
rienced in the care and management of orange and other citrus fruit groves. 
They shall hold office for the term of two years from the date of their appointment unless the Board of County Commission¬ 
ers shall determine that no reason exists for the further continuance of the com¬ 
mission. The Board of County Commis¬ 
sioners may fill any vacancy of the com¬ 
mission by appointment for the unexpired term, and may remove any commissioner if good cause is shown. 

f 

Sec. 2. Each horticultural commis¬ 
sioner shall before entering on the duties of his office give a bond to the county in the sum of one thousand dollars condi¬ 
tional for the faithful performance of his duty as such commissioner, with sureties to be provided by the Board of County 
Commissioners and shall also file with the clerk of the Board of County Commis¬ 
sioners an oath that he will faithfully dis¬ 
charge his duties as horticultural commis¬ 
sioner of Orange county. 

Sec. 3. The horticultural commission shall, after qualification, meet and organize with the election of one of its members as 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


chairman, and thereupon it shall become its duty to supervise the methods and means taken for the abatement and de¬ 
struction of the white fly. It shall, as soon as possible, with the approval of the proper officials in charge of the Agricul¬ 
tural Experiment Station in the Univer¬ 
sity of Florida and of the Board of County 
Commissioners of Orange county, make rules prescribing formulas and methods for the treatment of citrus groves, or¬ 
chards, yards, nursery stock, trees of any kind, shrubs, plants or fruit infested with the white fly, and also prescribing the methods, time and frequency of applica¬ 
tion, and shall have said rules published for free distribution. 

Sec. 4. The commission or any one of its members shall have power to examine any citrus grove, orchard, yard, nursery stock trees of any kind, shrubs, plants or fruit for the purpose of determining whether the white fly exists therein or thereon, and if the same shall be found infested, the commission shall notify the owner, agent or person in charge, in writ¬ 
ing that the same is infested, and shall serve him with a copy of the said rules and shall require him to treat the same according to said rules beginning at a specified time, which notice may be signed by any member of the commission and shall be served by any commissioner or by any person appointed by the commis¬ 
sion for that purpose in the manner di¬ 
rected for the service of a writ of sum¬ 
mons. The commission shall keep a record of all such notices and of the name of the person upon whom and by whom and when the notice was served. If any owner or agent of any vacant property cannot be found in the county, the com¬ 
mission may enter for the purpose herein¬ 


131 

after provided without such notice. If the owner, agent or person in charge neglects or refuses to comply with the notice for one week after the'expiration of the time named therein, the commission or any commissioner may enter the property de¬ 
scribed in the notice and proceed to make treatment at actual cost for the white fly according to the commission’s published rules. In such case the commission shall, 
when the treatment at that time is com¬ 
pleted, render to the owner, agent or per¬ 
son in charge an itemized bill of the actual cost of the treatment aforesaid, including the necessary per diem of one commis¬ 
sioner and a statement of the time when the said bill will be presented to the Board of County Commissioners. At the speci¬ 
fied time a duplicate of the bill verified by affidavit of at least one of the horticultural commissioners shall be presented to the 
Board of County Commissioners, and upon a hearing the Board of County Com¬ 
missioners shall allow the said bill or such part of it as shall appear to them to be proper and just, and if the said bill be not paid by the owner, agent or person in charge, it shall be paid out of the general revenue fund of the county, and such pay¬ 
ment by the county shall be a lien upon the property treated, and notice of such lien shall be filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court of Orange county within sixty days after the warrant for the payment aforesaid has been drawn in like manner as notices of lien of me¬ 
chanics and material men are filed. Such lien may be foreclosed in chancery, but no bill for foreclosure shall be filed until one year has elapsed from the recording of the lien. 

Sec. 5. The Board of County Commis¬ 
sioners shall purchase the necessary ap- 


132 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


paratus and materials for making the treatment and carrying out the rules afore¬ 
said, and upon the request of any owner, 
agent or person in charge of any infested place as aforesaid, shall treat same as aforesaid at actual cost: Provided^ That the cost, if required, be first paid or se¬ 
cured. Whenever the horticultural com¬ 
mission shall report to the board that any wild or uncultivated land is infested with the white fly, the said board may order the same treated at the expense of the county. 

Sec. 6. The members of the horticul¬ 
tural commission shall be paid $2.50 for each day they are actually engaged in the discharge of the work of the commission, 
and this compensation shall be paid by the 
Board of County Comrnissioners out of the general revenue fund; Provided, That the per diem of one commissioner shall be included as part of the amount for which any lien is filed. The Board of County 
Commissioners is hereby authorized and directed to pay such sums as may be neces¬ 
sary out of the general revenue fund to carry out the provisions of this act. 


Sec. 7. The horticultural commission shall make full quarterly reports to the 
Board of County Commissioners showing what work, if any, has been done, and the character and kind of insect pests found and the remedies applied and the result of such remedies. In case any San Jose scale is found within the county the proceedings shall be the same as hereinbefore provided for the white fly, except that only one board of horticultural commissioners shall at any one time exist in Orange county. 
If the Board of County Cotnmissioners should at any time abolish the horticul¬ 
tural commission as hereinbefore provided, 
and a new petition as prescribed by Section 
I shall be presented, the Board of County 
Commissioners may appoint another hor¬ 
ticultural commission, if it thinks proper so to do. 

Sec. 8 . This act shall take effect imme¬ 
diately upon its approval by the Governor. 

Approved May 27, 1905.

CATALOGUE OF FRUITS, 


ADOPTED BY THE SOCIETY AT THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL 

MEETING. 

In making a complete Catalogue of the Fruits of Florida, indicating intelligi¬ 
bly, in summarized and tabular form, the relative value of varieties for different sections, the wide-stretching territory, diversity of soil and climate, and the lim¬ 
ited range of each of the numerous fruits, render it essential that the State be divid¬ 
ed, so that regions allied throughout in their adaptability to fruits may be desig¬ 
nated and referrred to. 

To this end, four districts have been formed, as described below. Geographi¬ 
cal lines cannot be made to indicate pomological conditions with accuracy. More than approximate correctness could not be expected from an arbitrary division of this kind, especially where local conditions vary so greatly as in Florida. Work¬ 
ing by general averages, some sections are unavoidably left in the wrong districts, 
judging by the standard of local conditions. The divisions, however, will be found to answer their purpose better, than any that could be made without fur¬ 
ther sub-divisions, which would be impracticable. 

WESTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State west of the Au- 
cilla river. 

EASTERN NORTH FLORIDA—That part of the State between the Au- 
cilla river and a straight line drawn across the State from the mouth of the St. 
Johns river to Cedar Keys. 

CENTRAL FLORIDA—^That part of the State between the line above re¬ 
ferred to and the counties constituting South Florida. 

SOUTH FLORIDA—The counties of Brevard, Dade, Monroe, Lee, De- 
Soto and Manatee.

CITRUS FRUITS. 


SWEET ORANGES —Citrus aurantium. 


Note. —The development of orange culture in this State has given rise to a multiplicity of varieties, many of which, while meritorious, have no distinctive qualities, or superiority, as compared with others. It has been deemed advisable to omit the names of many varieties which have disap¬ 
peared from cultivation. The list, however, is still large. 

The names in heavy type are designed to constitute a complete list for the State, embracing varieties of the highest excellence in all the desired characteristics of season, quality, distinctiveness, 
productiveness, etc The names in light type are those whose characteristics are possessed in an equal or superior degree by other varieties which appear in heavy type. Some varieties in light type equal others in heavy type having the same characteristics but where there is a difference it is in favor of the varieties in heavy type. In cases of equal excellence, the best known has the preference. 
So that the varieties in heavy type, as a whole, and without disparagement to other excellent sorts, 
maybe said to embrace the leading kinds for general culture 

New, or comparatively unknown varieties also appear in light type; but for this distinction see 
“Adaptability” column. 


Note. —In referring to the time of ripening, in the column headed “Season”, “very early” ap¬ 
plies to varieties marketed in September and October; “early”, to October and November varieties; 
“early medium”, November and December; “medium”, December. January and February; “late medium”, February and March; “late”, March and April; “very late”, April, May and later. 


Note. —The region of orange production proper extends southward from Central Florida, 
overlapping the upper portion of Southern Florida. Therefore, under “Adaptability” below the va¬ 
rieties have been starred for “Southern Florida”; here, however, the starring applies more particu¬ 
larly to the upper portion of the district.

Remarks —On varieties as numbered above: Nos. 8 and 25, desirable early sorts: 5, 23 and 28, 
distinct; 6, distinctly corrugated, desirable; 1 and 10, ver desirable late sorts; 11, 12, 13, 17, 21 
and 26, desirable; 6, 7 and 18 came from Thomas Rivers, of England, the well-known nurseryman. 

Of Sweet Oranges, the leading fruit crop of the State, and great staple of the Central region, 
over five million boxes were produced in the season of 1894-95. 

The Navel Varieties are much esteemed on account of the delicate texture and superior quality of their fruit. They are usually shy bearers, although experience indicates that they are much more prolific upon “rough” lemon and trifoliata stocks than,as generally grown, upon orange stocks.

; 

Thb Blood Varieties are sweet, and therefore marketable, early in season, as indicated by th« abbreviations in the “Season” column. At this time their distinctive character is not apparent, 
and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts. As the season advances, their ruby tints develop, until quite apparent on the exterior,and their quality continues to improve until, at full ripeness, they are equaled by few and surpassed by none. In locations sufficiently exempt from frost to permit their being held on the trees until they reach perfection, they bring high prices and are exceptionally profitable. 

Other Varieties. —Excluding the Navels, Bloods and Satsuma, noted above, and without dis¬ 
paragement to other sorts of equal merit, the following are suggested as a desirable list for general planting, arranged in order of succession: Very Early, Boone, Sweet Seville; Early, Enterprise Seed¬ 
less, Parson Brown; Early Medium, Nonpareil, Centennial; Medium, Pineapple, Jaffa, Homosassa; 
Late Medium, Majorca, Du Roi; Late, Bessie, Maltese Oval; Very Late, Hart 

Varieties distinctly marked in their exterior appearance, like the Navels, Bloods, Du Roi, etc., 
are, other things being equal, most desirable for market.

Remarks —No. 1, a favorite in the New Orleans market; No. 2, the favorite of the group. The 
Satsuma is valued on account of its hardiness, which is increased by being budded on the entirely hardy C. trifoliata. It is much planted in sections north of the usual range of oranges.

The Pomelo. —Growing the Pomelo for market is a development of the past fifteen or tw«ity years; but large quantities of this fruit are now shipped from the State and its culture is rapidly ex tending. It has proved popular in the general market and its culture is very profitable. Its range of adaptability is about the same as that of the orange. Most of the older trees were planted before named varieties were introduced. The above list comprises the leading varieties now generally planted.

The Lemon. —Lemon growing in Florida is an industry of some importance, the crop of 1894 
being estimated at 150,000 boxes. The tree stands less cold than the orange, and planting is confined to lower latitudes and locations of comparative frost exemption. The foregoing varieties are highly esteemed and generally planted.

Remarks. —The Peach is successfully grown in localities throughout the greater part of the State, and in some districts is extensively produced for shipment to Northern mar¬ 
kets. As a rule, for this purpose, only those varieties are grown which are marked “early” and 
“very early” in the above table, and which come in before the general crop farther north. To this there are some exceptions, notably in Western North Florida, where some mid-season varieties, like 
Elberta, are successfully grown for shipment. 

While the list of peaches grown in the State embraces many varieties, the various sections, 
covering a wide range of latitude and longitude,differ to such an extent in soil,climate and conditions of local environment, that the varieties adapted to a particular region are comparatively limited in number. A first and vital essential to successful peach production is the adaptability of variety to locality; in general this is true of peaches to a greater extent than other fruits, and especially so in 
Florida. 

No. 21 is of peculiar shape, being elongated, with deep suture, and sharp recurved point. It is very sweet as its name “Honey” indicates; This variety comes from China and is the progenitor of a race of peaches well suited to the central and northern sections of the State. No. 38, the Peen-to, is also possessed of marked individual characteristics; its shape being flat like a tomato, and unless grown with fertilizers rich in phosphoric acid and potash is apt to be possessed of a bitter almond or noyau flavor. It comes from Southern China or Java and the varieties that have originated from it have given us a sub-tropical race of peaches well adapted to Southern and Central Florida. It is safe to say that nine-tenths of the commercial peach culture of peninsular Florida is confined to the varieties that have been or^inated from the above two introductions from the Orient. It should be mentioned, however, that neither the varieties that have originated from the Honey or from the Peen- 
to retain to such a marked extent the shape of the parent. Those that have originated from the Honey show a tendency to the recurved point but in a less marked degree. Those that have originated from ihe Peen-to are of regular peach shape.

Remarks. —2, 9, 11, almost free from fungous diseases; 1, 3, 4, 5, 10; 13, subject to fungous dis¬ 
eases in wet seasons; 7, 12, 14, subject to fungous diseases; 7, stars apply especially to the East Coast. 

Grapes. —In many locations throughout the State varieties (as indicated by the starring above) 
succeed well, and are grown for shipment to Northern markets as well as for local consumption and the manufacture of wine. 

For Market. —Delaware, Niagara, and Ives (only) have proved a success as shipping grapes for distant markets (when properly packed). Diamond, on account of its compactness and tendency to crack, does not stand long shipment. 

For Red Wine. —Cynthiana, Norton and Ives are the red-wine grapes of Florida, as they are the red-wine grapes of the United States. Especially is this true of the first two named; their juice is dark and rich in saccharine matter, and the wine made from these two grapes is said to possess great medicinal properties, owing to its large percentage of tannin. 

For White Wine. —Elvira, Delaware and Niagara are, among the varieties above named, the best grapes for white wine—especially dry wine. It is from Elvira that the famous San Luis Sau- 
ternes are made, which have established the reputation of Florida wines. Delaware is better adapted to the manufacture of sweet wine, and from Niagara a good dry wine can be made—much superior to tha article made from Northern grown Niagaras, our Florida Niagaras being almost entirely free from that foxy taste so prominent in all Northern Labruscas. 

European Varieties (V. vinifera.)—The U. 8. Department of Agriculture, Division of Pomo¬ 
logy, has established an experimental vineyard of European varieties, about 550 vines of 175 varieties

rupestris, are now in their fifth year and so far are remarkably successful. 

Other Varieties. —Besides the varieties described in the list above, other varieties may do we., 
in particular localities or favored locations, and may be satisfactorily grown for family use, but varieties not included in this Catalogue should not be attempted on a large scale until their value has been demonstrated by experiment.

Remarks —The Muscadine Grapes are prodigious growers and bear heavy crops of fruit. 
They are very popular in the South, where they are used for dessert and for making wine and jelly, 
but they are not grown for Northern market.

The Kaki succeeds well throughout the State, and is generally, though not extensively, 
grown. For market this delicious fruit has the merit of shipping well and keeping long. 
While new markets are often reluctant to take hold of it, wherever known it sells well. 

Nomenclature.—While there has been much confusion in regard to the names of vari¬ 
eties, the above kinds are now as well known as the leading varieties of other fruit; they embrace the most valuable kinds, and the names as given are correctly applied. 

Characteristics.—Some of the varieties have dark flesh, others light flesh, still others a mixture of the two. The light and dark flesh differ radically in texture and consistency as well as appearance, and when found in the same fruit are never blended, but always dis¬ 
tinct. The dark flesh is never astringent; the light flesh is astringent until it softens. The dark-fleshed fruit is crisp and meaty, like an apple, and is edible before it matures. Some of the entirely dark-fleshed kinds improve as they soften, like Hyakume and Yeddoichi; oth¬ 
ers are best when still hard, like Zengi and Tabers No. 129. As they are good to eat before they are ripe, it is not so important that the dark-fleshed kinds be allowed to reach a certain stage before being offered to consumers unfamiliar with the fruit. The light-fleshed kinds, 
and those with mixed light and dark flesh, are very delicious when they reach the custard- 
like consistency of full ripeness. In some the stringency disappears as the fruit begins to soften, as the Yemen, and in a less degree withOkame and Tanenashi; in others it persists until the fruit is full ripe, as with Tsuru. The light-fleshed kinds should not be offered to con¬ 
sumers unacquainted with the fruit until in condition to be eaten. A person who has attempted to eat one of them when green and “puckery” will not be quick to repeat the experiment. 
Seeds accompany the dark flesh. The light-fleshed kinds are seedless. The kind with mixed flesh have seeds in proportion to the quantity of dark flesh. Hyakume, Zengi and Hachiya are usually overspread at the blossom end with penciling or net-work of dark lines, and this sometimes occurs in other kinds. 

Varieties.—Tanenashi, Okame, Yemon and Yeddoichi excel in quality, perhaps in the order named. Okame (on account of the difficulty of getting the fruits all in the same stage of ripeness) and Hachiya are not as good shippers as the othere; the latter is valued for its 
Immense size and showiness. Okame, on accoimt of its long season, exquisite beauty, and superior quality, is the best for home use and local market. Zengi and Tabers No. 129 are val¬ 
ued for their earliness, as are Tsuru and Costata for thedr lateness. Costata is very distinct and handsome in both tree and fruit. Hyakume is most generally grown of the dark- 
fleshed kinds. Tanenashi is, perhaps, most highly esteemed in the market. 

Stock.—^The Kaki should be grafted on the native persimmon, on which it is much more satisfactory than upon its own or imported stocks.

Remarks. —Nos. 1 and 2, home use; 12, unsatisfactory bearer; 13, enormously productive; 14 
and 15, superior quality acid; 16, most desirable. 

Apples and Apricots —Are not recommended for general culture, although the varieties named give fair results in the home orchard in the regions indicated. 

The Fig —A most delicious fruit for the table and culinary use, thrives everywhere. It is not grown for shipment, except when canned or preserved, in which form it finds a ready market at high prices, but is one of the most valuable and gotierally grown home-use-and-local-market fruits. All the varieties named are desirable. 

Mulberries —Are well adapted to all sections. They are largely grown for swine, poultry, and as a toll for birds; and, by some, the more acid kinds-are esteemed for table use. 

The Pomegranate —An agreeable fruit, desirable for occasional use, and especially valuable ai 
^ ornamental shrub or tree, is not generally grown for market, but most plantations have a few trees. 
There are several new choice varieties being tried.

Dewberries, also Blackberries in some varieties succeed admirably in the regions indicated, 
but are not cultivated to any considerable extent, owing to the abundance of native, wild berries. 
The Manatee Dewberry, and the Northey, presumably a hybrid, have proved satisfactory in many localities. 

Loquats —Are grown in a small way for home consumption. They are a desirable fruit for table, as well as culinary use. At present the Loquat is propagated largely from seed, and the fruit varies greatly in size and quality. A number of varieties have been introduced from California and are being tested. 

Olives. —Many trees have been planted, and there are some old groves. The varieties, of which there are many, are not sufficiently known in this State to catalogue.

from cold. In South Central Florida they require artificial heat to protect them from frost during the winter. Further North they cannot be successfully grown except under glass. ^ 

The Spanish, Porto Rico, and Cayenne are grown most extensively for market. The Egyptian 
Queen, and Pernambuco are grown for market less extensively. These remarks apply to the East 

Coast. u • 1 . 

In the numerous and expensive shedded pineries of Orange County and the West Coast, which 

are cultivated on an intensive system, the Cayenne is planted almost exclusively.

Remabks —On varieties as numbered above. Nos. 1, 2 and 4, general market; 3, 5 and 7, home 

use. 

Commercial Banana Culture is confined to the extreme lower portion of the peninsula. 
Varieties. —The Baracoa is the ordinary Red Banana of commerce The Cavendish (M. 
Cavendishii) is a dwarf species, also known as “Dwarf,” “Dwarf Jamaica,” “Chinese.” 
Except the Orinoco, Hart’s Choice has a more northern range than the other sorts. The Orinoco matures further north than any other variety, it is an ordinary plantain (M. paradisaica sapientum) as distinguished from the Banana or Sweet Plantain (of which Baracoa and Golden are varieties); when allowed to ripen on the plant, it is of good quality, and desirable for home use, in sections too far north for other kinds.

The Gtjava is extensively grown in Central and Southern Florida for home use, local market, 
and the manufacture of jelly. It is a most delicious fruit for dessert, as well as cooking and preserv¬ 
ing. There are numerous varieties, as yet unclassified. The hardy kinds, Cattley and Chinese, have about the same range as oranges. 


MfINGOES— Mangifera Indica. 


(See Explanation of Abbreviations on page iv.) 



Remarks.—A large number of seedling mangoes are grown. Many of these are referred to as No. 11, and, while they have a group resemblance to one another, still they are distinct in varietal characteristics. A considerable number of named va/rieties are now being tested. 
Among these may be mentioned, AJfonse, Soondershaw, and Gordon.

Nuts.—The pecan has long been grown in the State in a small way; it flourishes in many localities and its culture is profitable. In addition to the four varieties above listed, other good varieties as yet only of local repute, will undoubtedly become prominent in the near future. The Japan chestnut, of comparatively recent introduction, has proved fairly well adapted, but hardly worthy of extensive commercial culture. The Japan walnut, of still more recent introduction, bears well and makes a remarkably handsome tree, but is not up to the standard of the best English walnuts in quality. 

Extensive Gocoanut plantations are to be found on the southern coast. Little or no attention has been paid to varieties.

Remarks. —Since 1895 strawberry culture has been largely extended, especially on the Western slope of the peninsula. The Newnan has been allowed to degenerate and the fruit is now rather small for shipment. The Hoffman does better on clay than on sandy lands and needs high fertilizing. 
The Cloud is vigorous in North Florida and stands drouth well; prolific early in the season. Not liked so well in South Florida. Rising is very vigorous and prolific, a firm berry and an ex¬ 
cellent shipper. Its foliage, however, grows rather open and it does not protect its fruit well against a frost The Phenomenal seems to be almost identical with the Hoffman in physical characteristics, 
but it has a longer season in South Florida. In Bradford county Aroma and Middleton’s Early have been tested by individuals and reported on favorably. Glen Mary, Hood River, Dollar, Warfield, Star, 
Robbins Early, Splendid, Pride of Cumberland and Gandy have been tested and condemned. Klon¬ 
dike is a recent introduction of great promise, and has been given a place in the list of desirable va¬ 
rieties.

PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 


NINETEENTH ANNUAL MEETING 

OF THE 


Florida State Horticultural Society* 


The Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the 
Florida State Horticultural Society was held in the Auditorium of the Windsor 
Hotel commencing on the evening of 
May 1st 1906. 

The opening meeting was unusually well attended and the different addresses were greatly appreciated by the audience. Not¬ 
withstanding the weather during the three days was intensely hot the sessions were fairly well attended. 

The latest introduction into the Society was the “Question Box,” and it proved quite interesting, as will be seen by. the printed questions and answers in this report. This is a feature that the mem¬ 
bers can take advantage of, even if they are not in attendance, by sending their cpiestions to the president by mail, which 


will be opened and answered during the sessions. 

The Board of Trade delighted the members with another one of its famous musicales, rendered by the “Ladies 
Friday Musicale.” So very popular are these musicales that the commodious hall of the Board of Trade building was packed to standing room. 

There was a spirited contest when the question of the next place of meeting came up, between those who wanted to come again to Jacksonville and those who preferred to visit other parts of the State. 
St. Petersburg was well represented, and won the day, so that the Twentieth An¬ 
nual Meeting will be held in the “Gem 
City of the West Coast.”

Addresses of Welcome. 




BY HON. D. U. FLETCHER. 


Mr. Fletcher spoke extemporaneously and rather rapidly, so we are only able to give more than an outline of his happy and well received address. 

Among other things he said: A day or two ago I received a letter from Secretary 
Painter informing me that he had called me up over the telephone and requested me to perform tonight, that he had print¬ 
ed the programs, putting my name on them and enclosed one, hoping I would be present. I told him that, under the circumstances, I would be here although the notice gave me no chance for any pre¬ 
paration. I approve of the Secretary’s way, however. He accomplishes what he wants and in the easiest, most satisfactory manner. He gets his speaker and the lat¬ 
ter has no time to make excuses or get nervous. 

There is nothing the Horticultural So¬ 
ciety could ask of me that I would not make an effort to grant. We give you a warm welcome, but the weather seems in¬ 
clined to over-do the thing. It is un¬ 
necessary for me to emphasize the warmth of our greeting, and I assure vou that is equally true of its sincerity. 

I would feel very much more at home probably discussing some other subject than Horticulture. If our friend Painter should sell a lot of fertilizer and accept a four months note in payment, which he negotiated at the bank, and the parties re¬ 
fused to pay on the ground the fertilizer was not beneficial, I could sav whether or 


not he would have it to pay; or if Mr. 
Taber should send out nursery stock to be paid for at a certain time, reserving the title to the trees, I might answer as to whether or not the purchaser could keep the trees without paying the price as agreed. 

If this were an agricultural gathering 
I would be much more at home. I have liad some experience raising nubbin corn and bumble bee cotton. Nubbin corn is that kind too poor to shuck, and the cotton referred to is the kind which a bumble bee can suck the top blossom off while sitting on the ground. You have heard of the Doc¬ 
tor who had a patient with fever, and after doing all he could for him, he gave him some medicine at last that threw the pa¬ 
tient into convulsions and when asked why he did so, he stated that he had treated him for days and days for fever and he did not know how to cure the fever, 
1 :)ut he did know how to cure fits and so was giving him something to throw him into fits. If I could change this Conven¬ 
tion into an Agricultural Convention there are many things I could speak of from experience. 

Horticulture is a kind of high toned agriculture, or the elite of agricultural pursuits. I imagine this thing of stand¬ 
ing on the shady side of an orange tree and watching its beautiful leaves and en¬ 
joying its odoriferous flowers while culti¬ 
vating it, following it as the sun moves

from one side to the other, is very much better and more pleasant than chopping cotton or plowing corn out in the open, 
where the unobstructed rays of the sun beat upon you, and no prospect pleases. 

There can be few things more impor¬ 
tant than this great industry you are de¬ 
veloping and fostering. As we recall in 
1899, the value of the fruit products of the United States was $131,000,000 and the vegetable products, not including po¬ 
tatoes was $131,000,000, and we exported over $9,000,000 worth during that year. 
The life of the Horticulturist is one of the most joyous and free allotted to man. 
If we did not have any freezes, or if we could avoid the consequences of them; 
or if we were not troubled with foot rot, 
and if the white fly would leave us alone, 
and if it rained when it should and ceased when it ought, and if we had satisfactory transportation, and if we could hit the market right, and if we were given proper treatment by consignees, and if a few other things happened, or didn’t happen, 
your meetings would partake more of the nature of an annual celebration and you would be touring the country in automo¬ 
biles. 

Now, this is the reason you are here; 
the purpose of this organization is to sur¬ 
mount the obstacles of this little word, 
“if.” There can be no better or higher purpose of any organization. To solve the questions how to preserve for the human race the necessary food products is a work worthy the brightest minds, the greatest skill, the most persistent industry. 
It demands the highest and best activities of the most gifted men and women. It calls for the exercise of judgment. It l)roceeds upon inve.stigation and study. 
It must have the knowledge born of ex- 
])erieuce. 


We read of the great scientists and statesmen who have won distinction and whose names will be known as long as we have history, but I would ask you wheth¬ 
er Copernicus, Gallileo, Michael Angelo, 
or Isaac Newton accomplished more for the world than the men who have made, 
developed, and placed on our tables our fruits, flowers and vegetables in their perfection. Of these great scientists who have won distinction, is there any one more entitled to fame than the man who introduced and developed the potato, ap¬ 
ple, peach, rose, or made the white black¬ 
berry and the spineless cactus. Is there one more entitled to fame or to whom man¬ 
kind is more indebted than to Luther 
Burbank, the American naturalist? 

Our Legislature meets every two years and passes laws affecting the welfare of the people of this State; there is no more important matter which can command the attention of our law makers and officials than the requests of this Society. I can conceive that you might be aided in your efforts by legislation along certain lines and surely there will be found patriotism and public spirit sufficient to give a hearty response to your appeal and a generous support to your work. There is no more important organization in this State than vours, and your work for the industrial development of Florida and for the material welfare of her people should meet with every encouragment from every quarter. 

It is a great pleasure to welcome you here—peculiarly wholesome and joyous and an honor to come in touch with the noble men and women from all portions of the State, who live nearest the fountain of life in the Divine Economy! 

Jacksonville recognizes that whatever makes for the prosperity of any portion 



i 6

of the State is a thing to be desired. She has no prejudices—she reaches out to all sections and would promote the good of each. She loves all the people of the whole State and would have them pros¬ 


per and their various undertakings and enterprises succeed. In this spirit she wishes your meeting here may be profit¬ 
able, and again bids you welcome. 


ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRADE. 


BY CAPT. C. E. GARNER. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In behalf of the Board of Trade and representing the business interests of our city, it is again my pleasure to extend to you Mr. President, the officers, and to every member of the Florida State Horti¬ 
cultural Society, a most hearty and sin¬ 
cere welcom.e. 

I had in mind telling you a great many things. I had conceived of a magnificent oration, expressing my personal senti¬ 
ments of the Horticultural Society, of its splendid work in behalf of our beloved 
State, and I also had in mind telling you something of the progress and prosperity of our city; but, to use the yachting phrase, “my little craft has had the wind taken out of its sails” by the eloquence of the gentleman who has just preceded me. 

If any one in this audience thinks they can follow the Hon. D. U. Fletcher along the same lines, and especially in the mat¬ 
ter of delivering an address of welcome, 
and say anything original, or anything appropriate to the occasion which has not already been said, I would like for him to step up on this platform and take my place because I feel utterly unable to con¬ 
ceive of anything that is appropriate that would not be a reiteration of what had been stated. 


I wish, therefore, to simply express my high appreciation not only of the Horti¬ 
cultural Society as an organization but of the Horticulturists of the State of Florida. 

Probably no man within the bounds of the State has been brought in closer con¬ 
tact with them than myself. It is not an acquaintance of a few days or a few years but for a quarter of a century I have known them, and know them intimately, 
and I wish on this occasion to say that they are in my judgment the bravest, 
most heroic class of people in this country. 

I know of their struggles, I have seen them under all circumstances, of pros¬ 
perity and adversity, chiefly the latter, 
and if you wish to measure the heroism of people you must be acquainted with them under all conditions, and I know of no people who have withstood adversit}' 
with a braver spirit than have the Horti¬ 
culturists of this State. 

You talk about the rebuilding of your city, the rebuilding of Baltimore, the re¬ 
habilitation of San Francisco from the ter¬ 
rible disaster that has just befallen that fair city, I have in mind the struggles of your horticulturists against all sorts of unfavorable conditions and disasters. 
They have been attacked by the white fly, 
that threatened their industry; the red

ant, foot-rot, blight, drought, and in some instances too much moisture. They have seen the result of the labor of years level¬ 
ed to the ground and have surmounted all these and have never appealed, received aid, nor had any insurance, but have gone bravely to work replanting, and today it can be truthfully said that never in the history of the State have the horticul¬ 
tural interests been in as good condition. 

I am reminded of an old friend of mine who came to Florida in the early eighties, 
bought a piece of land on the banks of the St. Johns River, planted a grove and expected it to support him the balance of his days without any further effort on his part. He used to confide his troubles in me, and he was of an optimistic turn of mind. If his crop was a partial failure he would say “Well, that is not altogether bad because I will get better prices.” 
When he lost the entire crop he said, 
“Well, it is not altogether bad because 
I can bud better varieties in the stumps. 
I am learning every day.” Said he was going to protect his grove against frost in the future. There was never any disaster so great but in his mind it might have been worse. He was I'eally typical of the average horticulturists of Florida as I 
have observed them, and he reminds me somewhat of a story that I heard about a man who went out West and engaged in the growing of stock. After being away about ten years he came back and one day walked into the store of an old friend who said “Well, John, where have you been?” John replied “out West.” 

“How have you been getting along?” 


“Well,” he said, “not so very good and not so very bad.” 

“What have you been doing,” inquired the friend. 

“I went into the sheep business.” 

“Well,” said the friend, “that is’good.” 

“Well,” said John, “not so very good because the sheep all died.” 

His friend said, “Well that is bad.” 

“Not so very bad,” said John, “because a rich widow sympathized with me in my misfortune and I married her.” 

“Well,” his friend said, “that’s good.” 

John said, “Well, not so very good be¬ 
cause she was a regular virago and had a terrible temper.” 

“Well,” his friend said, “that’s bad.” 

“Well,” said John, “not very bad be¬ 
cause she built a great big fine house.” 

The friend remarked, “Well, that cer¬ 
tainly was^ good.” 

“No,” said John, “not so very good because the house burned down.” 

The friend said, “Well,” that certainly was bad.” 

“No,” said John, “that was not so very bad because the woman was consumed with the house.” 

So it is with my friend. He says now that he sees a great many good things that have grown out of the freeze. He had diversified his crops; is more prosper¬ 
ous possibly than if the freeze had not occurred, and he and the other horticul¬ 
turists of the State, who are a people that adversity cannot overcome, and that no amount of prosperity can spoil, are en¬ 
titled to all the success that should come to intelligence, industry, perseverance, and courage. 


Response to Addresses of Welcome. 


BY G. L. TABER. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In a Society like ours there are some¬ 
times pleasant duties to perform and the task you have assigned me, of re¬ 
plying to these generous words of wel¬ 
come, is amongst these pleasant ones. 
During our annual meeting some of our members are called upon to speak on cer¬ 
tain well defined subjects, assigned them in advance that have to do with the dif¬ 
ferent phases of Horticulture; and while these duties, never considered onerous, are generally cheerfully complied with, the members who make these Committee Re¬ 
ports, as well as others that follow in dis¬ 
cussion, are supposed to confine them¬ 
selves, rather closely, to the subject in hand. In my case, however, Mr. Presi¬ 
dent, it is different, for custom has de¬ 
creed, wisely or unwisely, that more than the three words “We thank you” is ex¬ 
pected of him who makes response to an 
Address of Welcome; and this, notwith¬ 
standing all the heart-felt sincerity with which those words can be imbued, or the emphasis with which they can be spoken. 

And now, Mr. President, having defin¬ 
ed my independent position, permitted to touch on few or many things, and these in a light or serious vein as my fancy dictat¬ 
es—I wish to tell a stor}^ My story ori¬ 
ginated in a State some distance remov¬ 
ed from Florida, namely. North Dakota. 

An automobilist traveling through that untropical country found himself with a disabled machine and without proper tools to repair it. 


He called at a near by farm house and asked the owner, a Swede, for a monkey wrench. The Swede replied that he had none. “Do you know of anyone in the vicinity who has a monkey wrench” ? ask¬ 
ed the traveler. “Nay” replied the 
Swede, “may bradder, ’bout eigh miles from hayer ban got cattle ranch, may bradder-law. Ole Olson, ’bout sex miles, 
ban got shape ranch; but Nort’ Dakota too blame cauld for anybody keep monkey ranch.” Now Mr. President notwith¬ 
standing the more favorable climatic con¬ 
ditions that exists here, I have never heard of a monkey ranch in Florida, and, 
even if there were, I take it that you would rule its discussion out of order un¬ 
less introduced in some Horticultural con¬ 
nection, such as “Anima(la)ted Lad¬ 
ders,” “monkeys as orange pickers” or 
“The horticultural possibilities of our friend and one time relative, the mon¬ 
key.” Mr. President upon mature consid¬ 
eration I am convinced that even under any such horticultural disguises as those mentioned, further consideration of the subject would be bootless. I therefore re¬ 
quest you that all future allusion to the subject be barred and particularly that no monkey business be allowed to enter the question box—which will be opened later. 

Mr. President, there is one danger that always besers a man who tempted to make humourous remarks and that is that having made them (provided always that his hearers interpret them as such) he finds it rather hard work to get back on

to serious ground; or at least to convince his audience that the lighter vein has been abandoned. I wish to assure you, how¬ 
ever, that the remaining words I have to say are strictly and sincerely serious. 

Eighteen years ago the Florida State 
Horticultural Society was organized at 
Ocala. By a coincidence the figures eigh¬ 
teen also represent the number of our charter members. Of these just one-half have since passed into the Great Beyond. 
Of the remainder some have removed from the State, others are incapacitated by sickness, and a survey of this audience fails to reveal the presence at this meet¬ 
ing of a single conferee who assisted me at the birth of this Society. Looked at from the standpoint of losses of illustrious members, both of those who were with us at the beginning and others who joined afterwards, retrospection carries with it so much of sadness that I hasten to turn to the brighter side. That there is a brighter side is plainly evinced by the fact that notwithstanding our heavy losses by death and otherwise our last annual re¬ 
port showed a membership of 519. While the majority of these are located in the 
State, yet a review of the addresses shows that in addition to Florida, seventeen Stat¬ 
es and nine foreign countries are repre¬ 
sented in our membership, as follows: 

States: Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, 
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, 
New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Texas and Vermont. 

Foreign Countries: Australia, Asia, 
Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Mexico, New 
Zealand, Porto Rico and South Africa. 

Now, Mr. President, it is not my pur¬ 
pose to go into detail of what this So¬ 
ciety has accomplished. Our comprehen¬ 
sive annual repKDrts, published for many 


consecutive years past, contain full re¬ 
cords of our efforts and our accomplish¬ 
ments. But I make the broad assertion that no other State Horticultural Society in America has done more toward further¬ 
ing the horticultural progress of a State and that none other can show such an in¬ 
terest in its work as evinced by a world¬ 
wide membership. I wish also, Mr. Pres¬ 
ident, to call the attention of these gentle¬ 
men, who have so kindly welcomed us. to the fact that what we have accomplished we have done within ourselves, without outside help. The only exception to this statement is that a dozen years ago, for two years in succession, 1893 and 1894, 
our proceedings were published by the 
State Department of Agriculture, through 
Hon. L. B. Wombwell, Commissioner. 
While many State Societies have looked to liberal legislatures to assist them in their efforts toward upbuilding the Hor¬ 
ticultural interest of their States, we have looked only to our own membership; 
whatever assistance has been necessary has, with the exception already cited, 
come from within our ranks. 

Now, Mr. President, I believe this is all wrong. The fault may have been with ourselves in not having sufficiently appre¬ 
ciated or urged our claims, but I believe the time has come when we should ask, 
and should receive, from the Florirla Leg¬ 
islature appropriations which shall in some measure relieve the, approximately, 
five hundred members of this Society from carrying on at their own expense a work that is of so much benefit to evei'y one of the more than 500,000 people that comprise our population. For, Mr. Pre- 
ident, it is so true as to be axiomatic that back of the lasting commercial prosperity of a country stands the producer, the one who evolves from Mother Earth her fin-

ished products; and just to the extent that he can throw safeguards around these productions, increase their quantity and improve their quality, just to that extent is the commercial prosperity of that coun¬ 
try confirmed and enchanced. 

I hold in my hand, Mr. President, a copy of the ‘‘Transactions of the Florida 
State Horticultural Society for 1905”—a fair sample of many that have preceded it. 
We have been issuing them annually ever since 1892. This copy of our transac¬ 
tions covers 132 pages of revised Horti¬ 
cultural advice obtained from experience 
—'and experience that fhas to do with 
Florida conditions. It contains more than that. It contains 22 additional pages of catalogue, in which all the different fruits that are grown in Florida are listed in such a way as to give the comparative value of each variety to any given sec¬ 
tion of the State; whether it be Western 
North Florida, Eastern North Florida, 
Central Florida, or South Florida. The work entailed in getting out this annual edition in the creditable manner in which it is presented is unknowable except to someone who has had experience in this direction. 

The price of the book, which also in¬ 
cludes membership in the Society is $1.00. 
If we have 500 annual, and say ten new life members (life memberships are $10.- 
00) our income for the year would be 
$600.00, out of which we have to pay for stenography, secretary’s salary, printing of the book, stationery, stamps and all minor expenses. The secretary’s salary has in time past been, of necessity, so absurdly small, as compared with the work, that it has been repeatedly turned back into '.he 
Treasury by past secretaries, as a gift. 


Not that we want or expect the secretary to do this; on the contrary-we want suf¬ 
ficient funds provided from the source from which it should be provided, the 
State, to enable us to meet proper ex¬ 
penses in a manner that shall comport with our own dignity and that of the great Commonwealth we are trying to serve. 

Mr. President, I think that you will par¬ 
don me if I say that I have had an almost, 
or quite, unequalled opportunity to know the amount of work performed by this So¬ 
ciety. This from the double fact that I 
have been a member from the beginning, 
and that, since then, I have filled every office but one that it was in the society’s power to confer. I was its first Sec¬ 
retary, then, successively, Vice-Presi¬ 
dent, President, and now, a member of the Executive Committee. I have never yet been elected Treasurer, and know but one reason—or possibly two—why I have been overlooked in this connection. The first is that the handling of the societv’s funds is too easy a job, and the second 
—but perhaps I had better not allude to the second one. 

Mr. President, our work has to do with the aiding, up-building and uplifting of 
Horticultural pursuits throughout our 
State. It is gratifying to know that we, 
as a society, are held in esteem both at home and abroad; and it is doubly grati¬ 
fying to know that in this city of Jack¬ 
sonville. where so many pleasant meetings have been held in the past, we are still re¬ 
ceived with open arms. To you gentle¬ 
men who in behalf of the City and the 
City’s Board of Trade, have so cordially welcomed us, we feel profoundly grateful, 
and again say with heart-felt sincerity and with emphasis, we thank you. 



President’s Annual Address. 


BY C. T. MC CARTY. 


Members of the Florida State Horticul¬ 
tural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

This audience will forgive me while 
I indulge in some retrospection. It is worth while sometimes to lift the veil of the past and behold the achievements of the then actors. That picture reveals to us lessons which suggest progress, hope and advancement. At the outset of this address, it is well for me to take my bear¬ 
ings and to see what is the duty I have as¬ 
signed myself. To see and to study the standards that have been set for me in the similar efforts of the past; to study the men and the times that have produced the annual addresses of the past eighteen years. 

Our Society came forth almost full- 
fledged from its birth. In response to the demands of the times, it immediately took its place among the great Horticult¬ 
ural Societies of the age. Fortunately, 
it had as its first president, one of those rugged, fearless and intrepid characters that were transplanted, decades ago, from the great prairies of the Northwest to the tropical and subtropical conditions of our state. With the accumulated wisdom and experience of a life-time, he led the van in the early years of the society’s history and led them with unvarying satisfaction and success. In its first decade it had be¬ 
come so prominent that it received and entertained with, success some of the fore^ 
most scientists of this and other lands. 
The energy and persistence, the skill and 


faith, the merit and the accomplishment of its first president, Dudley W. Adams, 
are now matters of history. After all it is acts not words, that count in the life impression one leaves upon his age and generation. Judge by this standard what a splendid life was his. It is my duty as well as my pleasure, to put on record the high appreciation this society feels today for its first president after he has for well nigh a decade, felt upon his face the breath of the Eternal morning. 

Good foundations, like good principles and good practices, never fail to bequeath to subsequent generations their manifold blessings. 

In studying the history of our Society during this period of eighteen years, I 
find impressed upon this latter half, the large-hearted, good-natured, genial per¬ 
sonality and natural ability of its last pres¬ 
ident, George L. Taber. 

How fortunate our Society was when called upon to bear a sudden vacancy in its Chief Executive, that one "so able, so thoroughly equipped for its duties, so willing to bear and forbear, should be ready trained at hand. The annual ad¬ 
dresses of President Taber always con¬ 
tained a message of importance to the So¬ 
ciety. In times of progress and prosperi¬ 
ty it brought congratulations and good- 
cheer. In times of adversity, it brought hope, courage and manhood, and faith in skill and science to overcome difficul¬ 
ties or adverse climatic conditions. His

cheery tones were ever on the side of op¬ 
timism, were ever turning- towards the bright side of the picture of horticultural struggle and endeavor in this state, were ever pointing to new means of combatting the elements, of overcoming the natural enemies of our chosen industries and bolstering up those of less faith and cour¬ 
age. Through all these annual addresses runs the constant tone of enlargement and improvement, constantlv increasing in power, thought and literary finish, 
his last annual address became a fitting climax to the long series of addresses with which he has enriched the literature of our Society. I can well imagine his feel¬ 
ings when preparing his ‘‘Message from the Woods.” Like that felt by Bryant when he wrote his Thanatopsis, when he gave to his age, in poetry, his conception of a proper appreciation of nature and natural surroundings. Like him feels 
John Burroughs, the nature lover, the poet and admirer of the brook, the field, 
the orchard and the forest. How much of beauty and poetic feeling and love of nature and nature’s God are embodied in the president’s last annual address, on¬ 
ly future generations shall fully appreci¬ 
ate. 

Of retrospection this is sufficient. The past at least is secure. Our Society hav¬ 
ing passed safely the rapids of its up¬ 
per course and glided successfully along into its middle course, now moves for¬ 
ward in the direction of its lower and broader course. It has met the questions of the past. It has accumulated wisdom by experience. It should be, and doubt¬ 
less it is today, well equipped to meet the questions of the present, to maintain the reputation of the past and to lay broad and deep foundations for the achieve¬ 
ments of the future. The problems of to¬ 


day are not more difficult than in the past, but they are more complex and di¬ 
verse. There are in them a greater num¬ 
ber of factors even if each factor is of less vitality. What message does the pres¬ 
ent bring to us ? 

What duty do we owe the today ? What accomplishments can the tomorrow claim logically founded upon today ^ Are there messages that the horticultural conditions of the state at this moment require bring¬ 
ing to your attention? Fortunately we stand in the, presence of no calamity. We do not surround, as we have sometimes done in the past, those conditions that buried the hopes of thousands of our peo¬ 
ple. But even those clouds had their silver lining*, unseen then, but plainly vis¬ 
ible now. We are in the midst of pros¬ 
perity long continued and pronounced. 
Our industries have been enlarged both in number and in volume. Our output is greatly increased in every department of horticulture. Our sources of know¬ 
ledge, our ability to handle the drawbacks, 
the pests and the evils of our diversified industries have been largely increased. 
What then is there to consider? It fre¬ 
quently happens that the most danger¬ 
ous periods are those of greatest prosperi¬ 
ty. It has been well said that, “Security is mortal’s chiefest enemy.” 

In the line of thought I shall take to¬ 
night, I may be straying from the beaten path, may be leading the way into battle fields where the valiant, the sagacious and the steadfast of purpose alone can be found at the front. The commercial bat¬ 
tles of the present dwarf into insignifi¬ 
cance the battles with insects, with cli¬ 
matic conditions, with all o.ur other ob¬ 
stacles combined. The struggle for new markets, for cheaper production, for fair¬ 
er treatment by our agents in the markets. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


23 


for fair rates and rapid transit, do not these demand our attention and challenge the best brains among us ? Of what avail is it that we devote our time and capital to the problems of production if the other and more complex problems of economy, 
distribution, transportation, receive not their proper attention? These things are as much a part of our legitimate business as the cultivation of the soil, the ferti¬ 
lizer we shall use or the various matters of every day occurrence. What man is there before me who has not felt like this ? 
The season has been a good one, I have fertilized judiciously and wisely, I have cultivated, I have sprayed, I have spared no pains to produce a fine crop. How shall I market it to the best advantage? 
Have you not realized that you were then confronted with harder conditions than those of production and ones less within your control or management? 

The original scope of our Society be¬ 
ing much narrower than its presc'nt one curtailed the range of topics considered at our meetings to a very narrow inargin. 
The original thought of the founders of this Society was to make it apply almost exclusively to orange growing, to citrus fruits and their allied subjects. As the years have come and gone its scope has been widened so that it now covers, not only semi-tropical, but also tropical fruits, 
vegetables and many of the fruits of the temperate zone. This enlargement of its sphere has injected into it new relations and new problems for annual considera¬ 
tion. Let us briefly discuss a few of the important items worthy of thought. This is an age of organization, co-operation and consolidation. It is not sufficient that the horticulturist of today knows how to produce the fruits and the products of the soil but that he knows as well how to 


successfully transport, distribute and mar¬ 
ket them. Perhaps the largest field for present and future investigation is the one covering the problem of marketing. This problem involves the element of business experience and study of the relations of the cost of production and transportation to the market value of our products; the study of the laws of supply and demand as applied to each particular product; a study of the value of organization in the securing of reasonable and satisfactory rates of transportation; of the proper commissions to be paid our selling agents; 
and the proper distribution of the crop so as to prevent surplus in one portion of the country and deficiency in another. 
Were there no such thing as organized ef¬ 
fort among those whose financial interests are opposed to ours there should be no necessity for organization on our part. 
The value of farmers and fruit growers’ 
organizations is in direct proportion to the tenacity with which they adhere to them and the vigor with wLich they enforce the principles involved. I do not deem it necessary to go into arguments sup¬ 
porting the needs for compactly united organizations in each of our principal in¬ 
dustries. The need for organization must be apparent to all. For greatest efficiency consolidation of all for the handling of problems common to all is only common sense. Questions like transportation, tar¬ 
iffs for protection, rates of commission and kindred broad matters can only be handled powerfully and conclusively in the hands of one central organization. The methods and direction taken by each in¬ 
terest must be dictated by themselves. 

It can do no harm to crystallize among them, into some definite form the l^est, 
ideas of the most intelligent and ener¬ 
getic of the growers, nor need it be be- 


^4 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


lieved that the only value in horticultural organization is that of the maintenance of the price or cheapening the cost of the production and the proper regulation of die matter of transportation. 'In numer¬ 
ous other ways organized effort is super¬ 
ior to individual effort. The tendency of the times is to the enlarged costs of the material used for the packing and pack¬ 
age purposes, the costs of living and in¬ 
deed, increased cost in everything that the horticulturist purchases. The only fair method of safeguarding the growers and producers’ interests is to see that in¬ 
creased revenue accrues to him sufficient¬ 
ly to meet the increased cost of produc¬ 
tion as well as the cost of living and the necessaries and luxuries of life. 

Concurrent with this comes the thought of the reduced cost of production by bet¬ 
ter management, more intensive cultiva¬ 
tion, decreased cost of fertilizing by tak¬ 
ing advantage of cheaper sources of nitro¬ 
gen and other kindred economies. All of these are well and should never be for¬ 
gotten. The opening up of new fields of production have helped swell the volume of material in our markets and should set us to thinking of how to overcome this new competition. 

The solution of these problems will call for the best thought, the best persistent effort and ^ the most constant watchful¬ 
ness of the thoughtful classes in our midst Among the hopeful signs of the present are the cordial relations existing t>etween the country and the city; between the producer and the carrier; between the producer and the consumer. In these bet¬ 
ter understandings of each others’ rela¬ 
tions we see the future solution of +hese problems. So long as the different class¬ 
es understand and appreciate each other, 
realize their mutual inter-dependence on 

•* t 


each other, maintain their mutual respect for each other, that long will harmony and material prosperity exist. In passing, 
it might be said that the accentuation of the self-interests of the horticultural class¬ 
es does not necessarily mean war upon or antagonism of any other interest. 

The recent report of the U. S. Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture calls attention to the enormous resources of American agri¬ 
culture and horticulture. In comparison, 
all other interests combined sink into in¬ 
significance. The sums are so stupendous that we can scarcely realize their mag¬ 
nitude. Of this grand total we are a con¬ 
siderable part. It is just cause for con¬ 
gratulation that the importance, vitality and dignity of the harticultural classes is being recognized. 

Do our horticultural classes sufficient¬ 
ly appreciate the value of and the necess¬ 
ity for diversification ? Do we realize the full meaning of living at home? Is it not a fact that too great a proportion of the income from our products goes for that which can and should be grown in our own state and possibly in our own neighborhood? We hear it discussed on all hands, but have not acted on it vig¬ 
orously. While this thought is trite, I 
risk once more calling the attention of our people to its vital importance. 

I have felt- strongly impelled at this meeting to press upon your attention these important matters. To give vent to the thought that has been growing in my mind for some years, that the most vital and far-reaching questions now calling for solution by Florida producers were not cultural questions but commercial ones; not planting but marketing; not fer¬ 
tilizing but transportation. Let us think about these things, talk about them, study them, conquer them. If this thought,

talk and study take not the form of action then have we labored in vain. 

During the past few months, I address¬ 
ed a circular letter to every member of the society, in which I asked for an ex¬ 
pression of opinion on many matters of importance, and asked for suggestions. 
The replies have been numerous and my reward ample for the trouble I took. Much to enlighten and cheer the Society has come to me. Encouragement for the fu¬ 
ture, and splendid appreciation for the past of the Society has breathed from many of the much-valued letters received. 
I desire to thank you, most sincerely for these expressions of your better selves. 
In the quiet of your homes, you have said things that you would not say on the floor of this house. You have my promise to use the good suggestions in so far as I 
shall be able. These heart-to-heart let¬ 
ters shall bear fruit. 

Among the weighty subjects discussed in those letters, was that of ‘‘State Aid” 
in the printing of our annual reports. A 
careful tabulation of the replies show about an equal number favoring and op¬ 
posing the acceptance of such aid. Among those favoring, are some of our oldest and most thoughtful and experienced mem¬ 
bers. On the other side, can be found those of equal experience and wisdom. 
Some have cited other states in which 
State Aid is supposed to be the cause of their ruin as a society, while others point out other states in which it has had the opposite effect. The array of arguments pro. and con. is formidable and shows the ability and reasoning resources of our members. It is not my province or wish 


to discuss the question or to express an opinion on it. If the matter comes up, 
all the reasoning, on all its sides and phas¬ 
es, will be developed and the society can then pass upon it intelligently. Without taking the time to discuss them here, I 
will say that many of the suggestions made by members will be carried out during the progress of the meeting, as they shall fit into our work. 

We are to be favored by a number of emdnent persons, with addresses and pap¬ 
ers, during the progress of the meeting, 
as a glance at the program will show. 
Will these friends of the Society allow me to express, if ever so feebly, our sin¬ 
cere thanks for their kindness and our high appreciation of their valued efforts. 

But, what of the work? We have six sessions before us, occupying two full days. We shall have seven formal ad¬ 
dresses and papers. We shall listen to the reports of sixteen committees, and these reports will be ably and exhaustively discussed. In the course of these discus¬ 
sions will come out much of the real value of our gathering. Don’t hesitate to stuff our “Question Box.” Show me by your patronage of this lx)x that you appreciate a chance to ask questions. Work, fast and furious, is our portion for the next few days. At the close of the meeting may we feel that we never had a better one. Amidst the friends of many years, 
in the city of hustle and progress, with words of welcome to inspire our efforts, 
with the social feasts before us, our tasks shall be light and their accomplishment assured. 


Nematode Diseases of Plants. 


BY PROF. EARNEST A. BESSEY. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I wish to speak to you today about nematodes. In the first place, it may be well to attempt to explain to you just what a nematode is, although most of you are familiar enough with the work of one of them, the root-knot. Nematodes or ell- 
worms as they are sometimes called, are low animals, slender and worm-like, at least when young. Like the true worms they have no legs nor wings at any stage of their development. They differ from the latter in not being segmented and in having no jaws. They consist essential¬ 
ly of a tube-like skin lined with muscles; 
inside this is another tube, the alimentary canal, with various modifications along its course to act as gizzard, stomach, etc. 
Add a very simple nervous system and you have nearly all the essential features of a nematode. They should never be confused with the segmented earth-worms nor with the larvae of various insects, 
also, but erroneously, called worms. 

Many species of nematodes are par¬ 
asitic in animals, as, for example, the roundworm of the horse, the hookworm and trichina of man; many others live in various locations, both in the earth or in fresh or salt water, on decaying or¬ 
ganic matter, a wellknown example being the harmless vinegar-eel; while still others attack living plants. The latter are entirely harmless to animal life, so that we need not fear their presence on that 


score. They are bad enough as it is,* how¬ 
ever. 

With the exception of some that are parasitic in higher animals, nematodes are mostly minute. Those that attack plants are rarely over one-eighth of an inch in length, while some are many times smaller. Were it not for their great num¬ 
bers they would scarcely require serious attention. 

The principal disease of plants due to nematodes, at least in this country, is root- 
knot, in which the nematodes live within the root, causing it to enlarge, forming the characteristic knots. In addition to this di'sease, other species of nematodes cause abortion of the flowers of grasses, 
distortion of leaves and flowers through their presence within the stem, stunting and malformation of plants through nematodes living within the stem, killing- 
out of spots in leaves through nematodes in the tissues at these points, and injured canker-like spots on the roots. The lat¬ 
ter are caused by nematodes attacking the roots from the outside without entering- 
them. 

The life history of the root-knot nema¬ 
tode is in short as follows: The eggs, 
which are about 1-300 inch long, hatch into little larvea about i-ioo inch long, 
and about 1-2000 inch thick. These pos¬ 
sess at the anterior end, a stout spear. 
Crawling around in the soil they finally find roots, perhaps not for weeks after 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


27 


they are hatched. A larvae seeks out the root tip and bores into it by means of its spear, taking its place near the center, 
parallel to the axis of the root, with the anterior end directed away from the root tip. The necessary nourishment is sucked out of the surrounding tissue through the spear which is hollow. Growth is rapid now, and soon the nematode begins to increase in thickness more rapidly than in length. The tip of the root continues to grow. The tissue about the nematode owing to some stimulus, due to its pres¬ 
ence increases rapidly in amount, forming a knot of soft watery cells. If but one nematode has entered, the knot remains small, usually, but often the infections are not single and several to many nema¬ 
todes come to lie close together or at short intervals causing a large knot or a succes¬ 
sion of smaller one to be formed. The nematode’s increase in thickness contin¬ 
ues until it is flask-shaped. At this stage the male and female begin to become dif¬ 
ferentiated in shape; the former perform¬ 
ing a moult and again becoming a slenaer creature about 1-25 inch long and 1-500 
inch thick. The female, on the other hand, continues to enlarge until she is as thick as long, and only at the anterior end shows any worm-like portion. At this stage the egg laying begins, and con¬ 
tinues until 400-500 eggs have been laid. 
As these hatch they must bore their way out of the root tissue into the soil, and seek other roots or they simply find con¬ 
genial places to develop in the same knot so that in one large knot can be found nematodes of all stages of development. 

The time required for the development from the egg to the mature egg-laying individual depends to a great extent upon the temperature and upon the plant affect¬ 
ed, being more rapid in warm weather. 


It probably never is less than four weeks, 
and sometimes requires eight weeks. 

The injury to the plant is of two kinds, 
direct and indirect.- As direct injury may be considered that due to the reduction or stoppage of the passage from the roots of water and dissolved mineral food¬ 
stuffs, due to the tangling and interrup¬ 
tion of the water conducting vessels in the knotted roots, also the injury to the plant due to the diversion of food-stuffs to build up the tissue of the knot instead of building up the rest of the plant. 

Then direct injuries, although undoubt¬ 
edly harmful, rarely cause the death of the affected plants. The indirect injuries are due to the fact that the soft abnormal tissue of the knot is attacked by various organisms of both fungous and animal nature, causing decay to set in which may involve the whole root system and thereby kill the plant. Many fungi find easy en¬ 
trance in this way. So, for example, the fungus causing wilt of cotton attacks plants suffering with root-knot much more vigorously and destructively than those that are not so infested. 

Many plants are attacked so slightly that the injury is very slight or not even apparent. Such plants, however, owing to the large number of eggs laid b}^ a single worm, serve the purpose of keeping the soil well stocked with nematodes. 

I have been making a list of all plants on which I have seen root-knot or on which it has been reported to occur. This list now contains about 300 species of plants, including most of those commonly cultivated. Among those that may be seriously injured, may be mentioned the following: fig, peach, European grape, 
roselle, banana, pawpaw, tomato, egg¬ 
plant, rose, carnation, tuberose, violet, 
jasmine, cowpea, soy-bean, cotton, and 


28 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


most of the garden vegetables, especially cucumber, squash, pumpkin, water and muskmelon. On the other hand, the in¬ 
jury has been but slight in those cases where I have observed it on the follow¬ 
ing : various grasses, as Bermuda, crow¬ 
foot, fescue, orchard grass, German millet, 
persimmon, sawbrier, wormseed, chufa, 
bush-clover, etc. I have yet to see a case of true root-knot on any of the citrus trees, velvet-bean, Florida beggar-weed, 
oats, rye, barley, sorgum, hog-millet, etc. 

Many ideas have been advanced as to how this pest should be combated but many of them are based on experiments made with the closely related sugarbeet nematode of Germany. But little actual experimental work has been done. One method is that of soil sterilization, i. e. 
freeing the soil of the noxious organism l)y direct means. I shall mention various suggested means of doing this. 

Chemical Means.—The most efficient of these is the use of carbon bisulphide in¬ 
jected into the soil to a depth of several inches at close intervals and allowed to diffuse there throughout the soil. If enough is used this is effective. It has several serious objections; it is expensive, 
so expensive in fact, that it would proba¬ 
bly take several hundred dollars worth to treat one acre, not to speak of the labor of applying it. It is also poisonous to roots. A large fig tree will stand it some¬ 
times, but the check to the growth is great. 
It is highly inflammable. It does not mix with water, and so cannot be used in wet soil. Formalin in dilute solution is equally effective if applied in sufficient quantity. However, to wet dry soil to the depth of a foot would require about five gallons of solution to a square yard costing $150 to $200 per acre. My ex- 
])eriments to determine whether a lesser 


quantity will be sufficient are now under way. This solution is also harmful to vegetation, but if kept from the growing part of the plant is not as injurious as carbonbisulphide. Lime, gas-lime, gas liquor, oils, etc., have been tried on the sugar-beet nematode without effect. I 
am now trying some of them on the root- 
knot. 

Heat is the most efficient means yet found for killing out all kinds of pests, 
including the root-knot nematode. 
Thanks to Stone and Smith in Massachu¬ 
setts, the problem has been settled as far as nematodes in green-houses are con¬ 
cerned. Steam is passed at high pressure through tiles or perforated iron pipes run¬ 
ning through the soil. This effectually kills all animal and fungous parasites. 
It seems doubtful whether that method will ever become of use in the open, unless it be for seed-beds or for truck farms where the income is very high. It would probably cost not less than $2,000 per acre to establish such a ster’fizing appara¬ 
tus. The often recommended building of large fires upon the spot to be sterilized is to be discouraged, for the injury to the soil is too great. 

Freezing, formerly supposed to be fatal to the root-knot nematode, is considered so by me no longer since I obtained authentic record of peonv plants going- 
through a winter temperature of 35 de¬ 
crees below zero without even a mulch 

o 

protection and showing root-knot again that summer. That was not in Florida 

In Java where the dry season is well marked and is really dry, it has been found possible to exterminate the root- 
knot nematode by drying out the soil. 
This is done by keeping it in fine tilth during the whole dry season by means of repeated plowings, and harrowings. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


29 


Strange to say, the root-knot nematode is easily killed by drying out, although many of its close relatives are dried without injury, and can remain alive for years in that condition, reviving again upon being moistened up. Paradoxical as it may seem, moisture will also kill the root- 
knot nematode. It has often been found that wet lands are free from nematode injury while dryer lands adjacent suffered badly. In one case I learned of some very badly infected land flooded by a spring freshet for several days. Always thereafter it bore crops showing no sign of root-knot. In Java this method had also been tried and found to be successful. 
The land must be submerged at least five to eight days. 

Besides these direct means for freeing the soil of nematodes several indirect ones have been suggested, and it is by some of these that I believe our main salvation can be attained. The first to be mention¬ 
ed is the starvation method; i. e. growing nothing on the land that can serve as food for the nematodes until all has perished. 
How long this would require for the root-knot nematode has not been determ¬ 
ined ; for its close relative, the sugar-beet nematode, it is not under two years. To keep the land entirely fallow this length of time is, of course, not to be thought of, 
but the same results can be attained by cultivating only plants not attacked by root-knot even in the slightest degree. 
Hence comes the great importance of numerous experiments to determine which plants are and which are not susceptible. 
Of those which so far I have found to be free from root-knot, are crabgrass, the small grains, velvet bean, Florida beggar- 
weed and but few others. Such infor¬ 
mation bearing on the subject as I can obtain from you will be gratefully receiv¬ 


ed. In view of the facts known the prac¬ 
tise of many of allowing the land to grow up thickly to crabgrass in the summer, 
is one that ought to tend to keep the root-knot nematode in check. If that could be combined with the use of velvet bean for a season or two, or if small grains were sown as winter crops for two years followed in the summer by vel¬ 
vet beans it looks to me as if favorable results should be obtained. I have such experiments already under way. 

Another method of combating the pest, 
which promises very good results for cer¬ 
tain annual crops, is that of breeding up resistant races. Thus the Iron cowpea, if obtained pure, is not attacked by root- 
knot. Unfortunately, however, most of that obtainable in the markets or even some of that sent out from other sources, 
contained some admixture of other va¬ 
rieties vitiating the results. Mr. W. A. 
Orton has demonstrated that this quality of resistance is transmissable to crosses with other sorts. Doubtless some results of value can be obtained by selecting seed from plants least affected in a field known to be full of root-knot. Such plants, when in flower, should be crossed, if possible, 
with similar resistant plants in same field. 
In this way a nematode resistant sugar- 
beet has been obtained. 

The influence of increased amounts of certain elements of fertilizers on the amount of injury caused by root-knot has received, I find, practically no attention. 
It has been investigated very carefully in 
Germany in connection with the sugar- 
beet nematode. There it has been found that by greatly increasing the potash the injury is to a large extent, decreased. I 
am now beginning similar experiments with the root-knot. 

The method, however, that has perhaps 


30 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


been most successful of all against the sugar-beet nematode is the use of Trap- 
crops. Strange to say, although this has often been recommended for root-knot, 
I have yet to find a single case where it has ever been tried even as an experiment. 
I am making some experiments this sea¬ 
son. The method consists essentially, in planting thickly in close rows, some crop known to be very susceptible to the nema¬ 
tode, allowing the nematodes to enter it and before they have developed far enough to lay eggs, and so increase the number in the soil, to destory the crop. 
This is repeated several times during the season, and so reduces the number of nematodes still left in the soil that it re¬ 
quires several years before they become very destructive again. Certain cautions must be carefully observed, however, or the use of this method will increase in¬ 
stead of decrease the number of nema¬ 
todes. It is necessary to remove or entire¬ 
ly turn under and kill the plants about four weeks after they come up. If left too long the nematodes will have develop¬ 
ed too far and will have begun laying, if not long enough they will still be in the motile stage and will crawl out again and reinfect the soil. 


What to do with a peach orchard, for example, where the root-knot is bad is a serious question. In the first place we will take it for granted that the orchard, 
even in its diseased state, represents too much money to permit it to be cut down. 
It might be well, then, to try watering the trees heavily before the buds open, either early in the spring or late in the fall, with a dilute solution of formalin, so as to kill the nematodes in the knots. For such I would prefer the cowpea (not the Iron.) But unless they are re¬ 
moved in time these trap crops will do more harm than good. When the orchard is cut down the land should be freed from nematodes by some of the means above mentioned, before setting again to peaches. Avoid cow- 
peas, except possibly Iron, as they propa¬ 
gate the nematode rapidly. Use velvet beans or beggar-weed instead. These are but suggestions, please understand, not from the result of actual personal exper¬ 
ience, but as a result of fair acquaintance with the habits of the nematode. I trust some of you may have the courage to try these in a corner of your orchard and report to me the result. 


Report on the Manatee Snail and White Fly. 


BY F. D. WAITE. 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Our President recently asked me to get up a paper on the white fly and Manatee snail, the latter having been brought to the notice of the fruit growers within the past six months, and several descriptive articles have been published and copied into the leading papers of the State. I have brought a few specimens with me, also another specie of snail which may play a part in the cleaning up of the sooty mould, 
as we have found it feeding on the lichens several feet high on the trunks of old seed¬ 
lings. 

Messrs Butler and Heathcote of St. 
Petersburg sent me several dozen snail found feeding on the Mangrove at Passe- 
a-Grille, these were put around a tree dur¬ 
ing early winter and protected with sacks, 
but all died, I hope this summer to make another trial with them. 

I am sorry to say that parties have visited the grove where the Manatee snail was first discovered and stolen so many that we can hardly find any left, and our neighbors who afterwards discovered them in their groves, have been treated in like manner. 

From observations already made I be¬ 
lieve the snail is not active during cold or dry weather, neither do I think they increase until the rainy season, and dur¬ 
ing the foggy weather in early fall and winter, when they become most active in ridding the trees and fruit of the sooty 


mould. Those wishing to become famil¬ 
iar with the white fly and its enemies should procure Press Bulletin No. 4. is¬ 
sued May 1st, 1901, Press Bulletin No. 
59 of January 15th, 1906, Bulletin No. 
67 of June, 1903, and Bulletin No. 13 
issued by the U. S. Department of Agri¬ 
culture June 17th, 1897. There is another report of the Entomologist Prof. H. A. 
Gossard from July ist, 1900 to July ist, 
1901. 

All of the above reports cover the ground completely. I have a copy of Press 
Bulletin No. 59 with me, and if it is the pleasure of this Society I will read the same. 

THE MANATEE SNAIL, BULIMULUS 
DORMANI. 

(Press Bulletin No. 59, Florida Agri¬ 
cultural Experiment Station. Depart¬ 
ment of Entomology.) 

The sooty mold of orange, Meliola, is one of the most serious results of white fly infestation of citrus groves, and is an element in the injury to various plants from aphids and from some of the scale insects especially the Lecaniums, mealy bugs, wax scales, and cottony cushion scale. Tfee fungus is not itself a parasite on the plant, but a saprophyte, deriving its sustenance from the sweet honey dew secreted by these insects. The injury to the plant results from the smothering action of the fungus, the heavy coating of 



32 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 


fungal threads interfering with, the healthful action of sunlight on the leaves. 
The appearance of the various ornamen¬ 
tal and hedge plants is also disfigured by the dark fungus. The sooty mold is es¬ 
pecially bad following the white fly at¬ 
tack owing to the large amount of honey dew secreted by these insects. As the white fly larvae attach themselves to the under side of the leaves the honey dew exuded by them falls to the top side of the leaves beneath, thus affording favor¬ 
able opportunity for the growth of the fungus. So constant is the association of the fungus and the white fly that badly infested groves and hedges may be recog¬ 
nized at some distance by the heavily coated dark foliage. The fungus develops on the fruit as well as on the leaves and stem and washing becomes necessary, re¬ 
sulting not only in an added expense, but also in increased danger of decay in ship¬ 
ping. In this connection the habits of the tree snail, Bulimulus Dormani, are of the greatest interest. This snail has been found in the orange groves in Manatee county feeding upon the sooty mould. 
Just how long the snail has been present on orange trees in this county it is im¬ 
possible to say. It was observed as long as two years ago by Mr. F. D. Waite, at 
Palmetto. It seems to have been present in small number in other groves at this time, but attracted no further attention until the present summer. The snail is now widely distributed in Manatee coun¬ 
ty, occurring in many groves on both sides of the Manatee river. The work of the snails is very characteristic. When well started they occur in great,, numbers on the tree spreading over it from base to top. Its favorite food seems to be the sooty mold. The fungus is cleaned from the leaves, stems, and fruit. The leaves 


thus cleaned have a glossy, shiny appear¬ 
ance as though free from white fly. The fruit thus cleaned has a better color and probably ripens earlier. In addition to the fungus, the snail takes algae and some lichens from the stem and trunk, 
giving the trunk a much cleaner and fresher look. The trees that are cleaned stand out conspicuously from the sur¬ 
rounding trees by their bright foliage and clean trunks. The snails increase rapidly under favorable conditions. The eggs are probably deposited in protected places about the trunks of the trees, possibly also 

about the base of the tree under leaves 

* 

and other rubbish. That the snails are capable of doing effective work when present in sufficient numbers has been shown in numerous groves in Manatee county during the present summer. Such trees in these groves as are well stocked with the snails have been thoroughly cleaned, the fruit not requiring washing. 

The snails are of medium size, measur¬ 
ing, when full grown, three-fourths to one inch in length. The shells are smooth, 
white, or corneous white, and with about four bands of brown spots. Old shells have often a somewhat corroded surface, 
the bands becoming indistinct or absent. 
When the conditions are unfavorable, eith¬ 
er cold or dry, the snails take refuge in the hollows of the trees or under leaves ac¬ 
cumulated in the forks, or elsewhere, or under sacks at the base of the trees when these are provided. It thus becomes an easy matter to transfer them from tree to tree. A few snails placed by Mr. Wade 
Harrison in one of his trees in March, in¬ 
creased in such numbers as to free the tree of sooty mold by mid-summer of the same year. The snails are known to range with some variation from the mouth of the St. Johns river on the north, to the 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


33 


Caloosahatchie river on the south. The species is probably native to Florida as specimens in small numbers were observ¬ 
ed about the hammocks and elsewhere as long as fifty years ago. Its habit of feed¬ 
ing on the sooty mold of the orange, how¬ 
ever, was not known until within the past two years. 

In view of the fondness of the snails for the injurious sooty mold fungus, it becomes of first importance to observe their treatment of the beneficial fungi. 
Among the fungi parasitic on orange in¬ 
sects there are four species of inestimable value to orange growers. These are, the brown fungus well known as an effective parasite on the white fly larvae; the red-pink fungus also parasitic on the white fly; the red fungus, and the gray headed fungus, both parasitic on the common scales. The brown fungus so effective in control of the white fly, as is well-known, throws out spreading hyphae for some distance around the body of the dead leaves. It seems that the snails oc¬ 
casionally feed to a limited extent on these, spreading hyphae but evidently not enough to interfere with the spread of the fungus, since this fungus is doing particu¬ 
larly effective work in the groves in the 
Manatee region where the snails occur. 


The red-pink fungus is also abundant in the groves where the snails occur and is untouched by them. The snails have not been observed to feed on either the red or the gray fungi parasitic on the common orange scales, and it is probable that they have no taste for these parasitic fungi. Colonies of the snails are being started in part of the State where the white fly injury is severe and where condi¬ 
tions seem favorable for the growth of the snail. It is desirable that close atten¬ 
tion be given to the habits of the snail, 
as well as to means of protecting colonies against unfavorable conditions. A few sacks thrown around the tree seem to afford a needed protection against unus¬ 
ual cold. It is probable that sprays can not be used on trees stocked with the snails without injury to the colony, for, 
although protected by the shell from the immediate effect, sufficient spray probably clings to the sooty mold on which they feed to destroy them. The beneficial par¬ 
asitic fungi and the snails may be allowed to work together on unsprayed trees. 
The snail is here spoken of as the Mana¬ 
tee snail since while recorded as occurring in other parts of the State it was found working on the orange groves first in the 
Manatee region. 


Report of Committee on Diseases, Insects and 

Method of Control. 


[There was no regular report made by any member of the committee, but the question was opened for discussion, and this proved very interesting. The fol¬ 
lowing is as full a report as the stenog¬ 
rapher was able to make.—Sec.] 

Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I regret to say that I have been unable to make any report owing to the fact that I have been in a dark room for some weeks, unable to read or write and have had to depend upon some one else to do my writing for me. After the President had notified me 
I was on this committee I communicated with other members telling them of my disability and urging them to attend to the work necessary to a good report. 

Mr. Hubbard.—I have no formal re¬ 
port on this subject. I have had no ex¬ 
perience with the white fly, not even like our friend Mr. Hart. I have a small joke at Mr. Hart’s expense. One of our neighbors sent him a specimen and asked if it was the white fly, he also wrote Mr. 
Hart, but Mr. Hart was- so afraid of the white fly that he immediately burn¬ 
ed it without examination. I do not believe this gentleman had the white fly, 
but he did have the white wax scale. 
The red fungus is now attacking this scale and I think he will soon be rid of it. 

T practically do no spraying. In cases of small trees I use a small atomizer, 
using pure kerosense and treating them 


on a warm, dry day, putting it on care¬ 
fully. The kerosene will evaporate in about an hour and one application will remove most of the scale and will not hurt the foliage. Kerosene has practi¬ 
cally the same chemical composition as turpentine and the essential oil of the orange, so that when it evaporates it has very little effect on the tree. If you should saturate the tree with the kero¬ 
sene, of course it might do some damage. 

(Question.) Have you used whale oil soap? 

Mr. Hubbard.—I used to do this, but am now depending on Lady bugs and fungus. Orange trees may have some scale the first season, but the next year the lady bug and fungus will clean them out pretty thoroughly. If a man sprays for red spider etc., he kills the fungus and has to keep up the spraying continually. 

Maj. Healy.—Mr Waite seems to be the only one who has had any experience with the white fly. 

Mr. Waite.—One of the oldest groves we have, contains 600 large trees, so large we cannot get in between them to spray. This grove has been infested with the fly for ten or fifteen years. The fungi is very abundant, also about one hundred trees are inhabited by the snail, specimens of which I have brought with me. We commenced picking this crop of 4000 
boxes during Christmas week and finish¬ 
ed about the twentieth of January we 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

had a great deal of rainy weather at the time. Every box was washed except that which had been beautifully cleaned by the snail. The fruit carried well, and sold for $3.00 per box in Providence 
R. 1 . The trees cleaned by the snail gave us a uniform bloom this spring, while the balance of the grove bloomed only in the tops of the trees. 

Saturday night I went over to the grove to get specimens of the snail but could only find a few, and concluded that our neighbors had gathered the greater portion of them, but Sunday it rained during the night, and the next morning my foreman found plenty of them crawl¬ 
ing up and down the trunks, and over the foilage, and he said that many of the snails had particles of sand still sticking to them. We are not certain that they do not burrow in the earth during the cool winter weather, coming out when the weather is warm, and the atmosphere moist. They do not move around or feed, only when the sooty mold is wet, 
which I presume enables them ‘ to eat it more readily, and in doing so they clean up the eggs of the fly. 

Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I wish to ask Mr. Waite if in spraying he would risk clear water. 

Mr. Waite.—This would assist the snails and after two or three sprayings the fungi would make their appearance, 
for this reason I would reccommend to those who do not wish to use insecticides and fungucides, spraying .with clear wa¬ 
ter, and if done toward night, it would keep the sooty mold moist all night. 

Mr. Hart.—What kind of a nozzle would you use? 

Mr. Waite.—We use the Big Boston in a solid spray on the tall trees, and the 
Vermoel for small trees and where we 


wish to throw a mist over the fruit for the rust mite. 

Mr. Bell.—I would like to know wheth¬ 
er or not the result of the fungi mention- 
,ed is a remedy for the white fly. 

Mr. Waite.—After the white fly has been in a grove a few years, this fungi seems to be a natural parasite following it, and will unaided, in time clean up the trees so they will produce one fine crop in three years, and a medium one year, and comparatively nothing the next, but by assisting the fungi to spread more rapidly we may get fewer oflf years. 

Mr. Bell.—Do I understand that when the white fly gets into a grove that it will bear probably once in three years? 

Mr. Waite.—Yes sir, but it is my opin¬ 
ion that if we assist the fungi and snail to spread more rapidly, we will soon lose all fear of the white fly. 

Mr. Bell.—Is the damage done by white fly as much as one hundred dollars per acre? 

Mr. Waite.—I should say that was a small estimate but if the fungi and snail have your assistance they will keep out the fly, if you will take the pains, and use the time you would consume in spraying, 
distributing fungi and snails, it would not lessen the value of your grove one dollar. As I have stated the fruit ship¬ 
ped from the grove mentioned was as fine as any I ever saw, while that ad¬ 
joining this grove was not near as fine flavored, it was covered with sooty mold, 
which excluded the air and sunlight, nec¬ 
essary to make a fine quality of fruit. 
The trees stocked with the snail were quite clean by the last of Sept., so they had plenty of sunlight (and fully a month before gathering the fruit,) therefore I 
think the snail the best friend we have with which to fight the white fly.

Mr. McClung.—Is this mould respon¬ 
sible for the damage that is attributed to the white fly? 

Mr. Waite.—Yes sir. 

Mr. Bell.—How many oranges did you wash and what was the expense of wash¬ 
ing them ? 

Mr. Waite.—We have cleaned as many as fifty boxes in fifteen minutes, with three men at $1.25 per day. We washed our entire crop of grape fruit and oranges not cleaned by the snail. 

Mr. Longley.—I would like to ask about the scale and white fly: Is the white fly more destructive to one kind of fruit than to another? 

Mr. Waite.—It is more destructive to oranges than grapefruit, but is worse on tangerine, mandarin and lemon, than any of the others. 

Mr. Gist.—I would like to ask what steps I should take if the white fly should appear on my grove. Should I spray or use fungi and snail? 

Mr. Waite.—I would advise spraying the first trees showing any sign of the fly, in this way you may be able to hold it in check for several years, but it would pay to introduce the fungi and snail as soon as you see that you have the fly well started in your grove, but not before, for foilage partially covered with the fungi may contain plenty of pupa which may mature in a few days and fly to other trees not stocked with the fungi. 

Maj. Healey—I have sought infor¬ 
mation on the origin of the white fly and am told that it was brought to this coun¬ 
try from China. It might be we could gather some information from there that would aid us in its extermination. 

Mr. Sampson.—I would ask if the ex¬ 
termination of the white fly is dependent 


on fungi, snails, or spraying, and if there would be a full crop the third year. 

Mr. Hart.—I would like Mr. Waite’s opinion as to how the spraying can be done on bearing trees, and whether or not it would give us a good full crop the third year or a normal one each year. 

Mr. Waite.—Six years ago I took charge of the Manatee Lemon Go’s groves in Manatee county. The young grove of 225 acres joined another grove that was badly infested with white fly. Our trees were very small, from one to two feet high, we sprayed that portion near¬ 
est that grove the first winter, and as we noticed specimens of the fly farther out in our grove, from year to year, so we increased the area. For the first four years we kept the fly down to such an extent that our trees were always glossy, 
and only an occasional tree would be black from the sooty mould. As the trees became larger it was more difficult to wet the entire foilage, and the Fly would become numerous by October, and por¬ 
tions of the fruit would be black, but these winter sprayings seemed to clean the trees enough so that they would bloom and set a very nice crop of fruit. Our success was fully as good with old seed¬ 
lings. We did not spray during the past winter, wishing to see what results would follow the introduction of the brown and red fungi, these only work during the rainy season or foggy weath¬ 
er during the fall and winter. By spray¬ 
ing we have increased our crop of fruit each year. It requires more intelligent labor than the ordinary “Darkey” to do successful spraying as one leaf missed may have hundreds of eggs. 

,Mr. Brown.—What are the surround¬ 
ing dangers of the white fly? Upon what does it feed? 








FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


37 


Mr. Waite.—It feeds upon the orange, 
lemon, grapefruit and lime, I have also seen it in all stages from the egg to the adult fly, on the chinaberry, persimmon, 
cape jasmine and prickly ash. While I 
have never found the larva or pupa on the palmetto and gall berry, I have seen the adult flies quite abundant. The sooty mold attacks the honey dew, following the attacks of many kind of wax scale and mealy bug. Many have sent me speci¬ 
mens of plants or shrubbery covered with this deposit of sooty mold, and asked if it was not white fly. On examination I 
found only the wax scale, or mealy bug. 

Mr. Taber.—I would like to hear from 
Prof. Rolfs on fhis question. 

Prof Rolfs.—I was getting more infor¬ 
mation out of this than I could possibly give, but some people are never satisfied until they get things stirred up. 

The damage done by the white fly, and the smut which follows it, does consider¬ 
able damage to the grove that is ordi¬ 
narily not taken into consideration. The honey dew, which is excreted by the white fly, falls upon the fruit and the upper side of the leaves, this makes a medium in which the smut or sooty mold grows luxuriantly. By its extensive growth it forms a velvety covering over the leaves and fruit and on account of its black color it keeps the sun from penetrating to the leaves and fruit or in a large measure obstructs it. Sunlight as we all know is absolutely necessary for the welfare of our orchard trees, and is also absolutely necessary for the maturing of the fruit, 
consequently, when the sunlight is cut off almost completely, as is often the case with this sooty mold covering, the fruits cannot mature properly. This is brought out very strikingly when the fruit is run through a washer. The fruit as it 


hangs on the tree appears to be perfectly ripe but when it comes out of the washer it is half green, the green area extending as far as the fruit is covered with the sooty mold. 

The Manatee snail does not destroy the ‘ 
white fly as a number of people have as¬ 
serted. No one who has studied the work of this snail with a hand lens, which is the proper way to study it, will contend for a moment that the snail does any harm to the white fly. It merely feeds on the sooty mold cleaning it off completely from the leaves and. from the fruit, doing the work much more perfectly than any washer yet invented. 

The good work of the Manatee snail in clearing off the sooty mold was strik¬ 
ingly apparent in a number of cases. The trees that had been cleared of the sooty mold a year before produced an abun¬ 
dant bloom and set a heavy crop of fruit, 
while the adjoining trees bloomed rather sparsely and set, probably, a half crop of fruit. So far as the natural conditions sur¬ 
rounding these trees was concerned they seemed to be alike, there was every rea¬ 
son for believing that the beneficial effect was attributable to the work of the snail. 

Maj. Fairbanks.—I would like to know about the white fly on younger growth, as it did not seem to be on the older growth. 

Professor Rolfs.—The females deposit their eggs on the younger foliage, as young trees are usually making a vigor¬ 
ous growth, these are apt to have more eggs deposited upon them proportionally than the large trees. It sometimes hap¬ 
pens that a tree will send up a water sprout while the rest of it is practically dormant, if this occurs during the flight of the white fly, the water sprout will be

found to have received myriads of eggs on the lower side of the leaves. 

Mr. Henderson.—I want to touch on one point about the white fly. I am not properly in the orange belt, but I have about one hundred trees. In the fall of 
1904 the white fly appeared on one tree. 
I was told if I would cut all the leaves off the one tree I would be free of the white fly, which I did. This is good. I had them only on the one tree. 

Prof. Rolfs.—In the matter of keeping the white fly restricted to the area already inhabited. I may cite one instance that occurred among a number, in which we succeeded in eradicating the fly after it had become pretty well established, I am referring to the case that happened at 
West Palm Beach. A wealthy gentle¬ 
man who had a fine house at Orlando, 
decided to build a finer one at West Palm 
Beach, and after the house was built he carried with him some trees and shrubs. 
After these had been set out, probably some six months, it was discovered that they were infested with white fly. Per¬ 
mission was obtained to destroy every thing to which the white fly had spread, 
all the shrubbery, including citrus planted out, were grubbed up and burned, some of the stuff such as the stems of banana plants that would not burn were thrown into the lake. 

Later investigations failed to bring to light any white fly, we think therefore, 
that the pest was stopped and eradicated at the point of infection. If the infection is checked before migration of the white fly takes place, I think it entirely possible to eradicate it. 

Mr. Cook.—How did you destroy the white fly? If he is in the air, is he killed, or will he propagate a second vear ? 

m/ 

Prof. Rolfs.—The white fly in its com¬ 


plete development goes through the egg stage; the larval stage, during the first part of which it crawls about and during the latter part it remains stationary; the pupa stage which to the unaided eye is not very different from the larval stage, 
but can be distinguished from it by the use of a hand lens; and the last stage or adult state. During the last stage is the insect able to fly and only during this stage does it reproduce itself. 

During the summer season the eggs hatch in about three days. The larval stage lasts for about twenty five days, the third stage or pupa stage lasts for about ten days. The adult insect lives only a very short time, the females lay about all of their eggs during the first twenty four hours, the adult flies live only about three or four days. The time required for an entire generation during the summer tim.e, according to Professor Gossard, is about forty or fifty days, while during the winter portion of the year it may be nearly six months. 

Mr. Cook.—Does the white fly only live long enough to propagate the first time? Does it lay more than one crop of eggs? 

Prof. Rolfs.—The white fly appears to lay only about twenty five eggs and when this hatch is laid off she does not appear to lay a second batch. 

Mr. Cook.—I can spray my trees, but the white fly commences laying her eggs the next night. I have not been able to destroy the eggs. 

Prof. Rolfs.—During the summertime there is almost a continuous appearance of adult flies, there are, however, periods during which only few are on the wing, at such a time the work of combatting this pest can be carried on to best advantage. 

Mr. Cook.—Do I understand that they disappear after laying? 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


39 


Prof. Rolfs.—There are three or four periods during which the adults appear in countless numbers. During this time it is probably not best, to spray, excepting where it is done for special purposes, 
spraying can be done most effectively be¬ 
tween the broods. 

Mr. Griffing.—Prof. Rolfs mentions that a large portion of the State is now free from the white fly. While this dis¬ 
cussion has been confined to Manatee, 
I would ask if it can be determined just where the territories are that are now affected. 

Prof. Rolfs.—We can not give you the definite data as to what portions of the 
State are infested with white fly and what portions are not. Prof. Gossard had this pretty thoroughly worked out, 
but we know that every year the insect is spreading to new districts and we know how reluctant people are especially if he happens to be a Nurseryman to admit that white fly is present on his premises. A 
man might not hesitate to state the fact privately but he would not like to have it advertised. 

t 

Mr. -.—I have specimens of fun¬ 

gus which I presume the citrus growers are familiar with. Last year the State was full of this particular fungus. The damage is not known as yet, but we hope to know about it soon. Last year we had scarcely any scab at all, but this year we have an abundance of it. Some one found that by spraying the scab with 
Bordeaux mixture that it could be con¬ 
trolled. This scab will develop on the sweet trees also. xA.lso on grape fruit it is very severe. [The fungus referred to is the sour orange scab. Cladosporium ele- 
ganus. Sec.] 

Mr. Longley.—Is it more prevalent on grapefruit or oranges? 


Mr.-.—On lemon it is more severe 

than on any citrus stock. 

Mr. Longley.—Is the fungus shown on , 
vigorous growing trees? 

Mr.-.—The fungus attacks trees 

when they are very small, and it seems to make very little difference whether the tree is growing thriftily or not. I believe, 
however, we see it more frequently on thrifty trees. 

Mr. Longley.—Will the fungus spread during the summer? 

Mr. -.—Very little growth appears 

during that time, but if we have a dry season we are not apt to get much of it. 
It requires a rainy season for this to grow. ^ 

Mr. Longley.—Did that same fungus attack lemon trees prior to the freeze. 

Mr. -.—Yes. 

Mr. Beers.—Will inoculation of blue- 
stone be beneficial? 

Mr. -.—I should say^ no. This 

would have no preventative effect. 

Mr. Taber.—To what extent have you found this scab affecting trees? 

Mr.-.—Some sweet oranges are 

sometimes affected slightly; the satsuma^ 
very badly. Ordinary oranges we have no trouble with at all after the buds begin to grow. The scab I referred to was that on tall bearing trees, and so differs in that respect. 

Mr. Waite.—Referring to the sour scab on the grapefruit, I will say that in the last few days I have received a letter from a gentleman who says his trees are all more or less effected with fungi, with the exception of about two acres where the trees are located on a shell mound, 
there they seem to be free from , it, is it lime the trees require? 

Dr. Rolfs.—I cannot answer as to this question as we have made no experiment

on this line. It may be due to location, 
soil, or the shell. 

Mr. Fairbanks.—Is there any way of producing and developing non-resisting trees ? 

Mr. Brown.—It may be possible that there are some varieties of grapefruit that are more resistent than others. 

President McCarty.—This is a matter worthy of study. I hope something may be attempted along this line. I think it probable that something can be done, but 
I cannot tell how long it will take. 

Mr. Brown—There is one other dis¬ 
ease, that is withertip: I do not know how many here are familiar with it. If there are those*Fere who know anything about the withertip, I will beg to hear from them. 

Prof. Rolfs.—I have been studying the disease (withertip) for the last four years, and have also treated groves vary¬ 
ing in size from a few trees up to over twenty acres in extent. The methods of procedure are pretty thoroughly worked out. A bulletin on this subject was pub¬ 
lished from the Department of Agricul¬ 
ture, Wasington, D. C., and a revised edition of this bulletin is now being pre¬ 
pared. 

In addition to my own experience in treating this disease, I have given advice to many grove owners and have watched the application of this advice. Where the work is done thoroughly and followed up conscientiously the results have always been satisfactory. A number of groves that were treated according to advice, and were very badly infected with the disease, 
are now practically free. As there are a number of men present who have had practical experience in combating with this disease, I should like to hear from them. 

Mr. Phelps.—I have several groves 


that have been badly effected by this withertip; my fruit dropped badly and I 
wrote to Professor Rolfs but did not hear from him promptly, so I wrote to a spray¬ 
er and asked about inoculating with blue- 
stone. I asked him if it would not have the same effect as spraying. I urged inoculating, mixing equal parts of blue stone and air slacked lime. I have been doing this and find that after it has been in about ten days or two weeks there is a great deal of gum coming out. That is as far as I have gotten and I do not know what the effects will be. 

Mr. Hart.—Before we leave the mat¬ 
ter of diseases and insects there is a very important matter. I am losing trees briefly. A year ago I introduced a reso¬ 
lution asking that we get more assistance from the Agricultural Department in the study of blight, I took it up with Mr. 
Wilson who promised to help us if we could get in shape to receive it. I want to put in the same resolution. This is an important matter. I am losing trees now that would bear ten or twelve boxes each year, and I am putting in new trees in each place and have a tree growing wherever there is a place for it, but my grove is uneven, I am not alone in this experience; this disease is all over the 
State but we do not know much about it yet and it is something we should look after. 

Mr. Painter.—Your Secretary present¬ 
ed the resolution to Secretary Wilson in person, Mr. Wilson said he would be glad to do more than they were doing if he could but that all of their appropria¬ 
tion for this class of work had been used up. I am confident the only way we can get an appropriation for this work is to take it up with our Senators and Repre¬ 
sentatives and get them to ask for an ap¬ 
propriation. 








MAP SHOW'IXC; LOCATION OF CO-OPERATIVE EXPERIMENTS. 

















The Experiment Station Co-operative Work. 


BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS, 

DIRECTOR FLORIDA EXPERIMENT STATION. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In beginning my talk on the Experi¬ 
ment Station co-operative work I can¬ 
not do better than to show how the pur¬ 
poses for which the Experiment Station was founded is frequently misjudged, 
and in many quarters not understood. 
So much work has been done with the 
Horticultural Society, as a society, and with the different members of the Society, 
personally, that nearly everyone in my hearing is probably better informed than the best informed outside the Horticul¬ 
tural Society. In 1887 Congress pro¬ 
vided for the Experiment Station by pas¬ 
sing the Hatch Act. To show concisely what was intended by the Hatch Act I 
will quote you Section 2 verbatim : 

“Section 2. That it shall be the object and duty of said Experiment Stations to conduct original researches or experi¬ 
ments on the physiology of plants and animals; the diseases to which they are severally subject, with the remedies for the same; the chemical composition of plants at their different stages of growth; 
the comparative advantages of rotative cropping as pursued under a varying series of crops; the capacity of new plants or trees for acclimation; the analysis of soils and water; the chemical composition of manures, natural or artificial, with ex¬ 
periments designed to test their compara¬ 
tive effects on crops of different kinds; 
the adaptation and value of grasses and 


forage plants; the composition and diges¬ 
tibility of the different kinds of food for domestic animals; scientific and economic questions involved in the production of butter and cheese; and such other re¬ 
searches of experiments bearing directly on the agricultural industry of the United 
States as may in each case be deemed advisable, having due regard to the vary¬ 
ing conditions and needs of the respective 
States and Territories.” 

This, as you will see, makes a very clear cut statement of what the funds are to be used for. Thus, things which are not provided for in this Act are necessari¬ 
ly not contemplated and not permissi¬ 
ble under it. The Congress, previous to the one in session at the present time, 
passed a law requiring tliQ Secretary of 
Agriculture to supervise the experiments much more closely, and also co-ordinate the experiments in different States. 

During the past year Congress has passed the Adams Act which will prove of great benefit to the Experiment Sta¬ 
tion, and directly, to the people of Flori¬ 
da. In this Act an additional $5000 are appropriated, which is increased by $2000 
annually, until it shall reach $15000. 
This fund is more closely guarded even than that of the Hatch Fund. I quote you from this Act which appropriates the fund. 

* * * “to be applied only to paying the necessary expenses of conducting 



42 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


original researches or experiments bear¬ 
ing directly on the agricultural industry of the United States, having due regard to the varying conditions and needs of the respective States and Territories.” 

The term, “original research,” might be a very general one were it not for the fact that the Director of the Ofhce of 
Experiment Stations is held responsible for the interpretation of the expenditure of this fund. The Director of the Office of Experiment Stations has probably had more experience in Experiment Station work than any other living man, and con¬ 
sequently is able to tell at a glance wheth¬ 
er a proposed piece of work is original research, or whether it is a piece of demonstration work, or, what not. 

In interpreting this law the Secretary of Agriculture has issued a circular letter in which he states: 

* * * “Accordingly, expenses for ad¬ 
ministration, care of buildings and grounds, insurance, office furniture and fittings, general maintenance of the sta¬ 
tion farm and animals, verification and demonstration experiments, compilations, 
farmers’ institute work, travelling, except as is immediately connected with original researches in progress under this Act, 
and other general expenses for the main¬ 
tenance of the experiment stations, are not to be charged to this fund. The Act makes no provision for printing or for the distribution of publications, which should be charged to other funds.” 

I have thus taken considerable time to show you exactly what are the essential parts of the laws founding the Experi¬ 
ment Stations, and also what limitations are placed upon us. I do this from the fact that there seems to be a general mis¬ 
information as to what the office and privilege of the Experiment Station is. 


Even our legislators who assemble at 
Tallahassee bi-ennially and even people higher in authority have had erroneous impressions in regard to the essential parts of the law. 

The Hatch Act was passed in 1888 and became operative in the same year. This makes the experiment station a little over seventeen years old. During this time it has published 84 bulletins and several annual reports. Of the 84 bulletins 46 
are devoted to horticultural work directly, 
and portions of the remaining 38 are also devoted to horticultural work; and also a large part of many of the annual re¬ 
ports. From this you will see that the horticultural interests of the State have been well looked after. This is especially so in more recent years. Taking the- 
last teil years we find that 36 of the bul¬ 
letins, are devoted to horticultural matters. 
Most of these being fully illustrated. In the last five years 22 bulletins have been published on horticultural matters. Some of these have been profusely illus¬ 
trated. If no other bulletins had been, 
published from the Experiment Station within the last five years than those pub¬ 
lished on Horticultural subjects, the re¬ 
quirements of the law, so far as publica¬ 
tions were concerned, would have been more than met. 

The matter contained in these bulletins in the most cases, has received world¬ 
wide attention. 

The pineapple growers of Florida have at their disposal the most thoroughly reliable scientific publications on their special subject that has been published anywhere in the world. Within the pres¬ 
ent fiscal year two new bulletins on this subject have been issued which many of you will find on your tables when you reach home from this meeting. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

From the beginning the Experiment 
Station has had an appropriation of 
$15000 a year. During the seventeen years of its life the State of Florida has not appropriated anything toward equip¬ 
ment and maintenance of this institution. 
Consequently what it has done has been accomplished entirely on Federal appro¬ 
priation. This, of course, is much to be regretted, especially from the fact that, 
if, additional funds from the State had been accessible it would have been pos¬ 
sible to have erected very suitable build¬ 
ings and to undertake much more elabor¬ 
ate and useful experiments than it has been possible in the present conditions. 
Frequently in planning experiments these have had to be altered in such a way as to make it possible to meet the expendi¬ 
tures under the conditions imposed by the 
Hatch Act. Another serious condition that has arisen is the fact that the amount of appropriation has not been increased since the inauguration of the experiment stations and yet the living expenses and supplies have nearly doubled in prices. 
In some cases these have more than doubled in price. This is especially true of labor in the vicinity of the Experiment 
Station. 

CO-OPERATION. 

Our most successful experiments that have been carried out by the Elorida 
Experiment Station the State has co¬ 
operated with the Experiment Station. 
Among the first of these co-operative ex¬ 
periments was the one conducted in the fertilization of pineapples on the field be¬ 
longing to Mr. T. V. Moore, at Jensen, 
Florida. In this experiment Mr. Moore furnished the field and took care of it; 
while the Experiment Station furnisfied the fertilizer and made the application. 


The crop was the property of Mr. Moore, 
excepting that the Experiment Station made use of as many of the ripened pine¬ 
apples as might be needed for scientific work. This piece of work proved to be so thoroughly successful, that in spite of the fact that the writer was roundly criti¬ 
cised by members of the Board of Trus¬ 
tees, they found themselves in a position where his successor was permitted to car¬ 
ry out the exact line of work after a year or two of interruption. 

In this connection allow me to say that the members of the Elorida State Horti¬ 
cultural Society have always given the 
Experiment Station their generous sym¬ 
pathy, and in every way pointed out to them, have co-operated and helped us along in the most cordial way. This generous co-operation has not been merely that of words of encouragement, 
but in actual help in the field. Our sci¬ 
entific staff is not only welcome but re¬ 
quests and importunities are constantly coming for expert help and advice in the field. Whenever possible we respond promptly and cheerfully. There are times however when the conditions at the Experiment Station will not permit us to be absent. It shows that a very great interest is being taken at the pres¬ 
ent time in scientific information, and that the latest and most improved meth¬ 
ods are sought. 

NEEDS OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION. 

The first requisite of the Experiment 
Station is to have your hearty sympathy and support. These you have given very generously, though, possibly, not always in the most effective way. We have at times lost some of our most active and energetic men, that could have been saved to us if every member of the horticultural 


44 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Society had demanded of the Trustees that the resignation be not accepted. 

That we have no support from the 
Legislature to supplement the funds of the Experiment Station has already been indicated. There is however, a very general misconception on this point, not only by the Legislators, but also by the 
Agricultural constituents in the State. 
The Experiment Station is frequently importuned by the Agricultural people to hold farmers institutes. Erom the read¬ 
ing of the law which I have quoted it is clear that it was not contemplated by 
Congress when this act was passed to use the funds of the Experiment Station for 
Earmer’s Institutes nor for demonstra¬ 
tion work. The following paragraph is taken from a letter of instruction sent out by the Secretary of Agriculture to the 
Directors of Experiment Stations: 

‘^‘The increased liberality of the Eederal 
Government in providing for the endow¬ 
ment of research and experimentation in agriculture should be a further incentive to the States and local communities to supplement these funds for the extension of demonstration experiments, farmers’ 
institutes, agricultural colleges, schools, 
and courses of instruction, and the gen¬ 
eral education of the rural communities along industrial lines, in order that the masses of our farmers may be so edu¬ 
cated from early youth that they will ap¬ 
preciate the benefits of original research and experimentation as applied to agri¬ 
cultural problems and be able to appro¬ 
priate in the most effective manner for their own benefit and the general welfare of the nation whatever practical results are obtained from the work of the agri¬ 
cultural experiment stations.” 

Erom this you will see that it is very clear that the expenses of organizing and 


running farmer’s institutes and other similar institutions in the State of Elorida must be met from funds provided by the 
Legislature. 

SEPARATION OF THE EXPERIMENT STA¬ 
TION FROM THE UNIVERSITY. 

The Board of Control of the Elorida educational institutions as soon as they came into power decided to make a more sharply defined segregation between the 
University and the Experiment Station. 
Through their President Dr. Sledd of the 
University, they have promised us that the workers in the Experiment Station should not be required to do University work. 

This segregation has its advantages and also its disadvantages. It has its disadvantages in losing the services of, at least, two very able men. Dr. Elint and 
Dr. Sellards; on the other hand, it has its advantages in securing the undivided efforts of a number of the best workers that we have in the South. During the present fiscal year: i. e., until June 30, the connection between the University and 
Experiment Station will continue as it has been for the past fourteen years. At the beginning of the next fiscal year, 
which is July ist, the Experiment Station staff will be entirely free from teaching- 
work. This will make it possible for this corp of scientists to devote their entire time to the working out of experiments that have been inaugurated. It will also enable them to visit various portions of the State of Elorida at such a time, and for such a length of time, as their experi¬ 
ment work will permit. During the coming year it will be possible to deliver lectures from time to time at other points and at more frequent intervals.

REMOVAL TO- GAINESVILLE. 

Every member of the Horticultural So¬ 
ciety is familiar with the fact that the 
University of Florida is to be transferred to a new site at Gainesville during the coming year. At the same time when the University is transferred the Experi¬ 
ment Station will also be moved to its new location. The Board of Control are providing at Gainesville commodious 


buildings for every department in the 
Experiment Station; also propagating house, grounds, and other equipments necessary for beginning work at once. 
The plans have been made and are being carried out successfully so that there will be no interruption in the experiments that are already in progress and also make it possible to carry forward any new pro¬ 
jects that may be found desirable. 


Report of the Standing Committee on Peaches, 

Plums and Pears. 


l 

BY G. M. GRIFFING. 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I as chairman of the committee, ad¬ 
dressed a letter to the two other mem¬ 
bers of the committee, Mr. E. H. Hay¬ 
ward, of DeLand and Mr. J. Y. McKin¬ 
ney of Candler, asking if it was their wish that the report be made jointly, or if they wished to make a separate report and asked for suggestions, as neither of¬ 
fered any suggestions or assistance, I pro¬ 
ceed to prepare the following report. 
Was quite in hope of getting some valu¬ 
able assistance from these gentlemen as each are from sections where there is in¬ 
terest taken in peach growing. 

“In no line of business is there more need of Enterprise, and more problems to answer than in the growing and market¬ 
ing of fancy peaches.” These were the words of Prof. M. B. Waite of the De¬ 
partment of Agriculture, in opening his 
Address before the Georgia Horticultural 
Society at Dublin, Ga. in 1900, a man who has not only studied peach growing from a scientific standpoint, but from a practi¬ 
cal as well, he owning large orchard in¬ 
terests. Never was there a statement truer. Yet, where in all this vast country of ours can we find a people better fitted, 
better qualified to master this branch of horticulture, and reach the maximum of results, than we find in the Ranks of the 


Florida Horticultural Society. Men who have withstood the adversities and the disappointments that they have, yet who have come out victorous over all; certain¬ 
ly will not acknowledge defeat and aban¬ 
don an enterprise that has made our big sister States, Georgia and Texas famous. 
It is true that we are farther from mar¬ 
ket than our Georgia Brothers and that we do not have the famous Elberta va¬ 
riety. These are slight disadvantages we will admit, but we have advantages that outweigh these many times. What are they? Well, I should not think that any true Floridian would ask that question. 
It is some thing you all brag of and talk about. Why just simply Florida climate that enables us to grow and market the first good peaches of the season offered to the American people, and we have this market all our own for from two to four weeks. Not only this, but in point of flavor and carrying quality it is the best of the year, whether from Georgia, Tex¬ 
as or Michigan. This is rather a broad statement, but before I am through I 
hope to prove it to your entire satisfac¬ 
tion. 

I do not mean that every neglected, 
gnarly and diseased tree or orchard ot 
Jewell, Waldo, Imperial and other Flori¬ 
da varieties is going to produce this su¬ 
perb peach if left in that neglected un- 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

healthy condition. No most certainly not. What I do mean is that the orchard planted in soil adapted to the growth of peaches, that is well cultivated and cared for from the day it is planted, that is rightly fertilized and fruit properly thin¬ 
ned, picked at the right stage of maturi¬ 
ty, carefully handled, packed and ship¬ 
ped under refrigeration, will vindicate the statement that I have made. It has done it for the Griffing Florida Orchard 
Company and will do it for others. If the same careful painstaking attention is given to the growing and marketing that is given by our successful Horticulturist and trucker to the growing and market¬ 
ing of oranges and the tender vegetable crops, that has proved the backbone and the chief support of our State. In the brief time allotted for the reading of this paper I am not going to attempt touching on the' details of planting, pruning and cultivation, these are primary points known to all horticulturists. 

What we want is to interest more peo¬ 
ple in peach growing, then a few words about the selection of the orchard site, 
the treating of the diseases, and last but not least, the harvesting and shipping. 

We need five hundred carloads of 
Florida peaches a year to sufficiently in¬ 
troduce them in the great markets of our country, so that even a small percentage of the fruit eating, fruit loving people will learn to know, remember, and recog¬ 
nize them and call for them from their fruiters so long as they are to be had in the markets. How many markets know them this way now? One! Just one! 
Philadelphia is the only city that it can be said any perceptible number of the con¬ 
sumers recognize the merits of our Flori¬ 
da peach, and last year over forty cars of 


our Florida peaches were marketed there. 
Each day leading the market. Many of these cars were held in storage from two to three weeks. I was on the market one morning when there was over thirty cars of Elbertas displayed and sold, and that morning two carloads of The Griffing 
Florida Orchard Company pack of Imper¬ 
ial peaches were sold from the cold sto¬ 
rage without the buyers even examiining or looking at a crate at a price 25 cents above the price paid for the Elbertas on the dock. Why? Because these buyers knew that they had customers that would have no others so long as these lasted. 

It is not my object to pit our Florida peaches against the famous Elberta or to encroach upon the season of the Elber¬ 
ta in Georgia, Alabama or Texas, but I 
do want to condemn to everlasting doom, 
that miserable class known as the Per¬ 
sian type, comprising such varieties as 
Amsden, Alexander, Early Beatrice, and of the later introductions, Greensboro, 
Triumph, Sneed, etc. As Downing once said of this class of peach “a peach quick to ripen and quick to rot.” In fact, they are green, ripe and rotten at one and the same time, the under or shaded side will be green, the side next to the sun and light will be ripe, and the blossom end rotten. Delightful conditions to find in a fruit to create and build up a demand for it. Yet, hundreds of carloads of this class of peaches are shipped from Georgia, 
Alabama and Texas yearly. So soon as 
Florida produces sufficient peaches to be really felt and known upon the market, 
the demand for this class of peaches will cease and good Florida peaches will bring good prices with a strong demand. Ful¬ 
ly ninety per cent, of the fruit eating peo¬ 
ple supplied from our great markets do 


48 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


not know that there are any good peaches until in July and August when the Elber- 
tas and the later, better class of fruit is being marjketed, and for that reason there is no strong demand in May and June. 
A burned child dreads the fire and will give it a wide birth after suffering from its effects. So also the careful housewife who after buying one or two lots of in¬ 
ferior peaches with no quality, hesitates about trying another lot. Restaurants and Hotels will not put peaches on the menues until the Stewards know that there is a sufficient supply of good fruit so that they can be sure to get it daily and in sufficient quantities for their needs. 
As the situation now exists, Florida peaches only reach the Cheap Dago fruit stand trade. There is no real life in most markets for our peaches and there will not be until sufficient quantities are pro¬ 
duced for them to become an item in the markets. 

If Florida produced from twelve to fif¬ 
teen hundred carloads of peaches a year the average price per crate would be fully 
25 cents higher than has been realized. 

The Secretary has a few account sales realized by the Grififing Florida Orchard 
Company the past three years, which he will pass around for those interested to examine. These I consider fair prices and which will yield the owners of an orchard as great a percentage of profit as any branch of fruit growing or truck¬ 
ing. These account sales are taken at random, out of three years sales, we of course omitting those, that owing to de¬ 
lays in transit, insufficient or improper re¬ 
frigeration caused the fruit to arrive in bad order, and covers the shipping season from early in June until late in July.

eral cars were held in cold storage all of which came out in fine condition. 

We give the account sales of the last one taken out which sold on July 28th. 

None of the Jewell variety is included in these cars. The Jewell would have commenced ripening about two weeks ear¬ 
lier and would have prolonged the season that much. The Griffing Florida Orchard 
Company now has about 100 acres of 
Jewell at Komoko, all of which were killed by frost, and a hundred acres at 
Richland Pasco county planted this past winter. Another year we hope to move our first cars by loth to 15th of May. 

As further evidence of the impression 

H -4 


good Florida peaches make upon the mar¬ 
ket will read the following extracts from letters from our Commission Men, the originals of which can be seen at the Sec¬ 
retary’s desk. 

Philadelphia^, Pa., June 22nd, 1903. 

Gentlemen : Car of peaches arrived last night, found them good-color, but no larger in size than previous lot, selling fancies $2.25, choice $1.85, expect to finish the car at these prices. Very good demand and outlook favorable. Wired you situa¬ 
tion. Sorry to know you have no more for immediate shipment, just got our cus¬ 
tomers nicely started on this fruit, and could handle three cars a week to advan¬ 
tage. Quite a good many Georgia peach¬ 
es in today, mostly Carmen, Waddells and 
Early River, fruit much larger than the 
Florida stock but not- as good color or flavor, fancies selling $1.75 to $2.00 and choice $1.25 to $1.50. So you see your 
Florida peaches are bringing more than the best Georgias. 

H. B. Williams, Inc. 


The following is copy of a letter H. 
B. Williams wrote Mr. Frank Lindsey, 
their representative, with reference to 
Florida peaches: 

Dear Sir: Have telegraphed you on peaches, Griffings car arrived, took out a portion, sold fancies $2.25 choice $1.85. 
Good color but small compared with 
Georgia fruit. Had car from Hale Geor¬ 
gia Orchard Co. their smallest grade much larger than the Florida fancies and selling at a lower price. Selling Hales 
Extra Fancies $ 1-75 ^ $2.00, fancies 
$1.50, choice $1.25, so you see Florida fruit is bringing high prices compared with Georgia.

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


July ist_, 1903. 

Gents: Have no letter or wire from you today in reference to shipment of peaches; fear you did nOt get car off. 
This is unfortunate as market continues active for your peaches. No trouble to get $2.50 for fancies and $2.25 for choice. 
Outlook favorable. Our customers will want more of the Florida stock, while 
Georgias are larger they are not as good flavor as the Floridas. 

H. B. Williams, Inc. 


July 2ist, 1904. 

Gents : We took one crate of the Im¬ 
perial peaches out of Cold Storage to¬ 
day, which had been put in there July 
2nd, and it came out sound as a dollar. 
If we had a car of them today could get two dollars for them. With a big crop of Imperial peaches, and a short crop in 
Georgia, twenty or twenty five cars of these peaches in storage they would sell like gold dollars. Their keeping qualities are excellent. 

H. B. Williams, Inc. 


New York, June 17TH, 1905. 

Gentlemen : I want to state that it is a pleasure to handle goods put up in the style and careful manner which you ship in. The trade here recognizes that your brand of Florida peaches, is by far the best that comes from Florida. There will be no trouble in the future of obtaining top of the market. 

Lyon Bros. Co. 


Philadelphia, Pa., May ii, 1905. 
Dear Sirs : We are enclosing you a letter received from Mr. J. H. Hale on the conditions of the crop in Georgia. 

One of our customers called on us and 


wanted to know if your crop was secured this year from the cold weather. When we assured him it was he has gone to the expense of twenty to twenty-five dollars in having a large sign painted across the front of his store “Headquarters for Grif- 
fing Peaches.” He has given us instruc¬ 
tion^ that he wants 100 crates every day as long as you ship, so you see we feel very much encouraged over the inquiry we are having for your peaches.

New York, July 25TH ,1904. 

Gentlemen : We have your several communications and it is very satisfac¬ 
tory to us to have you express yourselves as being satisfied with the results, but, 
we wish to state that a great deal of cred¬ 
it for the results we obtained for your peaches is due to yourselves, for by the style of your packing and the delicious flavor of your peaches, caused the buy¬ 
ers to seek for more and buy liberally. 

They were at the top of the market every day we had them to offer. We can say honestly that the eating quality of your peaches were superior in flavor and lacked that bitter taste from the skin that many of the Florida peaches had, that were on the market, and we can assure you that you can look forward to always having New York take your peaches at the top prices and as many as you can place on this market.

Philadelphia, July 8, 1905. 

Dear Sirs : We wired you today to ship all peaches possible here. I enclose you a letter received from Mr. Hale today in which you will note he says about the peach crop there. This is contrary to

what he wrote us a few days ag*o in re¬ 
gard to the situation, so they must have gone to rot very suddenly. You will no¬ 
tice he says they are rotting green on the trees. 

If your peaches arriving here Monday are in good shape and the Elbertas begin to show any rot here, we are going* to put them in the cold room, because the last few cars of peaches you shipped us have been the finest you have ever shipped in the last few years and the trade are more than pleased with them. I could have sold ten cars today as easily as one at these prices. I never saw them any bet¬ 
ter size and better color. 

H. B. Williams. 


I hope that I have now impressed upon your mind three things. First, that there is a good demand for Florida peaches. 
Second, that if properly grown we have the best flavored and best keeping peach of the year. Third, that there is money in it. 

Now for the troubles and vexations. 
And I assure you that the path of the peach grower is not strewn with roses. 
Neither can he lay on beds of ease and wait for nature and our climate to bring forth fruit in abundance. Nature and climate if yoked together, and intelligent¬ 
ly worked will produce wonders. But it wont answer to let them run loose. 
Oh yes! they will continue to work. But as if vexed at your presumption in yoking them together, and working them for your benefit, they voluntarily enlist in the enemies forces. Nature has created an insect or a form of plant life to prey on and feed off of every other form of in¬ 
sect or plant life in existence, and our cli¬ 
matic conditions are such as to rapidly 


develop these forms of insect and plant growth which could be justly termed ene¬ 
mies of mankind. Therefore if we would succeed in the cultivation of peaches, 
plums and pears all of which are especial¬ 
ly subject to these enemies, we must eith¬ 
er stir ourselves and find nature’s way of controlling them, either by parasitic or predacious insects or fungus, or find arti¬ 
ficial means of combating them. 

As the peach is the first and most im¬ 
portant of the fruits under consideration, 
will dwell more at length on Ihe troubles of the peach grower. It commences with the nurseryman at the time the pit is planted for no sooner is the little seedling fairly taken root, than an enemy is ready to devour it. This enemy is the Nema¬ 
tode Angoulula, commonly called iroot knot. For a remedy or a preventative from this nematode, we are forced to appeal to nature for no artificial means for controlling or eradicating, praticable for the orchardist, has been discovered. 
The preventative nature provides is the planting of the nursery or the orchard on virgin soil, not subject to washes from old field land. This nematode, the An- 
g'oulula, is present in all our light south¬ 
ern soils, and only needs the presence of plant roots pleasing to his majesty’s pal¬ 
ate for him to feed upon to multiply in myriads and so infest the land that a young peach tree, however healthy when 
|#aced there, cannot thrive. The only known means of eradicating this pest from the soil is heating it to a high de¬ 
gree, or the saturation of the earth with bi-sulphide of carbon as sugges¬ 
ted by Mr. Bessey in his valuable pa¬ 
per on Nemiatodes. This is sometimes practiced for potting earth for green¬ 
house or bedding plants, but not practical 



52 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


for the orchardist. Therefore the sim¬ 
ple and effective preventative is to plant on virgin soils, free from washes from old fields. With this simple precaution, and planting trees free from the disease, no serious annoyance should be experienced from this source. 

The next trouble likely to attract the peach grower’s attention, will probably be the borer. Many are the devices that have been invented and reme¬ 
dies tried all of which have proven more or less a failure. Of these remedies I 
believe the Porter system of treatment the best and most practical. This system of treatment as invited by Mr. C. M. 
Porter of Douglas, Ga. and offered by him in farm rights, consists of a series of mounding, worming and applying a caustic wash. We have tried it on our own orchards, and from present obser¬ 
vation and status of experiment l^elieve it of some value. The method of treat¬ 
ment employed most largely in our own orchards and by many of the largest and most successful orchardists of the south, 
is the banking around the trees to a height of eight to fifteen inches in July and August, before the fly deposits the egg on the body of the trees. This forces him to deposit the egg well up on the body. In the fall or early winter this dirt is removed,leaving the young larva in the body of the tree well up in the air, where the bark will harden as soon as the earth is removed causing many to perish. 
Would also recoiumend after removino: 
the earth, the scraping the body of the tree from the crown roots up to 12 or 15 
inches in height with a sharpedged instru¬ 
ment, this will disturb and kill many more of the young larva. The painting of the bodies from the crown to the limbs after 


the earth has been removed, with a strong caustic solution, will also be beneficial in killing many of the larva and preventing others that hatch higher up or that have been knocked off from entering the bark. 
After these precautions have been taken, 
a few will likely have escaped, dig them out with the point of pruning knife, as soon as they show themselves by their signs, an excretion of a half gummy half sawdusty matter from* the point where the young larva entered and commenced to feed. With these precautions no serious trouble or loss should be experienced from the borer. 

The next annoyance noticed is likely to be Gall knots on the roots and crowns and which is generally accepted as Crown 
Gall and if it is the true Crown Gall, I 
consider that it has been much over-rated, 
and especially so by some of the entomo¬ 
logists and pittiologists in some sections. 

Mr. A. C. Weiting Commissioner of 
Agriculture, Albany, N. Y. in an article in the National Nurserymen, in discuss¬ 
ing Crown Gall said, “All Galls on the roots are not Crown Galls, a distinction between them may be made.” He fur¬ 
ther said “the galls caused by aphids are usally knotty and very hard, while the 
Crown Gall is rather soft and as easily cut as a turnip. Its tissues being brain like in formation.” As the knots usually found on the peach trees are usually hard woody substance covered with thick pul¬ 
py bark and wart-like formation. I am very doubtful about the most of it be¬ 
ing the true Crown Gall. This Gall knot has by some been confused with the root- 
knot Angoulul'a, and by others with the black-knot of the cherry and plum of the states farther north. It is entirely dis¬ 
tinct and different from the former, but 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


53 


somewhat similar yet different from the latter. It seems to be caused from a fun¬ 
gus which I believe is either always pres¬ 
ent or develops spontaneously in much of our southern soil. This may be a lit¬ 
tle radical and not in accordance with some of my professional friends’ views, 
but I will give one of my reasons for the assertion and I believe the experience of those present, who may have had occasion to note same will sustain me. Natural peach seed can be gathered, and I believe if test wanted to be carried far enough, 
sterilized sufficient to kill any possible germs on the exterior of the pits, and planted in virgin soil, and a percent, will develop these gall knots. In some piec¬ 
es of ground not one tree in 5000 will develop a knot, while in another plat, 
or possibly in a different section of the same field, one or even two per cent, may show it. The Marianna plum roots are especial!}^ subject to the attack of Gall knots. Cuttings from apparently healthy trees can be planted in any ordinary field, 
grown one year, and grafted the follow¬ 
ing winter with scions of the desired variety taken from an equally healthy tree, and by digging time, one to ten, 
sometimes as high as fifteen percent, will develop gall knot. Now where did these knots come from if, the fungus causing same, was not either already present in the soil simply waiting for a suitable plant to establish itself upon or de- 
\^^loped spontaneously. The loss from these Gall knots is usually small. As a remedy would advise removing the knots if they apt>ear on the body or crown of the tree where they can be detected and the cut place moistened with a saturated solution of Blue stone water. They will never appear again at the place. If you 


get too much of the Sulphate of Copper 
(Blue Stone) in the wound it may cause a dead place in the wood. I have seen these gall knots for twenty years, or ever since the first work I did in a nursery, 
even before our own nursery was found¬ 
ed. I have seen the same in all portions of this State, in Georgia, Alabama and my brother reports the same in Texas. 
I cannot see that it is any worse now than twenty years ago and do not believe that it will be any more serious in twenty years hence. 

Will next consider the part in Florida peach growing played by the moist wide¬ 
ly known and widely disseminated scale insect of my knowledge. The San Jose 
Scale. The rapid spread and dissemina¬ 
tion of this scale insect caused more ac¬ 
tivity and discussion by Entomolog^ists than all other scale insects and has caused many very stringent State and Foreign 
National laws to be enacted, some of which are now proving a menace to 
American fruit commerce. This scale pest while bad if allowed to run its own course, is easily controlled, either by natural enemies, the Red or Brown 
Fungus a native Florida Fungus dis¬ 
covered by Prof P. H. Rolfs, now 
Director Florida Experiment Station, 
Dake City, Fla., and the other the 
Chinese Lady Bird (Chilocorus Similis) 
the Natural enemy of the San Jose scale in China, or by artificial means. The most practical and successful artifi¬ 
cial means is the spraying of the trees once or twice during the winter months with lime, sulphur and salt mixture. Two applications during the dormant period is sufficient to keep the scale under perfect control if not eradicating it until introduced again from 


54 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Other infected trees. The following is the formula for the lime, sulphur and salt mixture and our method of prepar¬ 
ing and applying it. 

LIME, SULPHUR AND SALT MLXTURE. 

Rock Lime .21 pounds. 


Flour of Sulphur.15 pounds. 

Salt . 5 pounds. 


Water to make fifty gallons. 

The lime is placed in the cooking bar¬ 
rel with about 10 or 12 gallons of water. 
The steam is turned on, which agitates the lime while Backing preventing it from burning, and renders the slacking more perfect. After lime is thoroughly slack¬ 
ed fill barrel about one-half full of water. 
Mix the sulphur into a paste, after lime is slacked add the sulphur paste and salt and boil vigorously for forty minutes. 

The arranging of cooking plant I will be glad to explain to any one sufficiently interested to write or ask about it. 

In spray machinery we have used everything from a knapsack sprayer to a traction engine and steam pump, the lat¬ 
ter carrying 20 to 30 nozzles, except the gasoline power sprayer. The gasoline power sprayers have never appealed to us for two reasons, first: The weight of en¬ 
gine, pump and tank of water for cooling engine, neccessary to haul around, and second, the intricacy of the little engines and a scarcity of a class of help with a knowledge of gasoline engines that would care to work in as disagreeable work as spraying. When you have a days weath¬ 
er, right for spraying you want the most reliable machine possible. The most prac¬ 
tical we have yet found is the Wallace 
Sprayer, manufactured by Wallace Ma¬ 
chinery Company, Champaign, Ill. The 


pump is driven by a gear from the wheel, 
one extra mule or horse will pull the ex¬ 
tra load occasioned by this gearing and maintain a pressure of from 90 to 120 
pounds. For effective spraying a high pressure must be maintained. The trac¬ 
tion engine outfit did good service, though do not know as it is an economical outfit, 
the 'trouble came from the little annoy¬ 
ances such as two or three of the nozzles out of a cluster of four or six becoming clogged, necessitating the stopping of the remainder of the twenty or thirty noz¬ 
zles for these two or three to be cleaned. 
With thiis steam outfit, an engineer, fire- 
mian and six men could spray thoroughly one side of three rows of trees ranging from 12 to 15 feet in height, about one half as fast as a man would naturally walk up and down the rows, covering about ten acres a (day. With the Wallace outfit three mules and three men would spray one side of one row at a little fas¬ 
ter pace than the engine moved, in fact the team was kept moving slowly and steadily. While I do not know that the 
Wallace Sprayers would be practical in an orange grove, where a great amount of leaf surface is to be covered but for spraying peaches, while in a dormant con¬ 
dition they are practical. 

The curculio, curculio stung or wormy peaches and plums are found in every old peach growing section and in fact in near¬ 
ly every plum thicket. Cures or remedies 
.for this little rascal are few and difficult, 
preventatives are about our only hope. 
Here are a few of them. 

Plant your trees in a place as far dis¬ 
tant from other peach and plum trees where you find worms in the fruit, as possible. . Keep all brush heaps, old rot¬ 
ten logs, and such trash cleaned out 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


55 


from the orchard, and away from around it. Have if possible, a cleared and culti¬ 
vated strip of ground from 150 to 200 
feet between your orchard and uncleared woodland. Trash and rough woodland harbors the curculio; in a large orchard you will invariably find worms worse next to woods or near a pile of trash. 
Jar the trees and pick up all fruit that drops off and also stung fruit found on the trees. This should be repeated every two weeks from the time that peaches are the size of a marble until they are ready to ship. Never allow a drop peach to be plowed under or decay in the orchard for in 99 cases out of 100, 
it has a worm in it that will develop in¬ 
to a beetle that will ruin a thousand peach¬ 
es next spring. Jarring the trees and catching in a sheet or bug catcher the peaches that fall and also the beetles (cur¬ 
culio) that may play o’possum and drop off is an old method practiced by success¬ 
ful plum growers in nearly all parts of the country, and by peach growers in many places. All the drop peaches that may have dropiped the night or day or so before should also be picked up and de¬ 
stroyed. 

If these precautions are taken it will be years before sufficient worms will de¬ 
velop in an orchard to be a menace to the fruit. This year we are trying some spray experiments for curculio and next year hope to be able to report the results. 

Brown Rot Fungus (Monilia Fructig- 
ina) is another pest that must be com¬ 
bated by preventatives rather than reme¬ 
dies, for by the time it makes its appear¬ 
ance and you commence applying your remedy, the mischief is done. The pre¬ 
cautions recommended for the curculio are the principal ones in preventing Brown 


Rot. The removal of all decaying peaches is important. Especially the mummied peaches, that you may occasionally see hanging in the trees. Plow the orchard by blooming time every spring and. be sure to stir the entire surface. This will disturb any mummied and decayed peach¬ 
es that may have accidently been left in the orchard and prevent them from throwing up a lot of larger fungus growth in the form of toad stools that will throw off sufficient brown rot fungus spores from a single mommied pleach tO' in¬ 
fest the trees of a five acre orchard. 
All caustic spray solutions are good as fungicides, the lime sulphur and salt mixture is equal to almost any fungicide known and one or two 
Spraying'S' during the winter Jo kill scale, will rid the trees of all fungus spores that may be carrying over on -the trees, again if these trees are well spray¬ 
ed and well covered with this caustic so¬ 
lution, at blooming time the spores that may be thrown off 'from the toad stools in the spring cannot get a foot hold on the trees. Another precaution is to so fertilize and cultivate the trees as not to produce a heavy foliage, also trim all the trees so as to be open in the middle when carrying a load of fruit so as to admit as much air and light as possible. 

This I believe covers a list of insects and fungus pests that cause the worst trouble to the peach grower. The same ones that we have here, trou¬ 
ble them in the north also Georgia, 
Alabama and Texas. Besides in the north and in portions of the other states mentioned they have peach yellows and rosette neither of which have ever been known within the state and either one of which is more serious that all of the pests 


56 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


we have. Ours can be combated, peach yellow and rosette cannot. If they can make a success of peach growing in other less favored sections, are we to give it up and acknowledge that we are not as skil- 
full horticulturalists as they. 

Now for the harvesting and shipping. 

First, you should plant sufficient acre¬ 
age yourself or organize an association in your neighborhood who would plant sufficient acreage to load and ship in car¬ 
load lots, about thirty acres of a variety is sufficient for this, forty or fifty would be better. Grade and pack all the fruit uniformly, being sure to have every crate so full that you could not get anoth¬ 
er peach in the baskets. Separate the fruit and dofi’t put any cull fruit in the bottom of the baskets, let the bottom be as good or better fruit than the top. Use nothing to fill up baskets but peacljes. Excelsior either in top or bottom, paper used in any manner prevents ventilation, de¬ 
ceives the buyer and makes a bad repu¬ 
tation for your pack and brand. Have the fruit graded and packed by pro¬ 
fessional fruit packers, it will cost you but little more and your pack is right. 
Care in packing peaches is more im- 
])ortant than any other fruit. In load¬ 
ing yoiir refrigerator cars, see that the car is clean and that nothing ob¬ 
structs the ventilators between the ice chests and the body of the car at each end both next to floor and at the ceiling. 
This is necessary for circulation. Re¬ 
member without circulation there will be no refrigeration. Load peaches as soon after picking as possible and if you have to detain car more than one day, arrange to get a ton and a half of ice to put in bunkers, so as to have them as full as pos¬ 
sible when car leaves the orchards. Ar¬ 


range with the railroad to have car re¬ 
iced as soon after leaving the orchard as possiible. Remember that the first 24 
hours after the fruit is placed in the car is the critical time. The fruit continues to ripen and mature until cooled and re¬ 
frigerated to the pit. If car is .poorly iced and it takes 36 or 48 hours for this refrigeration, the fruit has had that many hours of ripening process going on with¬ 
in it. and it matters not how well the car is iced during the latter part of journey, 
the damage is done and your fruit melts down almost as soon as it comes from the car. If good refrigeration can be had at first and the fruit cooled to refrig¬ 
eration point in from’ 6 to 12 hours, the iceing for the last part of the journey is not so imiportant. 

Experiments are being made in quick cooling of the fruit before the cars move, 
by artifically circulating the cold air in the car, and by this means bring the fruit to a refrigeration point in from four to six hours. Fruit quickly cooled this way, 
is claimed to hold up, an almost indefinite time if temperature is kept reasonably low, and when taken off the ice holds up almost as long as when picked direct from the tree. 

I will not attempt to tell a Florida Hor- 
ticulturalist how to market his fruit. 
But would say that of all fruit, you should try to establish a reputation for your pack of peaches and I would say put enough of them on one market so that your commission house at least knows that you are in the peach business. 
Do not scatter your shipments a few crates in a place, on such shipments is where you are robbed by both express company and questionable commission men. 

This paper being long and no

doubt many of you are already tired and as plums and pears are not generally enough grown for commercial purposes, 
I will not attempt to say anything with reference to them. If however any mem¬ 
ber knows of any plums of any special merit, it would be of interest to myself and dare say to others of the society, to hear about them. The same for pears. 


Supplementary to regular report would say that a few days ago I sent out a cir¬ 
cular letter, asking for information re¬ 
lative to present conditions of peaches in several sections of the state with refer¬ 
ence to damage by frosts of March ist and 22nd. Also about varieties grown in the several sections. The following is the essence of the replies received bear¬ 
ing on these two points. Some mention was made in some of the replies relative to scale, gall knots and other troubles all of which I think have been covered by report. 

Dinsmore, Fla. 

I estimate that the frost of March 
20th and 2 1 St killed 75 per cent, of the crop. 

Wm. Macklin. 

Waldo, Fla. 

Peaches not hurt here in the least. 
Waldo and Jewell only kind grown for market. 

T. K. Godby. 


Stetson, Fla. 

So far as I know, none of the peaches were hurt at all in this section. 

H. B. Stevens. 


Fulton, 'Fla. 

The March first fro'St was local in its effects, in and around Fulton some or¬ 
chards were much more injured than others. Jewell variety suffered most. 
Waldos came off better. Later varieties some. 

H. F. Hale. 


Inverness, Fla. 

We will have a good peach crop. I 
hear of none being killed by frost. 

S. M. Wilson. 


Boardman, Fla. 

No commercial orchards in this sec¬ 
tion, only for family, but so far as they go the promise is for full crop, the frost not having hurt them. 

F. G. Sampson. 


Interlachen, Fla. 

The frost of this Spring did but little damage in fact only thinned the fruit on outer limbs. None of the early varieties seem to be injured by the cold. 

J. H. Wylie. 


Lady Lake, Fla. 

The frost did not do us any damage at all. Peach trees of all kinds are full. 
Jewell the best. 

L. B. Miller. 


DeFuniak Springs, Fla. 

Peaches and plums not injured in the least by frost. Holding fruit well dur¬ 
ing this dry weather. Varieties principal¬ 
ly Elberta. 

L. W. Plank. 


Melrose, Fla. 

Peach crop is as good as can be, we

never miss a crop of peaches in this im¬ 
mediate vicinity. Varieties, Jewell, Cli¬ 
max and Imperial. 

W. E. Baker. 


Jessamine^ Fla. 

The frost did not affect the peaches in this region and there is now good pros¬ 
pects for crops. Varieties most prefer¬ 
red Jewell, Waldo and Angel. 

W. J. Ellworth. 


Manatee^ Fla. 

None of the peaches were damaged by cold. Varieties Jewel, Waldo, Bidwells 
Early and Angel. 

A. J. Pettigrew. 

Earlton, Fla. 

The Spring frosts did no damage in 
South Eastern part Alachua county, but have been told in the northern part some damage was done. Varieties Jewell and 
Seedling of my own. 

H. VoN Luttichan. 


Earlton^ Fla. 

No peaches, plums or pears were hurt in the neighborhood of Lake Sante Fe. 
Varieties Jewell and Waldo. 

C. C. Shooter. 


Dade City^ Fla. 

Crop in this Section not at all damag¬ 
ed by cold. J. C. Carter. 


Lake Helen^ Fla. 
No damage here by cold. 

J. P. Mace. 


Mr. J. Y. McKinney, a member of committee who is here, reports no dam¬ 
age at Candler. 


Gainesville^ Fla. 

The peach crop in this immediate sec¬ 
tion is probably less that half. We had heavy frosts soon after setting both ear¬ 
ly and medium late varieties. Varieties, 
Waldo, Florida Gem, Oviedo and Pal¬ 
las mostly. 

H. S. Graves. 


The damage to Jewell variety in the 
Komoko orchards of the Grilling Florida 
Orchard Company was 90 per cent, prac¬ 
tically destroying entire crop. Waldos 
70 to 80 per cent. The Imperial and other medium late varieties suffered very little, practically full crop. In the Baker county orchards near Macclenny, no Jew¬ 
ells were planted, Waldos damages 60 to 
75 per Cent. Later varieties not hurt. 

By studying the map of Florida you can see that the setion in which damage was done is comparatively small. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Henderson.—As I have had a good deal of experience in peach grow¬ 
ing, I think I can give some points that may be interesting. I used to think I 
could not raise peaches without spraying. 
I have an orchard of about 100 acres and last year we sprayed until I discovered what has proven to be a red fungus. At first I did not know what it was. I sent to the Experiment Station and found that 
I had this red fungus and I stopped spray¬ 
ing. I wrote and asked some questions. 
I asked if I could trust my orchard in the hands of this fungus if it was very slightly affected. The answer was that I 
could. The scale had practically killed 
25 per cent, of my trees, but today I can¬ 
not find a single scale anywhere. The

scale is off and it was left in the hands of this fungus alone. Today I am very much more encouraged. 

The San Jose scale is worse than any other scale, but there is no let up of the fungus until this scale is all off. I think this is one of the greatest things for the peach growers, in the State of Florida. 
Take a limb with this fungus on it and it will spread in moist weather in twenty- 
four hours and little orange colored pim¬ 
ples show over the trees. As soon as it kills all the scale these become black spots on the tree, hence the name black fungus. 

Mr. Griffing.—I would like to ask if the trees were not putting on new growth after this fungus had been on it. 

Mr. Henderson.—They are, after hav¬ 
ing been cut back. All the trees that were affected with this scale have put on beautiful new growth and some branches are from five to eight feet long. 

Mr. Wood.—Should we cut back healthy trees? 

Mr. Henderson.—By all means. Those from five to six years old. 

Mr. Wood.—I cut back some of my trees, but those I did not cut back had more dense foilage. 

Mr. Henderson.—The fruit will be better next year. The best time to cut it back is just after the fruit is gathered, 
say in July- 

Mr. Ellis.—What is the probable life of the peach orchard from the time it is planted. 


Mr. Henderson.—That depends on the class of land and the kind of tree planted. 
If planted with yellow subsoil, the orchard will be very poor and probably die after it has borne three or four crops. 
If the tops were cut off and a new crop allowed to come on, it would probably bear from twelve to fourteen crops of fruit. The average crop is only from seven to eight crops. 

Mr. Wood.—Would you advise clean culture. 

Mr. Griffing.—I would not, but would advise plowing each spring. Be sure to turn over every inch of the surface, then let it grow up in beggar-weed. The beg¬ 
gar-weed will save fertilizer bills. 

Mr. Ellis.—On a land naturally salt, 
would it do for peaches ? 

Mr. Griffing.—I would not think so. 
If old land is to be used for planting a peach orchard, plant and grow velvet beans and beggar weed on it for two or three years before planting the peach trees, letting nothing else but these grow on the land. This will not only build up and fertilize the land, but will reduce the nematodes in the soil to such an extent that the young trees will become estab¬ 
lished before the nematode sufficiently increases in numbers to injure the tree. 
The nematode, may cause some of the trees to be short lived, yet fairly satis¬ 
factory results may be expected. 




Report of Standing Committee on Grapes, Figs 

and Kaki. 

BY B. M. HAMPTON. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, 

Fellozv Members of the State Horti¬ 
cultural Society of Florida : 

For some reason beyond my ken, I have been appointed as chairman of the stand¬ 
ing committee on grapes, figs and kaki. 
While I have had some experience with all of these fruits, I do not want you to think for one moment, that I consider myself as expert authority on any of them; but I suppose you expect something said on the subject, and so I will try and add my mite. 

The grape and the fig, as you all know, 
are among the oldest fruits of which his¬ 
tory gives us any record. “Under your own vine and fig tree,’’ is as old as time itself. The vine especially is almost world-wide. Take, for instance, our own country. You will find it flourishing on the bleak and rocky hills of New England, 
and ’mid the sunny glades of Florida, 
as well as on the coral rocks of her thou¬ 
sand keys or islands. One of the most valuable fruits known to man is the grape, 
and no home, however humble, should be without its vine or more of the health¬ 
ful grape. 

Starting from the shores of the Cas¬ 
pian Sea, you will find it flourishing in many lands and under many conditions of soil and climate. As I have alreadv told you, it grows from New England to the 


southern extremity of the United States with more or less profit; but up to the present time with less profit in Florida than in most other sections where it flour¬ 
ishes. And as I said before, everyone should have a vine or two at least, for their own use. When you have a near¬ 
by market, other things being equal, you can grow them with profit in Florida; but as a bread-winner to be shipped to a dis¬ 
tant market^ I do not think it has proven a success. 

I have known a number of vineyards to be planted in Florida, but for some reason they are soon dug up or abandoned alto¬ 
gether, thus intimating that commercial¬ 
ly speaking, they were not a success. I 
myself planted about two acres some ten years ago. All went well until I came to sell them. For some reason the fabulous prices so often noted in the papers of 
Florida, did not pan out. 

I planted a number of kinds of the 
Labrusca species or common grape grown in the North for wine or the table mostly 
—all seemed to do well—also quite a number of different kinds of the Vini- 
fera or raisin grape. Of the former spec¬ 
ies, the White Niagara seemed to get the closest to filling the bill; thrifty, prolific and a good quality, it is one of the most satisfactory grapes for Florida. Like the old speckled hen, it will give good returns with lots of neglect. Then the Vinifera

species or raisin grapes that are so ex¬ 
tensively grown on the western coast, in 
California, for wine and raisins, whilst I 
have given them, that is, most of those grown on a large scale there, and some that are not, a trial, I have never found any that gave much promise of profit ; 
though you can grow a few for home use, 
and they are quite enticing for the novice to experiment with. You see glowing ac¬ 
counts in the papers of this one or that one having phenomenal success with these choice varieties and promising to revolu¬ 
tionize grape culture in Florida. You hear the report quite distinctly, but listen in vain for the echo. 

There are two kinds of the Vinifera varieties that seem to be worthy of more extensive notice and also a trial. The one that I am acquainted with is the one known as the St. Augustine grape. It is thin of skin and of a good flavor, quite thrifty and prolific, ripening in July, bun¬ 
ches are large, berries resembling the Ca¬ 
tawba ; but the bunches are not so compact. 
It thrives in and around St. Augustine, 
and is supposed to have been brought from 
Maderia by the Spanish in the early settle¬ 
ment of the place. It seems to flourish and fruit with as little care as the Scup- 
pernong, but ripening so much earlier than the Scuppernong helps to extend the sea¬ 
son for this fruit. Then at St. Augustine they have a blackish-purple grape, pretty much the same as the above, and of the same family, but having larger berries and ripening when the other is about gone. It is quite prolific. Both of them are supposed to come from Spain. 
I traced their ancestry back for about one hundred years, and then it seemed to end; 
but all agree that it was brought from 
Spain with the earliest settlement of St, 
Augustine. 


There is still another grape, said to grow on the Keys in and around Key 
West. I wrote to the board of trade of 
Key West about the grape, but failed to get any definite information. 

From all I could learn, the grape is of the Vinifera species, and without a doubt came from Spain, though some say Eng¬ 
land ; but this I doubt. The vine is said to be quite a thrifty grower and quite a pro¬ 
lific bearer. The grape is as large or larg¬ 
er than the Niagara. The fruit itself is reported to resemble the famed Malaga, 
in color a reddish-purple, bunches large, 
said to weigh from five to seven pounds. 
Indeed, I have been told some of them have been known to weigh as much as twenty pounds; but I would advise taking quite a liberal pinch of salt with the state¬ 
ment about the size and weight of these bunches. In fact, it would be well, per¬ 
haps, to take a grain or so with the whole story. Mr. E. V. Blackman is the only one I have ever met that claims to have seen the grape, and he says he has seen the bunches that would weigh from five to twelve pounds each. Some years ago 
I had a talk with James Mott about this grape. He took a trip to the Keys par¬ 
ticularly to find this grape,'and if I re¬ 
member rightly, failed to do so. The vine is said to be quite tender, but in time this might be overcome. I think perhaps 
Mr. E. V. Blackman could give us some definite information, he being so close to where it is said to grow. I think it well worth further investigation than I have been able to give it. 

Now as to the fig. This is another fruit, if you will allow me to call it a fruit; 
for really it is not a true fruit. That which we call fruit being the fleshy recep^ 
tacle, of a conical form attached to the

or apex having a small opening. This ex¬ 
pands somewhat, as the true flowers open, 
and the seeds mature within this fleshy re¬ 
ceptacle. 

Be it flower or fruit, it is of great value to man wherever the climate will permit of its growth—one of the most whole¬ 
some and nourishing of the long list of fruits given to man, either fresh, canned or dried. I believe several kinds could be grown profitable in Florida, both for home use and for canning and preserving 
I have grown various kinds with more or less success for the last twelve or fifteen years on high pine land. I find the White 
Marseilles, Brown Turkey, and the Bruns¬ 
wick among the best for home use in 
Florida. By having these three you will always have figs in their season; but if you have a choice spot of ground, rich and moist; not wet, and feel willing to give the tree a little extra care, then plant a 
White Adriatic, and it will abundantly pay you. for all of your trouble; but it must have moisture and plenty of fertiliz¬ 
er in some form. Plenty of good cow-pen manure is about, as good as anything 
Then you can supplement this with some good commercial fertilizer. 

The fig, like the grape,will grow readily from cuttings taken at any time when the tree is dormant and has shed its leaves. 
November or December, I have found about the best time to clip the cuttings. 
Either plant these at once or bury them until the beginning of February, then plant in good, rich soil, just leaving one or two buds above the ground and keep the ground moist until well-rooted—^not wet, mind. 

In writing these few lines on figs, I 
have taken it for granted that all of you know about them, their culture and use. 
I will just add that all of the kinds I have mentioned are good for all home purposes 


or for canning, preserving or drying. I 
have made fine dried figs out of each kind; 
but I prefer the White Adriatic. I have had this fig to cure right on the tree. It is larger than the others when properly grown, and to my way of thinking, much better. It is greenish-white in color and has a thin, but exceedingly tough skin, 
with a rich crimson sweet pulp, a fine flavor, and is especially sweet—well worth the extra care you have given it. Every home in Elorida should have at least a few trees for home use. 

Now a few words on the Kaki or Jap¬ 
anese Persimmon, and I am done. This fruit, I think, will in time be of more pro¬ 
fit to Florida commercially speaking than either of the others. But in the first place, 
one should give them names, good Eng¬ 
lish names, that all can pronounce without giving them the lockjaw. There is much in an attractive name. Give a fruit a pret¬ 
ty sounding name, and the battle is about half won. This fruit is just in its infancy in this country; so that we have much to learn as to what varieties to grow and cul¬ 
ture of same. Some say to give thorough culture; others tell you just to fertilize and let alone. I have known them to do well under both culture and non-culture. I 
planted quite a grove of this fruit some years ago and gave it clean culture. The trees grew nicely, but I sold the grove be¬ 
fore they came into bearing, and now I 
have but a few trees just coming into bear¬ 
ing. These are on high pine land, with the usual grayish top-soil, yellowish or reddish sub-soil, underlaid with red clay, 
at Lakemont, Polk county, Elorida. 

In some sections of Elorida, particularly where I speak of, the Japanese persimmon, 
SO far as I know, has been a shy bearer. I 
have tried a number of years to get the 
Tannenashi to fruit, but to no purpose; 
so finally I dug it up. This is a fine fruit 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

—one of the best, and in many places fruits abundantly. It is a very large fruit, 
conical in shape, skin reddish-yellow, with few seeds—many fruit none at all—and a good shipper when not allowed to get too ripe before shipping. This variety is very attractive to the eye and as good as it is attractive; but for some reason I 
could never get it to fruit to amount to anything, though the wild persimmon fruited in abundance all around me; but l^ecause the Tannenashi would not fruit for me, I did not give it up, for some had trees in bearing of other varieties, but all had a good many seeds and all were of medium size—good to be sure^—but not extra. But, at last in an obscure corner, 
I noticed a tree that bore full crops every year. The fruit was large, tomato-shaped and of the deepest red in color, covered with a rich bloom like a plum, seedless and less astringent than most varieties, 
and was of a finer, richer flavor than any fruit of the kind I had ever eaten, and" I 
think that I have sampled all of the choice varieties around St. Augustine, the home of this fruit; for at this place they all seem to fruit without an}^ trouble. I further noticed when a bud was taken from this particular tree, which for want of a better name, I shall call “Hampton’s Choice,” 
simply to designate it from others (I have 
^*ied in most of the catalogues to locate this variety, but so far have failed,) and budded on a Tannenashi that refused to hold its fruit, that branch would be full of fruit while the rest of the tree would have but few or none. It will thus appear that the “Hampton’s Choice” was immune to that which caused the Tannenashi to drop its fruit. 

'Oh the high, sandy land at Lakemont. 
as yet I have but two or three trees ii\ 
bearing. They were grafted on the wild, 
small stock three years ago the past season 


and bore full crops of fruit last season and this; however, the trees are but from four to six feet high and had but little care. I have been away from my grove most of the time for the past two years 
I have gathered this fruit when fully colored and kept it in the house for even four weeks, and at the end of that time it was sound and as fine in quality as a per¬ 
simmon ever gets. The past fall of 1905 
I gathered among others, one fruit that was quite hard and only partly colored. 
This was early in November, and this fruit was kept until Christmas without showing any signs of decay. Then it was in good condition to eat and was good as one could ask it to be, thus proving its keeping and shipping qualities. The fruit is large, from two to three inches in diameter and of the deepest red and en¬ 
tirely seedless, never having found a sin¬ 
gle seed in a fruit. Yet I do not know of any persimmon so highly colored that can be eaten when as solid as a good, ripe ap¬ 
ple, and then lacking in the astringent qualities that other persimmons would have at that stage of ripeness. 

While this persimmon may have been grown by some for years, certainly I 
have never been able to locate it among others on the fruit stands in Florida. I 
sometimes think, however, it is simply the section it is grown in that makes it appear different from some of the listed varieties. But one thing is sure, it is the persimmon par excellence for the high, 
pine land, and the one of all others I 
could plant on such land for profit or home use. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Griffing.—I would like to hear from Mr. Macklin who has had some ex¬ 
perience in growing persimmons. 

Mr. Macklin.—As I read a paper before 



64 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


this society last year on this subject I did not expect to say anything at this meet¬ 
ing. Nevertheless there are a few re¬ 
marks I would like to make. 

I most heartily endorse the remarks of Mr. Hampton, in the paper just read, 
on the use of the word “kaki.” We do not call an orange a peach, or a pineapple by its botanical name and I see no reason why we should do so with the persimmon. 
We have a good English name for the fruit so why not use it. I would very much like to see that the word “kaki’’ 
discontinued in the reports of this society. 
I have been at considerable pains for several years past to introduce this fruit into northern markets as the Japanese persimmon and if I have to begin all over again with “‘kaki” I shall despair of success. 

Up till this season I was under the im¬ 
pression that the persimmon was so late blooming as to be immune from frost but this spring a frost on March 21st damag¬ 
ed the crop considerably. 

As regards markets, some places will have them while others will not. In New 
York they sell fairly well, yet Boston which is only a short distance away, will not give a paying price for them. It looks as though the Bostonians were too conservative and would not eat anything that is new. 'Since reading a paper on persimmons here last year my orchard of the Haycheya variety shows signs of in¬ 
creasing its crop with the increased age of the trees. 

Mr. Griffing.—Is the Yemon variety holding its fruit as well as the others. 

Mr. Macklin.—I have only three varie¬ 
ties in commercial quantities, the Hya- 
kume, Tannenashi, and Haycheya, the 
Tannenashi I find to be the best. 


Mr. Henderson.—We can have the per¬ 
simmon so long that I think there are few fruits better. We can have them from the first of August until March. I 
have only six varieties. The Tannenashi is the best I have. They are of a large beautiful shape and carry well, better than any I have. I kept some of them until after Christmas and they were per¬ 
fect. I think we should have more Japan¬ 
ese persimmions and grapes. 

Mr. Griffing.—I would call attention to the fact that we may use the persim¬ 
mon to good advantage in diversifying our products. The Japanese persimmon is the very best food for hogs. There is one variety the Zengi that ripens and commences dropping in August and con¬ 
tinues until December. Hogs are very fond of these and will fatten on them. 

Mr. Steele.—In their report on figs, 
there are two varieties left out that have proven to be very good with me. The 
Celeste, the little sugar fig, as it is called is always to be desired. The Poulette fig is one of the best that I ever tasted. 

Mr. Blackman.—Some four or five years ago there was quite a stir about the 
Key grape. At several different times there were brought to my office, bunches that weighed from 3 to 5 pounds each, 
and much larger bunches have beeq known to be produced. So far as we know they are a very good grape; but will not compare with some of the finer va¬ 
rieties. There is one difficulty regard¬ 
ing this grape, the berries do not ripen evenly and the vines are short lived. I 
know one party who secured a good many cuttings, all of which grew for a time and then died. Rev. Bolton of Cocoanut 
Grove at one time had a number of vines in fruiting; but they have since died out. 





Report of Standing Committee on Pineapples and 

Other Tropical Fruits. 

MANGOES. 

BY PROF. P. H. ROLFS. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Among the tropical fruits that are be¬ 
ing introduced into Florida, no one is more certain to make a definite impres¬ 
sion upon the market than the new man¬ 
gos. The fruit produced by the mulgoba exhibits such a character that it will push its way into the market were it to com¬ 
pete with peaches; but fortunately it rip¬ 
ens just ahead of that crop, and so we will not be thrown into actual competi¬ 
tion with this luscious fruit. The mul¬ 
goba budwood can now be had in almost any quantity that any one desires in Flor¬ 
ida. There is still some difficultv ex- 

w/ 

perienced in propagating and setting out the trees. From my experience in this matter I am inclined to believe that we shall have to adopt methods for the pro¬ 
pagation and setting out of these trees that are radically different from those practiced in setting out citrus trees. As citrus growers we are apt to make this our standard, and anything that does not conform to the methods of procedure that we have adopted for growing citrus trees is considered to be extra difficult, or else not worthy of attention. We are also apt to draw a long breath when the nur¬ 
seryman confronts us with a price for these trees that is probably ten times as 
' high as that of citrus trees. Here again we allow our standard to interfere with our business methods. We should re- 
H-s 


member that mulgoba trees are really rari¬ 
ties. 

PROPAGATING. 

Budding of mangos is not only pos¬ 
sible but may be done profitably. The mango nursery, however, must be radi¬ 
cally different from that of the citrus nursery. For general purposes I think the methods advised by Mr. John B. 
Beach, and which he has published re¬ 
peatedly in the agricultural papers, and also in addresses to the Horticultural So¬ 
ciety, are probably familiar to every one here, so I will not take them up again at this point. 

AREAS ADAPTED TO MANGOS. 

If we will examine the map of Florida we will see that all of that area on the 
East Coast south from Mangonia and on the West Coast south from Caloosahat- 
chee River, is adapted to mango growing. 
In addition to this general area there are isolated areas to the north of this in which mangos can be grown with a fair degree of assurance that crops will be obtained. 
Several years ago a considerable number of mango trees were fruited in the vici¬ 
nity of St. Petersburg. In this region there are trees sufficiently large to pro¬ 
duce a considerable quantity of fruit. 
Various places on the Manatee River are also quite certain to produce paying quan- 



66

titles of mangos. I will not attempt to enumerate further the isolated localities where mangos may be ;.^.rcwn. To a large extent this will have to be deter¬ 
mined by actual experiments. In a gen¬ 
eral way we may say, however, that wherever citrus fruits may hang on the tree all the winter and never become frost¬ 
ed it will be possible to grow the mango. 
This definition for a region in which mangos can be grown should not be taken too strictly as we know that under cer¬ 
tain peculiar conditions a few citrus fruits pass winter in orchards where the greater bulk of the fruit is frosted. 

We are hopefully looking forward this year to the fruiting of Alphonse mangos. 
This variety is said to be very much bet¬ 
ter than the mulgoba. To us who have eaten the mulgoba, however, this sounds like sweetening honey or perfuming the rose. 

MANGO RACES. 

The mango, so far as I have examin¬ 
ed the fruits critically, seem to group themselves into the following races: ist. 
The Number Eleven; 2nd, The Pineapple; 
3rd, The Manilla; 4th, The Apricot-Ap¬ 
ple : and 5th, The Bombay. 

First. The Number Eleven group, 
which is composed of seedlings running to well-marked varieties, is early ripen¬ 
ing, flat fruit, and long tapering fruit, 
weak fibre, but profuse; color, pinkish or reddish. Tree tall upright growing. 
The leaves medium smooth and veining not prominent. Stigmatic area even. 
Skin medium and not tough. 

Second. The Pineapple group, is early ripening. Leaves medium, smooth and veining not prominent. Stigmatic area prominent early ripening. The fruit medium size, tapering to obtuse point at 


stigmatic area; fibres medium, profuse; 
color light orange with strawberry cheeks; 
skin medium and rather strong. 

Third. The Manila, which is said to be the same as the Philippine of Cuba, 
ripens early; flat fruit; tapering; long; 
fibres very weak and scanty. Color, lem¬ 
on or a little darker. It ripens about the same time as the pineapple, and many hy¬ 
brids, and all intergradations were seen, 
but the two types are very distinct. Skin very thin but tough. 

Fourth. The Apple-apricot group con¬ 
tains a number of named varieties. The tree is of a low, spreading growth. 
Leaves rather short. Fruit ripens late. 
Very full at side. Very short. Stigmatic area well up on ventral side. Color uni¬ 
form yellow ; between orange and lemon. 
Fibres very coarse and strong, though scattered. Skin thick and tough. 

Fifth. Bombay, including mulgoba. 
Late ripening; fruit short for its diame¬ 
ter; sides very full; stigmatic surface well up on ventral surface; frequently grooved along lower portion of ventral surface; fibres scant and very weak; con¬ 
fined mostly to ventral and dorsal sides; 
skin very thick; not leathery; ground color, green turning to yellow with rosy cheek. The tree is a vigorous grower and is between upright and spreading, 
and the leaves are rather small and rigid with the veins prominent. 

AVOCADOS. 

For a money crop in the sub-tropical region of Florida, this has a very prom¬ 
ising outlook. During the last five years a very great amount of work has been done in systematizing the vari¬ 
eties and in working up the methods of propagation. In connection with this work, I may be allowed to say that among 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


67 


the avocados as among the citrus vari¬ 
eties, we strike some that are particularly difficult to bud, and others that take very readily. Buds of the Chapellow avocado live with the greatest ease. The Trapp avocado does so somewhat less readily; 
the Pollock buds fairly easily, and the 
Baldwin requires considerable attention to work well. The family avocado is one which begins to ripen in July, and continues to ripen its fruit until late in 
October and November. It should not l)e planted for commercial purposes, but is one well worth having at the home place. 

TRANSPLANTING. 

Lately a great deal has been said about the difficulty of transplanting avacados. Just why this should occur, 
T do not know. I know that a certain disease occurs upon the young trees, 
which is especially apt to strike in at the point where the stock is cut off. 
This difficulty can be avoided to a con¬ 
siderable extent by waxing over the stock at this point when it is cut off, or by painting it over. Then the shock of trans¬ 
planting is apt to prove somewhat severe and the tree apt to die back to the bud. 
In my own field there seems to have been no difficulty in planting avocado seed¬ 
lings. As a matter of fact, I have turned this work over to colored labor, and the success met with has been somewhat bet¬ 
ter than the experiences in having col¬ 
ored labor set out citrus trees. From my experience in this matter I am inclined to believe that there is no greater difficulty in having avocados set out than in having citrus trees set out. 

SAPODILLOS. 

This is one of the fruits that origi¬ 
nated in the Western Hemisphere. In 


fact, it has not been domesticated in the true sense of the word. A few seedling trees have been planted out in the Antil¬ 
lian region, which includes the West In¬ 
dies, the eastern portion of Mexico, the eastern coast of Yucatan, and in the southern portion of Florida. They also occur as native trees down through the central portion of Mexico, and I believe in South America. 

This species adapts itself to cultiva¬ 
tion very readily. The number of vari^ 
eties, however, are about as great as the number of seedlings that come into bear¬ 
ing. In the Miami and Key West market a very careful distinction is made between the better and the inferior fruits. In 
Miami some of the largest and finest of this fruit sell for high as ten cents apiece, 
and the smaller varieties one can fre¬ 
quently buy at ten cents a dozen. Syste¬ 
matic work at propagating and improving sapodillos has already begun at the Sub¬ 
tropical Laboratory. 

The region through which sapodillos may be grown successfully, is practical- 
1 }^ coincident with the region where the mango may be grown. 

CERIMAN. 

(Monstera deliciosus). This plant be¬ 
longs to the peculiar family of aroids which includes the calla lily, the tania and various other tropical species the roots of which are used for food. 
This plant has been grown for a number of years and fruited in the vicini¬ 
ty of Miami; also at Mangonia. In the conservatories of the North, it has also been fruited repeatedly. In the regions where only a little frost occurs, and freez¬ 
es are never known, this plant can be grown successfully under a pineapple shed. 
It produces a creeping trunk that is about four inches in diameter, and if permitted, 


68 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


will grow on the wall to the top of the highest conservatories. In such positions the trunk is rarely more than one and one-half to two inches in diameter. For fruiting purposes, however, it is better to prevent the vine from climbing at all. 
Under pineapple sheds it blooms profuse¬ 
ly, and it fruits rather abundantly. Every bloom is almost certain to make a fruit. 

PROPAGATION. 

For propagating purposes the trunks are cut into segments in such a way as to leave an eye on each segment. These segments are planted out and struck with a fair degree of success. In the course of two or three years, if these plants are well cared for ; they will produce fruit. It is about 14 months from the time of bloom¬ 
ing for the fruits to ripen. 


TYESS. 

This is also sometimes called egg-fruit. 
No systematic effort has yet been made to bring this fruit into the best state of cul¬ 
tivation. Only seedling trees have fruit and the product of these is exceedingly variable—good, indifferent, and bad, I 
think the extreme of inconsistency was met in this fruit in the tree which was fruited by Prof. Gale, at Mangonia. This tree fruited abundantly and gave a fine- 
looking specimen. Some of them were sweet and delicious, other fruits from the same tree were only indifferent, and some of the fruits growing on the same tree, 
and taken from among the good fruits were extremely bitter. Even the same fruits were somewhat variable; one side being quite palatable while the other side would be distinctly bitter. 


THE LOSS OF PLANT FOOD IN PINEAPPLE AND OTHER 

COARSE SANDY SOILS. 


BY A. W. BLAIR. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

A very interesting point which has been brought out by the pineapple fertilizer ex¬ 
periment, is the great discrepancy be¬ 
tween the amount of plant food applied to an acre of pineapples and the amount that is acutally removed by the crop taken from an acre, inculding fruit, slips and suckers. 

AN UNBALANCED ACCOUNT 

To illustrate, we may first take one of the plots from the experiment, which has been fertilized at the rate of 3750 pounds 


per acre. This plot received annually one pound of actual phosphoric acid, one and one fourth pounds nitrogen and two and one half pounds of actual potash. Multi¬ 
plying these figures by 150 (the plots be¬ 
ing 1-150 of an acre in size) gives to one acre 150 pounds of actual phosphoric acid, 
187 1-2 pounds of nitrogen and 375 

pounds of actual potash, or 712 1-2 
pounds of actual plant food in one year. 
Now, if we allow that this acre pro¬ 
duces 500 crates of pineapples, each weighing 70 pounds net, the amount of plant food removed by this 35,000 pounds of fruit would l^e, as calculated from the 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


69 


average of a number of analyses, 15 
pounds actual phosphoric acid, 25 pounds nitrogen and 79 pounds of actual potash, 
or a total of 119 pounds of actual plant food. 

This does not take into account that which is removed with slips and suckers, 
which unfortunately has not yet been de¬ 
termined, but allowing that these would remove as much as the fruit, which is, 
I believe, an exceedingly liberal allow¬ 
ance, there would be removed from the acre a total of 238 pounds of plant food against 712 1-2 applied, a loss somewhere amounting to 474 1-2 pounds—66.6 per cent. 

To take a more familiar instance, the grower who puts on 3000 pounds per acre of a fertilizer which would analyze 4 p>er cent, available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent, 
ammonia, and 7 1-2 per cent, potash, ap¬ 
plies 120 pounds actual phosphoric acid, 
123 pounds nitrogen and 225 pounds ac¬ 
tual potash, or a total of 468 pounds of actual plant food, and if he gathers 350 
crates of pineapples per acre, which would be a good average yield, he removes from his soil 10.36 pounds actual phosphoric acid, 17.32 pounds nitrogen, and 55.26 
ix>unds actual potash or a total of about 
83 pounds of plant food from the acre. 

If here, as before, we allow that slips and suckers taken off, remove an amount equal to the fruit, the total amount re¬ 
moved in this case would be 166 pounds against 486 applied, a loss somewhere of 
302 pounds—64.5 per cent. But this pro¬ 
bably does not represent the entire loss, 
for in many instances there is added, over and above what has been counted, some phosphoric acid which is not reckoned as available, but which, nevertheless, does 
Income slowly available, and undoubted- 
1v some of this would be lost. 


WHERE THE BALANCE GOES. 

Now what becomes of this lost plant f(X>d? If it remained in the soil within reach of the plant, the soil would increase in fertility more rapidly than it does. We are driven to the conclusion that the greater part of it is carried down by the rains and is finally lost in the water table below. Perhaps a small amount of the nitrogen escapes into the air. 

A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION. 

In an effort to explain this unprecedent¬ 
ed loss, for certainly in no other field crop is the percentage of loss so great, 
I have recently conducted some experi¬ 
ments to show the rate at which water percolates through different typ^s of soils, 
and the consequent loss of plant food. 
And while it is true that the conditions in the laboratory were not the conditions that exist in the field, still the results are relative, and serve in a way, to illustrate what takes place in the soil. 

Four glass tubes of equal size were taken and one end closed with perforated disc and filter paper, thus retaining the soil but allowing a solution to pass through. Into each was placed air dried soil as follows: No. i, 150 grams (be¬ 
tween five and six ounces) of South Car¬ 
olina clay soil; No. 2, 150 grams Colum¬ 
bia Co. virgin soil; No. 3, 150 grams of typical pineapple soil, and No. 4, 150 
grams of muck soil. Into each was pour¬ 
ed TOO cubic centimeters (a little less than a gill) of water containing one gram of sulphate of ammonia, and the following observations made:

This emphasizes very forcibly the fact that the coarser the soil, the more rapidly the water and plant food get away, and it perhaps gives us a clearer idea of the conditions which exist in the pineapple belt. There we have a very coarse soil, 
composed of almost pure sand, through which water runs almost as it would run through a pile of stones, carrying much of the soluble plant food with it. The question then arises, what is there about 


clay soils, and other fine soils, to hold plant food and moisture, that is wanting in the pineapple soils? 

THE WORK OF OTHER INVESTIGATORS. 

The researches of Way and other emi¬ 
nent investigators have shown that most soils have an absorptive power with re¬ 
ference to plant food. 

In the case of phosphoric acid this is not difficult to explain, as the acid forms insoluble compounds with the iron, lime, 
and magnesium, which are present in most soils, and is in turn rendered slowly available by the action of the solutions contained in the roots of the plants. 

As to the absorption of the alkalies,the explanation is more difficult, since nearly all their compounds are readily soluble in water; the potash salts for example. Since most soils consist of sand, clay, and or¬ 
ganic^ matter, Way went to work to de¬ 
termine which of these constituents ex¬ 
ercised the absorptive power. Without describing in detail his methods it will suffice to say that he showed that clay alone is capable of absorption phenomena. 

(It should be borne in mind that the term absorptive power as used here re¬ 
fers to a chemical change, and not to phy¬ 
sical absorption as when a sponge absorbs water). 

Having shown that clay was the main constituent in a soil which caused the absorption of alkalies. Way next tried to trace out the particular compound which caused the absorption, and finally suc¬ 
ceeded in producing a hydrated silicate of aluminum and soda which exhibted dis¬ 
placement and absorptive properties very similar to those shown by the soil. 

Then Eichorn hit upon the idea of try¬ 
ing natural hydrated silicates, or zeolites

71 


and found that they exhibited the same power as Way’s artificial ones. Other investigators have shown that the absorp¬ 
tive power bears a close relation to the amount of soluble silicates present. That is to say the absorption of salts of the alkalies, accompanied by the change of base, is due chiefly to the presence of zeolitic materials in the soil. 

There is besides this purely chemical absorption of salts by the soil, a physical absorption, which is illustrated by the ab¬ 
sorption of water containing dissolved salts, by the organic matter of a muck soil; even sand will hold back a limited amount of dissolved salts, but the amount is in proportion to the fineness of the soil, and that it is held in a merely me¬ 
chanical way can be demonstrated from the ease with which it is washed out. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE ABSORPTIVE POWER 

« 

OF THE SOIL. 

The importance of this absorptive pow¬ 
er can scarcely be estimated. Houston and 
Goss formerly of the Indiana Station, 
have pointed out that by means of this power those mineral ingredients of plant food of which most soils contain but lit¬ 
tle, referring more especially to phosphor¬ 
ic acid and potash, are held in a form too insoluble to allow of rapid loss by drain¬ 
age, and still soluble enough to answer the needs of vegetation, provided the store is large enough. This cannot, how¬ 
ever, be said to apply to nitrogen in the form of salts of nitric acid, but here na¬ 
ture has made a wise provision for this element by binding it in the form of or¬ 
ganic bodies which nitrify but slowly, 

. and by supplying each year a small amount from the atmosphere. Houston 


and Goss conclude their discussion of the importance of soil absorption with the fol¬ 
lowing statements; ^‘By means of the ab¬ 
sorptive power of soils, the farmer if he puts on an excess of potash and phos¬ 
phoric acids as a fertilizer, does not lose it, but is able to reap the benefits from it in the next year’s crop: If it were not for this power the best method for apply¬ 
ing fertilizers would be a much more complicated problem than it is at present, 
as it would be necessary to apply them at just the proper season and in nicely re¬ 
gulated amounts to insure against loss.” 

PINEAPPLE SOILS LACKING IN ABSORPTIVE 

POWERS. 

Of course Houston and Gross did not have in mind such soils as the East Coast pineapple soils when they wrote this, for we have there just the conditions which they say would make the problem of fer¬ 
tilizer application much more complicated than it is, and make it necessary to apply them at just the proper season and in nicely regulated amounts to insure against loss. 

We have there a soil which is practi^ 
cally devoid of clay and therefore of sol¬ 
uble silicates; which contains only traces of iron, lime and magnesia, and a com¬ 
paratively small amount of organic mat¬ 
ter but which is, on the other hand, 
98 to 99.5 per cent, sand—much of it being very coarse sand—hence there are wanting nearly all those properties which in ordinary soils would effect the absorp¬ 
tion of soluble plant food, and instead of being held there in a form suitable for uti¬ 
lization by the plant roots, it is there in quite soluble forms, and as the rains come it goes down and down into the soil wa¬ 
ters below. Only that portion is stored 



72

up which the roots actually get hold of, 
and that which is mechanically held, and in such coarse sand, the amount mechani¬ 
cally held is quite small as has been dem¬ 
onstrated by leaching tests. 

Even organic fertilizers such as bone meal, cottonseed meal, dried blood and castor pomace are slowly converted into soluble forms in the soil, and on account of the almost entire absence of those substances which produce absorption phe¬ 
nomena (a binding of soluble plant food) 
a large part of this soluble plant food, if not used at once by the plants, goes down with the first rain that comes. 

VALUE OF SLOWLY AVAILABLE MATERIALS. 

However, there is a great advantage in using these slowly available forms over the readily soluble forms, for all the while that they are thus being made available, 
the plants are being benefited, and the ex¬ 
cess to be carried away by percolation is not so great. 

I believe one of the qierits of slag phos¬ 
phate lies in its somewhat insoluble, but nevertheless slowlv available form of phosphoric acid. When applied from year to year, a small amount is being ren¬ 
dered available all the time, and at the 
‘same time no very great amount is lost hy j>ercolation. I further believe that if we could get a more slowly available fomi of potash for such soils, the problem of fertilizing pineapples would be simplified and the expense reduced. The good re¬ 
sults obtained with tobacco stems might possibly be attributed to the fact that the 
]>otash becomes slowly available, and thus in the end is nearly all taken up by the plant. 


PLANT FOOD AND CAPILLARY ACTION. 

But some one asks, may not much of this lost plant food be recovered and brought within reach of the plant roots by the capillary action of the soil mois¬ 
ture? 

If the soil were a clay or a clay loam the answer would certainly be in the af¬ 
firmative, but in such coarse sandy soils the conditions are very different. It is a well know physical fact that when three tubes of different internal diameters are placed open end in water, the water will rise highest in the smallest tube, that is the smaller the tube the greater the capil¬ 
lary action. So with the soil, the finer the particles the greater the capillary action, 
and as the particles of sand composing the pineapple soils are very large in com¬ 
parison with the particles that make up clay soil, so the amount of water, and hence of plant food, brought up from a deep soil by capillary action is correspMDnd- 
ingly smaller. Hence it is that plant food when once lost in the waters of the sub¬ 
soil, are recovered but slowly and with great difficulty by capillary action. This was well illustrated by another experi¬ 
ment conducted in our laboratory. 

Over the end of a glass tube of about 
3-4 in. internal diameter, was tied a piece of muslin cloth, and into the tube was placed the pineapple soil to a depth of 12 
in. The tube was then suspended so that the end over which the cloth was tied just touched the surface of distilled water con¬ 
tained in a beaker. At the end of three days the highest point at which the soil had been moistened by capillary water was 3 3-8 in. The same experiment was tried with the Columbia Co. soil, and the 
S. C. clay soil with the result that at the 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


73 


end of the three days the Columbia Co. 
soil was moistened to a height of 8 3-8 in., 
and the S. C. clay soil 10 7-8 in. In each case the tube was weighed with the dry soil, and again at the expiration of the three days. The pineapple soil retained 
8.9 grams of water, the Columbia Co. 
soil 23.4 grams, and the S. C. clay. 27.2 
grams or a little more than three times as much as the pineapple soil. This indi¬ 
cates very clearly the difference in cap¬ 
illary action. In the pineapple soils the grains are large and as a consequence many of the spaces between them are too large for capillary spaces. 

To illustrate in another way, if you could put these grains of sand together into the form of a lamp wick, you would still have a very jx)or medium for lifting oil, but if the wick be made of fine par¬ 
ticles of asbestos, which is also a mineral, 
the oil is raised without difficulty and a good flame is the result. 

.SOME REMEDIES SUGGESTED. 

Then is it possible to 4 o anything to prevent this great loss of plant food ? 

Certainly it is not possible and perhaps not desirable to convert the sandy soils into clay soils, nor even to mix with the sand a small percentage of clay. 

I will mention a few ways that have suggested themselves to me. 

(i) By increasing the amount of or¬ 
ganic matter in the soil. 

It is a well established fact that organic matter acts as a sponge to hold moisture, 
and in holding water it will hold plant food. This was well illustrated in the experiment with the soil. 150 grams of an air dry’muck soil retained over 100 
grams of water, and go.g per cent, of the sulphate of ammonia. Whereas the 


same weight of the pineapple soil retain¬ 
ed only 30 grams of water and 5.77 per cent, of the sulphate of ammonia. Old pineapple plants and other organic matter might be allowed to decay on the fields in¬ 
stead of being burnt. In some cases it might be possible to increase the organic matter by spreading seaweed and muck soil over the fields. Other ways will doubt¬ 
less suggest themselves to those interest¬ 
ed. Of course the pineapple grower can¬ 
not resort to cover crops such as velvet beans, cow peas, beggar weed etc., as can the man who grows ordinary field crops. 

(2) By the use of wind breaks. 

Currents of dry hot air passing over 

the fields cause the surface moisture to evaporate rapidly, thus to a certain de¬ 
gree breaking the chain of capillary mois¬ 
ture. 

(3) By the addition of lime to the soil. 

Lime coagulates the soluble nitrogen¬ 
ous matter of manures and fertilizers, and this coagulated nitrogenous matter tends to make the soil more retentive of mois¬ 
ture; moreover lime, before it is carried very far down would probably begin to bind the grains of sand together and thus form a layer somewhat impervious to the downward movement of the water. 
In the use of lime, however, care must 
]ye exercised that it be not applied in such a way as to cause the loss of ammonia from other materials, 

(4) By using materials which become slowly available. 

For such a crop as pineapples where the plants remain in the ground from year to year, there would seem little reason for using quickly available materials except say for the first 18 months to get the plants started, even had we a soil that was capable of absorbing and holding the plant food. 


74 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


After a certain amount of these slowly available materials have been added to the soil, some plant food is being rendered available all the time, and as the roots are there ready to utilize it—perhaps al¬ 
most as rapidly as it becomes available— 
not so mudi is lost by seepage to the soil waters below. It seems to me, too, that this might apply to the fertilization of orange trees. 

(5) By shading. 

Shading undoubtedly conserves soil moisture, and if we can retain the soil moisture near the surface, it not only means more water for the plant, but it also means more water, and with it more plant food, brought up from the deep sub¬ 
soil by capillary action. 

In the light of the evidence before us 
I am strongly inclined to the belief that it would be economy to fertilize pineap¬ 
ples from four to six, instead of two to three times a year. I am aware that this is not in accord with recommendations made in the recent bulletin on fertilizer experiments with pineapples, but at the time those recommendations were made we had not discovered that the loss of plant food on pineapple soils was so great 


If you should give to your horse at one time, food enough to last him one week, you would expect much of it to be wasted; so, if you give to your pineapples at one time, plant food enough to sustain them six months, and there is nothing in the soil to bind or absorb this plant food, 
so that it may be given out again gradu¬ 
ally, there must necessarily be much loss. 

At present I know of no experimental evidence on which to base such a state¬ 
ment, but reasoning along the lines indi¬ 
cated, I am of the opinion that 2000 
pounds of fertilizer applied at intervals of tw'o or three months would be as ef¬ 
fective as 3500 pounds of the same material in two applications. 

There is, however, the difficulty that the extra expense of frequent applications might outweigh the cost of the extra fer¬ 
tilizer required in the case of two applica¬ 
tions. This of course could be determin¬ 
ed by experiment, and as the Chairman of the Committee on Fertilizers and Irriga¬ 
tion points out in his paper, it would no doubt be a profitable field for investiga¬ 
tion along other lines than pineapple growing. 


SOME NOTES ON THE PINEAPPLE EXPERIMENT 

AT JENSEN^ 


BY A. W. BLAIR. 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

A bulletin giving full account of this experiment up to and including the crop for last year has recently been published by the Experiment Station, and will very soon be distributed, but I trust that I may 


not be out of place here, if I sketch briefly the object and plan of the experiment, 
mention some of the more important re¬ 
sults obtained, and perhaps raise some questions which it may be profitable for pineapple growers and others to consider.. 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


75 


Iti the beginning, I wish to accord to 
Prof. H. K. Miller full credit for the part he has had in this work. He plan¬ 
ned the experiment and had immediate supervision of it for three years, and on his retiring from Statio%work, the writer, 
who was associated with him during this time, was placed in charge, and has endeavored to carry to krompletion the plans which Prof. Miller projected. Much credit is also due Mr. W. R. Hardee, 
whose hearty co-operation, and sincere interest in solving the problems which confront the pineapple grower, have made it possible to continue the experi- 
lU'cnt over so long a period. 

Credit is also due a number of others whose names I need not mention, but who, nevertheless, lent efficient aid, and acknowledgment is hereby made to all such. 

OBJECT OF THE EXPERIMENT. 

The object of the experiment, as stat¬ 
ed in the bulletin referred to above, is to find out from what source or sources it is best to obtain fertilizing materials for pineapples; the right amount to use; best method of applying; ratio for phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash.; the effect of shading, and to determine any other con¬ 
ditions which will prove of advantage to the grower. 

Certainly not all of these questions have been answered to our satisfaction, per¬ 
haps none of them have been fully ans¬ 
wered. However, we had not hoped to lie able to make two pineapples grow where one grew before, nor to produce two at the cost of what had formerly been the cost of producing one, but we did hope to throw some light on some or all of these questions, and we leave it for those who studv the results obtained, to 


say with what success we have accom¬ 
plished our task. That there is much yet to be learned, there is no doubt. 

GENERAL PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENT. 

The experiment was commenced in the spring of 1901, arrangements having been made with Hardee Bros, of Jensen to con¬ 
duct it as a co-operative experiment, they furnishing the land, work, etc., and the 
Experiment Station to plan and direct it, and furnish fertilizers and shed, and have samples of the fruit for analysis when required. 

In accordance with this plan, Hardee 
Bros, set aside for the experiment about one acre of virgin spruce pine land. It was cleared and put into thorough con¬ 
dition, laid off into 96 plots, 24 sections of four plots each, as shown on diagram, 
and in Augnst of that year, planted to slips of the Red Spanish variety. 

The plots are 1-150 of an acre in size,, 
and contained, in the beginning, just 100 
plants each, making a total of 9600 plants. 

On account of a border around the out¬ 
er edge, and extra space required for al¬ 
ley-ways only about 2-3 of an acre was ac¬ 
tually required for the experiment. 

PLAN FOR FERTILIZER APPLICATION. 

As mentioned above, the plots are in sections of four, all the plots in a section receiving the same kind of fertilizers, but in gradually increasing amounts, begin¬ 
ning with the first in the section. 

The second plot in the sections is taken as the standard, and received annually 
.8 pound phosphoric acid, i.o pound ni¬ 
trogen and 2.00 pounds potash, or to put it in terms of pounds per acre, it received at the rate of 3000 pounds per acre of a fertilizer which would analyze 4 per cent. 


76 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent, ni¬ 
trogen and 10 per cent, potash, this stan¬ 
dard being based upon the analysis of the plants and fruit, and the experience of the more successful growers. Plot one re¬ 
ceived one fourth less than the standard, 
plot three one fourth more, and plot four one-half more or twice as much as plot one. 

That is, plot one received at the rate of 2250 pMDunds per acre of such a fertili¬ 
zer, plot two 3000 pounds, plot three 
3750 pounds, and plot four 4500 pounds. 

With the exception of a few sections introduced for special purposes, this plan was followed throughout the entire plot, 
different sources of plant food, of course, 
being used in the different sections. 

It will thus be seen that all* the plots in a given horizontal line received the same amount of plant food, the difference 
1>eing in the sources from which they are derived. 

To illustrate, the 2nd plot of sec. H 
received 0.8 pound phosphoric acid deriv¬ 
ed from slag phosphate, i.oo pound ni¬ 
trogen derived from dried blood and 2.00 
pounds potash derived from muriate, 
while the second plot of sectiom M; for example, received the same amount of phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash de¬ 
rived from lx)ne meal, cotton seed meal, and high grade sulphate. Sev¬ 
eral sections were introduced for spec¬ 
ial purposes; for example, section K was introduced with the idea of finding out the effects of lime when used with acid phosphate; isection L to determine the proper ratio for phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash; section V to determine the number of applications giving the best results, etc. 

After the first 18 months the fertilizers 


were applied twice a year, except in the case of one or two sepcial sections, accord ing to the plan mentioned above. One ap¬ 
plication in February or March as the conditions seemed to require, and one soon after the removal.of the summer crop. 

THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST YEAR. 

Beginning with the first crop which came off in 1903, careful count was kept of the number of the different sizes of pines taken from each plot. This record is published in full so that in one table may be found the amount and kind of fertilizers applied to each plot, 
and in another the number of the different sizes of pines produced by these plots for the three years 1903, 1904 and 1905. 
They cannot be given in detail here. 

The crop of 1903 was alx)ut 88 per cent, of a total possibility; that is, each plot had a possible yield of 100 pines, 
and actually yielded, on the average 88. 
This must be considered a gopd yield when it is remembered that in an ex- 
I>eriment of this nature, it is almost a foregone conclusion that some of the plots receive a treatment which will, to a great¬ 
er or less extent, injure the crop. 

As a matter of fact there was a wide difference in the yield of the various plots, 
some yielding little more than half a crop, 
while several yielded 97, 98 and 99 out of a possible 100 and one, at least, yielded 
100. 

The results are interesting, but can best be studied from the published tables. I 
will, IhoweYer, undertake, in a general way, to point out some of them. 

COMMENT ON FERTILIZERS. 

The experiment has emphasized the fact, which had already been pretty gen- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


77 


erally accepted, viz: that acid phosphate and kainit are injurious to pineapple plants; it has shown that nitrate of soda has some good qualities and some bad ones; it is good as a source of nitrogen to start young plants, but used liberally on bearing fields it finally injuires the plants and produces a fruit which has poor carrying qualities; the results ob^ 
tained with the sulphates of potash, low and high grade, were slightly better than those obtained with the muriate. As sources of phosphoric acid bone meal and slag phosphate have given very good re¬ 
sults, slag apparently giving slightly bet¬ 
ter results than bone meal 

Dried blood, cotton seed meal and cas¬ 
tor pomace have all given good results as sources of nitrog'en, and it would be rath¬ 
er difficult to say which is the best. One grower may use dried blood with success, 
and perhaps another may use cottonseed meal or castor pomace with equally good or even better success. The price of the goods, the requirements of the individual etc. will necessarily come in here as deter¬ 
mining factors. And I may stop here to say that in this work it has been our en¬ 
deavor to show just what results the dif¬ 
ferent amounts and different kinds of fer¬ 
tilizers will give, rather than to calculate to a nicety which is the most economical, 
thus leaving it with the grower who is, 
in almost every instance, competent to de termine which is the most economical in his individual case. 

A THEORY FOR THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS 
OF ACID PHOSPHATE. 

Before leaving this point it may be well 
^to state that the beds which received acid phosphate without lime have been almost entirely ruined, while those v/hich receiv¬ 


ed acid phosphate and lime in addition, 
have remained in good condition and have given almost as good results as some which have been considered among the best. It is not an easy matter to explain this. However, one theory at least has been advanced, which is, that acid phos¬ 
phate contains sulphates of iron and alu¬ 
mina which are astringent salts, the pres¬ 
ence of which might be injurious to the tender rootlets of the pineapple plant. 
With the addition of lime these astringent salts would be neutralized with the for¬ 
mation of the harmless insoluble oxides of iron and alumina. This explanation would seem to be strengthened by the fact that the plots which received geniune dis¬ 
solved bone black, which does not contain salts of ii 1 and alumina, were not injur¬ 
ed. 

It may be objected that if the tender rootlets of the pineapple plant are injured by these astringent salts, then would not the rootlets of corn, cotton, wheat, etc. 
be injured in the same way? To this ques¬ 
tion I would answer no, not necessarily, 
since in the soils where these crops grow, 
there is much more lime than there is in the pineapple soils, probably all that is needed to neutralize these astringent salts. 

However I would not recommend the use of acid phosphate on pineapples, even with lime, at least until the subject has been further investigated. 

The excellent results obtained by the use of slag phosphate might possibly be taken as an indication that there is some efficacy in lime, since this material con¬ 
tains a goodly percentage of free lime. 

THE LIMIT OF PROFITABLE FERTILIZING. 

One very interesting part of the experi¬ 
ment has been the determining of the lim¬ 
it to which it is profitable to fertilize pine¬ 
apples.

Fertilizer Experiments, Bulletin No. 83, Fla. Exp. Station, February 1906. ^Special plots. 



























































































































































FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


79 


As has already been pointed out, the first line of plots received at the rate of 
2250 lbs. per acre, the second 3000, the third 3750 and the fourth 4500. 

Now by actual count there was, for the crop of 1903 an increase, in a number of the sections from the first to the third plot, though seldom were there materially more on the fourth than on the third, 
some times less. This seemed to point to the fact that with the third plot of the section, that is, the one that received its fertilizer at the rate of 3750 lbs. per acre, 
we had reached the limit of profitable fer¬ 
tilization. However, when we came to sum up the totals of these four lines, we found them to be so near the same that we would hardly have felt justified in draw¬ 
ing such a conclusion on this evidence alone 

But when we came to take into consid¬ 
eration the number of the different sizes, 
there was a marked difference. 

To take the 24’s for example it may l)e seen by reference to the table that there is a decided increase in the number from the first to the third plot of nearly all the sections, while from the third to the fourth there is seldom a very great increase and indeed sometimes a decrease. Reference to the totals emphasizes this fact. These are in the upper half for No. i, 45, No. 

2, T05; No. 3, 277 and No. 4, 277, and for the lower half. No. i, 124; No. 2, 
165; No. 3, 162 and No. 4, 269. a very decided increase from No. 2 to No. 3 but practicably no increase from No. 3 to No. 
4 and yet No. 4 received at the rate of 
750 lbs. per acre more fertilizer than No. 

3. Likewise there was an increase, though not so pronounced, in the 30’s and a some¬ 
what corresponding decrease in 36’s and 
42’s; but if by the addition of some¬ 
thing like T -2 to 3-4 of a ton of fertili¬ 


zer per acre up to a certain limit we can grow 24’s and 30’s where before we grew 36’s and 42’s I think the grow¬ 
ers will bear me out in the statement that we are still engaged in a fairly profitable business. 

Plot 19, the third in sec. E and which received its fertilizer at the rate of 3750 
lbs per acre, yielded in 1903 an increase over plot one, of this section, apparently due to thus increasing the fertilizers an amount equivalent to over $339 
per acre above the expense of the fertili¬ 
zers. Other plots showed an increase nearly as great. The plot which gave the largest total returns for that year was also the third plot in a section and received 
3750 lbs. per acre, plot 35 sec. I. This yielded at the rate of 537 1-2 crates per acre while plot 36, the fourth in the same section, and which received at the rate of 
750 lbs. per acre more fertilizer, yielded about one crate less. 

Putting together all these facts and some others which I cannot now take time to mention, I think we are safe in saying that for shedded pines and under present conditions, there is profit in applying as high as 3500 to 3750 lbs. per acre, of a fer¬ 
tilizer which will analyze 4 per cent, 
available phosphoric acid, 5 per cent, nit¬ 
rogen and 10 per cent, potash, beyond this is money lost. 

The profit comes chiefly in very materially increasing the number of the larger sizes. 

THE CROPS FOR I9O4 AND I905. 

No such decisive conclusions can be drawn from the crops for 1904 and 1905, 
but this is undoubtedly due to causes other than fertilizers. The crop from the ex¬ 
periment plot for both these years was less than one third of a total possibility 


8o

and it would seem hardly fair to under¬ 
take to draw many conclusions from such a diminished crop. Certainly the fact that in several instances, at least, the plot receiving the least fertilizer gave the lar¬ 
gest yield of fruit would indicate that it was not want of plant food that caused the short crops. Possibly the shortness of the crop for 1904 may be attributed partly, at lease, to the heavy yield of the previous year, the plants being somewhat exhausted temporarily; the shortness of the crop of 1905 is explained by the freeze of that year. However, there is in the re¬ 
sults from this year, further evidence tending to show that with 3750 lbs. per acre of a fertilizer analyzing as stated, 
we have reached the limit of profitable fertilizing. We shall await with much interest the results from the crop of 1906. 

For a full discussion of the results of the experiment up to and including the crop for 1905 those interested are refer¬ 
red to bulletin No. 83, Florida Experi¬ 
ment Station. 


DISCUSSION. 

Prof. Stockbridge.—I have forgotten from your statement, whether or not in your different fertilizer applications nitrate of potash was used. 

Prof. Blair.—It was not used. 

Prof. Stockbridge.—Mr. President, 
the thought was suggested to me that capillary action might be increased by changing the character of soil. If we could add clay to pineapple soil the capillary action would be increased; the point I 
wish to bring out is to know whether chemical salts are put on in addition to the other properties with a view of in¬ 
creasing the capillary action. Some of the salts used in fertilizers such as kainit 


is known to increase the capillary action, 
but it could not be used in pineapple, but there is one, the nitrate of potash, com¬ 
monly known as salt peter. Experiments have shown that the nitrate of potash will increase the capillary action to 25 per cent, 
or to a very great extent. I believe the best experiments shows an increase of 
22 per cent., therefore it seems to me that it is quite feasable, at least there is a field for experiment with nitrate of pot¬ 
ash in growing pineapples and this might increase 20 per cent, the amount of water consumed. I think this suggestion worth consideration. What is the contents of 
Nitrogen in nitrate of potash? 

Mr. Wilson.—Sixteen per cent, nitro¬ 
gen, 44 per cent, potash, 96 per cent, of pure salt peter. 

Prof. Blair.—I think that reasoning very good, but it seems to me that nitrate of potash is so very expensive that the loss by solution and going down deep into the soil, outweighs the capillary action he speaks of. 

Mr. Blackman.—Mr. President, have you or others ever made any experiments in Dade county with surface soil in regard to loss of fertilizers? 

Mr. Blair.—Our experience so far has only been carried on in Jensen, which is not the type of soil you refer to, it is the sandy soil. 

Mr. Blackman.—I wish there could be experiments made in the rocky lands of Dade county along this line. I ^ 
am of the opinion that there is little or no loss of fertilizers in our rocky soils. The rock is very porous and we believe that a great amount of fertil¬ 
izing properties which in sandy soils would be lost, are retained in the rocks and held there. The rock being so porous that the -roots penetrate it gathering up

the stored fertilizer and appropriating it. 
Another reason why we do not believe that the fertilizer in solution percolates through the rocks and is lost, is that our pine lands are lower than the glades, and there is an ever flowing underground current of water, forcing its way upward through the rock, which would have a tendency to force back to the surface what soluable matter that had penetrated the rock, making it available at all times. 
A well may be put down any where in the rocky lands from eight to ten feet deep which, can never be pumped dry, 
furnishing an unlimited amount of fresh, 
sweet, pure water. During the past three or four years I have put down a number of these wells and have not had a failure in any of them. The flow of water is as 


great today as it was the day they were put down. 

The thought came to me while Profes¬ 
sor Blair was talking, that in some way, 
down in our country nature had provided us a pocket in which to hold these fertil¬ 
izers. It is held largely in solution in these rocks and the roots go down and penetrate them, thus throughout the severest droughts we have, does not tend to yellow the trees, to dry up the foliage, 
or check the growth. I call attention to this hoping that the professor will some¬ 
time make an experiment to see whether a portion of our fertilizers are lost in percolating through the soil and rocks, or whether they are stored underneath the ground in the rocks and are ready for future use.

Report of Standing Committee on Fertilizers 

and Irrigation. 


BY PROF. E. R. FLINT. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I take it that it is the province of this committee^ to present any progress that has been made during the year, in regard to fertilization and irrigation, in so far as it is of interest to the horticulturist, 
particularly of the State of Florida. 

While I cannot announce anv start¬ 
ling discoveries for the year in the mat¬ 
ter of fertilization, nevertheless there is undoubtedly a constant and steady ac¬ 
cumulation of experience and experimen¬ 
tal data which ’is gradually leading to the point of making plant fertilization more nearly an exact science than it has been, 
or perhaps it would be nearer the truth to say, to a point where we begin to real¬ 
ize that, as it varies so with every varying condition, it never can be an exact sci¬ 
ence. 

In regard to practical results and pro¬ 
gress in our own State, the Florida Ex¬ 
periment Station has just published the results of an extensive experiment on the fertilization of the pineapple and has reached some interesting and valuable re¬ 
sults, which are to be presented in another paper. Fertilizer experiments are also in progress on the orange, cotton and pota¬ 
toes. 

If we review the work done by the var¬ 
ious experiment Stations on fertilization, 


for the past year, it seems to me that we must be lead to the belief that not only every State, but every county, every farm and indeed every portion of that farm requires more or less special or in¬ 
dividual treatment to get the best results. 
A universal formula for any particular crop is not possible. Such a formula may serve as a basis, but no intelligent plant grower should rest content with this, but should constantly seek to so modify it that it will best meet his own individual conditions, and the more intelligently and conscientiously he does this, the more economically and profitably he will be able to fertilize his land. It is for this reason that Stations and Agricultural papers are always advocating home mixing, and that fertilizer dealers are advertising, 
more and more, the various plant food ingredients rather than mixed fertilizers. 
A mixed fertilizer will always find some sale because there are many that will not take the trouble to do their own mixing, 
and I would not in any way imply that they are not of value, as every reputable dealer aims to supply what is needed and in the best form, as it is in the results ob¬ 
tained that he gets his best advertising, 
and I think we have no reason to com¬ 
plain of the dealers in our own State. 

I believe, in the past that we have be¬ 
come accustomed to place too much reli-

ance on published formulas which have been made up from the analysis of the soil and the crop, and have contented our¬ 
selves with these data. The subject of animal nutrition and feeding is naturally one of considerable complication and dif¬ 
ficulty, as compared with plant feeding, 
but I think that we shall eventually come to believe that the more intimate ques¬ 
tions of plant nutrition, approach it in this respect. To be sure we are concern¬ 
ed in furnishing only a very small percent of the total plant food that is re¬ 
quired, as by far the larger part is ob¬ 
tained from the air, but that part is just as essential to the growth of the plant as the other. If the problem was merely one of determining just how much pot¬ 
ash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen was re¬ 
moved in the crop and was required for the additional growth for the year, it would be easily solved. But in practice, 
this is found to be wholly inadequate for crops like the orange and from eight to ten times as much as the amount so indi¬ 
cated by the above figures seem to be re¬ 
quired to keep the plant up to the best condition of quality and quantity of fruit. 
Where does this excess go to, and how can we economize by reducing this dis¬ 
crepancy to a minimum without lower¬ 
ing the results we wish to obtain?. To answer this question, I think we must turn from the chemical side of the ques¬ 
tion to the physical one, or. in other words, study the physical and mechani¬ 
cal conditions of our soils to find a solu¬ 
tion. 

There are various sources of loss of plant food in the soil, and reasons why the plant does not get all that we apply, 
with which we are acquainted. One of the most evident of these is the leaching 


of the material through the soil and car¬ 
rying it away from the area of the root system of the plant. The rapidity of this leaching increases markedly as we pass from a clay to a sandy soil. Now, on our Florida soils there is no question but that leaching goes on to a very great ex¬ 
tent. It is of course desirable that we have our plant food in a soluble form as it is only in this condition that the plants can make use of it. If we apply it in this condition, or in such compounds that it rapidly becomes so, it is conceivable and no doubt to a large extent true, that with the first soaking of the soil with rain it is carried away to a large extent be¬ 
yond the reach of the plant (speaking particularly of our loose, sandy Florida soils.). Now can we prevent this serious and expensive loss ? At present the meth¬ 
od of overcoming this seems to be to sup¬ 
ply sufficient to allow for this loss and to feed the plant too, which is one reason why we have 'to apply from eight to ten times the amount removed by the crop, and that would seem, from all rational and scientific standpoints, to be necessary. In other words, we apply say from one to two tons to the acre, expecting and know¬ 
ing that we shall lose a large part of it, 
when perhaps 200 to 300 pounds is all the crop needs and makes use of. If such conditions held in any technical line, you may be sure the manufacturer would take immediate steps to prevent this loss. 
If the farmer can stand this constant drain and still make a profit, there must indeed be money in farming. I believe, 
however, that we can control this loss to a considerable extent. According to the usual practice, we make one or two appli¬ 
cations of fertilizers a year to the crop and expect it to save and make use 


84 


•! FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


of what it can out of this, for the next six months more or less, although its food is being rapidly carried out of its reach, 
and I have no doubt but that the amount of available plant food within access of the plant roots, during the last few months of such a period, is exceedingly small. In other words, we give it a sur¬ 
feit of food in one meal and then starve it for some months. Does not the remedy in this lie in our dividing up our appli¬ 
cations, making several of them through the season, keeping our plants supplied with avaliable food in small amounts, as required. I believe that such a practice would result ih a considerable saving and that a smaller amount of fertilizer so ap¬ 
plied, would produce the results of one or two large applications. To get the best results such a system of applying fertili¬ 
zers should be accompanied with means of irrigating, so that, with each small ap¬ 
plication, if there were not sufficient rain¬ 
fall, just enough water could be applied to bring the food into solution, but not enough to leach through the soil. It is true that the proper carrying out of such a system would involve some initial ex¬ 
pense, but to the progressive farmer of today, who aims to get the best results at the least expense, and can look ahead on his balance sheet, it will eventually save money. 

Another source of loss, which however is largely temporary, and with the pres- 
*ent system of applying fertilizers perhaps more beneficial than otherwise, is the chemical changes that the fertilizing ma¬ 
terial undergoes in the soil, tending in general, to pass from a soluble to a less soluble form. This would be obviated, 
to a considerable extent, by the system just suggested. 


The belief in the value of a chemical soil analysis as an indication of what is necessary to add to that soil in order to make it fertile, is rapidly loosing ground, 
and attention is being turned more par¬ 
ticularly to the bacteriology of the soil, 
the various conditions of acidity and alka¬ 
linity, the changes of the humus in the soil etc., and when the present lines of in¬ 
vestigations shall have advanced further, 
we may hope for a more practical and in¬ 
timate knowledge of the relation existing between the chemistry of the soil and the fertilization oi plants. 

Present methods of soil analysis are aiming to determine the plant food that is actually available to the plant, rather than the total amount of such material in the soil. These methods should give a much better idea of what is needed than the methods formerly employed. 

The farmer has two valuable and in¬ 
expensive means of improving his soil and thereby cutting down his fertilizer expenses, which I do not think are prac¬ 
tised nearly to the extent that they should be, and these are, the plowing under of green crops and the growing of legumin¬ 
ous crops as a source of nitrogen. As the natural sources of fertilizing material become less abundant and more expen¬ 
sive, in the future, these means will be more appreciated and used. It is a strik¬ 
ing fact that is noticeable as we review the developement and advancement of civilization, with its ever increasing neces¬ 
sities and requirements, that no sooner does an urgent emergency arise for any¬ 
thing that may contribute to the comfort and welfare of mankind, than some dis¬ 
covery is made that supplies that demand. 
Up to the present time, we have lived in a time when nature, by the exploration 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


85 


and opening up of new countries and the discoveries of great deposits of valuable mineral material, has supplied everything needed with a lavish hand. Nor has man been at all backward in using, with the greatest freedom and often times with the most inexcusable wastefulness, the resources which have been so bountifully given to him. The time has already ar¬ 
rived, however, when we begin to look into the future and speculate as to what is going to happen to posterity when we shall have exhausted the resources which we are now drawing on with ever-increas¬ 
ing freedom to supply the constantly growing demands. That the crude ma¬ 
terial stored in the earth, which has grown to be so indispensable to our wel¬ 
fare, will eventually be exhausted, no one can doubt, and in fact it is possible to calculate approximately, with the present rate of use, when many of our natural resources will be exhausted, a period in many instances surprisingly and almost alarmingly short. We must then, con¬ 
sole ourselves with the above mentioned fact, that some discovery will be made which will enable us to get along as well or better without them. 

Let us consider for a moment, the sit¬ 
uation in regard to the future supply of fertilizing matei:ials and see what is being done to provide for the time when we shall have exhausted the great deposits that have proved of such inestimable val¬ 
ue to agriculture. First in regard to pK)t- 
ash. It is calculated that the present con¬ 
sumption of potash, for all purposes, is over three million tons a year and that it is constantly growing. Practically all of this comes from the great Stassfurt de¬ 
posits in Germany. As minor sources of supply we have wood ashes and cotton 


seed hull ashes, which are limited. About 
2000 tons of muriate of potash are an¬ 
nually made in the south of France from sea water and the Scottish manufacture of kelp yields perhaps 1000 to 1200 tons yearly as a by-product. There are a few other minor sources of supply, such as ni¬ 
trate of potash, wool washings and beet sugar residues. Leaving out these minor sources, which supply but a very small part of the total demand, we have as prac¬ 
tically the sole source, the great potash deposits at Strassfurt, Germany. Al¬ 
though the yearly output of this great collection of mines is now nearly four million tons a year and is steadily in¬ 
creasing, the supply seems almost inex¬ 
haustible, so that it will at least be many, 
many years before mankind will find it¬ 
self face to face with the problem of its potash supply, which has become so es¬ 
sential to successful agriculture, and the necessity for which will grow greater as the population increases, virgin soils are robbed of their natural fertility, and in¬ 
tensive farming becomes more and more a necessity. Let us hope that when that times comes, some means will have been found or new discoveries made, which will supply the deficiency. 

In regard to phosphoric acid the natur¬ 
al supplies may be summed up in general, 
in the deposits of phosphate rock, phos- 
phatic guanos, bones and slag. The great guano deposits which have been drawn upon so heavily in the past will be ex¬ 
hausted before a great many years, and although smaller gauno islands may from time to time be discovered, the supply from this source must gradually diminish. 
The conditions which allow the accumu¬ 
lation of such deposits, which require many years to form will probably never 


86 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


be repeated to the extent they have been, 
so that this source, when exhausted, will probably never be replaced. The phos- 
phatic deposits, as those through the southeastern portions of the United 
States are large and will give an abund¬ 
ant supply for a long time, but they are not inexhaustible. The source of supply from bones etc, which however, is insuf¬ 
ficient to supply the demand, can be count¬ 
ed upon as a steady source, and the same applies to slag, a by-product in iron smelt¬ 
ing. Viewed as a whole, there is noth¬ 
ing alarming in the present situation of the potash and phosphoric acid supply. 

In regard to nitrogen, the fact con¬ 
fronts us that we are continually using up this element of plant food without an adequate return to the soil. The constant cropping of the land, combined with our present system of sewerage disposal, 
which prevents the return to the soil of such a large and legitimate nitrogen sup¬ 
ply, the fact that so many crops are sold away from the land, are sufficient to in¬ 
dicate the loss, ■ without considering the destruction of nitrogen compounds by de¬ 
nitrifying bacteria, the leaching of the soil and other sources of loss. The world’s supply of the two richest sources of nitrogen, guano and saltpeter, is being rapidly exhausted. At the present rate of consumption of the latter, one billion tons a year, it will be exhausted, as claim¬ 
ed by some, in 30 years. New methods for the production of nitrogen compounds available for fertilizing purposes may be discovered, and some efforts have already been made in that direction with electrici¬ 
ty, but this does not promise sufficient as yet to count on it to any extent to relieve the situation. 

Nature has provided, to a certain ex¬ 


tent, for the return of nitrogen to the soil. 
Arising from the chemical changes going on, on the surface, there are always traces of ammonia compounds and compounds of nitrous and nitric acids in the air, which are washed down by rains. Electrical dis¬ 
charges in the air bring small amounts of the free nitrogen into combination so that it may be returned to the soil by the rain. In 1891 it was discovered that there were certain micro-organisms in the soil which could bring the free nitrogen of the air into combination without the aid of any other plant life. Experimen¬ 
tation on this line has been undertaken to make practical use of these organisms but so far without result. 

The fact that leguminous plants had a very beneficial effect on the soil is a very old observation and they have been used for this purpose without the knowledge of the reason for this. It was demon¬ 
strated in 1895 that there was actually an increase in nitrogen after such a crop. 
It was also noticed that these plants would grow in a soil that contained practically no nitrogen. Hellriegel, in 1886 an¬ 
nounced that leguminous plants derived their nitrogen from the atmosphere and in 1888 Wilfarth and Hellriegel demon¬ 
strated that the growth of such plants in a nitrogen-free soil, occured after the de¬ 
velopment of nodules on the roots. Pre¬ 
vious to this time, although these nodules had been noticed, they had been con¬ 
sidered as a diseased condition of the roots. When the true solution of the question began to appear, it was easily demonstrated that a leguminous plant, grown in a soil absolutely free from nitrogen, as in pure quartz sand that had been heated to redness, and watered with a solution devoid of nitrogen in any 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


87 


form, would produce a normal growth when the nodules were present, but if they were not present they would quickly die. 
It was indeed proved that a legume grow¬ 
ing in a poor sandy soil provided with no¬ 
dule-forming bacteria, will be even more vigorous and produce a better crop than plants growing in a moderately rich soil devoid of the bacteria. A great many re¬ 
cent field experiments in all parts of the country have proved this beyond a doubt. 

One of the most striking experiments was that of Prof. J. F. Duggar at the 
Alabama Experiment Station in 1895 and 
1897. On one field where hairy vetch had not been grown previously and the fertilizer used contained phosphoric acid and potash without any nitrogen, the yield was but 235 pounds of hay per acre. 
On a similar plot, treated in a similar manner with the exception of the addi¬ 
tion of some soil from an old field con¬ 
taining the proper bacteria, the yield of hay was 2540 pounds per acre, or an in¬ 
crease of over 2000 pounds. This benefi¬ 
cial effect is not confined to the legumin¬ 
ous crop itself, but is imparted to the crops following such plants and this has become so universally accepted and so many times proved, that every recogniz¬ 
ed system of rotation includes some legu¬ 
minous crop in its course. The fact is tersely stated by T. E. Neal, from results of experiments at the Deleware Experi¬ 
ment Station, that $100 invested in clo¬ 
ver seed returned four times as much as the same amount invested in nitrate of so¬ 


da. It is estimated in this country that the average amount of nitrogen added to the soil by legums is 122 pounds per acre. 
When it is remembered that a high grade nitrate of soda contains only about 15 per cent, of nitrogen, while much that is on the market often contains considerable less, it will be seen that a crop of legumes is equal to from 800 to 1000 pounds of nitrate of soda per acre, which at the pres¬ 
ent price of this fertilizer, is equal in value to from $20 to $25. 

We thus see a possible future solution of the question of the nitrogen supply, at least. The horticulturist of Florida, as well as in other states, in order to meet the gradually extending competition, has got to take advantage of every possible means of furnishing the fertilization necessary to secure the best results, at the lowest price consistent with efficiency, 
but in doing this he must be careful that he does not deteriorate the quality of his fruit. Every poorly fertilized grove means poor fruit which in turn is a men¬ 
ace to the reputation of the whole crop,, 
which up to the present time at least, has justly and easily held first place. We must however, seek always to improve our fruit, so that we may not only meet, but keep ahead of the competition that is bound to develope from the West Indies etc. The geographical position of Flori¬ 
da is such, that I believe she can and will meet this competition, especially in the quality of her fruit.

THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF FIXED NITROGEN. 


BY L. HEIMBURGER, M.S., 

FIRST ASSISTANT STATE CHEMIST. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Of the three natural elements so often deficient in our soils combined nitrogen is the one most easily exhausted, the most costly and the most rare. 

Every crop removes its aloquent por¬ 
tion of combined nitrogen from the soil, 
and if not returned by the grower leaves the soil proportionally poorer. Everv bat¬ 
tle results in the waste of hundreds even thousands of tons of nitrogen that could be used in supporting instead of destroy¬ 
ing human life. 

Again our sewers are delivering un¬ 
told millions of dollars of nitrogen an¬ 
nually into the sea. 

Every pound of coal or wood as or¬ 
dinarily burned, results in the return to the atmosphere of a definite amount of nitrogen. 

The problem is to replace this annual loss of combined nitrogen and as our two chief sources at present are neither inexhaustible, it becomes a serious mat¬ 
ter. These two chief sources arc our coal beds and nitrate deposits. Of the coal burned only a comparatively small amount of the nitrogen content is saved and our visible supply of Nitrate is be¬ 
ing rapidly exhausted. 

At the present increasing rate of ex¬ 
portation, now one and a half million tons annually, the Chili nitrate deposits cannot last more than another twenty years. 

Nitrogen is one of the least active 


chemically of all the elements, and for this reason, it is found in nature principal¬ 
ly in its free uncombined or elementary form. It is only by the most drastic of chemical or physical methods that elemen¬ 
tary nitrogen can be made to combine with other elements. The ultimate source of all our nitrogen combined and uncombined is the atmosphere where it is present in its elementary form to the ex¬ 
tent of about 79 per cent, by volume. The remaining 21 per cent, is principally oxy- 
gen. 

The greatest direct economic value of elementary nitrogen in the atmosphere is to act as a delutant to the oxygen. In¬ 
cidentally it is the source of all combined nitrogen. 

Elementary or uncombined nitrogen has no neutrant value to the higher or¬ 
ganisms and therefore is of no direct value to the plants and animals we are most interested in. 

In its combined forms nitrogen is one of the bases of life among higher organ¬ 
isms being a principal constitutent of pro¬ 
toplasm; the others being Carbon, Hy¬ 
drogen, Oxygen, Sulphur and Phospho¬ 
rus. 

If it were not for combined nitrogen, 
life as we now know it would be impos¬ 
sible. 

Here the question may be asked, how is the free or elementary nitrogen which is so inactive chemically, made to combine in nature with other elements so that higher life may be possible? 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


This is a most difficult question to an¬ 
swer, and at present can only be answ^^r- 
ed in part by Science. It is along this line that bacteriology together with chemistry and physics have accomplished great work in recent years. 

Bacteriology, the youngest of all the sciences has shed the greatest amount of light upon this question. During the last two decades this science through its many researches tells us of a great number of micro-organisms that have the power of fixing nitrogen; that is, they are capable through unknown processes to cause ele¬ 
mentary nitrogen to combine with cer¬ 
tain other elements present to form com¬ 
pounds of Nitrogen which are available as food for higher plants. 

These nitrogen fixing micro-organisms may be divided into two classes, symbio¬ 
tic and non-symbiotic. 

The greater amount of research has been devoted to the former, and therefore they are best known *at present. 

These symbiotic micro-organisms are always found intimately associated with certain higher plants especially the papil- 
lionaccae or leguminosae (beans, peas, 
clover, etc.) in whose roots they reside. 
The amount of nitrogen that may be fix¬ 
ed by these micro-organisms is large and the cultivation of legumes should always be encouraged. 

Of late years our National Department of Agriculture has been making great ef¬ 
forts to devise a reliable method by means 
-of which the micro-organisms above men¬ 
tioned may be readily distributed in a commercial way. 

The method of drying the cultures on cotton, recommended so highly not longer than a couple of years ago, has recently been shown to be but at best partially suc¬ 


89 

cessful. Still a reliable method will un¬ 
doubtedly be forthcoming before long. 

To the second class or non-symbiotic nitrogen fixing micro-organisms belong those of bacteria that have the power of fixing elementary atmospheric nitrogen unaided by any host. These organisms have not as yet been studied extensively, 
still a large number of forms have been discovered. 

Besides the nitrogen fixing bacteria just discovered, there are forms of micro¬ 
organisms that have an opposite function, 
that is, they have the power of breaking up nitrogenous compounds with the lib¬ 
eration jof elementary nitrogen. There¬ 
fore the action of these bacteria result in the loss of fixed nitrogen in the soil. 
These organisms can, however, be readily controlled by the prop>er drainage and cul¬ 
tivation of the soil, for they are as a rule anarobic, (not capable of existing in the presence of air) or at best but slightly facultative (capable of existing in or not in the presence of air.) 

Another natural agency by means of which atmospheric elementary nitrogen is fixed is through electrical discharges. 

For many years it has been known that lightning discharges cause atmospheric nitrogen to combine with oxygen to from oxides: These in turn unite with aqueous vapour to form nitric and ni¬ 
trous acids, which are washed out of the air into the soil by the rain. 

It must be borne in mind that but a very limited amount of atmospheric nitrogen is fixed in this way. 

As far back as 180 years ago Caven¬ 
dish, one of the founders of modern chem¬ 
istry, predicted the commercial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and a few years la¬ 
ter contemporaneously with Priestly 


90 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


showed that electric sparks under certain conditions oxidized atmospheric nitro¬ 
gen. 

Later the noted chemist Bunsen did more valuable work in the electro-ther¬ 
mic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. 

Until very recently the yield of oxides of nitrogen has been very poor by elec¬ 
tro-thermic methods being only in the experimental stage. The principles upon which are based all electro-thermic meth¬ 
ods for the fixation of free nitrogen are in general as follows: 

When air is subjected to silent electri¬ 
cal discharges of high potential, the oxy¬ 
gen is ozonized and the nitrogen is oxi¬ 
dized most largely into nitric and dinitric oxides (NO, NO2) the former can be fur¬ 
ther oxidized to dinitric oxide. 

Dinitric oxide or nitrogen preoxide in the presence of water forms nitric (HN 
Da) nitrous acid (HN O2) as well as ni¬ 
tric oxide (NO) depending on the relative proportions of peroxide and water pres¬ 
ent. 

These acids, nitric and nitrous, com¬ 
bine with bases to form nitrates and ni¬ 
trites. 

To oxidize nitrogen requires a very high temperature. It has been shown in recent years, that the percentage of ni¬ 
trogen oxidized is very largely depend¬ 
ant upon the temperature the gases are exposed to. Nernst determined that at 
1,811 degrees C. only .37 per cent, of the 
Nitrogen supplied was oxidized, while at 
3,200 degrees C. 5 per cent, of the nitro¬ 
gen was oxidized. 

If the oxides fromed are not rapidly re¬ 
moved, this high temperature causes their decomposition. 

Electricity is the best source of heat for obtaining the high temperature re¬ 


quired for the oxidization of atmospherit nitrogen. 

Of the large number of electro-thermic methods for the fixing of free nitrogen, 
but one, the Birkeland-Eyde process, has proven a complete commercial success. 

In the Birkeland-Eyde process the in¬ 
ventors use magnetic blow-pipe electrodes with an alternating current, this gives a flame disk of large surface. 

The air enters from both sides of the flame disk and is drawn off from below in such a manner that it has passed direct¬ 
ly through the plane of the flame. 

Only about two percent, of the nitro¬ 
gen is oxidized in the flame. After pas¬ 
sing through the flame, the air is cooled in a suitable chamber where the nitric oxide (NO) is further oxidized to per¬ 
oxide, (NO2.) From the cooling chamber the gases are conducted through absorp¬ 
tion towers, eight in number, where they come in contact with water. The dilute nitric acid is drawn off from below, rais¬ 
ed again, and allowed to trickle down again from tower to tower, until upon flowing from tower number eight the formerly very dilute acid has been raised to about 50 per cent. 

The last traces of acid are removed in towers irrigated with lime water and finally in a dry lime chamber. 

The nitric acid thus obtained is neu¬ 
tralized with calcium carbonate (lime¬ 
stone) Ca CO3, and the resulting calcium nitrate (Ca NO3,) is evaporated and fused using the waste heat from the electric furnace. 

The factory at Nottodden, Sweden using the Birkeland-Eyde process, obtains a yield of from ii to 13 hundred pounds of nitric acid per killowatt year, equiva¬ 
lent to about I T-3 horse power year. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 




At these Nottodden works cheap water power is to be had, and in many places in 
Sweden power may be produced for the very low rate of $3.00 per horse power year. 

With the above figures in mind i. e. 
$3.00 worth of power for the production of one half ton of nitric acid, it is proven that the nitrate of lime as produced at 
Nottodden can successfully compete with 
Chili nitrate of soda at current prices. 


91 

The Birkeland-Eyde process being new, is susceptible to material improve¬ 
ment. 

A new improved plant, recently put up, 
turns out over fifteen hundred pounds of nitric acid per killowatt year. 

The much dreaded nitrogen famine so often predicted of late years, may in the very near future be entirely eliminated by electro-thermic methods for the direct fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. 


FERTILIZING MATERIALS. 


BY LORENZO A. WILSON 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The fertilizer question has been so ably handled before this Association during its nineteen meetings it would appear there was very little left to be said regarding it. 
My friend, Mr. Painter has told you some of the things he knows on several occa¬ 
sions and has also issued some very intel¬ 
ligent books that nearly all of you have read. During the past twelve years I have written articles myself, sending them broadcast over the State to nearly every one of you I think, and there is only left for me now the rehashing of the same matter. 

There are so many growers in the State who have made such a close study of the question of plant foods and are so well- 
posted on it that I find it a very difficult matter to-day to get a traveling salesman to work for me, who knows as much on this subject as many members of this As¬ 
sociation do. T have always said it was a bad plan to put a fertilizer manufactur¬ 
er on this Committee as it is almost im¬ 


possible for him at times to leave out some of the good things he might say of his own brands when he writes or talks on fertilizers. In the following article I 
have tried to write with the idea before me all the time, that I was a fertilizer broker in New York, selling materials to the manufacturers of Florida. 

First I would like to say that the fer¬ 
tilizer industry has been very thoroughly developed in Jacksonville during the past two years. To-day the fertilizer factories of this city have a capacity for making approximately two hundred thousand tons of complete goods, if they had the market for them the year round, and the equipment to move them with. 

PRICES. 

The small growers of Florida buy their fertilizers cheaper to-day in this State than many of the larger buyers do on 
Long Island, New Jersey or Connecticut or Massachusetts. All of this has been made possible by the development of the fertilizer business in Jacksonville; the 




92 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


fact that the market has grown as it has; 
that the materials are imported direct to this port from their points of production and the fact that the State of Florida it¬ 
self produces practically the Phosphate supplies for the world. I have heard many growers say they were raising orange groves, pineapple patches and vegetable crops for the fertilizer manufacturer, as they get all the money. The question must necessarily then be of all-absorbing interest to the horticulturalists of the 
State. 

The greater proportion of the groves and pineries are on high pine lands, which are composed of from 95 to 98 per cent, 
sand. The rest are mostly on hammocks that were quite rich to start on but under the draft of heavy crops of oranges their fertility was soon reduced to the same degree of poverty as the high pine lands so that the fertilizer question began to ap¬ 
peal to all alike and the whole country set in to study this subject. 

In this article I will only take up the question of fertilizing materials, princi¬ 
pally those that are used by the orange grower. 

Under the influence of the German 
Kaili Works the first article that seems to interest the orange grower the most is 
Potash. In the modest opinion of the writer they have worked Potash rather strong on the grower, claiming for its ex¬ 
cessive use a great many things that can¬ 
not be sustained. 

The first or crude produce of the Ger¬ 
man mines is Kainit, which gives 26 j>er cent, of Sulphate Potash, Salt, Magnesia, 
etc. This is purified and the Double Man¬ 
ure Salts of Potash, Magnesia was form¬ 
ed, which gives 50 to 52 per cent. Sulphate of Potash or 26 per cent. K2O and about 


35 per cent. Sulphate of Magnesia, with 
2.50 per cent, of salt. This is still further purified and the chemist obtains the al¬ 
most chemically High Grade Sulphate of 
Potash, 90 to 96 per cent Sulphate of 
Potash or 49 to 52 per cent K2O. 

On account of the supposed good effect of the Sulphate of Magnesia on the soil and the fruit a great many orange grow¬ 
ers prefer to buy Double Manure Salts, 
paying the difference in price and freights over the High Grade. I do not know whether they are justified or not in this belief, 

I will pass over the Murate of Potash because it is so little used by the grower, 
its high content of chlorine or salt mak¬ 
ing it objectionable to the orange tree. 

Nitrate of potash or salt petre is used to a limited extent. There are several grades, the highest 16 per cent, ammonia and 44 per cent of potash K2O, giving the ammonia a valuation of $3 per unit per cent, we find this a little cheaper source of potash than the sulphate. At a selling price of $92 per ton at Jacksonville the 
44 per cent, of Potash is worth $42 or less than $i for each per cent. It is very quick in its action and does not seem to combine readily with the soil elements and is in great danger of being washed out by heavy rains. 

The next imiportant element in a fertili¬ 
zer is the phosphoric acid, without it no blossom or seed is perfect. It is derived from a great many sources. Animal bone gives 4 to 5 per cent, ammonia and about 24 per cent, phosphoric acid of which from 6 to 10 per cent, is available to the plants, the rest gradually under¬ 
goes decomposition in the soil and it will take from three to five years for it all to become used up. Steamed bone gives 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


93 


about 3 per cent, ammonia and 25 per cent, phosphoric acid and on account of its fineness is more readily available to the plants. The spent bone from the sugar refineries is treated with sulphuric acid to make its phosphoric acid availa¬ 
ble at once, and is used and sold under the name of dissolved bone black. It con¬ 
tains then from 16 to 18 per cent, availa¬ 
ble phosphoric acid. 

Florida phosphates or fossil bone is the greatest source of phosphoric acid. This is mined in the central and southern parts of the State and immense quantities are exported to Europe. This phosphoric acid in our Florida phosphates is entirely insoluble. If it had been soluble it would not have remained, but would have been dissolved by the soil water and long since have disappeared from our country into the Gulf of Mexico. Chemistry has come to our relief in making this and other phosphatic materials available to the plant. Sulphuric acid is used in render¬ 
ing water soluble the insoluble phosphor¬ 
ic acid in animal bone and the fossil bone in Florida. Each contains phosphoric acid and lime combined in the same pro¬ 
portion; one part of phosphoric acid and three parts lime which is called bone phos¬ 
phate of lime, which is insoluble. Now to make the material, either bone or the 
Florida phosphates soluble and available to the plants it is ground and combined with sulphuric acid diluted with water to 
52 per cent beaumae. The sulphuric acid has more affinity for the lime than the phosphoric acid has and combined with two parts forming sulphate* of lime or land plaster, leaving the phosphoric acid combined with one part of lime which is soluble in soil water and availa¬ 
ble to the plants. The sulphuric acid 


combining chemically with the lime is no more sulphuric acid and there is no more danger of your getting free sulphuric acid in this preparation than you would in sulphate of potash or sul¬ 
phate of ammonia. This idea of danger from free sulphuric acid is a humbug and not worthy of the slightest attention by the intelligent horticultural- 
ists of this State, an idea advanced by a northern manufacturer. Soluble phos¬ 
phoric acid is identical no matter from what source it is derived, and when some growers realize this they will save money. 

One of the northern firms for the last twenty years has been trying to make the 
Florida grower believe that all other com¬ 
plete fertilizers have free sulphuric acid in them, claiming that through a secret process by steaming he makes bone, Peru¬ 
vian guano and other phosphatic mater¬ 
ials all available. This statement has been made to many growers in the State but would never be made before a fertili¬ 
zer manufacturer or some one who knew because the party making this claim knows only too well there are no elements in water or steam to combine with the lime in bone or phosphate to make it available even though he should put it through a secret isteaming process (for seventeen years. 

Peruvian Guano is another fine source of phosphoric acid. High grade will give 
9 to 10 per cent, ammonia, 9 to 12 phos¬ 
phoric acid partly available and three to four per cent, potash. Lower grades will give 3 to 4 per cent, ammonia, 18 to 20 
per cent. Phosphoric Acid and 3 to 4 per cent. Potash. All of its phosphoric acid sooner or later becomes available in the soil. They are not susceptible of treat¬ 
ment with sulphuric acid. 


94 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


The by-products of the slaughter hous¬ 
es, tankage or blood and bone furnish variable quantities of phosphoric acid and 
- ammonia. 

The next and most important element of all fertilizers is ammonia or nitrogen, 
it is the life, the growth of all plants. It is derived from a great many sources, 
which are divided into non-organic or chemical and organic. Of chemical am- 
moniates sulphate of ammonia heads the list, giving 25 per cent ammonia. This is one of the slowest of all, gradually changing into nitric acid in the soil. Ni¬ 
trate of soda or Chili salt peter gives 17 
to 19 per cent ammonia in its most availa¬ 
ble form, the nitric acid separating from thesoda at once,being immediately availa¬ 
ble to the plants. As it does not readily combine with the soil elements it is in dan¬ 
ger of being washed down below the reach of some plants by heavy rains. Nitrate of potash mentioned before has the same tendency. 

In the list of organic ammoniates we have dried blood, giving 17 per cent. 
This changes quite quickly into nitrate with a reasonable amount of soil water. 
Blood and bone or tankage contains from 
10 per cent, to 6 per cent, ammonia ac¬ 
cording to grade and changes rather slow¬ 
ly in the soil into Nitrate. 

Cotton seed meal furnishes 7 1-2 to 8 
per cent ammonia. Castor pomace con¬ 
tains from 6 to 6 1-2 per cent, ammonia. 
Tobacco stems furnish a small amount of ammonia from i to 3 per cent, and some potash, one grade giving 3 ammonia and 
TO potash which is in a very available form. 

You will see from the above list of am¬ 
moniates that you have quite a lot from which to choose but the intelligent hor- 


ticulturalist knows that the chemical am¬ 
moniates give the best results on orange trees and I will conclude by giving an ex¬ 
tract from an article by Mr. Herbert J. 
Webber, Assistant in Division of Vegeta¬ 
ble Pathology at Washington, and who is well known to most orange growers. 

^‘Probably no element of plant food used in the fertilization of orange trees should be more carefully considered with respect to both form and quantity than nitrogen. It is the most costly and at the same time the most dangerous element to use, as excessive applications are liable to result in extensive splitting and drop¬ 
ping of the fruit or in the production of the serious disease known as die-back.” 

“The mineral nitrogen manures, nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia appar¬ 
ently stimulate the production of fruit more than organic manures, and yet pro¬ 
duce a fair general growth. The fruit produced by fertilization with these salts used in correct proportions with the other elements, which it is necessary to apply, 
is usually of good quality, being solid, 
rich and juicy, with thin skins and little rag. Sulphate of ammonia has the effect, 
growers testify, of sweetening fruit to a great extent. 

“Sulphate of Ammonia has been very widely used among orange growers. Ni¬ 
trate of soda has been but little used thus far, but is apparently in favor. Its insec¬ 
ticide and water attracting properties are probably much greater than those of sul¬ 
phate of ammonia. 

“Organic manures are of doubtful util¬ 
ity. Barn manure is largely used by many growers who still hold to the tra¬ 
dition that chemical manures are injuri¬ 
ous to the plants. The benefits of bam manure in an orange grove are a serious 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


95 


question. The fruits produced from ni¬ 
trogen from this source are usually large, 
coarse, thick skinned, with abundant rag and inferior flavor. If barn manure is used and most growers have a limited quantity and desire to use what they have, 
it should be spread over the grove lightly so that each tree receives only a small amount. When such manure is depended upon as the main element of fertilization, 
liberal dressings of sulphate of potash should be occasionally applied. This will tend to correct the evils of an overbal¬ 
anced nitrogenous fertilizer. What has been said as to the effects of barn manure on the quality of the fruit applies ec{ually to the effects produced by muck, cotton seed meal, blood and bone, tankage etc. 
In general, organic fertilizers do not stim¬ 
ulate fruiting to the same extent as the mineral fertilizers. It is probably better to apply such fertilizers to annual crops, 
garden truck, etc. 

‘Tn fertilizing the orange, potash is most frequently used either jn the form of sulphate or wood ashes. 

“The noticeable effect of the potash on orange trees appears to be its aid in com¬ 
pleting and maturing the wood; appar¬ 
ently an insufficiency of potash is shown by an excessive growth of weak, imma¬ 
ture wood, which does not harden up as winter approaches and is liable to be in¬ 
jured by frost. 

“The phosphoric acid, which is a yery 


Florida orange lands, is mostly used in the form of dissolved bone, superphos¬ 
phate, bone, bone black, raw bone, guano etc. The immediate effect of phosphoric acid on the orange tree and its fruit is little understood. Several intelligent growers claim to be able to recognize the necessary element of fertilization on effect of phosphorus starvation by the ap¬ 
pearance of the new growth of leaves. If these, when they first push out, or while they are young and tender, present a slightly variegated appearance, mottled with light and dark green it is claimed that they are suffering from a lack of phosphorus and if a liberal application of some soluble phosphoric acid is ^ applied this appearance may be checked. If this can be shown to be the case it will prove a valuable index to the available quality of phosphorus in the soil. A similar ap¬ 
pearance may, however, appear in light cases of so-called frenching, a disease, or more properly a symptom of disease which is not uncommon. Phosphorus starvation may have some effect in in¬ 
ducing this disease.” 

Having watched the irrigation ques¬ 
tion since the dry Spring of 1890 I can say that not one plant in a hundred has paid a dividend on orange groves. If the trees are properly fertilized early in the season and kept cultivated until the rainy season sets in, I do not think that irrigation need be resorted to.

FERTILIZERS AND IRRIGATION. 

BY F. D. WAITE. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

My report on Fertilizers and Irrigation will not take up much time, but I trust we shall have a full discussion as to the merits of chemical fertilizers. In my mind there is nothing that is so necessary as the right kind of fertilizers, when, and how they should be applied, in order to grow the very best fruit and vegetables. 

Thinking it necessary that I should give to this Society something new along these lines, I reviewed my file of this so¬ 
ciety’s reports for the past twelve years, 
and after I had finished, it seemed that the ground had been completely covered, and that it would be a waste of time to re¬ 
hash them all. Not that they are not valuable for they are, and I recommend that the members of this Society that have not a complete list of these books, apply to the Secretary for copies of as many as he can furnish, commencing way back in 
1893, when Major Healy and others were discussing the merits of muck and stable manure (being a complete fertilizer for orange trees) up to the present time when the question arises, whether we shall (tr get the best results) experiment with our individual soils, using pure chemicals, or purchase ready mixed fertilizers of stand¬ 
ard formulas from reputable manufac¬ 
turers. 

Some well known growers have recent¬ 
ly remarked that ten and fifteen years ago when blood and bone was used with a balanced ration of potash, we experienc¬ 
ed less trouble with our groves, and new diseases were not developing as rapidly as they are today, and the question arises; 


Are we pursuing the right course? 
Some tell us we should not use acid phos¬ 
phate, that it contains so much free acid, 
that our soils will become poisoned. Yet our State Chemist tells us that availa¬ 
ble phosphoric acid is just as good from one source as another, and that when we buy the so-called dissolved bone black it is just as liable to be acid phosphate color¬ 
ed with lamp black, and we pay about seven dollars extra for the coloring. 
Prof. Rose also says that efforts have been made by agricultural chemists to distin¬ 
guish them, so far without results. 

As the situation exists to-day, we may buy a complete fertilizer which has on its tag, dissolved bone or dissolved bone black as its source of phosphoric acid. All our 
State chemist can do is to determine by samples sent him the true analysis as to its content, of ammonia, phosphoric acid, 
and potash. 

The manufacturers that wj deal with may be honest, and believe that which they sell us is the true article, as they have a guarantee from the dealers that sold them, and have no way themselves of telling one from the other. Some as¬ 
sert that the supply of bone does not equal the demand, then we had better buy acid phosphate and save seven dollars per ton, 
or buy steamed and raw ground bone, if we are afraid of filling our soils with acid. 

I have recently corresponded with deal¬ 
ers who handle nitrate of potash and basic slag. With these two chemicals we can secure a fertilizer well balanced and abso¬ 
lutely free of all acids, and the slag con¬ 
tains 50 per cent, of lime. 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


97 


At present I think all the basic slag is imported, and is a by-product in manu¬ 
facturing steel from an iron ore contain¬ 
ing a high percentage of phosphorous. 
To one ton of iron ore, looo pounds of rock lime is added, and this material hav¬ 
ing a great affinity for phosphorous, takes up this element from the iron, and when drawn from the converter, the slag is at the top and usually runs about, fifty per cent, of the original charge. 

At the steel works in this country I un¬ 
derstand the slag is cooled with water which cracks it into small pieces, it is then used to balast railroads. We pay from $20 to $22 per ton in large lots for the imported product which runs about 17 per cent, available phosphoric acid, and 50 per cent, of lime. If the Ala¬ 
bama slag is of the same quality is seems to me that our Jacksonville manufactur¬ 
ers could give us a pure form of phos¬ 
phoric acid, and at less expense than the high grade acid phosphate is now costing us. 

During our meeting at St. Augustine 
Mr. C. G. White gave us the results of some very interesting tests made in growing Irish potatoes with slag phos¬ 
phate, and says, “Slag phosphate does sur¬ 
prisingly well and as far as one test goes, sustains the European experiments as to its value on sour soils, also the re¬ 
sults at the Ohio Experimental Station.’' 

Why is it we have so little exchange of thought in regard to fertilizer? Is it be¬ 
cause we are ashamed to admit a lack of knowledge, or that we are perfectly satis¬ 
fied with our own mixtures or manufac¬ 
tured goods? Even if we are, I believe we should express ourselves more fully, 
thereby saving the Novice much time and expense. 

H—7 


This subject has been discussed in the meetings for several years and many plans have been given in recent reports for surface and sub-irrigations. Proba¬ 
bly the best plan for sub-irrigation is that in use at Sanford among the vegetable growers, and fully discribed in Year Book for 1903, page 60. It is just as necessa¬ 
ry to have drainage, as irrigation, and if 
I could have only the one, I would choose drainage, but with this plan at 
Sanford it acts for both. Water from artesian wells being the source of supply. 

These wells are less than half the depth of those in the Manatee section, I have never heard that the water from the San¬ 
ford wells has an injurious effect. 

We, on the Manatee use surface irriga¬ 
tion from artesian wells, carrying the wa¬ 
ter either through cement pipes under ground, in ditches, or canvas hose to all parts of the grove. 

Some assert that artesian water has kill¬ 
ed a great many trees, we admit that in some cases this is true, but largely due to the lack of drainage. An excess of rain fall would probably have the same effect. 
We should be cautious as we approach the rainy season and not fill our soil too full of water, for if we do we shall certainly suffer from the result. 

The following is a discription of the ir¬ 
rigating plant of the Wills grove at Suth¬ 
erland Florida, as given me by Mr. Wills. 
The plant is supplied from a pond or small lake, with this as you will see, he can Spray his trees with clear water for the red spider and purple mite. 

Sutherland, Fla., April 24, 1906. 

My Dear Mr. Waite : Our Irrigating 
Plant is equipped with a White-Blakleslee

ary pump, with a five-inch suction and a four-inch discharge maximum capacity of which, is 335 gallons per minute, with a guaranteed capacity of 250 gallons per minute. We have a four-inch main run¬ 
ning through the center of the 30 acres under Irrigation and from this main are laterals every 150 feet, starting out with two-inch pipe and running down to one inch, with three-fourths inch stand pipes 
150 feet apart over the entire 30 acres, so that a 75 foot piece of three-fourth inch hose connected with two opposite hydrants will meet each other. The spray rods are made of three-fourth inch pipe, six feet long tapered down to a point at the lower end to stick into the ground, with a T about 18 inches from the lower end for connecting the hose and on top of the spray rod is a McGowan sprayer.. We run twenty sprays at a time with three- 
fourth inch hose moving them from cen¬ 
ter to center, when the ground is suffici¬ 
ently moistened. Last year I found that our twenty spray rods were giving twelve gallons per minute all over the grove, it took us six days last May to spray the en¬ 
tire grove, with an amount of water equal to one inch of rain fall, according to fig¬ 
ures .given to me by Prof. Rolfs, that is, 
it will take about four or five hundred gallons to every 30 square feet to equal one inch of rain fall. The engine that we are using is made by the White-Blakleslee 
Manufacturing Company, of Birming¬ 
ham, Alabama. We have a three-thou¬ 
sand gallon Tank thirty feet from the ground, connected with our Irrigating 
Plant, this gives us pressure enough to wash down our budded trees through one- 
hundred feet of three-fourth inch hose with a nozzle on same without using the 
Engine, two men working at a time. 


With the Engine running we can easily wash down trees from thirty to thirty- 
five feet through ten or twelve lines of hose at a time. We are now trying to wash the spider off the grape fruit trees with the tank pressure, as we cannot get sufficient labor to work many nozzles at a time. 


DISCUSSION. 

Dr. Bessey.—Mr. President, I would like to ask whether any one present is familiar with the recent work that has been done with the processes invented in 
Germany for combining calcium with nitrogen of the air; it has been shown that this compound can be produced very cheaply and very satisfactory results have been claimed for it. 

No response. 

Maj. Healey.—In the old days we used to fight this fertilizer business to a finish. 
We did not have quite so much science then as we have now. It strikes'me that if these fertilizer men would give us an 
“electro-magnate” that would turn us out ten hours work for $1.00, it would be of interest to us. The time was when this society was the best posted of any in the 
United States but that was the time be¬ 
fore it fell into the hands of the fertilizer men. We thrashed out our own compost pile and I think we were capable of know¬ 
ing how to combine the necessary ele¬ 
ments to make up the necessary fertilizer for a large grove. 

It is a curious proposition that of all the members here on the fertilizer com¬ 
mittee that not a man has a word to say as to where the cheapest source of am¬ 
monia can be found. He says, if you will use my fertilizer you will get a cer-

tain percent, of ammonia and a certain percent, of nitrate. I know there are growers here who have been making nitrate with beggar weeds. The reason 
I do not use the cow pen is because I 
have not the cows. 

Now we are here to get at the manner of producing a crop from the ground. 
We are the ones who produce it and the other fellow is the man who lives on the producer (applause). He sells us the stuff, we give him our check, it is placed in the bank and we have to pay it. You can make your soil just as rich with one tenth of the money if you choose to do it. 
I have land on which I have raised three crops of corn. When I first began to use it, it would not produce more than five bushels of corn to the acre, but now 
I am getting at least twenty bushels to the acre without one pound of fertilizer. 
If you can do this in a corn field, it can be done in any other field. I know, no man can gainsay the fact that this is a true statement. 

Professor Blair.—I would like to see 
Maj. Healey raise velvet beans on pine¬ 
apple land. 

Maj. Healey.—If I were raising pine¬ 
apples, I would raise them the same way 
I do velvet beans. I have no wish to say what a gentleman should do with his soil, but I wish to say that if you will raise three crops of velvet beans on it, 
you will have better success with your pineapples. 

Now as stated before, we were not so poor in the old days, we found how much of the chemical fertilizer to put on the soil without knowing its use. I say to this audience that I have land that I wish 
I did not own, for just as long as it is there I am fool enough to do something with it. It was one time what was called 


when I was young, an orange grove. It is a sad sight now and I presume it will always be a sad sight to my pocket book. 
I own it under the “homestead act” and you understand how that is. I said that it was really a good looking grove and since 1895 ^ have never put one pound of fertilizer on it, it has been made on vel¬ 
vet beans and beggar weeds. There is potash enough in that to make a grove. 

Much to my surprise one of my men said to me last year that there were some oranges on my grove, I went over and looked through the grove and sure enough there was a good crop of fruit and I concluded to ship them and am sorry, for they brought me some money and that was an inducement for me to go to work and make another orange grove. 
This proves to you that while you can put the enormous sum of eighty pounds of fertilizer to the tree, yet you can get good results from the velvet bean and beggar weed. 

Now Mr. Chairman, I hope this fertili¬ 
zer question will be taken up by this audience and let us see if we can get down to absolute facts, and see if the old time fool orange grower cannot thrash this down to $50 per year for oranges. 

Mr. Wood.—Mr. President, I note that on the first paper on this subject the writer recommended the plowing under of green crops. My opinion is that it is much better to let the crop die on the ground. 

Prof. Stockbridge.—I am quite sure that the author of that paper through an oversight inadvertantly used the word 
“green” when he should not have done so. In the country from whence he came they term green crop what we call cover crop, and that is what he meant to say. 

Professor Blair.—Just, one word, I 





lOO 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


want to say that the value of both the beggarweed and velvet bean was especial¬ 
ly pointed out in a previous paper. 

Mr. Hart.—I just want to say that ac¬ 
cording to my knowledge of things, it is easy to make land rich by growing velvet beans or beggarweed, though I would not advise the former in orange groves. 
Beggarweed is a profitable crop when the trees are small but when they get larger and shade the ground it will make little growth. In previous years the poli¬ 
cy of growing velvet beans for orange trees has been discussed; the beggarweed 
I indorse fully wherever it may grow, 
whether in orange groves or any where else, but we have to use commercial fer¬ 
tilizers with it to properly balance the ration. I do not believe we can get the nitrogen we want from beggarweed or velvet beans, after the orange trees inter¬ 
lock their limbs. 


Mr. Hubbard.—At the risk of repeat¬ 
ing what may already be known by the members, I will relate the experience of Mr. Butler in the raising of beggar¬ 
weed for nitrogen. He had good trees but no fruit. He had an analysis of the soil made and also for lOO boxes of orang¬ 
es to the acre. The top foot of soil con¬ 
tained about enough ammonia for one to two crops, phosphoric acid for 3 crops and potash for only i 1-2 crops. He then began to use commercial fertilizers. 
He studied this question and decided to use beggarweed to gather nitrogen for the reason that it did not produce any soldier bugs to work on the fruit, the consequence was that after three or four years using only phosphoric acid and potash he gathered so much ni¬ 
trogen that he had to take a mower and mow down the beggar weed to prevent die back taking his trees. 




Report of the Committee on Nut Culture. 


BY H. K. MILLER. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The subject that has been assigned us is rapidly becoming a very live one throughout the South, owing to the great interest now being manifested in the com¬ 
mercial development of the pecan indus¬ 
try. The consumption of nuts in the 
United States is steadily increasing and we are importing approximately six mil¬ 
lions of dollars worth of nuts, in addition to consuming virtually all the home sup¬ 
ply. In as much as nuts have been, until recent years, regarded as a luxury rather than a staple article of food, and since the reform movement now existing through¬ 
out the country in the matter of more rational foods is strongly advocating the liberal use of nuts as a partial substitute for meats, it may confidently be expected that the demand will rapidly increase. 
Already the prices have been steadily ad¬ 
vancing and the ordinary pecans, which a few years since were marketed at five and six cents a pound are now command¬ 
ing eight to twelve cents, while the fancy pecans readily sell at twenty cents to one dollar per pound. 

A health food company in New York, 
of about two years standing, is making a specialty of nut food products and here¬ 
tofore have imported the nuts of the edi¬ 
ble pine to be used as a basis for their preparations. However, the demand for their output has increased to such an ex¬ 
tent that the company is already consider¬ 
ing means by which this constantly in¬ 


creasing demand is to be met. Naturally it has under consideration the pecan and is endeavoring to perfect machinery that will enable the substitution being made. 

The Persian or English walnut indus¬ 
try has been firmly established in Califor¬ 
nia and such renumerative prices obtain¬ 
ed that land in that state suitable for wal¬ 
nut culture has increased in value five fold. Some of the reported incomes from well established orchards are almost in¬ 
credible. Not only is nut growing wor¬ 
thy of our most serious consideration and earnest efforts because of.its commercial possibilities, but like fruit trees in proper assortment, a few nut trees merely for home use adds materially to the pleasure and interest of the home. Besides sup¬ 
plying a wholesome and palatable food, 
the trees themselves add much in the way of making attractive surroundings. It is difficult to estimate the value that a few nut trees will add to the home. 

In presenting this subject brief consid¬ 
eration will be given some of the more important nut bearing trees that are adap¬ 
ted to this state, giving greater attention to the pecan, which so far as known is capable of forming the basis of an indus¬ 
try of considerable magnitude. 

COCOANUTS. 

In the southern part of the state along the Atlantic Coast is to be found cocoa- 
nuts growing wild. These have been es¬ 
tablished there by nuts being washed 



102

ashore. By selecting choice strains of nuts for seeds, the cultivation of the cocoanut may be attempted near the shore where only light frosts occur, however, it is questionable if profitable returns can be expected. The nuts may be planted in place fifteen to twenty feet apart or bet¬ 
ter planted in trenches in moist soil and transplanted after the seed leaf is well developed. 

Little is to be done in way of cultiva¬ 
tion except to prevent other plants from encroaching on the young palms for a few years. Mulching is advantageous as also is the use of fertilizer, however, the returns will not admit of much outlay. 
Our supply of these nuts is derived, for the most part, from the wild groves of the tropics. The palm is an attractive plant and finds considerable use as an or¬ 
namental. 

THE CHESTNUTS. 

Three species of the chestnut are culti¬ 
vated in America: The native American chestnut, the European chestnut, and the 
Japanese chestnut, besides we have the chinquapin, a dwarf and small fruited 
Castaneas, though occasionally the chin¬ 
quapin is found to be a tree of considera¬ 
ble size. A few chinquapins of large size are being propagated which apparently will succeed here, yet it is rather too early to say they will prove of sufficient merit to deserve extensive planting. 
These are supposied to be hybrids com¬ 
bining the size of the chestnut with the good flavor of the chinquapin. Trees may be set twenty feet and thinned after crowding begins, thus securing several crops on land otherwise unoccupied, else they may be given greater distance and field crops grown between the trees until the land is given up to them entirely. 
Clean culture is to be recommended du¬ 


ring the spring. Spraying with Bordeaux will hold in check the fungus diseases, 
but for the weevils, which are the most serious pests, there apparently has been no satisfactory remedy proposed. 

WALNUTS. 

The commercial growing of the walnut in this country is confined to the English or Persian walnut and while this species is hardy in the east as far north as New 
York, and trees known to bear frequent¬ 
ly in the southern and eastern states, no attempt is made to grow this nut on a large scale in these localities. In south¬ 
ern California, however, the production of walnuts has assumed important pro¬ 
portions and perhaps ranks only second to the citrus production of the state. Lit¬ 
tle encouragement for growing the En¬ 
glish walnut in a commercial way in 
Florida can be given, but in as much as bearing trees are reported to exist in the state it is worthy of trial in a limited way. 
A rather open alluvial soil seems best for this species. One disadvantage here is root-knot, but this may be avoided by using the black walnut as a stock. Trees bear in four to six years. 

The Japanese walnuts will thrive in our state and should have a place in every nut growers collection. The cordifor- 
mis is the most desirable variety and may be grown from seed. This tree is attrac¬ 
tive and is being used as a shade tree. 
Some towns and cities in the south are now planting them on their streets. The 
Black or native walnut of the east -does well here and while the nut is exceedingly rich the thickness of the shell is against it as a commercial nut. It is held in greater favor in the north than in the south and there commands a price, but one that is too low to make the cultiva-

tion of this variety for its fruit profitable. 
The cheif value of the black walnut lies in the character of its wood which is useful for furniture. The high price of this timber it seems would induce a liberal planting for timber purposes on much of our waste land. The chief obstacle seems to be the long time necessary to grow salable trees. Little attempt has been made to improve the Black walnut or to made to improve the black walnut or to seems to be an inviting field for the plant breeder. 

HICKORY NUT. 

There are a number of species of this nut other than the pecan, which is by far the most important, and some are prized for their delicate flavor, yet, excluding the pe¬ 
can, very little has been accomplished in cultivating these native trees. The hicko¬ 
ries are for the most part of slow growth and the wood is useul on account of its toughness for manufacturing purposes. 
Some effort has been made at cultivating the shellbark and shagbark, but the trees are difficult to propegate and are slow growers, however, the nuts are of deli¬ 
cate flavor and the shells comparatively thin. Of all the species of hickory the pecan is easily the most important from a horticultural standpoint; indeed it may well rank first in cultural value of all our native nuts. Possessing as it does so many desirable qualities such as rapid growth, productiveness, hardiness, long life and comparative freedom from dis¬ 
ease and insect pests, and yielding a nut with thin shell having a plump, nutri¬ 
tive and delicately flavored kernel, it seems strange its possibilities were not earlier recognized. Only within the past thirty years has any systematic effort been made to establish commercial orchards, 


and even now, by far the greater part of our supply is derived from the wild trees of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Be¬ 
sides finding the pecan native in these states, it is also indigenous to the low¬ 
lands of the Mississippi river and its chief tributaries extending as far north as Indi¬ 
ana and Iowa. It has been introduced in the southern states east of the Mississippi and in general, where proper soil condi¬ 
tions prevail has been found to succeed throughout the cotton area. The tree under favorable conditions attains a height of one hundred to one hundred and seventy five feet with spreading branches so as to produce a majestic dome-like appearance. The foliage is bright and pleasing, thus making the in many of the southern states. These were set with seedling trees, and in many cases, the soil was not wisely selected. 
This with the prevailing notion that the trees required no attention, and hence neglected, resulted in disappointment in a majority of instances, and interest in planting almost died out. Still a few pioneers persisted in their efforts to mas¬ 
ter the situation. Grafted trees were sub¬ 
stituted for seedlings, which had proven so unsatisfactory, and greater care given to cultivation and selection of soil. So much better results followed that interest began to slowly manifest itself once more and has been steadily increasing. A num¬ 
ber of growers in different sections have been making special study of the pecan within the past decade with a view to solv- 
pecan one of our most valuable shade trees. The planting of orchards was undertaken some thirty years ago and rather extensive proportions were reached ing the problems involved, with such happy results that many of the barriers to success have been removed and reliable

information iis now available. Previously little that was authentic was to be found. 
Only in recent years has it been possible to secure trees of good varieties in quanti¬ 
ty and still the supply is short of the de¬ 
mand, on account of the scarcity of graft¬ 
ing scions and the difficulty of successful propagation. 

By means of improved methods of grafting and budding the output has in¬ 
creased very much in the past four years. 
In the attempts to grow trees from seeds the greatest variations were met with, 
few if any producing nuts like the one planted. In most cases the nuts were in¬ 
ferior to the original, the trees were of different character, some growing rapid¬ 
ly, others making ordinary growth, and still others very slow growers. On this account the seedling orchards present a very irregular and unsatisfactory appear¬ 
ance, with trees of same age ranging from a few feet to thirty feet in height. 
Equal variation exists in the time of bear¬ 
ing, some bearing at the age of five years and others still barren at twenty. Very different the results from varietal stock. 
With budded or grafted trees growth is more uniform and even faster than that of the parent tree. Bearing begins much earlier, generally at from three to six years from planting, and the nuts are uniformly like those from the original tree. Attention is here called to the fact that an opinion prevails, that nuts from an isolated tree will produce trees which bear nuts identical with the one planted. 
This is partly due to parties owning such trees advertising the nuts for seed, per¬ 
haps ignorant of the well established prin¬ 
ciple that a self pollenated tree is the surest one to yield inferior seeds. The range for pecan planting in this state ex¬ 
tends southward to the lake region. 


Planting south of this region should not be attempted, except in a small way, until a more thorough trial has been given. In selecting a soil for a pecan orchard pre¬ 
ference should be given to a sandy loam with a sand mixed clay subsoil, the richer the better. Success may be had on a great variety of soils, ranging from almost pure sand to rather stiff clay. A thirsty soil or one that is always wet is to be avoided. A soil that will admit easy pene¬ 
tration by the roots and retain moisture in liberal degree is to be desired. Plant¬ 
ing, care, cultivation and methods of pro¬ 
pagation will be discussed in papers by the other members of the committee. 

The parent trees of the named varieties of pecans were of course seedlings and it is rather strange that among the vast number of seedlings that exist through¬ 
out the south, such a small number have been found of sufficient merit to be given a name and be propagated. Among the older varieties Stuart, Van Deman and 
Frostcher represent the best. Van De¬ 
man is superior to the others for table use but for commercial purposes in the ordinary sense Stuart and Frostcher are in the lead. Among the varieties more recently introduced Schley, Success, Rus¬ 
sell, Dewey, Delmas, Georgia, Curtis and a number of others may be mentioned. It is beyond the scope of this paper to de¬ 
scribe the different varieties but among the ten above mentioned can be found varieties that are adapted to all require¬ 
ments. Proper appreciation for the dif¬ 
ferences existing between varieties is lacking, and the prospective planter might consider this subject thoroughly, with profit to himself. There are varieties that are worthless and it will be a happy day when all these are discarded. 

There are other varieties which are ex-

105 


cellent in some localities and worthless in others. In this state, however, most any variety that has merit may be expected to succeed. It is good policy to plant at least three varieties in an orchard; what these are to be can only be best determined from a knowledge of the object in view and the location of the land. Some of the more recently introduced varieties are much superior to any of the older standards, 
especially in quality of the nuts. Each of the good varieties has its disadvant¬ 
ages, as well as points of merit and it can be said the perfect variety is yet to be found. 

Successful pecan culture like all other remunerative enterprises is not to be had without effort. The same problems are to be met as in other lines of horticulture, 
the only difference being that at present there is prospectively smoother sailing ahead than in other lines. Cultivation, 
care, fertilizing and warfare on insects will demand attention. Fortunately the list of insects is not so large nor are these so serious as those which affect the apple, 
yet there is sufficient injury to warrant a declaration of war on our part. In con¬ 
nection with this paper a Spray Calendar by Prof. H. A. Gossard will be presented. 

In conclusioff, it is to be remembered the pecan industry is young, in fact, very young, considering the possibilities that have been lying dormant so long. With many of the difficulties removed by a bet¬ 
ter knowledge of the requirements for successful culture, we may expect rapid 


progress in the next few years. Young orchards now coming into bearing yield¬ 
ing nuts of superior quality that command a fancy price is giving impetus to the movement. The returns to ^ expected have largely been a matter of speculation and single trees have been made the basis of estimates. Sufficient progress has been made to furnish reliable information and in a few more years exact data may be expected. The expectation of enormous profits is, not to be indulged in, yet, com¬ 
pared with other lines of a horticultural nature, very profitable returns may safely be expected and after the trees are large enough to occupy the land, a few acres should yield a good income with small annual outlay. 

The question of overproduction seems to cause some concern, however, when we consider the time that must elapse before any very great increase can be expected, 
the rapidity with which the demand is in¬ 
creasing and remembering that we have the world for a market, with exportation not yet begun, there need be little fear from this source in our day. Besides, the millions of pounds of common pecans must first give place to the improved va¬ 
rieties. 

There are many features of nut cul¬ 
ture that might be dwelt upon but it is beyond the scope of this paper. From a careful review of the subject there seems to be no more inviting field of endeavor awaiting the young horticulturist than the culture of nut trees in the south

NUT CULTURE. 


BY J. H. WYLIE^ INTERLACHEN^ FLA. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The diairman of our Committee on 
Nut Culture, some time ago requested that I make a short report at this meeting as to planting and cultivating Pecan trees. 

I regret to state that this subject has been neglected by our Society for the past two years, we receive a great many in^ 
quires regarding the setting out, care and cultivation of Pecan groves in this State, 
and it is now considered “an important industry.” Increasing and more intelli¬ 
gent attention is being given each year to the planting and cultivation of the Pecan. 
The permanent and increasing value of the tree is realized. We believe the out¬ 
look for the industry is brighter than ever. 
The demand for fine nuts for table and confectionei*y purposes is constant, and the supply of fine nuts is entirely inade¬ 
quate. 

WHEN AND HOW TO PLANT. 

In this State Pecan trees may be set any time after the leaves drop in the fall varying with the season, but nearly al¬ 
ways by the first of December until the end of March. It is essential however that the trees be dormant. As to distance apart we prefer to set the trees 40x40 or 
50x50 feet. 

In setting out a Pecan tree, a hole twen¬ 
ty-four inches in diameter and deep enough to accomodate length of tap root is usually large enough although larger holes and wider may be dug with advan¬ 
tage, more especially where any fertilizer 


is used in planting the trees. Well-rotted manure or good commercial fertilizer may be put in outer sides of hole, an inch or two beyond the lateral roots when the hole is being filled, but not in direct con¬ 
tact with the roots, work and firmly press the soil among the roots, laying each root in its natural position, no holes or cavities should be left and the soil should be in close contact with the tap root after wa¬ 
tering and it is also very important that no part of the crown or root be left ex¬ 
posed to the air. It is better to plant them an inch or two deeper than they stood in the nursersy than to have the crown roots exposed. 

In Pecan groves low growing crops such as peas, melons potatoes, peanuts, 
cotton, truck etc., may be planted profit¬ 
ably. 

BUDDED AND GRAFTED TREES COMPARED 
WITH SEEDLINGS. 

This covers an important feature of the 
Pecan Industry. Grafted and budded trees have advantage over seedlings be¬ 
cause they usually begin to bear much ear¬ 
lier than seedlings they reproduce the va¬ 
riety from which buds and grafts were taken; perpetuation of the early, heavy and anual bearing of the parent tree is ob¬ 
tained; also greater care and attention usually given them on account of their greater cost. 

As a result of the variable success at¬ 
tending the propogation of Pecans by budding and grafting and the cornpara-

tive slowness of the precesses as com¬ 
pared with the simpler propagation of peaches and plums oranges etc., the trees must necessarily sell at a price which al¬ 
lows a margin to cover great losses in budding and grafting from unfavorable weather such as droughts or excessive rains, another consideration the cost of grafting and budwood, which is a sacri¬ 
fice of nuts from choice bearing trees by the cutting therefrom of scions or bud¬ 
ding wood. Again the disfigurement of seedling trees where buds or grafts fail to take the first season. 

DISAPPOINTMENT. 

There will be many disappointments in 
Pecans to those who have planted the 
“cheapest’’ trees they could buy without investigating source of variety of trees or reliability of party who follows the busi¬ 
ness of selling them. 

Now is it not very plain to all that it is folly for anyone to risk the use of land for years expense of cultivating etc., to save a few cents on a tree, when for a trifling increase in the price he can get the very best warranted stock ? 

Most of the worthless stock is worked off by strange agents, who sell on their own account and are not authorized by any responsible firm to take orders for them. Such men buy up refused stock from large nurseries for almost nothing and fill their orders with it claiming it to be good. They also frequently warrant the stock, but as they the unknown or ir¬ 
responsible, their warranty is absolutely worthless. If people would consider this fact, and buy only from agents who can show a certificate authorizing them to rep- 
resent a respKDnsible firm, there would be less danger of being cheated. 


Our attention has been called to cer¬ 
tain tree peddlers in this State buying seedling Pecan trees that had been graf¬ 
ted but grafts having failed to take new sprouts would naturally come out and make a nice healthy top; such trees being worth about ten to twenty cents, have been sold for grafted stock at $1.00 to 
$1.50 each. 

It will be heart-breaking to those who have planted such trees relying upon them to support them in their old age to find they have been cheated and swindled and all hope of rest and peace in their declin¬ 
ing years vanished. Men will die and leave “Pecan Groves” of this kind to their widows and children—with what result ? 

hogg’s monument 

The accompanying clipping from the daily press dispatches is very significant and means much, not only for Texas, but for the entire country. It shows an ap¬ 
preciation of the value of nut trees by a prominent man who had the welfare of the masses at heart and who chose the time of his departure from earth to im¬ 
press the injunction upon his family and, 
through them, on the public at large. 

“I want no monument of stone,” 
he said, “but let my children plant at the head of my grave a pecan tree and at the foot of my grave a walnut tree, and when these trees shall bear let the pecans and the walnuts be given out among the plain people of Texas, so that they may plant them and make Texas a land of trees.” 

Such a monument will not only perpet¬ 
uate the memory of Gov. Hogg—^gener¬ 
ations to come will share in the beneficial results which will follow the stimulus thus given to the nut growing industry, which is only now beginning to attract the at-

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


teiition it merits from every one who owns a farm or villag'e home. 

Gov. Hogg was a man of wide exper¬ 
ience, a close observer of cause and effect and he doubtless saw in the future of nut growing much to interest him and much of prospective good to his state. We like monuments of this kind, that help others to better lives and more profitable and pleasant surroundings. 

The statement is generally made that the Pecan will succeed wherever the large species of hickory are found in the State, 
and this is doubtless true, as the Pecan belongs to the same family of trees. 

Our experience in a small wa}^ in graft¬ 
ing some of the choice varieties of Pecan on young Hickory has been very satis¬ 
factory, as to the growth, and we trust in 


a few years to be able to make a good re¬ 
port as to our success in getting them to bear fruit. 

In working the jiecan on hickory we find it an advantage to graft under ground and for this reason advise select¬ 
ing the small trees in the forest where a grove may be desired on account of the hickory being plentiful. 

There is no doubt that the Pecan is ex¬ 
tremely hard to work, and only when the budding or grafting is done by an exper¬ 
ienced hand is it likely that good results will be obtained. 

The Pecan will grow on any soil ex¬ 
cept springy boggy land where the water stands near the surface or where the soil is underlaid with ledge rock at a slight depth. 


AN ENTOMOLOGICAL CALENDAR FOR THE PECAN. 


BY H. A. GOSSARD. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The following calendar is approximate¬ 
ly accurate but must be admitted to be in a measure conjectural, because observa¬ 
tions on pecan insects have not yet been sufficiently thorough to make possible an absolutely authoritative schedule. We hope that this imperfect one will stimulate observation and thereby contribute to the making of a perfect one in the near fu¬ 
ture. 

JANUARY. 

The twig girdler is at this time, a lar¬ 
va tunneling in the fallen twigs which were severed in the preceding fall. These 


infested twigs may be gathered and burned. 

Other fallen limbs may contain larvae and pupae of the oak pruner, hence, 
should be collected and burned. 

The larvae and pupae of various borers are in their tunnels in the heart-wood of the trunks. The burrows may be located by the particles of sawdust on the ground and clinging to the bark beneath the ex¬ 
ternal openings; also by the discolored bark below the orifices, caused by the ooz¬ 
ing of the sap. By means of a spring bot¬ 
tom can or in some similar manner, inject bisulphide of carbon or chloroform into the furrows and at once stop the openings

with grafting wax or with a wad of clay mud. 

The larvae and pupae of the hickory shuck worm are in the fallen and decay¬ 
ing hulls beneath the trees, which may be raked up and burned. The larvae and pupae of 'this insect, are known to be jfound in the fallen hulls in December and therefore presume they remain here until early in the summer when new hulls are forming. 

Two or three budworms and case- 
worms are hibernating in small brownish, 
blister-like cocoons and saber-shaped cas¬ 
es on and about the budscales and on the bark of branches. Reasoning from analo¬ 
gy, spraying with the litne-sulphur wash would probably be useful against them. 
Grafts may be cleansed of the cocoons and cases by means of a knife point, before be¬ 
ing used. 

The cottony scale is in the larval form on the branches at this season. The dor¬ 
mant winter period is the time to treat it; 
spray with kerosene emulsion, one part of emulsion to five or six parts of water. 
Pruning can also be effectively used against this pest at this season, the infest¬ 
ed twigs being cut out and burned. 

FEBRUARY. 

Calendar and pratice ditto as for Jan¬ 
uary. 

MARCH. 

Practically the same as for February. 

APRIL. 

Simultaneously with the bursting of the buds in late March and early April, the differgit species of bud worms and case- 
worms commence a most destructive at¬ 
tack. They burrow into the buds and also into the tender twigs. Two of these insects are caseworms, one of them being 


commonly observed and of considerable size, the other being much smaller and finally maturing a case resembling a min¬ 
iature cigar. The thii d species, after quit¬ 
ting the buds, becomes a leaf-roller and lives in a tube made by folding over itself the border of a leaf. Later it gathers a cluster of leaves to the original one, mak¬ 
ing* a conspicuous nest. The larger case- 
worm also clusters leaves together mto a nest and several caterpillars may be found in the same cluster. If these insects can be successfully treated in the same way as the better known budworms and case- 
worms, a spraying with arsenicals should be made while the leaf-buds are swollen, 
just before they burst. A second spray¬ 
ing should be made about a week later than the first, just where the leaf-buds begin to show green at the tips. A third application should be made as soon as the leaves are expanded. Owing to its ad¬ 
hesive qualities, arsenate of lead will doubtless prove more satisfactory for spraying pecans than Paris green. It will be wise to make one of the first two and the third of these sprayings a com¬ 
bination of an arsenite with bordeaux mixture. 

The large, leathery skinned caterpil¬ 
lars of the Catocala moths, sometimes known as “alligator” worms, begin their depredations this month. They feed at night and by day lie concealed in crevices of the bark, or under trash on the ground. 
This protective coloration makes their dis¬ 
covery difficult. Spraying with the ar- 
senites ought to check them. The bud- 
worm spraying will catch these insects also. Right after a rain when the bark is discolored by wetting, the lighter color of the worms renders their detection more easy and it is possible to collect and de¬ 
stroy many by hand. If the trunks are 


I lO 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


kept wrapped with burlap bands, many caterpillars will retreat beneath these for hiding and the next morning they can be 
^ collected and crushed or thrown into a pail containing kerosense and water. If a sticky band of some kind, such a ‘‘tree tangle foot,” made by the O. and W. 
Thum Co. Grand Rapids, Michigan, be put around the trunk below the band to prevent any of the worms passing to the ground, it would seem possible to catch nearly all of them in a very few nights. 
Thus far, we have heard of no complaint that “tree tangle foot” injures the tree. 

In late March and early April, the eggs of the fall webworm are laid on the leaves in clusters of 400 to 500. In a week or ten days, these eggs hatch into very hairy, 
large-headed caterpillars, which always live in webs that are enlarged according to need, where spraying with arsenicals is regularly practiced they are not apt to become numerous, but where no spraying is done, the young nests should be pruned out and burned; or a torch of fat pine, 
attached to a pole, may be held beneath the nest until the worms are destroyed. 

The eggs of the Pecan tree borer, Sesia scitula, are probably laid in April and early May. Since the young borers usu¬ 
ally enter the sapwood through some wound in the bark, such as a graft union, 
all such scars should be well covered at this time with grafting wax with which white arsenic or Paris green has been mixed. Coat over the wax protection with whale oil soap which has been dilut¬ 
ed with enough water to give it the con¬ 
sistency of thick paint. Pour into this soap paint enough crude carbolic acid to give it a strong odor, and apply with a brush at the beginning of a bright, 
sunny day. Before night a tough, sticky film should form which is not readilv dis- 


solved by rain. Any wounds inflicted during the course of cultivation should be at once covered with some such mix¬ 
ture as this. 

» 

MAY. 

All of the species, hatching in April, 
will extend their damage over into May, 
spraying with arsenicals may be continu¬ 
ed against caseworms and caterpillars if the previous treatments were insufflcient. 
Many of the measures already suggested for April work against other insects will need to be continued into May. The moths of the caseworms, bud worms, etc., 
begin to appear in numbers this month and may be started up from their resting places on the leaves, on the trunks, in the mulch at the bases of the trees, etc. 

The different species of heartwood and bark borers are apt to commence egg- 
laying this month, hence it will be wise to keep the trunks and larger limbs cov¬ 
ered with white-wash which may be ap¬ 
plied with a spray pump. ' Some port- 
land cement added to the whitewash will doubtless add to its efficiency, since our object is to fill the interstices of the bark and make a covering over the whole trunk which the young borers cannot penetrate when they emierge from the egg. 
Possibly a further addition of one pound of Paris green or white arsenic to every fifty gallons of the white-wash would be good. t 

During the first half of May, the eggs for the walnut caterpillar are laid on the tender surfaces of the leaves, usually those of the lower branches. These are found in clusters of several hundred and before hatching become of a glistening white color. The young caterpillars feed gregariously and when first observed, the few leaves on which they are found may 


i 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Ill 


be plucked and the whole colony destroy¬ 
ed. At a later stage, spray with arseni- 
cals. 

JUNE. 

The young caterpillars of the bud- 
worms and caseworms are hatching from the eggs and would seem to be amendable to treatment with arsenical sprays. 
Though some of them must extend their bodies out of their encasing tubes to feed, 
and others have in a measure the habits of leaf miners, all consume more or less or the epidermis, hence can possibly be killed with poisons. Continue the work of May against webworms and the wal¬ 
nut caterpillars collect in masses on the trunks of the trees to moult, kill them by means of a burning torch or by crushing. 
A ring of “ tree tangle foot” put around the trunk above the mass before begin¬ 
ning the slaughter will prevent any es¬ 
caping worms from reascending the tree, 
though they may seek other neighboring trees and here continue their develop¬ 
ment, If necessary repeat the white¬ 
washing against the borers so as to keep the coating intact. 

JULY. 

Young caseworms and budworms working on leaves and can likely be check¬ 
ed by spraying with poisons. Because of copious rains in spring it may be found more advantageous to spray for these in¬ 
sects during the drier months of summer and fall. The second • brood of web¬ 
worms may be expected to put in their 


api>earance about this time. It is probably that a second brood of catocalas or “alli¬ 
gator worms” also appear at about this time, since the moths of at least one spe¬ 
cies issue in June and early July. Ex¬ 
amine the white-wash coating on the trunks and renew if necessary. 

AUGUST, SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER. 

Budworms and caseworms continue feeding during August and part of Sep- 
ber, but usually ensconce themselves in winter quarters before October. The whitewash may need renewing in August but this is unlikely if cement was used the preceding application. The second brood of webworms become conspicuous during this period, so also does the sec¬ 
ond brood of walnut caterpillars. The twig girdler is busy in September and 
October laying their eggs and girdling the twigs in which the eggs are laid. 

NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. 

Insects and practice about ditto as given for January and February. 

Inspect the roots carefully to ascertain if root borers are present. If any are found, treat with carbon bisulphide. Fill up all cavities in the trunk with cement, 
first cutting out all rotten wood and singe¬ 
ing the cut surface with a blast lamp to destroy the spores of any rot fungi that may be present. This will do away with a favorite hiding place for hibernating forms, such as the pupoe of the fall web- 
worm.

REPORT ON NUT CULTURE. 

BY C. F. BARBER. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Having been appointed by the Presi¬ 
dent as one of the committee on this im¬ 
portant committee and being satisfied that the question will be thoroughly covered by the other distinguished committeemen 
I shall make my report very short and shall deal with the growing of Pecans and leave the question of the growing of other nuts to the other committeemen. 

I believe that the Pecan is the only nut that can be raised for a profit in the state of Florida and I do not think it ad¬ 
visable to attempt to raise a seedling Pe¬ 
can grove. My observation has been, 
that the bearing qualities are very uncer¬ 
tain. I will not attempt to explain what varieties are best to plant in Florida; 
that part of our report I will leave to the other committeemen. 

Budding and grafting has proven to be very expensive to nurserymen there¬ 
fore, to plant out a grove with budded or grafted Pecans is much more expensive than it would be to plant the same grove with seedlings but the assurance of having trees bearing earlier with chances of a crops of nuts each year will more than pay the difference in putting out the grove. My experience has been far more satisfactory with buds than with graft¬ 
ing. Where a nurseryman has irriga¬ 
tion, I think the grafting has proven to 


be as satisfactory and possibly more so than the budding. Most all land in the state of Florida has proven to be very satisfactory in raising Pecan trees. The low stiff soil with a clay subsoil anywhere from two to five foot seems to be the best land to grow Pecan trees on. Pecan trees will stand most any amount of water on low land without any injury to the trees. 
They will not do much on land that is underlaid with quick sand or land that is better known as sand soaked land. The 
Pecans are usually regarded as a difficult subject to deal with in transplanting; af¬ 
ter they have been transplanted for twelve months and get started to growing then a rapid growth can be put on them each year with the proper attention paid to them. I find that barn-yard compost is the best fertilizer to use around the Pe¬ 
can trees. I raised one year old buds last season on two year old roots that grew five to six foot and some larger. 
Pecan trees should be transplanted in 
December or January to get the most sat¬ 
isfactory results in growing off. I don’t think it advisable to transplant late in the spring after the sap has . started to flow in the stock. My opinion is that it will cause the trees to dwindle and finally die. 
Plant out budded or grafted trees of the best varieties and the results will be sat¬ 
isfactory in years to come.

Report of Standing Committee on Citrus Fruits. 


BY L. B. SKINNER. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

When I was notified of my appoint¬ 
ment as a member of the Committee on 
Citrus fruits, I made up my mind that I 
should surely be there, and even up to to¬ 
day I was of the opinion that I would be there, though there has been creeping in¬ 
to my consciousness, the idea that some thing was going to happen to prevent my getting there after all. 

It is with exceeding great regret that 
I give up the pleasure of meeting the fruit growers of the State from whom I 
always learn something of value, and with whom I always enjoy the time spent. 
I say time spent, but I ought to rather say, 
time saved. The towering practical, Mr. 
Waite, the golden, Mr. McCarty, with his pleasant smile, and hearty ways, the faithful, hard working, Mr. Painter, all these I shall miss. 

I had intended to make a verbal report, 
as I had been unable to get any replies from my fellow committeemen, as to what form our report should take. The wise men from the East, Phelps, Hart, 
Hubbard, have recforded, in time past, 
about all there is to know of orange cul¬ 
ture and perhaps a little more, and we, 
that are learners, would rather sit still and listen that we may learn more, like 
Sampson, or Boardman. Perhaps in the past year I have learned some things that will be interesting to fruit growers. 

I have extensivel}^ used a power duster, 
and I find that it keeps fruit bright, but 
H—8 


it induces scale, and a good deal of it. 
I find that in a multitude of varieties of the orange there is decided trouble. It were better that a good many of these va¬ 
rieties had never been born. 

I hear Parson Brown fruit talked up, 
it is a pretty poor fruit to my notion, and 
Marsh Seedless grapefruit, be sure you want it before you plant it. There is none better than the Duncan Grapefruit, but 
I am afraid that there has been a large quantity of buds, not accurate to name, 
of this variety sent out. Not intention¬ 
ally, but by error, and I suppose that tli - 
often happens, in other cases too. It is disappointing to plant Tardiffs, and find that you are going to reap Sweet Sevilles, 
or Parson Browns, and find you have an ordinary seedling. 

The Enterprise seedless orange, some- 
• times called Stark Seedless, is one of the best bearers, and of a very good quality, 
of the ordinary oranges, and commercial¬ 
ly, has given me the best of results. 

I have been interested in the compari¬ 
son of the Valencia and the Tardiff or¬ 
anges. I thought for a long time that they were one and the same variety, but under a different name. I find upon look¬ 
ing them carefully over, that they are really distinct. That they are different in several ways. The Valencia is of a deeper color, less of the lemon in color. 
Then too the inside of the fruit is better colored than the Tardiff. On the other hand I think that the Tardiff is the better

keeper, both as to season, that is time of shipping, and as to its ability tO' hold up en route. And as to keeping qualities the fruit en route, that remark opens up to me the one question that occupies my thinker these days to the exclusion of any other. 
How shall we make our fruit keep and 

cari*v better? What is the reason of the 

•/ 

epidemics of rot such as attacked us at times the last two years ? If I knew, and could answer these questions aright, you would have a paper worth your listening to. I would like to ask your agricultural chemists what effect nitrate of potash would have on the stability of fruit? I 
think from a test made for two years that it is decidedly favorable to the keeping quality. I would like to ask some of the professors whether paraffine would tend to keep the fruit from rotting. 

I would like to ask whether, in the opinion of growers, late cultivation tends to make fruit rot in transit? 

The markets are all practically done with Florida citrus fruits, and yet we could just as well grow enough Tardiffs to keep them supplied for six weeks yet. 
Suppose there is some waste, what of it,* 
we can stand it. And grapefruit—I ate 


grapefruit in July last year from off the tree that was the finest thing I ever ate on a hot day in my life. I expect to eat it again this year, and if we can get a grape¬ 
fruit in April, May and June, I am willing to risk its selling at a paying price. 

I believe the variety to be a distinct va¬ 
riety, but will know better when it is test¬ 
ed longer. We ought to ship citrus fruits from October to June continuously, and when we do, the fruit industry need fear no competition. 

James Russell Lowell has an eleventh 
Beautitude “Blessed is he that has noth¬ 
ing to say and cannot be persuaded to say it.’’ I am reminded that I would rather work at growing oranges than talk about it. I grow a considerable quan¬ 
tity of fruit, and some of it is the best 
I ever saw and some of it is the worst, I 
am sorry to say. I know a very little, I 
am hoping to learn a great deal more, and again I want to express my regret at not being able to be with you. I wish you a vei*y interesting and profitable meeting. 
I know that vour officers have been untir- 
ing in their efforts at the proper prepara¬ 
tions for such a meeting. 


Report of the Committee on Strawberries. 


BY R. F. 

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Strawberries are now one of Florida’s staple crops and brings in to the State each year many thousands of dollars, and at a time of the year when there is not very much other fruit to be had. 

The soil best adapted to the growth is a dark sandy loam, underlaid with clay,—if it can be had—if not, any piece of good lowland that can be well drained. 

The best varieties as to flavor and ship¬ 
ping qualities, as far as I have tested, are 
Klondike, Hofman, Improved, Lady 
ITmpson and Excelsior. 

The yield per acre is, with a fair sea¬ 
son, about five thousand quarts, if you have home grown acclimated plants, and al)out three thousand quarts if you have to get northern grown plants. 

Method of culture.—First, the land should be plowed from eight to twelve inches deep and then well pulverized be¬ 
fore being bedded, which should be done at least four weeks before setting of plants, 


BY R. K. 

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I regret exceedingly that I will not be able to be present this year. In for¬ 
mer years I told the society all I knew about strawberries. The only new thing 
I know of is the time of planting, this should be done in spring instead of fall and the plants worked all through sum¬ 
mer. This will insure large plants and

as well selected ground gives a greater assurance of a good stand of plants and they will grow off more quickly and more thriftily. 

The plants should be cultivated after each rain very shallow, about one half to one inch deep. 

Method of marketing.—The best and safest way to get berries to market is in ice boxes containing sixty four quarts each as they will arrive in the market three days after as fresh as the day that they were picked. 

The growth and extent of culture has l)een very much checked by the rates that the express companies have placed on car¬ 
rying berries to market. 

Draw backs are many. — Drought, 
freezes and late frosts are all very much against the berry grower, but the worst of all is the express company in their charges to carry berries to market, and at tlie end the commission men keep the rest and send back for charges.

about four times if not ten times the yield. 
I have tried it with the best results but the cultivating through the summer costs 

o 

money. 

The difficulty of getting plants is another difficulty but they can be got at almost all the northern nurseries, and when planted then the northern grown plants do very well. 





Report of the Committee on Vegetables. 


% 


BY W. N. GIST. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I cannot in this paper, convey to your minds a comprehensive idea of the vege¬ 
table industry of the State. It is varied. 
It is a deep subject calling forth much energy and “gray” matter, and let me accent the latter if the grower wishes to be successful. It calls for as much care, 
thought and energy as the raising of chil¬ 
dren of which we expect to make men and women of the highest types; that may be an honor to the community in which they may be cast. 

The vegetable industry is too varied to be discussed fully here at this time, but 
I may say that it is one of the moneyed industries and possibly would be pardon¬ 
ed for saying that it now brings more dollars into the State than the orange crop. The movement of truck (you know we grow truck and ship stuff), 
commencing in November and continues until July, giving nine month’s shipping season for the State; some part of the 
State having suff that is wanted by the 


man who has the dollars; all through this period, and the market demand for all our produce is increasing. Twelve years ago the growers around Gainesville would not have thought of shipping a carload of lettuce to New York at one time, now that market can take care of a trainload at paying prices and I might mention other crops, for instance, what effect would Hasting’s potato crop have had on the market even five years ago. 

The demand has increased and also the means of distributing, and I might say this part of the business has been seriously neglected. It should be a busi¬ 
ness separate from the growing. The growing and packing is a job big enough for one man, but nearly every trucker thinks (and I’m one of them myself) he can ship his stuff to better advantage than the man who keeps up with that end and makes it a business, giving his entire time and attention to distributing. 

There is money in the business! There is also sleepless nights and gray hair to the one who falls a victim. 



The Geology of Florida in Relation to Artesian 

Water Supply. 


BY DR. E. H. SELLARDS. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In its general geology Florida is fortu¬ 
nately of comparatively simple structure. 
Tlie formation^ of the state have suffered no great distortion since their deposition and lie for the most part nearly horizon¬ 
tal as formed, or with a slightly accentu¬ 
ated dip. For a clear understanding of the water supply problem a conception of the leading features of the geology of the state is essential. 

The underlying foundation rock throughout the state is a massive and very thick limestone. In character the limestone is granular, soft and with many shells, and, for the most part porous. 
Borings indicate that water circulates freely through it. The conditions of for¬ 
mation, as indicated by 'the rock itself, 
were, clear water free from land sedi¬ 
ment in which shell life flourished abund¬ 
antly. This foundation limestone is com¬ 
monly known as the Vicksburg limestone, 
or in recent years the Peninsula lime¬ 
stone. This formation we may expect to encounter by borings in all parts of the state. Beyond the coast line the forma¬ 
tion is known to extend to Costa Rica, 
a'nd there is no reason to doubt that it extends to the east into the Atlantic and to the west into the gulf basin much beyond' the present Florida coast, and 


is the one formation that is of uni¬ 
versal distribution throughout the state lying at the surface in small areas, 
but for the most part buried at slight to considerable depth beneath later rock deposits. The peninsula limestone is ex¬ 
posed at the surface except for a more or less thick covering of sand in local areas throughout Marion, Alachua, south¬ 
ern Columbia, and Suwannee Counties. 
In other parts of the State it is covered by later formations, indicating that while most of the state remained somewhat longer under water, the areas named appeared as islands at the close of the for¬ 
mation of the peninsula limestone. 

On top of the peninsula limestone around 'these islands and throughout the state in general there accumulated subse¬ 
quent marine deposits some of them of considerable thickness. These later for¬ 
mations are, however, more or less local in character and while reaching a consid¬ 
erable thickness in parts of the state no one of them extends unintermptedly through¬ 
out the state as a whole. Immediate¬ 
ly following the peninsular limestone in the central part of the state is the Ocala limestone, best exposed at the lime kiln at 
Ocala where‘it is something more than twenty feet deep. The Chattahoochee limestone is perhaps a little later than the 
Ocala and occurs along the Appalachaco- 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Il8 

la river. The Tampa Silex beds and 
Tampa Limestone are seen at Ballast 
Point, Tampa. Another thin formation, 
the White Beach is exposed along little 
Sarasota Bay. These several local for¬ 
mations are included along with the pen¬ 
insular limestone to make up what is known in the more recent classification as the Oligocene of Florida. The rocks of these several local formations taken to¬ 
gether make up the surface rocks, except for the mantle of sand over a very consid¬ 
erable area of the central and western part of the state. 

The Micoene next above has an increas¬ 
ed proportion of clay and shales along with some limestone and sandstone. The prin¬ 
cipal area of Micoene extends along the 
East Coast from Jacksonville to Lake 
Worth or l^elow, and reaches in some lo- 
calaties a thickness of five hunderd feet. 
The same time interval is represented by a thinner deposit along the Appalacha- 
cola river and west of the river towards 
Pensacola. 

Formations of still later date cover the extreme south of the state and local areas throughout the istate in general. 

The Florida deposits are all among the more recent of the geology time divisions, 
all falling within the Cenozoic or last of the large time divisions. The state as a whole lies entirely within and is a part of the general coastal plains deposits reaching from New Jersey on the north along the Atlantic coast to the Gulf, and west to Texas, embracing as a whole a strip varying in width, but averaging about loo miles along the coast covering the eastern part of New Jersey, Delaware, 
Maryland, Virginia, North and South 
Carolina, Georgia, all of Florida, much of the southern part of Alabama, Mississippi, 


Louisiana and Texas. The formations of the coastal plains area as a whole are se¬ 
dimentary containing much clay and shales and sandstones, lying nearly hori¬ 
zontal or with but slig^^t dip. The sedi¬ 
ment forming these deposits came evi¬ 
dently from higher lands to the north and west. 

Owing to the fact that Florida, especial¬ 
ly peninsula Florida, was farther remov¬ 
ed from the source of sediment the pro¬ 
portion of wash from the land was very much less, and in the resulting seas an abundant shell life was able to develope. 
It thus happens that Florida is exception¬ 
al among the other gulf states in the large proportion of limestone it contains. 

As will be gathered from this brief re¬ 
view the Florida peninsula has been ele¬ 
vated above water slowly. That the up¬ 
lifting began at the close of the formation of the peninsular limestone is evidenced by the appearance of the island areas at that time. That the further elevation was also gradual and slow is indicated by the successive deposits of later formations around the island areas. It is assumed that the slow upward pushing has brought the peninusla up as a large anticlinal fold with the highest part of the fold forming' 
the central area of the peninsula. Actual observation of anticlinal structure from the rocks themselves is difficult owing to the mantle of sand covering, and the lim¬ 
ited exposures of rock. That there is a dip, however, is indicated by the depth at which any recognizable formation is en¬ 
countered in borings. Thus the peninsu¬ 
lar limestone which is found at the sur¬ 
face in Alachua or southern Columbia county is encountered in wells at St. Au¬ 
gustine at a depth of 224 feet. Farther to the south along the coast an even greaL 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


er thickness of later formations rest on the peninsular limestone. At Lake Worth the limestone is reported at a depth of looo feet. A dip to the south is likewise indicated from the fact that the peninsu¬ 
la limestone in that direction dips under later formations towards Tampa and the 
Manatee region. 

The features of the peninsula area 
1>earing most directly on the question of underground waters are as follows: The 
Florida peninsula has as its sub-forma¬ 
tion a porous cavernous limestone. On top of this is a varying thickness of sedi¬ 
mentary rocks of alternate pervious and imi>ervious layers, limestone, shale, clay and sand horizons, and that these hori¬ 
zons dip in general to the east, south, and west from the central area. 

Artesian supply: Artesian water is properly water confined and under pres¬ 
sure, usually pressure of its own weight, 
so that when the stratum containing it is tapped the water will rise in the opening thus made. 

Artesian flow occurs when the head is sufflcient to cause the rise of water to and above the surface level of the mouth of the well. 

The conditions necessary to bring about artesian water may be grouped for brevity under three heads as follows: 

Dip of the strata. 

Alternating impervious and pervious strata. 

Some condition or combination of con¬ 
ditions bringing the water under sufficient pressure to supply the necessary head. 

This latter condition may result from the sagging of a series of these strata at the middle allowing the edge to be expos¬ 
ed at either side, so that the water will flow at any point lower than the exposed 


119 

area of the horizon. Such a trough like structure is an artesian basin. The same result may be brought quite as effectively by an inclined porous stratum wedging out between two impervious strata, or by the pervious straum itself grading into an impervious or less pervious condition, 
as a sandstone grading into a finer iSand- 
stone, or a sandstone grading into a shale. 
Even a local variation in the thickness or texture of the containing stratum may re¬ 
sult in considerable head. The friction of water threading its way long distances through the pores of a pervious formation affords sufficient head for an appreciable rise of water through a.boring. (Cham¬ 
berlin, 5th An. Rpt. U. S. G. S., p. 143). 

The term, artesian slope is applied to such an area. It is apparent that the pressure of the Florida artesian water is explained by artesian slope rather than an artesian basin. 3 

The dip of the Florida formations whatever may have iDeen its cause furni¬ 
shes the first of the essential structural features of artesian water accumulation. 
The second condition necessary, the al¬ 
ternating impervious and pervious strata, 
is met in the varied nature of the Florida deposits in which water tight clays and shales are often succeeded by porous and water bearing* limestones and sand¬ 
stones. The head necessary to induce ar¬ 
tesian flow is doubtless due to pinching out of strata or change to fine texture of the water carrying layer. 

Source of artesian water: 

The catchment area. 

The general gathering ground for the artesian water of the coast is naturally the interior region of the State. Of the rain¬ 
fall of an area a part is evaporated and re¬ 
turned to the atmosphere; another part is carried off immediately to the ocean as

surface drainage; while a third part finds its way into the ground. 

Owing to the generally porous nature of the Florida formation, that part of the annual rainfall going directly into the ground is an unusually high percentage. 
While the part passing off as surface drainage is a correspondingly small part of the annual rainfall. 

It is not to ])e assumed, however, that all of that which passes into the earth is available again as artesian supply. The amount of water reaching the surface through an artesian well is necessarily less than that entering the ground, owing to friction in flow, to lack of completely pervious strata above and below and ow¬ 
ing to the evident fact that there is in all cases sources of escape for the water through channels other than the artesian wells. 

The area covered by the outcrop of any horizon will vary according to the thick¬ 
ness of the horizon, the topography of the area at which the outcrop occurs, and the dip of the strata. The dip of the Florida rocks is slight and the catchment area for any collecting horizon is therefore propor¬ 
tionately large. 

In addition to this usual or normal catchment area an added supply in some cases, probably of considerable importance is received from sinks reaching through to the conducting horizon. 

Of the great number of sinks through¬ 
out the State receiving regularly surface drainage many evidently reach no great distance downwards and the water after a more or less extended underground course reaches a river or otherwise re¬ 
turns to the surface. On the other hand it is equally evident that some of these 


sinks are waterways leading through, im¬ 
pervious strata and connecting with por¬ 
ous horizons, below which conduct water readily and are capable of becoming ar¬ 
tesian horizons Thus if the water of a sink is observed to rise to a definite level and to be unaffected by any amount of water going into it, and especially if the level of the water in the sink is found to agree practically with the level to which artesion water rises in borings in the im¬ 
mediate locality it becomes evident that the sink leads to the artesian horizon. The added supply of artesian water received through such sinks is doubtless very con¬ 
siderable. 

In this connection should be mentioned also a second unused artesian supply, 
namely the drainage of inland areas through deep borings. As is well known this plan of drainage involves sinking bor¬ 
ings to such depth as to encounter a con¬ 
ducting stratum which carries the water readily . Obviously the probabilities are that the water is thus being turned into a horizon capable of becoming an artesian supply horizon in some lower area of the 
State. Some such wells are recorded in which the water is turned directly into an artesian stratum, the artesian water ris¬ 
ing in fact within a few feet of the sur¬ 
face. Some of these wells present the un¬ 
ique feature of being, during wet weath¬ 
er drainage wells, and during dry weath¬ 
er, through the medium of pumps, irriga¬ 
tion wells. In these cases it is impossible from the data now at hand to affirm that the water thus added is available as an addition to the artesian supply at any nearby region of lower level having ar¬ 
tesian flow, but the inferences are very strong that the artesian supply is directly increased in this way.

Available supply of artesian water: 

Fortunately Florida with its heavy rainfall and with its formations especi¬ 
ally adapted for taking up and holding a store of water is subject to an annually added supply not likely to be over drawn. 
It must not be supposed, however, that 


more water can be taken from the arte¬ 
sian horizon than enters it. On the con¬ 
trary the supply avaliable is neccesarily much less than the supply received. For¬ 
tunately the rainfall is sufficient to assure an underground water supply among the 
States most valuable assets. 


Florida Immigration—What Shall It Be? 


ti 

BY CAPT. R. E. ROSE^ 

STATE CHEMIST. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The subject assigned to me, “Florida 
Immigration, What Shall it Be?’’ is one that is not commanding much attention, 
not only in Florida, but throughout the entire South. We have recently had several conventions of representative men on the subject: Seldom do we have a gathering, or convention of any kind, 
agricultural commissioners, cane growers, 
turpentine producers, timber men, saw mill men, railroad men, ticket agents, 
traffic managers, farmers, cattle growers, 
agriculturists or horticulturists, but the subject of Immigration “crops out in one shape or another. 

In fact, the Southern States have agi¬ 
tated this question of Immigration—For¬ 
eign Immigration—to a very consider¬ 
able extent during the past few years, 
much has been said upon the subject, 
numerous plans have been proposed to turn the tide of foreign immigration, 
from the West, to the South. The estab¬ 
lishment of direct lines of immigrant ships, from Southern ports to Europe; 
with agents of the Southern States estab¬ 
lished in foreign countries, to secure im¬ 
migrants, is probably the most popular plan suggested. To avoid the “contract labor laws,” the States are asked to do ivhat the citizen (or corporation), is pro¬ 
hibited from doing; and also to tax the people of the State, to secure cheaper 


labor, to compete with the working men of the State. 

Florida, I am glad to say, has not be¬ 
come hysterical, or anxious, in this mat¬ 
ter. She has displayed no great haste to receive the influx of foreign immi¬ 
grants—Japanese, Italians or Chinamen, 
so ardently desired, and earnestly advo¬ 
cated, bv some of our sister States— 
urged on by Land Syndicates—mining and manufacturing corporations, desiring to secure cheaper, and more servile labor, 
than is now obtained in the South, out¬ 
side the cities. 

While the phenomenal development of the South, during the past decade, along all lines of industry, agriculture, mining, 
manufacture and transportation, has created a large demand for labor, and has largely increased the wages of our working people, it is questionable if it be for the best interests of the South, and particularly Florida, to encourage foreign immigration. 

The South is now the only distinctly 
American section of the Union; where the traditions, habits, prejudices, virtues and vices; courage, chivalry, indepen¬ 
dence and love of freedom so characteris¬ 
tic of the early settler or pioneer, can be found in its purity. Where the true 
American character, begat by the “pio¬ 
neer,” “Puritan,” and “cavalier,” can still be found. The descendants of those ad¬ 
venturous men and women, who at their

own cost of deprivation and hardship, es¬ 
tablished the original thirteen colonies, 
on the Atlantic Sea Board; who first oc¬ 
cupied the land, drove back the Indian; 
threw off the yoke of the old country—• 
with its limitations, political and relig¬ 
ious, to establish a Republic of Freemen, 
where liberty in its truest, sense should prevail. 

The true American type—we certainly have such a type—is now found princi¬ 
pally south of “Mason and Dixon’s Line” 
—In the South Atlantic, and Gulf States; 
and is most strongly marked in the rural districts of the cotton growing States; 
particularly in Florida, where most of our people can trace their lineage, direct¬ 
ly to the founders of the Republic, with little if any admixture of foreign blood— 
Descendants of those grand old pioneers 
—rugged, capable, stubborn, courageous and honest, who lone handed, and by mere force of character, conquered the wilderness, as an heritage for their chil¬ 
dren, and children’s children. 

The descendants of whom fought the bloodiest war of modern times, to preserve the constitutional liberties of the Republic founded by their fathers. Those fathers, 
who by their sacrifices, made it possible for the foreign immigrant to flock to the 
States—the North and West—after the establishment of religious and political liberty, by our Revolutionary ancestors. 

Florida has had a large increase of population, during the past fifteen years; 
she has increased from 391,000 to 620,- 
000—a little more than 58 per cent.— 
From 1890 to 1900, she increased 35 per cent. (391,000 to 528,000). The States’s census taken last year, now being com¬ 
pleted, will show a greater proportionate increase. 

Florida gained a larger percentage of 


population, than any other Atlantic State, 
during the last United States census per¬ 
iod; namely, 35 per cent. She exceeded the average of all the groups of States— 
that is the North Atlantic group—20.90 
per cent. The South Atlantic, 17.90 per cent.; the North Central, 17.50 per cent.; 
the South Central, 26.10 per cent., and the Western Division, 31.90 per cent. 

Her percentage of increase in popula¬ 
tion was exceeded only, by Arizona, 
Idaho, Indian Territory, Montana, North 
Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington, 
and Wyoming, from 1890 to 1900; while the indications are that her increase for the present decade will be far greater in proportion.

Our State census of 1905, will show a total of 62,000 approximately. 

The most remarkable feature of Flori¬ 
da’s population is the very large per¬ 
centage of native born Americans; par¬ 
ticularly natives of the Southern States— 
notably from the States of Georgia. 
South Carolina, Alabama and North 
Carolina.

All the other States and territories are represented in Florida’s population, 
though the above list embraces all States that have 1,000 or more representatives in our population. 

What I desire particularly to empha¬ 
size—is that Florida has had a greater proportionate increase in population than any other State, except the few Northern 
States mentioned previously, that have been filled up by foreign immigrants; 
exploited by the railroads and immigrant ships—for simply “business reasons.” 
The “Foreign Immigrant” is exploited 
Ijy the “Immigrant Ship” and railroad like any other commercial commodity. 
Lumber, merchandise, beef, or pork; cat¬ 
tle or hogs. And were it not for the laws prohibiting individuals (or corpora¬ 
tions), importing contract labor, the ques¬ 
tion of foreign immigration would be solved at once by the importation of mil¬ 
lions of coolies—not Chinamen, Japanese or Malays necessarily, but millions of 
“Redemptioners,” from all parts of 
Europe, who would be sold for a term of years, to those desiring labor, miners, 
manufacturers, planters, saw mill and turpentine operators, for simply enough to pay their passage and a profit to the transportation lines, as was done during the early years of the last century. 

Another remarkable feature of Flori¬ 
da’s population—not only the great pre¬ 
ponderance of American born citizens, is the great number of native born children; 
a population of 528,000 in igoo—shows 
270,293 children, or youths less than 20; 
197,600 of school age; and 72,693 less than four years old, more than half of our 


population. Such facts are potent argu¬ 
ments against foreign immigrants, par¬ 
ticularly when we know that thousands of our best American citizens are now seeking homes in the State. That this domestic immigration is rapidly increas¬ 
ing is patent to any one who is noting the rapid filling up of the whole State. 
I think the State census of 1905 will surprise many of our peole, when the increase of population is noted, particu¬ 
larly the natural increase. Race suicide can by no means be charged against 
Florida, where over one-half of the popu¬ 
lation are school children, or younger. 

That Florida needs, or can comfort¬ 
ably care for—more people, is true; that she is obtaining them more rapidly than any other Atlantic State, is also true; 
that by natural increase and by American immigration—men and women from the 
Southeastern States particularly, she is rapidly filling up the vacant places is also true. 

Speaking of vacant lands. United 
States lands, I desire to call your at¬ 
tention to the fact that there is compar¬ 
atively little vacant land. State or United 
States, remaining. The State has little left, no homestead lands at all, and has claims against what remains unallotted of some four millions of acres more than she has to meet the claims with. 

United States homesteads are being rapidly exhausted. Most of the desirable homesteads are now occupied. The re¬ 
cent “Stone and Timber acts” are rapidly absorbing the remainder of the United 
States lands. Ninety per cent, of the public domain has passed into the pos¬ 
session of individuals, syndicates and corporations, during the past twenty years. Not only in this, but in other 
States. 












FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

Though Florida had probably a greater acreage of State lands than any other 
State, except Texas, some twenty-seven million acres, more or less, practically five-sevenths of all the land in the State— 
less than twenty-five years ago, she to¬ 
day is practically bankrupt in her landed possessions, and has claims against her for millions of acres more than she has to meet the claims with. 

At a recent convention held in the 
Southern part of the State, the statement was made by several gentlemen; men well-informed and familiar with condi¬ 
tions; that one of the principal reasons why young men were flocking to the cit¬ 
ies, was that lands for homes could not be purchased. This was not denied, 
though repeated by several members, and in the presence of representatives of sev¬ 
eral of the larger Land Syndicates. 

Our public domain—once the boast of our State and Nation—has dwindled until now it is difficult for a young American to find 160 acres to homestead. We have parted with our heritage, our vast domain of productive soil—our own chil¬ 
dren—to say nothing of the foreign im¬ 
migrant—are left without homes, to be¬ 
come the ‘‘bond servants” or “tenant far¬ 
mer” of land syndicates, corporations or trust magnates. 

Do we need immigrants? Yes; Ameri¬ 
can immigrants; particularly from the 
Southeastern State—men who will own their own homes; maintain the true 
American spirit, a love of liberty, and per¬ 
sonal independence. Such men as were recently alluded to by Judge Emory 
Spear—in charging a jury in a noted criminal case that has commanded inter¬ 
national attention during the past seven years—in charging, the Judge said, “I 
am told that is has been cynically said by 


a famous New Yorker that no man who has a million dollars can be convicted of crime in America. The verdict of this jury of plain, clear-sighted, honest Ameri¬ 
cans has falsified such a pessimism. Of that jury it may be said that there is per-- 
haps not a man who cannot trace his an¬ 
cestry to a patriot of the Revolution which established American independence. It is true, as I have often declared, that to the homogeneous Americanism of these 
Southern States when they are plainly shown their duty, our country may ever look with confidence for the enforcement of its laws and for the maintenance of its institutions.” 

True they will have to purchase their lands—and pay several thousand per cent, 
profit to the present owners; and in a few years, find it difficult if not impos¬ 
sible, to obtain a free hold, by purchase or otherwise. 

Doubtless, some of my auditors will consider me an alarmist, and believe my picture overdrawn; let me assure them such is not the case. When but a few years ago—less than twenty—the foreign emigrant, or the native born young 
American—had tens of thousands of homesteads, from which to select his one hundred and sixty acres; he has today but few to choose from, they-are remote, 
scattered and not desirable, having but little agricultural value. 

While our public domain has to a large extent disappeared, foreign immigration has increased until it has attracted the serious attention of thoughtful Ameri¬ 
cans. I quote a recent editorial from the 
“Miami Metropolis,” one of the most conservative of our Florida newspapers: 

“Foreign immigrants are pouring into 
Eastern ports in such large numbers the 
Department of Labor and Commerce has 









126 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


l:)ecoine apprehensive and has determined to more strictly enforce the regulations for the restriction of immigration.” 

This is a country of vast territory, and its assimilative powers are very great, 
but there should be some limit to the in¬ 
flux of foreigners and the crowding of our cities with a population which seriously adds to the gravity of problems that are pressing more and more for so¬ 
lution. The stream of foreigners is not sufliciently distributed. Too few become soil tillers and producers. It can be easily understood wh}^ this country is so attrac¬ 
tive to the poor of overcrowded Europe, 
and quick and cheap transportation makes it comparatively easy for them to seek homes. In 1900 there were 10,460,000 
people of foreign birth in this country, 
and over 21,000,000 born of foreign parentage. About 35 per cent, of the total population is wholly or partially of foreign parentage. 

Of the foreign-born population, 94 per cent, is resident in the North, and 6 per cent, in the South. In 1900 the total foreign-born population of Allegheny, 
Pa., was, in round numbers, 30,000; in 
Atlanta, it was 2,500; in Charleston, S. 
C., it was 2,500, and 12,000 in Colum¬ 
bus, Ohio. In Louisville, it was 21,000 
and in Lowell, 40,000; in Memphis, it was 5,000, and in Minneapolis, 61,000. 
In Worcester, Mass., it was 37,000; in 
Rochester, N. Y., it was 40,000; in Provi¬ 
dence, R. I., it was 55,000, and 46,000, 
in St. Paul. In New York City there were 786,000 persons of German parent- 
age, 715,000 of Irish parentage, 245,000 
of Russian, 218,000 of Italian, 53,000 of 
Polish and 52,000 of Hungarian. A con¬ 
siderable per cent, of the total population is German and Irish. 

These, as a rule, make excellent citi¬ 


zens, and become thoroughly imbued with x\merican methods and ideals. But there are millions of immigrants who are not desirable as citizens; and even a large inpouring of foreigners who may make good citizens is not wholly unobjection¬ 
able. Through immigration and natural increase the country is being rapidly filled, 
and. when it becomes crowded, as it will, 
it means a change of conditions—from the free and easy methods of living char¬ 
acteristic of Americans, to the close econ¬ 
omy and hard life of the crowded coun¬ 
tries of the old world and labor will be cheaper and the cost of living greater.” 

That I am not alone in my position, 
I quote the language of that typical Amer¬ 
ican citizen, Theodore Roosevelt—that representative American the descendant of the Dutch Founders of Manhattan on the one side, and an equally noted South¬ 
ern family on the other; in an address to the representatives of Organized Ameri¬ 
can Labor, at the White House, on 
March 21, speaking of immigration, he said: 

“You have spoken of the im«iigration laws. I believe not merely that all pos¬ 
sible steps should be taken to prevent the importation of laborers under any form, 
but I believe further that this country ought to make a resolute effort from now on to prevent the coming to the country of men with a standard of living so low that they tend, by entering into unfair competition with, to reduce the standard of living of our own people. Not one of you can go further than I will go in the effort steadily to raise the status of the 
American Wage Worker, so long as, 
while doing it, I can retain a clear con¬ 
science and the certainty that I am doing what is right. I will do all in my power for the laboring men except to do what 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


127 


is wrong; and I will not do that for him or for any one else.” 

“We must not let our natural sentiment for succoring the oppressed and unfor¬ 
tunate of other lands lead us into what warped moral and mental attitude of try¬ 
ing to succor them at the expense of pull¬ 
ing down our own people. Laws should be enacted to keep out all immigrants who do not show that they have the right stuff in them to enter into our life on terms of decent equality with our own citizens. This is indeed first in the in¬ 
terests of the laboring man, but further¬ 
more in the interests of all of us as Ameri¬ 
can citizens; for gentlemen, the bonds 


that unite all good American citizens are stronger by far than the differences, 
which I think you accentuate altogether too much, between the men who do one kind of labor and the men who do another kind. As for immigrants, we cannot have too many of the right kind; and we should have none at all of the wrong kind; and they are of the right kind if we can be fairly sure that their children and grandchildren can meet on terms of equality our children and grandchildren, 
so as to try to be decent citizens together, 
and to work together for the uplifting of the Republic.”

Report of Standing Committee on Ornamentals. 


BY MRS. GEO S. GATES. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Those of us who have borne the heat and burden of the day, those of us who have been twenty years in Florida, and are thus entitled to the name of “Old 
Settler,” are beginning to rejoice because of the real prosperity that is everywhere showing up over our fair State—at last the time has come when we also have green lawns, ornamental grounds and good roads. 

These years of experience have taught us valuable lessons, these lessons are tab¬ 
ulated and crystalized into records and into great nurseries of thrifty stock, avail¬ 
able for all kind of horticultural purposes. 
So now, the wayfaring man, though a 
“Yankee,” need not err. We are greatly indebted to the State Horticultural Socie¬ 
ty for a large mass of these records, and we should all more earnestly work for a broader field of usefulness for this society. 

For from the soil must ever come the sound, healthy prosperity of any State. 
As the spring is with us still, we must express the joy we have felt from her very first appearance, in the fragrant buds of the Yellow Jessamine, to the present pageant now waving about us in the waxy bloom of the great Magnolia. 
We have secured much pleasure by avail¬ 
ing ourselves of the simple plants within eas}^ reach. In December we secured many roots of the Yellow Jessamine— 
planted some about old stumps and some 


on posts, and it is perfect for old fences and arbors. By March, we had some bloom, and the second year, with care and fertilizer a mass of new growth and blossoms—and I know no miser ever had more joy with his gold, than we, with our mass of golden fragrant bloom. 

The wild plum is the next to bloom— 
about the middle of February. It does not bring a few blossoms, here and there, 
but great wreaths, bunches and banks of snowy bloom. One can go out and cut great armfulls of feathery blossoms, and fill the house with the very spirit of spring—and one is exalted with that spirit as they pass and repass; those great gnarled branches, that speak of greater life and peace and hope—crowd halls and dark corners with these fleeting joys. 
The gentle Japanese make the Cherry blossom time the happiest festival of the year. So do all lovers of nature—the pear tree is a marvel just after the plum, and so full of blossoms are all fruit trees, that I 
feel sure, Nature means that we are to enjoy her blooms, as well as her fruits— 
she is never stingy—if you ever dare think it of her, look at the spring-time blos¬ 
soms; and learn there the wonderful les¬ 
son of the large, full glorious develop¬ 
ment that is certainly in common with all 
Nature. Let me plead for the arrange¬ 
ment of blossoms when we bring them indoors—for the busy housewife gets the most of her enjoyment from her cut flow¬ 
ers. Don’t crowd several kinds in the 



129

same holder. A perfect rose; a perfect branch of blossoms have as strong and re¬ 
freshing an individuality as have our human friends, and they repay us as gracefully for respecting it, as they do. 
Next to bloom is the pink Azalea, or Wild 
Honeysuckle, as it is called all along the 
Atlantic States—simply delightful in a great mass—grown ten or twelve feet in low land, but with care, a thrifty bush on high land. The same can be said of the Dogwood Lily of the Valley tree, 
Spirea, or Bridal Wreath, the Oleander, 
Cape Jessamine, Crape Myrtle, and the 
Sweet Myrtle. These are all fragrant, 
hardy and close at hand. We find 
December planting most satisfactory for trees and shrubbery. We have had the best success in planting .Oleanders, by getting a stake about two feet long, stiff enough to drive, sharpen it at one end and drive into the ground just where you want it to grow, leaving out two or three eyes or buds, they will put out from them and you have a tree at once. 

I want to recall Mr. Taber’s paper of last year, to your mind. It is well worth another reading. It was about the joys of a thicket, he called it, “A Message from the Woods.” I saw the thicket be¬ 
fore I read the message, and I felt then, 
that every Nature-lover had just some such spot—I have. It is a human instinct to keep a bit of nature’s work close at hand, from whence can be drawn inspir¬ 
ation, strength and hope. 

It may be a bit of pond, full of gleam¬ 
ing white lilies, or a bit of virgin forest in its strength and grandure, or a thicket full of the riotous profusion of trees, 
shrub and vine, that in its blending of shape and shade, is the despair of all our timid efforts. Let me suggest the greater planting of the Wistaria, both 


white and purple, there again the Japan¬ 
ese have produced wonderful effects, their arbors are simply dreams. You do not realize you are looking at anything man has done, it looks like magic. Some of the flower stems are three feet long, and hang above the head like a purple and white sky. It will grow rampant here, 
even with little care—of course it is not as early as the plum, or as evergreen as the Yellow Jassamine, which I heartily recommend—the Wistaria blooms in early April and the Jessamine in early 
February, both are valuable for wiring to scrawny tall trees, and for covering unsightly objects. But chief among vines in this land of “Creepers,"” is the wild 
Smilax, or Bamboo Briar, as it is called here. I spoke of this vine last year, and wish to call your attention to it again. 
I have found four varieties, a plain green one, and a variegated one without thorns and mostly roots, they are worthless, 
never grow more than six or eight feet, 
then there is a strong rampant growing one with briars, and covered with black¬ 
berries in the fall, ornamental, but cruel. 
But the bamboo, or Wild Smilax, that is shipped from the entire South, for decorating along with Holly, Palm leaves, gray moss, long leaf pine, etc., is a most beautiful and satisfactory plant— 
grows just like cultivated Smilax, but is hardy, evergreen and a smooth vine, no berries, latter part of April has small, 
greenish blossoms, very fragrant, much like the Mignonette—if the roots are planted in December the vine will grow from thirty to sixty feet in a season. 
It comes up in the spring with a head like Asparagus and is edible, 
rather a good substitute for that vegetable, the vine runs along with this head and gets Hs growth before putting

out its side branches. You must be up and doing, for it is a rapid grower, it stays awake nights to grow. But a dain¬ 
tier, cleaner, more satisfactory vine, I 
have never found. 

A beautiful, hardy, flowering border that is very effective along a fence, is the hardy Verbena, purple, it will grow al¬ 
most two feet high. A neighbor has one on three sides of a town lot— it is a surprise and a delight to all who behold it, a mass of soft purple splendor, it reveals the value of flowers in a great mass. 

There are wonderful possibilities for 
Florida, I can only hint at them, and give a bit of cheer and experience from my own little corner in Putnam county, 
and urge you to plant things that will also be a joy^ to others after we have passed away. 

That brings me to the Village Improve¬ 
ment work. This work for a higher life for our village, for tree planting and the making of good roads, is one where men and women must work together. It is certainly the mother’s anxious concern that her town, her county, her State be clean and up-to-date as well as her home, 
for in them she must continue the educa¬ 
tion of her boys and girls. It is the environment of the young that makes us have men and women with proper ideals of civic pride, and of partiotism. Moth¬ 
ers know instinctively how important it is to give children the right appreciation of beauty and cleanliness. When our boys and girls get the right education in Florida, our towns will be too nice for hogs and cattle to run in and not until then. But mothers sometimes fail. You can find this out by getting an ordinary man to clean up a bit of road-way. You will most likely find his idea of “cleaning 


up” means to “dig up” everything living in sight, leaving a nice, clean bed of sand, 
without the slightest idea of the use for which the cleaning was made. We don’t expect all men to see beauty, any more than we expect all women to sing, but we do ask, if you find a beautiful, young tree or Palmetto, that can remain in the clearing, just as well as not; please let it stay. ' In this village improvement work, we deal with matters of fact, not of opinion, so there is only the common inertia of humanity to overcome, and it is enough. Our study of how to get the most out of what we have, and for the comfort and happiness of all, has brought the Christ spirit much closer to us, in our homes and in our public work, for work¬ 
ing with Nature, not against her, we are one with the birds and the trees, and we become as little children, simple and trust¬ 
ful. Surely Chas. Wagner would love 
Florida, for one soon learns here the 
“Simple Life.” and cannot worry long if he tries. 

As woman is the maker of the home 
“atmosphere,” and man the strength, the foundation of the structure let us make the most of these great forces, that the environment may be the most perfect for the proper development of our children. 
Not stopping at the home but demanding and struggling for better conditions in our towns, our villages and our State. 

Give me a man whose mother has taught him to love the birds, the trees, 
the beauties of nature, he is the man for road commissioner, for park work, he can see and save what nature has given us so lavishly on every side. But with¬ 
out the right environment and the ear¬ 
nest love implanted in the child-heart, our efforts will be slow and faltering. ^ 

Joy is in my heart when I read of 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


this good roads agitation, this work is the most important work before us today, 
the home, the mill, the mine are all handi¬ 
capped terribly, without good roads. 
Life is without sociability and work a drudgery. There are many lovely spots in our State, beautiful villages, ideal in every way, but the tourist or settler are driven to other localities by the awful sand roads. This is a question for each town to settle for themselves for the needs and conditions are all so different. 

We are greatly indebted to Senator 
Mann and Senator Morgan, for their heroic work along this line, and we feel sure they have the earnest support of every member of this Society. Let me suggest when you lay out your new roads, 
you call a conference of the City Fathers, 
and the Village Improvement Mothers. 
Women’s studies along these lines are showing them the value of nature’s free gifts in all States, by road-side and river, 
on mountain sides and in valleys. Im¬ 
mense amounts of beautiful and suitable material right at hand. They will be sure to get the trees planted at once and have all our magnificent forest trees represented. We like planting each spe¬ 
cies by itself, a long line of Water 
Oaks, a long line of Hollys, a long line of Camphor, Wild Olive, Live Oak, Pal¬ 
metto, and a long line of the queen of all flowering trees, the Magnolia Grandi- 
flora. This superb tree with its magnifi¬ 
cent and odorous bloom should be planted 


131 

about every Florida home and village. 
All the trees I have mentioned are ever¬ 
green—what a wonderful collection, per¬ 
fect for beautifying and shading our roadways. Miles of highways shaded with such a variety of splendid trees would give us, in time, such fame as have the giant Cryptomerians given Japan on her wonderful State roads. There the poor of the cities travel for miles on per¬ 
fect roads and under giant trees, taking in their rude vehicles the babies and kitchen outfit and journeying along for days out of doors and under God’s great canopy— they get courage and health to return again to the city struggle. How good it would be if our poor could jour¬ 
ney to the ocean or gulf—only a few pal¬ 
try miles, and it would often bring back health to the fever stricken and hopeless. 
In the face of the wonderful progress of 
Florida in twenty years, we feel certain that our good roads dreams will come true. The Times-Union says they will, 
and the Times-Union ought to know, 
they say we shall have an automobile track from North to South, and from 
East to West of the State, and in the near future. If there is anything in 
Christian Science let us all join heartily in believing in this dream, and if we are good Americans ‘‘hustle for it” as well, 
for nothing can 1)e more ornamental, 
more useful, more progressive than hard, 
well-shaded high wavs.

PLANTS FOR HOME ADORNMENT. 


BY W. C. STEELE. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It is not necessary for me to come before yon with any argument in favor of the ornamentation of the home surroundings. That subject has been so often discussed here, that nothing re¬ 
mains to be said on that line. 

I think that we are all agreed that it is desirable to do the best we can to make our homes attractive and beautiful. It then only remains for us to consider the matter of ways and means. There are a few favored mortals who do not need to consider expense when they wish to have a beautiful home. They give orders that such and such things shall be done, 
and immediately all the energies of gard¬ 
eners, landscape gardeners, nurserymen and florists are devoted to the task of com¬ 
pleting the job satisfactorily. The result is not always as pleasing, to a cultivated taste, as would be expected from the great outlay of money. Unless directed by a wise controlling mind, effect is often spoiled by crowding, or by the use of un¬ 
suitable materials. This, however, does not concern very many of our number. 

I have thought it best, at this time, to try to give a partial list of trees, shrubs and vines that deserve a place in our door- 
yards and are available to every one. 

Last year, the present Chairman of the 
Committee on Ornamentals, recommend¬ 
ed the live oak, quercus virens, and the water oak. quercus aquatica. Both are desirable, the water oak makes the most rapid growth, is symmetrical and beauti¬ 
ful. It is, perhaps, not so long lived as 


the live oak, but trees of the water oak that were over 50 feet high and with trunks over a foot in diameter, twenty years ago, are still thrifty and vigorous. 

There are two other native evergreen trees that should be added to the list, mag¬ 
nolia grandiflora and magnolia glauca, 
the latter is commonly known as sweet bay. If given plenty of room, in open ground, where they will not be shaded by older trees, both species will grow rapidly and form symmetrical heads. 
They are highly ornamental at any sea¬ 
son of the year, but are especially so when in bloom. 

The camphor tree, cinnamomum cam- 
phora, is one of the most desirable shade and ornamental trees that I knovv. It thrives best on moist soil, but will grow wherever an orange tree will live. 

There are two smaller evergreen trees that would be more commonly found in cultivation if it were not for the fact that they are very difficult to transplant, suc¬ 
cessfully. I refer to the two larger varie¬ 
ties of holly. Ilex opaca, the common prickly leaved species and Ilex Dahoon. 
The latter is much like the first except that it is of somewhat smaller growth and the leaves are smooth. Hollies may be transplanted by cutting the trunk off close to the ground, in winter, and then mov¬ 
ing the roots at once with as little dis¬ 
turbance as possible. I have known holly trees to be transplanted with the tops on, 
but there are more failures than successes. 
Hollies are diecious, that is the staminate and pistillate flowers are borne on differ- 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


133 


ent trees. None but the pistillate trees ever bear fruit, and they will fail unless there is a staminate trees within a reason¬ 
able distance. If you live near a ham¬ 
mock where there are wild trees you may safely set out a pistillate tree with the expectation that it will bear fruit. But if not, it is useless to look for berries un¬ 
less you have both kinds on your place. 

In some locations, shade is not desir¬ 
able all the year, or at least not neces¬ 
sary in winter, in such places a decid¬ 
uous tree may be planted. One of the very best of these is the softmaple, acer rubrum. This tree always excites admir¬ 
ation when in bloom or in fruit. It usually blooms in February and the fruit ripens and falls before the leaves appear. 

A close second to the maple is the sweet gum, liquidamber staraciflua. It is not striking in appearance when in bloom, but its foliage is attractive, es¬ 
pecially n the autumn just before it drops off. The corky winged branches are quite curious in winter when not hidden by the leaves. 

Of course those of you who live below the frost line have at least a few orange trees. If any of you are so unfortunate as not to be able to grow the ordinary sweet or sour oranges, we would recom¬ 
mend that you set one or more trees of the hardy orange, citrus trifoliata. As an ornamental tree it has one advantage over the sweet orange, that is the flowers come in clouds while there are no leaves on the tree to hide part of them. The curious thorny branches covered with a sheet of snowy blossoms are beautiful. 

Shrubs that will bloom all the season are most desirable. Where it is not too cold, the Chinese hibiscus has few equals for showiness, but thev are too tender for some parts of the State. 


Altheas, a nearly related family to the hibiscus, are entirely hardy and will bloom throughout the entire season. There are varieties of several colors, but not the range of shades that may be found in the 
Chinese hibiscus. I can especially recom¬ 
mend the double white as being the best of all. 

Tabenaemontana coronaria, that is a long name, but it has no common name in this country, so far as I have ever heard. Henderson, in his “Hand-book of Plant,” says that it is known as East 
Indian rose bay, quite as long a name and but little easier to remember. This is one of the most desirable that I have ever seen. It is very tender, easily killed by frost, but has grown at my home for about 18 years, without protection, except that a few times it has been banked about the base with earth, and it has not failed to bloom each year. When killed by frost, 
it sprouts up quickly in the spring and soon begins to blossom and keeps it up until cold weather comes again. The flowers resemble those of the cape Jessa¬ 
mine, (Gardenia florida), but are not over one-fourth to one-third the size, and are more delicate in appearance. They are very double, pure white and have a delicate fragrance. 

Bauhinnia acuminata is also cpiite ten¬ 
der, but in my many years of experience with it, it has not once failed to sprout up and bloom freely. 

The flowers are single, pure white, 
without fragrance, and from two to three inches in diameter. I have only had 
Bauhinnia Galpinii for about three years, 
it comes into bloom earlier in the season. 
The flowering season, as with the other, 
lasts until cold weather.. The blossoms are smaller and are orange red in color. 

Dautintonia punicea, known in some 


134 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


parts of South Florida as “red pea-tree/' 
is a handsome evergreen flowering shrub or small tree. It blooms about twice a 
♦year, covering itself with long clusters of large pea-shaped flowers, bright orange red in color. It is beautiful when in bloom, but the blossoms are destitute of fragrance. 

Duranta plumieri, golden dew-drop, iS' 
also an evergreen shrub. It is most showy when in fruit. The flowers are small, a delicate lilac in color and are borne in long racemes. They are quite pretty, but when the large yellow berries are grown the bush is quite showy. The fruit hangs on for months, often until new growth begins again the next season. 

There is a desirable class of shrubs that is but little cultivated in this State. I 
refer to the list of hardy shrubs common¬ 
ly grown at the North, many of them will do as well, or better, in Florida as anywhere. There is only one objection to them, that being that they bloom but once a year and are deciduous. There is one exception, one of the best of these old favorites, the lilac, syringa vulgaris, can¬ 
not be successfully grown in Florida, or at least I have failed and have never heard of any one that has made them do well or even live, for any length of time. 
I can recommend the Japan quince, cydo- 
nia japonica, common S3^ringa or mock orange, philadelphus coronarius, weige- 
lia rosea and other varieties of Weigelia. 
The different varieties of Spirea should also be included. All of these are showy flowering shrubs. The blossoms of the syringa or mock orange, are almost as fragrant as true orange flowers. 

I am exceeding the limit and must omit many equally valable species, but I can¬ 
not bear to stop without speaking of a few vines. First the Ipomoeas, the peren¬ 


nial varieties are all desirable. Ipomoea learii is a strong grower and profuse bloomer, flowers large, dark purple. 
Like the morning glory, on hot days these blossoms fade by noon or soon after, but in cool weather, I have seen them stand up until nearly or quite noon of the second day. A curious fact about them is that when they last until the sec¬ 
ond day, the color fades into a dull red. 

Ipomoea mortoni is, if possible, a more rampant grower than I. learii, but is not so free a bloomer. Flowers red and smaller in size. 

Both of these species may become pests if allowed to escape into land that you wish to cultivate. They run on the surface of the soil and root along every inch of their length. In that case, the more you plow or cultivate them the more you scatter the roots and the more plants you have. The only effectual way to destroy them is to cut them off, just below the surface, with a hoe, as the roots alone will not sprout. An ounce of prevention is worth not only a pound of cure, but many of them, do not allow the vines to run on the ground at all. 

Ipomoea Michauxii, of Chapman’s 
Southern Flora, but I. jalapa of the 
Cyclopedia of American Horticulture, has received the name of “blushing beauty moonflower.” It grows from a large tuberous root, often a foot or more in diameter, and has been called “potato- 
vine.” It is a strong grower and a free bloomer, flowers open about four o’clock p. m.. color delicate pink. Ipomoea sin- 
uata is known in some localities as “noon¬ 
day glory.” This species can be easily recognized by its foilage, which looks much like that of the rose geranium. It is a vigorous grower, thought the stems are quite slender. It blooms freely, flow-

ers small, white with a dark center, open¬ 
ing about noon. 

Rhynchospermum Jasminoides, some¬ 
times caller Star Jassamine is a woody evergreen vine of strong growth and har¬ 
dy throughout this State. In the spring it is covered with small, pure white flow¬ 
ers that are quite fragrant. 

I have a vine of this plant that stands about ten feet high by six or eight wide and three feet through, that has been in bloom for a month. During that time the foliage has been nearly or quite, hidden by the dense sheet of flowers which have covered it. In the evening the fragrance is so strong as to be almost overpower¬ 
ing. 

I cannot cover the entire list of desir¬ 
able vines, but there is one more to which 
I wish to call attention. It is Pereskia aculeata, sometimes called “lemon vine,” 
from that fact that the leaves are shaped like those of a lemon tree, and are thick and glossy. This plant is one of the few members of the true cactus family that has leaves. It is really a cactus, though few would suspect it, on account of its vigorous growth and profusion of leaves. 
It is sensitive to frost and is often killed to the ground, but sprouts up quickly. 
Where a screen of vines is wanted, this is one of the best. If killed to the ground it will not bloom that season, for the flow¬ 
ers come on new growth that starts from last year’s wood. When not hurt by cold, 
it will literally cover itself with a cloud of small flowers about one and one-half inches in diameter. The color is peculiar, 
being an almost transparent waxen white, 


sometimes with a slight greenish tinge. 
The blossoms resemble small single roses in general appearance. They have a pow¬ 
erful odor which is unpleasant to some people. 

I have barely touched upon the list of desirable plants for home adornment, and have not mentioned any of the more com¬ 
mon species. The subject is so vast that it is impossible, within the limits of a paper that would be suitable on such an occasion, to do more than skim over the surface. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Henderson.—When I first came to this part of the State I saw in Gaines¬ 
ville a very beautiful vine on a veranda, 
I called at the lady’s door and asked for some and she called it the coral vine. 
This seems to be the common name for it. 
It begins blooming in June but is killed by frost. One thing I think of value about it is that it is the very best flower for bees that I have ever seen. It does not seem to^be very fragrant but the bees will work on it while it is in bloom. The flowers are shaped something like the sweet pea and are of a dark pink color. 
I would like to know what it is. I think it worthy of consideration. 

Mr. Steele.—There is a common vine here known as Rosa Montana, I thought probably, from your description that it was your coral vine. But from the dark pink color it is not the same. The proper name of the vine (rosa montana) is anti- 
gonon leptopus. 




Report of Secretary 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

At one time it looked "“as if the mem¬ 
bership of the Horticultural Society was going to be considerably behind that of last year as there were not very many remittances received for membership fees during the year. However, the last no¬ 
tice to the members brought out a large response and many of the members did some good missionary work in the way of securing new members and today I am able to make the following report:

It will be seen from the above report that the society is going to be consider¬ 
ably short of sufficient funds to meet the coming year’s expenses, to say nothing of the expense of presenting a resolution to the State Legislature for an appropri¬ 
ation. It is earnestly hoped that all mem¬ 
bers of the society will increase their ef¬ 
forts towards getting more new mem-

bers through the year as we should enroll, 
at least 300 more. 

The expenses of the coming year can be cut down by reducing the cost of print¬ 
ing the Report by leaving out the cata¬ 
logue of fruits and doing away with the illustrations. This feature of the Report, 


however, is a very desirable one and if it can be possibly done one or more illus¬ 
trations should be continued. ' 

All of the above is respectfully submit¬

Report of Committee on Legislation. 


BY M. F. ROBINSON. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Florida State Horticultural Socie- 
ty. 

Dear Sir : As a member of your com¬ 
mittee on Legislation, I would respect¬ 
fully report: That it has been suggested by our honored President and Secretary that it is with the greatest difficulty that the expenses of this Society can be main¬ 
tained from the modest meml:>ership fees; 
That no inconsiderable part of the ex¬ 
pense, is the publication of the Society’s 
Annual Report of its meetings; and that the Legislature of the State should be pe¬ 
titioned to make an annual appropriation in aid of these expenses. Such a petition would be entirely proper and in line with the action of the legislatures of Other 
States that aid in the support of similar 
Societies. That such a petition should specify the amount of funds desired, and name the purpose for which it will be used, is believed by your Committeeman to be highly important. Therefore it is recommended that the Secretary make a careful estimate of the amount necessary for the publication of the Annual Report, 
and prepare an appropriate resolution, 
requesting the desired appropriation by the legislature, and submit it to this meet¬ 
ing for action. 

Another matter which in the opinion of your Committeeman is highly impor¬ 
tant to the members of thil^ Society, and which it is the duty of the Society to lay 


before the legislature of the State and ask for relief; and that is the deplorable fence laws of the State; whereby cattle, 
horses, hogs, sheep, and goats are per¬ 
mitted to run at large. Therefore to bring this matter before the Society for its consideration, the following preamble and resolution is hereby introduced. 
Your Committeeman offers the follow¬ 
ing and moves its adoption. 

PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTION. 

Whereas, The farming and horticul¬ 
tural community and the towns and cities of the State of Florida are greatly ha¬ 
rassed and damaged besides being put to an enormous expense by reason of the fact that cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, and goats are permitted to run at large; and. 

Whereas, The finances of the State would be vastly improved, if the owners of such stock were compelled to fence, 
and, directly or indirectly, pay taxes or rent on the pastures used for such stock, 
instead of being permitted to pasture their stock on the land belonging to others or belonging to the public domain; and. 

Whereas, It is believed that a large majority of the voters in the State are in favor of a radical change in the present law; therefore, be it 

Resolved, By the Florida State Horti¬ 
cultural Society in meeting asembled; 
that the Legislature of the State of Flori¬ 
da, be and is hereby petitioned and im- 



140 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


plored to make and inforce such laws as will prohibit the running at large of cat¬ 
tle, horses, hogs, sheep and goats in the 
State. And if, in the wisdom of the Leg¬ 
islature, it is thought that any County in the State contains a majority of voters in favor of the present law, let it be sub¬ 


mitted to the voters of each County to de¬ 
cide whether the new law or the present law shall be enforced in that particular county. 

Resolved, That the above resolution be submitted to the next Legislature, by the Secretary of this Society. 


Notes from Abroad.

BY DR. VVM. C. RICHARDSON, TAMPA, FLA, 


When Doctor W. C. Richardson ad¬ 
vised me early in January that he was about to visit the Citrus sections around the Mediterranean I asked him to write something on his observations. He kindly consented to do so and mailed the letter from Paris thinking it would reach me at Jacksonville in time to be read to the 
Society. It failed to reach me in time and I am doing the next best thing— 
printing it in the proceedings. Personal¬ 
ly and on behalf of the Society I thank 
Dr. Richardson for his most instructive and interesting letter.—C. T. McCarty. 


Paris, France, April 25, 1906. 

C. T, McCarty, Esq., President Florida 
State Horticultural Society, Florida 

U. S. A. 

Dear Sir: In accordance with your request to write you relative to things of interest that I might see on rny cruise around the Mediterranean, in the way of horticultural matters, I take occasion to say that the first stop was at Funchal Is¬ 
land, of Maderia. This island grows some oranges of a rather inferior quality, 
and all sub-tropical fruits and vegetables flourish as extensively as the small limits of the island will permit. Sugar cane, 
however, seems to be the principal arti¬ 
cle of cultivation. 

The next place visited, was Cadiz, 
Spain, located on an almost barren little 


peninsula, and aside from the splendid harbor, its commerce as the chief port of 
South Western Spain, and the manufac¬ 
ture of salt by evaporation, it has little of interest in a business way, but is rich in art treasures and historical associations. 

A visit to the interior, some hundred and fifty miles, revealed quite extensive orange groves, and many quite large olive orchards. The orange trees are planted in squares in regular order, eighteen or twenty feet apart, and do not seem to grow anything like as large as our Florida trees. In the gardens of the palace of the 
Alcazar there are many very old trees, 
one of which is said to have an authentic history of over six hundred years ; It is a bitter sweet, and the man showing us through the place said that sweet oranges injected into the bitter stock, he meant budded, were growing in the grounds and bearing abundantly at ages of two and three hundred years. These trees did indeed look thrifty and healthy, but they were no larger than our fifteen or sixteen year old trees. All the unprotected or¬ 
ange and other sub-tropical trees had been nipped with the cold to the extent of los¬ 
ing their leaves, but this did not seem tr. 
worry the Spaniards any, and they ap¬ 
parently treated it as nothing unusual, or of any consequence. Spanish oranges are not of the best quality, and aside from color have little to recommend them; 
they are tender, thick skinned and of a negative flavor. 




142 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


The next stop was at Algiers, in North¬ 
ern Africa, where oranges, lemons, gua¬ 
vas, bananas, etc., were found in pro¬ 
fusion. All showed the effect of recent cold, but had not suffered as much as in 
Spain. The orange groves were set out in a much more crowded way, the trees being only 12 or 15 feet apart, and, like in Spain, all pruned up very high. The mandarine oranges are raised very ex¬ 
tensively in Algiers, and are of a most excellent quality—in fact all the oranges here are very good indeed. 

After visiting Greece, Turkey and 
Asia Minor, where olives and figs are raised extensively, and oranges are grown in a rather limited way, and where they suffer a great deal from cold every win¬ 
ter, the next place of interest from an horticultural standpoint was Jaffa in Pal¬ 
estine. 

Jaffa is the home of the very best or¬ 
anges we have seen outside of Florida, if an exception be made in favor of a blood navel found in a small way on the island of Malta. The cultivation of the orange in Jaffa is more wonderful to a Florida grower than is the delicious character of the fruit. The trees are planted in rows not more than seven or eight feet apart, 
and not more than five or six feet distant from one another in the rows. All culti¬ 
vation is done with hoes-and spades and they dig deep everywhere, even close up to the trees. They have a loose sandy soil, richer apparently than ours and their only knowledge of fertilizers seems to be confined to barn yard manure. 

When the trees get so large as to make them too close together for convenient cultivation and harvesting the fruit, they cut them off alternately in the rows and rebud the sprouts, I do not think any trees are allowed to get more than ten 


or twelve feet high before they are thus treated. I was told by a man whose family are the most extensive growers in this country that small thrifty trees close together gave larger returns per acre and better fruit than any other system of cul¬ 
ture they had been able to devise. 

Egypt was found to be almost as won¬ 
derful from an horticultural and agricul¬ 
tural view as it is from an ethnological and historical standpoint. At Cario in latitude 30 degrees north, where it never rains and where the climate in much warmer especially in summer, than in 
Jacksonville, we found many things to in¬ 
terest us. We were fortunate enough to secure an introduction to the Director of the Botanical and Zoological gardens, 
who kindly devoted a forenoon to show¬ 
ing us through the wonderfully rich pos¬ 
sessions under his management, includ¬ 
ing rare specimens of all kinds of fruits and plants that grow, in this lavishly productive country. Everything we ever saw growing in Florida seemed to flour¬ 
ish here, including two splendid real 
American alligators kept in a pool enclos¬ 
ed by wire netting, separating them from the Crocodiles. It seemed like ineeting friends from home, and after long asso¬ 
ciation with Arabs, camels, donkeys, etc., 
it cheered us up wonderfully. 

We were also fortunate enough to be in Cairo at the time of the Egyptian Hor¬ 
ticultural Exposition, conducted with a great flourish under the auspices of the 
Khedive, who by the way is a very pleas¬ 
ant appearing, popular and democratic monarch. The Exposition had a few very fine exhibits of fruits and some of the finest kinds of large appetizing appear¬ 
ing vegetables, also a beautiful show of flowers and tropical plants, but taken as a whole it did not begin to come up to the

exhibit of'any one of several single coun¬ 
ties as shown at the Florida State Fair held at Tampa. Oranges are grown and cared for in Egypt about the same way as in Algiers, except they depend on irrigation entirely. Guava trees are not small bushy things as with us, but quite as large as orange trees and are kept pruned up. 

From Egypt we went to Italy and 
Southern France, where from Naples to 
Nice, along the shore of the Mediterran¬ 
ean, the orange flourishes in a more or less precarious way, being often found growing on narrow terraces of a moun¬ 
tain side with snow capped peaks in plain view. In fact it appears to me that the 
Mediterranean varieties of citrus fruits can, and do, stand much more cold than they do with us in Fla. Even in Egypt there had been, shortly before our visit, 
enough cold to cut down bananas and knock the leaves off the guava and other tender trees. While the cold is always felt it is seldom extreme enough to freeze the fruit, and at Nice in Southern France, 
where they had recently experienced a real freeze, we were told that all fruit that did not drop off the trees within a couple of weeks was considered as good and marketable as if there had been no freezing. Blooming seems later than with us, and it was after the first of 
April before we saw any trees in full bloom. 

None of these countries produce orang¬ 
es in quantities large enough to have much apparent effect on our markets, and in fact they do not seem to raise more than enough for home consumption and to supply local and adjacent markets. We only had opportunity to get at the prices of oranges as sold at retail, and found them selling at approximately the same 


price as at home. As a table necessity they seem to be well appreciated, and I 
do not remember a single dinner any¬ 
where in the Orient or Europe that we did not have them. 

We noticed surprising and astonishing things that completely upset our ideas, 
based on experience, of the disposition and nature of orange trees, such as seeing them growing and flourishing luxuriant¬ 
ly out of holes in solid rock pavements with no apparent soil or other nourish¬ 
ment for their support and no possible chance to cultivate or fertilize them. We saw them trained against houses and palaces, and shaded into arbors like vines. 
In Egypt we saw several large en¬ 
closures fenced in with hedges of orange trees pruned and trimmed into various shapes as the owner’s fancy dictated. 

In conclusion I may say that the most prominent feature of our trip was cold always and everywhere, and with the ex¬ 
ception of a few days in Cairo, and one day clambering over lava and in warm volcanic ashes on Mt. Vesuvius, the very day before the great and destructive erup¬ 
tion, we have not had a chance to get warm ! 

In the lower end of the Jordan Valley, 
near the Dead Sea, around the towns of 
Jericho and Gillgal, was the only place where we did not see evidence of frost. 
In this small territory are a few lemons, guavas, etc., but the Turkish sys¬ 
tem of taxation is so oppressive that little is undertaken by the wretched inhabitants in the way of fruit growing. They told us that each and every fruit tree was taxed the same, no matter whether it was large or small, barren or productive. 
Many were cutting down their trees and selling the wood as the only way to escape this ridiculous method of taxation. With

irrigation and better laws the Valley of the Jordan, now a howling wilderness in possession of wild animals and fierce 
Bedouins, could be made one of the most productive and delightful places in the world. 


With kindest regards to you and yours, 
and best wishes for the splendid society of a splendid State over which you pre¬ 
side, I am. 

Yours truly,

Question Box. 


A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES,, ANSWERED BY 

VARIOUS MEMBERS. 


I. What is the cause of thick-skinned grapefruit or oranges? Can the trees be fertilized in a way to produce thin-skin¬ 
ned fruit ? 

Mr.' Taber.—Mr. President, I think 
Mr. Sampson should be called upon to answer this question. 

Mr. Sampson.—There are a number of causes for thick-skinned fruit. 'The first crop might have thick skins while the sec¬ 
ond would not. If you put on too much ammonia in proportion to phosphoric acid and potash, you might expect coarse- 
skinned fruit. 

Mr. Sample.—I would like to know if cultivating it is conducive to thick skin. 

Mr. Sampson.—I think it is. We had a portion of a natural sour grove where trees were left too thick for anything but * 
hoe cultivation—three times a year—that invariably grew much thinner-skinned fruit than same variety where trees had clean cultivation till rainy reason. They produced much less fruit but it was solid, 
handsome fruit and ripened earlier. 

Maj. Fairbanks.—I have noticed that where I had my stables the land was very rich and the trees planted near there bore very thick skinned fruit. I concluded that too much ammonia was . the cause of this thick skin. 

Mr. Connor.—In my last report I said something about cultivation. I think the 

H—10 


matter of cultivation can be overdone to a great extent. I have some old soil and 
I think it is as poor as any in the State. 
My plan has been to cultivate it without cultivation, in other words, to make use of the growth of beggar weed etc., mow it down in summer and use what I want for hay, then in the fall and spring run over it with cutaway harrow and chop it into the soil. After three years such treat¬ 
ment it now looks like good soil. 

Mr. Cook.—I did not hear all that Mr. 
Fairbanks said in reference to thick- 
skinned grape fruit. My experience has been this; in cultivating the citrus tree and its fruit the use of a highly ammoni- 
ated fertilizer with constant and late cul¬ 
tivation produces a vigorous growth of wood and a large, coarse, ^thick-skinned fruit either grapefruit or orange. By the free use of potash this result can be modi¬ 
fied somewhat as to the fruit. 

Mr. Painter—The thickness of the or¬ 
ange peel depends on several conditions— 
fertilizer, cultivation and moisture, or a combination of the three. Young trees that are highly fertilized and thoroughly cultivated will bear thick skinned fruit if the season is one of abundant moisture. 
A dry season would produce thin-skinned fruit because the tree cannot take up as much of the plant food from the soil—a lack of moisture means a lack of nitrifi¬ 
cation. Old trees that have but little cul- 






146 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tivation generally produce the thinnest¬ 
skinned and best appearing fruit. 

Mr. Hart.—I will say my groves have not been plowed in many years. I do not cultivate deeply after the second year from setting a grove. 

I wish to speak of budding the orange, 
more especially the Washington Navel on rough lemon stock. This variety is a shy bearer on sweet or sour stock but fruits well on lemon yet my experience is that on stock the navels are very coarse and poor. 
My navels were so poor on this stock the past season that I would not have shipped them at all had I known just how poor they were. The fruit may be better on pine lands but for hammock I would say, 
don’t use lemon stock at all. 

I am cutting down my navels and put¬ 
ting in other varieties. 


2. Citrus trees in a grove eight to ten years old have grown so thick limbed that it is almost impossible to gather the fruit grown inside of the trees. Would it be well to prune out a lot of the inner branches and twigs? Would it be a good time directly after the blossoming season is passed? 

Mr. Hart.—The older I grow in orange 
'^culture the more I find that I am not posi¬ 
tive of many things I thought I had set¬ 
tled in my mind, I have not settled. I 
believe in letting the tree grow, I do not think it was born depraved and has to be cut to pieces every year. I do hardly any pruning at all except to take out dead wood and I am very much pleased with results. Now as to the second question, 
I would say this much, I would not prune right after the trees bloom, if I were going to prune at all it would be right liefore the starting of new growth. 


Mr. Connor.—I was with Mr. Waite while he was pruning some trees in Man¬ 
atee Lemon Co. Grove at Palmetto three years ago. If he has made it pay—after the use of the knife in what I called at that time a very free manner, it would convince me that pruning is a good thing. 
I would like to know what his success has been. 

Mr. Waite.—If the grove is situated near, or in the white fly belt, I should advise pruning out the centers of the or¬ 
ange trees, for the fly'likes these thick places, and we have noticed that almost immediately after it gets started in a grove the scale insects kill the most of this inside wood and unless the tree is cleaned out you will get but little fruit. 

With us the grapefruit and lemon trees do not grow as compact, and the lemon especially, sheds a great deal of its inside foliage from the fruit spur wood, yet these will invariably produce bloom which is well protected from cold, and the fruit thus produced is of the finest quality. As the fly is quite severe on the lemon we have found that the scale soon kills a greater portion of this inside wood. 

We have no set time for pruning, but 
I believe that January is the best month in which to prune, as the tree at that time has enough sap flowing to enable it to heal the wounds thus produced. 

Mr. Longley.—Mr. President, I do not want to interfere only to prove as near as 
I can that pruning is very objectionable. 
I had a neighbor who had a grove of about 85 acres who is always pruning and today he claims four thousand trees, 
but he will iiot average one box of fruit to the tree. I do not prune at all and have a good crop of fruit all' through my trees. 
I claim that pruning is good in the fore part of the winter before blooming time.

3. What will labor and material cost to spray 5000 medium sized orange trees\? 

Mr. Connor.—During the last three weeks I have had some experience in this line, just the experience fruit growers would have who have not the complete apparatus for spraying. The cost of spray¬ 
ing for about 500 tr^es was something over $7.00, with an additional cost of 
$8.00 for material used, or about $15.00 
which would be an average cost to depend upon. Trees bearing from two to four boxes. 


4. Will whitewashing orange trees with pure carbonate of lime be detrimen¬ 
tal ? 

Mr. Hart.—I remember twenty five or thirty years ago there was quite a discus¬ 
sion in regard to whitewashing orange trees. In California several years ago I 
saw where they had cut back their trees to bud them, and that they had white¬ 
washed the trunks eight or ten feet high to protect them. This might be all right but I remember there were objections found to white-washing but they have gone out of my mind just now and I can¬ 
not state them. Perhaps Maj. Fairbanks can give us something on this line. 

Maj. Fairbanks.—I wish to say that I 
have no information whatever. I like the orange tree and think it is the most beau¬ 
tiful tree in creation and it is a sacrilege to white-wash it. 

Mr. Painter.—Anything put on the orange tree to cover up its pores is in¬ 
jurious, especially during the growing season. White-wash your fence and out¬ 
buildings but wash the trunk of your trees with water and whaleoil soap. 


5. I have Mexican clover in my grove and would like to know how to get it out. 

Maj. Healey.—Let more of it grow and you will not want to get it out. 

Mr. Painter.—I would suggest that if he really wants to get rid of it he move to another county. 


6. Explain how, when and what quanti¬ 
ty of blue vitriol to use for dieback. 

Mr. Brown.—I suppose that the regu¬ 
lar Bordeaux formula would be used; it should be used just previous to the start¬ 
ing of new growth, I should say the latter part of January, but it could be usejl later in the season. If the tree is in a very bad condition, inoculate the tree, but my plan is to use a spray. 

Mr. Longley.—I would like to know what quantity to use in this inoculation. 

Mr. Brown.—I use a quantity about equal to that of the size of a pea inserted risfht under the bark of the tree. 


7. What is the best remedy for foot rot? Is it best to resort to remedies for the cure of this disease, or pull out the tree and plant a new one. 

Mr. Phelps.—Some time prior to 1895 
I set out ten trees. I found this foot rot on them later. I happened to meet 
Mr. M. F. Robinson who advised me to apply sulphuric acid to the ground and rake it in well, this I did and the very worst tree I had came out fine, in fact better than any of them. 

I should dread very much pulling up a tree as it is no little job, and shall do everything I can to save them otherwise and l have saved a good many so far; 
I still believe in the sulphuric acid well raked in. 









148 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Mr. Painter.—The sulphuric acid remedy referred to by Mr. Phelps is a dilute form. Three gallons of 50 per cent. 
B. acid is diluted with seventeen gallons of water. 

Mr. Blackman.—I have tried a good many remedies, spraying, cutting away the wood, sulphuric acid, in fact almost everything I could hear of; but the only effective remedy I have found for this disease is blue stone. I inoculate the tree close to the ground, cutting the bark the same as for budding and inserting a piece of blue stone about as large as a grain of wheat. This must be done when the sap is up and the tree in a growing condition. I think that for foot rot blue stone is a grand panacea. In some cases it will scar the tree badly, but in time it will heal over and the tree will put on a most vigorous growth. I have found quite a good many trees that were af¬ 
fected; but in every case they were trees grown on low land. I have never seen a tree in our section that was grown on high pine land affected by this disease. 

Dr. Bessey.—What is the appearance of a tree with foot rot.^ 

Mr. Brown.—Thy become yellow and drop their leaves. I did not know just what it was at first, but I wish I might tell every grower who has foot rot in his grove that if they will put blue stone in the root just at the surface of the ground, 
it will surely do the trees good. 

Prof. Rolfs.—About four years ago we tried some experiments in treating die- 
back by inserting a small piece of blue stone under the bark of trees. In this experiment a certain number of trees were chosen to work upon, a number of trees were treated as described above and along side of these an ecjual number left untreated, careful notes as to the extent 


of dieback and the location of the lesions in the tree. About three months elapsed before it was practicable to return to take notes on the work, and it was found that treated and the untreated trees were en¬ 
tirely free from dieback. The point I 
wish to make here is, that it is absolutely impossible to draw a reasonable conclu¬ 
sion from any experiment unless we have checks upon our operations. Die¬ 
back or citrus tree indigestion, may be brought on by a variety of causes, even different trees in the same grove may have dieback from entirely different caus¬ 
es. The matter of first importance in treating dieback is to ascertain what caused it and then to remove the cause. 
Often times this is all that is necessary. 
The recovery of the tree may, however, 
be hastened by an application of weak 
Bordeaux mixture to the upper surface of the leaves. Among the most frequent causes of dieback I may mention plowing during the rainy season, applications of organic ammonia, hard pan or a rather hard sub-stratum under the tree. A tree that has a tendency to dieback may be set over into a case of dieback by pruning or cases or dieback have been known to be brought on by root pruning. In other cases of dieback have been known to be ables them to secure too much organic ammonia are apt to have dieback. 

Mr. Hart.—In this matter of foot rot, 
the time to cure the disease is in its early stages; look'out for it, examine the trees and if you find gum exuding at or near the ground, dig the dirt away and e?q)ose the roots, this will usually cure it. I think when a tree has foot rot so as it loses its leaves it is best to dig it up and set sour stock in its place that is budded eighteen inches above the collar. 

Mr. Frink.—I would like to hear from 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


149 


Mr. Wilson as to his experience with this foot rot in Porto Rico. 

Mr. Wilson.—We have a kind of foot rot in Porto Rico which we have fought with carbolic acid and Bordeaux mix¬ 
ture, but whether this is the same foot rot you have in Florida or not I do not know. We discovered it a few years ago only on a few trees. When I first found this foot rot on my trees my men put on the carbolic acid too strong and killed the tree but since then I have used this car* 
bolic treatment, superintending it myself, 
and found it very successful. A neigh¬ 
bor of mine has found this remedy very successful by pulling the dirt away from the trees and washing them with this mixture. 


8. Will Dr. Walker please give the so¬ 
ciety a report of the camphor experiment at Huntington? 

Dr. Walker.—Mr. President, I am afraid the subject on which I am going to speak, will place me in rather a false light. 
I have in my possession a sample of cam¬ 
phor prepared in Huntington and purified in Washington, but first must tell you how this came into importance (and must confess that it is of great importance to us.) 

Most of the camphor used in the United 
States today comes from Formosa. Re¬ 
cently several Japanese authorities were quietly sent over here to see how much camphor was grown, and whether we could raise it successfully or not. 

The results of their visit were so serious that the celluloid manufacturers—our great camphor consumers—said, in their 
.report -to Washington that they must have American camphor or move to For¬ 
mosa. Camphor, up to this time had been 


worth about thirty cents per pound, but immediately advanced to $1.00 per pound. 

In 1898 I met Prof. Hubbard who was our State Entomologist and he showed me the results of his experiments. I 
found that one pound of camphor could be extracted from 70 pounds of leaves. 
It was at this time, when it was worth only thirty cents per pound, that people thought it would be a profitable business to plant camphor trees here. 

The camphor trees are very beautiful, 
and I got rather enthusiastic over mine, 
which were growing well. When I heard that another grade of camphor—a chemi¬ 
cal product could be put on the market at fifteen cents per pound, so thought it would be useless for us to try and raise the trees. Camphor is very similar to tur¬ 
pentine. Many people have tried to make camphor out of turpentine and think it will yet be done. 

We waited for a year or two, during which time the camphor workers were said to be hard at work, but no camphor was produced. Then, at a very oppor¬ 
tune moment, these works were burned and we do not think they will be rebuilt. 

Camphor is also very essential in the manufacture of smokeless powder. Al- 
tho’ other substances might be used yet if anything should happen to draw us into a war, when we would require a quantity of powder immediately, we would be in a dilemma if Japan decided not to provide us with the camphor. 

About a year ago, a gentleman came down from the experimental station— 
Washington—to see what the camphor outlook was in Florida. After a general look around he took samples of this Flori¬ 
da made camphor back to Washington and purified it. The celluloid people were interviewed and shown the samples which 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


150 

resulted in an order from the president of the company for 500,000 pounds of 
Florida camphor at $1.00 per pound. But unfortunately it was not procurable, and we are out that^$500,000. (Laughter.) 

The gentleman from the experimental station came down, later to experiment in 
Huntington. I was only too willing to offer him all the facilities I had for the experiment, as this was such an important question, and should be pushed forward. 
In six weeks time he (and his assistant) 
returned to Washington and purified this camphor. I had gotten 1.42 per cent of camphor from my own trees but am told they can do better at Washington. I did not expect to go into the matter very thoroughly, but just pass this information along. 

Other trees may be cut down by severe cold, and that is the end, but not so with the camphor trees, as we can use them even four months after they are cut down. 
I used some old trees that had been cut down three months, and obtained 1.021 
per cent of camphor, so I know that this is true. So, if we go extensively into the business, and a severe frost cuts down the trees, we can still obtain the cam¬ 
phor from them. 

I wish to call attention to the value the camphor tree will be to us within the next ten years. It will be worth millions of dollars, if we only take hold of it. Japan has all the trade now, but can we afford to let her keep it? If Japan says they must pay $2.00 per pound for their camphor, 
we, who are obliged to have it, will be obliged to pay. And if she says we can¬ 
not have any at any price we will not get it. If we do not stop the growth of camphor in Formosa, for use in this country, it means the loss to us of mil¬ 
lions of dollars. 


I will take my chances on the camphor growing. It is surprising what can be done, and the only thing we need worry about is that this Cynthetic camphor may be made. Yet if it should be, we still have our ornamental trees. 

I would like to have the opinion of this association on this subject. 

Scattered about in different parts of 
Putnam county are groves of these trees, 
varying in size from a dozen trees to several acres. If we can get the govern¬ 
ment to take the matter up, you see of what great importance it will be to us. 

I have offered them every inducement to come to Huntington and experiment on my trees. I am willing for them to cut them down, dig them up, or do anything they like with them. I would like expres¬ 
sions from this society in favor of having this work pushed forward and suggest that they show the government their ap¬ 
proval and appreciation of the experi¬ 
mental work being carried on. 

Mr. Steele.—On what character of soil is the camphor grown? 

Dr. Walker.—It will grow well on any high pine land. I have beautiful trees growing on my place at Huntington. The cost of extracting the camphor cannot yet be determined, as we were only experi¬ 
menting. I do not know how the govern¬ 
ment sample was extracted, but will know in the fall, how it was done. In about two weeks I expect to have a sample of the first celluloid made from this Florida • 
camphor. (Applause.) 

Mr. Steele.—iMr. President, I had a large camphor tree that was killed down in the freeze of 1899, but now it has grown up and is as large as ever. If you will give a camphor tree a fair start, 
it will grow right on, almost anywhere. 
There is hardly any soil on which it will 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


not grow. It does not do so well on dry- 
soil. 

Mr. Frink.—I would like to supple¬ 
ment what Dr. Walker has just said on the subject of camphor, I have recently had letters from two different gentlemen connected with the United States Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture, who stated that re¬ 
cent experiments in producing camphor gum have been extremely successful and they seem to think it highly feasible to produce camphor gum here on a profitable commercial scale. As a result of those ex¬ 
periments I have recently had inquiries for trees in lots of five to twenty thousand. 
From these letters and inquiries I think within a comparatively short time cam¬ 
phor production will become quite an ex¬ 
tensive industry here. 


9. Have any of the members of the society seen the nitro culture that is being introduced by the United States Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture, and with what suc¬ 
cess? 

Mr. Hubbard.—I would like to ask the gentlemen from the State Experiment 
Station what success they have had with 
Alfalfa and nitro culture. 

Dr. Bessey.—In behalf of the depart¬ 
ment I would ask that a distinction be made between nitro culture and nitrogen gathering bacteria. 

Mr. Hubbard—Either one of them. 

Mr. Henderson.—I did not know there were two kinds, I want to know if their use is satisfactory to the department of agriculture. 

Mr. Hubbard.—Prof. Connor said that they were experimenting with alfalfa at 
Lake City and I wished to know if they 


151 

could give us any report that would be of advantage in growing alfalfa. 

Mr. Merriam.—I have had some exper¬ 
ience with nitro culture, some of it is very good. There has been a great deal of discussion about this commercial nitro culture and some of the experiment sta¬ 
tions claim that it is not as good as that sent out by the government. I tried some last spring on beans and English peas and it was a success on my peas, I tried it very fully putting it on the seeds and in connection with this I used fertilizer with¬ 
out any nitrogen and right along side of it I put in some that contained five percent, nitrogen, but the phosphoric acid and potash, with the nitro culture made better peas than the fertilizer. I do not know why it was hut I did not get very 
. good results. I used this on some beans but the cold killed the beans so I could not tell about them. I could not see any dif¬ 
ference on cow peas at all, one was as good as the other. I presume that the reason was that the ground was already well inoculated. I understand that it is necessary to have the nitro culture fresh as it will not keep very long in the shape the department puts it up. 

Mr. Ellis.—Mr. President, I have used the commerci^^ nitro culture on both cow peas and velvet beans and I planted one half with and one half without the nitro culture and we could discover no differ¬ 
ence at all. The nitro culture was bought from a good reliable firm who claimed that it was fresh. The bacteria seemed to develop all right in the jars, butH 
could see no difference in the crops at all. 

Mr. Henderson.—I tried peas similar to Mr. Merriam with a commercial nitro- 
culture but could see no difference.

lo. Has any member of the society had any experience in growing “Ginseng”? 
With what success? Can it be success¬ 
fully grown in Florida? 

Mr. Painter.—Ginseng has been tried in Florida but the only one who made money out of the deal was the firm who sold the roots for planting. 


II. Can a grove be cared for and fer¬ 
tilized so that it will give a full crop each year, if so, how and when to fertilize it? 

Mr. Blackman.—Mr. President, I can answer that in part, not from my own experience, but for another. This gentle¬ 
man take it one vear with another, has good to heavy crops of grapefruit. The first few years his grove bore, it would produce a heavy crop one year, the next ligliter. The owner commenced experi¬ 
menting in fertilizing and for the past three years his grove has been loaded almost to the breaking point. I do not know what kind of fertilizer he uses, or how many applications or when applied. 
He uses a fertilizer manufactured in this 
State. He works his grove in the spring, 
allowing the weeds and grass to grow through a portion of the summer. I do not know how much fertilizer he uses to the tree; but I do know that he gets a* full crop each year. 

Mr. Connor.—I do not know that I can give any light on this subject but I wish to say that there are so many things that have to be taken into consideration to produce a full crop of fruit that I do not think we can lay it altogether on the kind of fertilizer used for the reason that there as so many other things that we have to take into account. If we do not have moisture then we are not apt to have a full crop of fruit, then again I think 


the time, and quality of fertilizer used has something to do with it. My idea is that the time of fertilizing is in the fall of the year, it seems to get the grove in better shape to set fruit and then I would follow that with a light application in the spring, 
then feed the tree gradually all along the year. If you feed the trees well, being careful to have suitable analysis, you will have no trouble in getting a good crop each year. 

Mr. Gist.—All of Florida is not so fortunate as to have a rock foundation to put their groves on, therefore some suffer for the lack of moisture. I think Mr. 
Connor’s remarks were well made, for my observation is that a tree that has been well fed winters well. Down in 
Miami they do not have to consider the winters as we do. A well fertilized tree will stand a lower degree of temperature than a poorly fed one and thus better crops will be the result the next year. 


12. How are bamboos propagated? 
Will they grow from cuttings, if so what time should they be put out? 

Dr. Walker.—They are propagated by taking the roots. This can be done at most any time. 

Mr. Steele.—I saw in a neighbor’s yard a large clump of bamboo, from which‘it was impossible to get a sprout. I took some cuttings, slender twigs, and planted them in moist soil and all grew. 


13. Given a sandy soil of a tidewater island that is too salt for growing oran¬ 
ges is it possible to neutralize the excess of salt by the use of a special fertilizer? 
The soil is so salty that the kelsey plum after being transplanted when matured will taste as salty as if it had been pickled

in brine. Larger pear trees planted in this soil in February continue to grow, 
putting on a large crop of fruit and again blooming and fruiting, as did the plums, 
and dying the second year after having fruited three crops; the third crop of the second year being immature. This land is well above the ordinary tide and has a fine growth of palmettoes, live oak, cedar, 
accacia and camphor but it is of a peculiar¬ 
ly dry character getting dry immediately after being soaked, seeming to lack nitro¬ 
gen also. I would be glad to know how 
I can make oranges and other fruits grow on this land. 

Mr. Painter.—There is no hope for your ever being able to neutralize the salt in the lower strata of your soil. It is evi¬ 
dently there from salt water from below. 
The only “neutralizer"’ salt has is water. 
This dissolves it and would eventually clear the soil if you had perfect drainage and no return of salt water from below. 


14. What is the best size of budded stock of the orange or grapefruit to trans¬ 
plant. 

Mr. Frink.—In reference to size of bud- 
• ded trees, I wish to say that there is con¬ 
siderable difference of opinion as to most desirable for planting. Some people pre¬ 
fer a two year bud and others one year bud. The demand is heavier for four to five feet one year buds than any other size, and two year buds probably come second. My own observation and exper¬ 
ience goes to show that a four to five foot one year bud is easier to transplant and everything considered the most desirable size. 

Mr. Connor.—We all know that the smaller the plant is or the closer it is to the seed, the better it transplants. When 


it is removed from the seed bed, and is tough enough to be transplanted I think this is very true with the orange tree, for this reason; you can get nearly all the fiberous root with the young tree but if you wait until the stock gets to be of large size the feeding roots are necessa¬ 
rily thrown out farther from the plants and it takes a tree in that condition longer to adopt itself to its surroundings and start new roots. My opinion is that stock from two to two and a half years old well supplied with fibre roots will adopt itself better and receive less shock by trans¬ 
planting than the large ones with no fibers.. • I do not care so much about the age of the bud it may be one or two years old. 

Mr. Hart.—My interests simply call for the best tree I can get and my ex¬ 
perience has been that the size of stock is of more importance in successful trans¬ 
planting than size of bud. I would pre¬ 
fer the stock to be two inches through. 
I have trees bought from nursery stock that were not larger than my finger after the freeze of 1899 much 

larger yet, but I have some trees of my own growing that I planted out three years ago, these buds were thrifty, the stocks of good size and the trees now are many times larger than the smaller ones set years before. I came to this State when the trees for our groves were all taken from wild hammock and we did not take any stock less than two inches in diameter and some were six inches through. We set them out and budded them as they were set out, you cannot do that with the small nursery trees. It takes them some time to start new growth but you take large trees at the ground, not too large say about three and one-half inches through and you will get your

grove quicker and make more fruit. You bud the trees after they are transplanted and your buds start right to growing and in three years you have profitable bearing trees. I would not cut the old stock down close to the bud until the buds get to growing rapidly, then cut them off and wax them and the wound will soon be covered over and a smooth trunk result. 
You will get thrifty bearing trees from large stock, while the small stock will give away to drouth or any of the ills to which the trees are heir. 

Mr. Connor.—Did you ever try trans¬ 
planting smaller trees from the nursery? 

Mr. Hart.—I certainly have. Have you ever planted four inch stock? That is well worth trying. 

Mr Connor.—Take a good tree and at the end of three years you cannot reach the tops of them. I have some now that 
I tried this with and I cannot reach the tops of them. I have never seen finer trees than I have in my grove planted three years, and I used the ordinary four or five foot bud, one year old in nursery. 

Mr. Longley.—It makes a great differ¬ 
ence in conditions. I suppose Mr. Hart’s place is on hammock land. On my pine land I have taken stock three eights of an inch thick and planted between trees that had been planted two years, that had grown from one and a half to two inches. 
In three years from that time the small trees were the finest by far and all planted in the same row. 

Mr. Chilton.—In the past few years 
I have set out in groves about 20,000 trees of different varieties and I certainly must bear out the view of Mr. Hart in refer¬ 
ence to a good large thrifty stock with a two year old bud in preference to a small stock and bud. I have been in the busi¬ 


ness for the past thirty years 'and came to this State in the old time, which Mr. Hart speaks of when we had large wild groves of the orange scattered all through our hammocks and know the time when we set those large sour stumps, six and eight inches in diameter and after budding they made a quick bearing grove. 

In three years we could count on a good crop. It takes too long to wait with small stock. I prefer a good thrifty four year old stock with a two years old bud of not less than three inches in diameter to start with and a two year bud. The stock should be vigorous which is one of the main points to beginners. 

Mr. Blackman.—Is it possible to lay down any iron clad rules that will govern all conditions in the different parts of the state ? 

Mr. McCarty.—No, of course not. 

Mr. Blackman.—The first two years is the critical time with orange and grape¬ 
fruit trees in Dade county and my exper¬ 
ience is that a year old bud is the best for planting in that climate and soil. In 
Marion county I used three year old buds with good success; but not so at 
Miami. 

Mr. Hart.—Mr. President, I have a few government hybrid buds here that I 
cut last winter, if I remember correctly about six hundred. I now-have permis¬ 
sion to distribute these and if any one present would like to try these oranges 
I will be glad to give them some buds. 
Many people have been writing and ask¬ 
ing me for these varieties and some seem inclined to go into these new varieties heavily. I would not advise that yet, we do not know enough about them. Or¬ 
ange trees when they first bear do not

show just what the fruit will be later. 
I am the only one who has fruited these two varieties the Trimble and W.eshart and both of them have been earlier in former seasons than the ordinary tan¬ 
gerine and of larger size. The fruit has been large this year but not quite so early as heretofore. It may develop later to be an early orange or it may not, we do not know, I would advise testing them in a small way on different soil. 

Mr. Taber.—I would like to ask again what these two varieties are, as condi¬ 
tions were so unsettled we did not get them. 

Mr. Hart.—They are Trimble and 
VVeshart, I will give a few buds to any one who would like them; they are hybrids, crosses between the Parson 
Brown and Dancy Tangerine but are practically tangerines. I took it for granted that most of the members had read of them. As I cannot supply them by mail I take this opportunity.

No. 15. Will some one tell us what basic slag is and how much available phosphoric acid it contains ? Is it as good as lime to sweeten sour soils? 

Mr. Painter.—Basic slag is a by-pro¬ 
duct in the manufacture of iron. It is also known as odorless phosphate or 
Thomas slag. It was introduced into 
Florida about fifteen years ago but did not become popular. It was then manu¬ 
factured at or near Philadelphia but is no longer made there. Basic slag does not contain any water soluble phosphoric acid. 
About one-half of the total phosphoric acid is soluble in citrate of ammonia, be¬ 
ing tri-calcium phosphate or reverted phosphoric acid. It would be impossible to have water soluble phosphoric acid and lime in the same mixture as the lime would at once revert the phosphoric acid. Slag is good for sweetening sour land but lime is much cheaper. One ton of lime, will neutralize about seven times as much acid as one ton of slag.

PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 

TWENTIETH ANNUAL MEETING 

OF THE 

Florida State Horticultural Society. 


For the twentieth time the Florida 
State Horticultural Society held its annual meeting, and the place of meeting this time was within the gates of the delight¬ 
ful city of St. Petersburg. Owing to the poor schedules for getting to St. Peters¬ 
burg it was thought that only a small number of members would be at the open¬ 
ing session, but in this every one was dis¬ 
appointed. The first session was well at¬ 
tended, and each meeting up to the close the attendance was above the average. In fact, there were more members in attend¬ 
ance during this session than at any time since the meeting was held at Miami. So many of the members had never visited 
St. Petersburg or seen the Manatee sec¬ 
tion, therefore they were delighted with all they saw while on the trip, as well as entertained by the splendid program offer¬ 
ed. 

The good people of St. Petersburg 


chartered the Steamer Favorite and gave the members a delightful ride up the 
Manatee River. Owing to the rain no one was able to get off and view the country around, but they were able to put in the more time regaling the inner man with the good lunch the St. Petersburg people sent along and seiwed by the Ladies’ Im¬ 
provement Society. The brew of the coffee was perfection, the salads were su¬ 
perb, the sandwiches just right, and, a plenty of everything for everybody. 

The “next place of meeting” was an interesting topic and was frequently dis¬ 
cussed between meetings, in the boat, and whenever a few gathered together. When the voting time came, however, Gaines¬ 
ville won with a good majority and was announced as the next place for holding the twenty-first annual meeting of the 
Florida State Horticultural Society.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I presume it is one of the chief pleasures of the executive of any city to welcome the various bodies of people that gather in the city in convention or otherwise, 
and I assure you that it is an especial pleasure for me in this particular instance to welcome to our city this distinguished society; not alone for the honor you have conferred upon us by holding this con¬ 
vention here, but for the beneficial results we expect to^ derive from your presence among us, and your particular purpose here. I commend at all times any gather¬ 
ing together in convention of any repre¬ 
sentative body of people, because we all recognize the fact that it is the rubbing together of the minds and the study of our neig'hbors that brings advancement; 


and advancement is certainly the order of the day. 

We are all well aware of the fact that cultivation of the soil is the world’s great¬ 
est and most valuable industry, and we are also aware that there is vast room for a higher education of our people in this industry, and we look forward to beneficial results from these state con¬ 
ventions. I feel sure that the benefits we expect to derive from your gathering among us will be manifold, and for these reasons I extend to you the courtesies of our city, and assure you that we ap¬ 
preciate the presence of yourselves, and the importance of your purpose. The keys of the city are yours, and I trust that you will be able to remember with pleas¬ 
ure your stay with us. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. 


ADDRESS OF WELCOME ON BEHALF OF PINELLAS ORANGE- 

GROWERS’ ASSOCIATION. 


By Mr* A* F* Bartlett* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I was just congratulating myself that 
I was to escape having to make this ad¬ 
dress. The notice came to me a very short time ago that I would be expected to say a few words in place of the Presi¬ 
dent of the Pinellas Orange Growers’ 
Association, who was not able to be here on account of a sad calamity to some of 


his friends. . I had tried to persuade the 
Secretary that it was his place and duty to do this, but while I was attending to some important business connected with the Society, he conspired with the presi¬ 
dent and substituted me for himself. I 
have been at a loss to know how to get out of it. I supposed I had succeeded until I was just called on, so you will

understand how unprepared I am for this momentous occasion. 

I realize that we are before a body of representative people; people that I 
have learned to admire, and whose wis¬ 
dom I have been trying to drink in for a great many years. The splendid cour¬ 
age that has been manifested by the As¬ 
sociation during its twenty years of exist¬ 
ence (for this is its twentieth birthday we are gathered together tO' celebrate) is a remarkable thing. This organization has lived through all the disasters that have ever visited Florida since it has become a state of any importance—going back to the drought of 1890, the great freeze of 1894-95, the varieties of bugs and in¬ 
sects that have afflicted us, and everything you can think of to discourage an organ¬ 
ization devoted to this interest; but it is still in existence and doing business at the same old stand. 

The people who have done this are the class of people we meet here. I have lived in the West, in the states where they do not know the meaning of the word “fail,” some of the states standing high in the catalogue of industry and wealth, and a short time ago I read a statement in some journal that the peo¬ 
ple of South Dakota were making more money per capita than those of any other state in the Union. I was in that state at a time when contribution boxes were passed around in the city of Chicago to help the people of that state. I have known the troubles of other western states—Nebraska and others. They ap¬ 
pealed to the nation to help them out at their time of sorest need, but I have never known Florida to appeal to the nation or any organization to help her out in the time of great disasters. I think 


this is a credit to her and her people, and 
I am proud to claim a citizenship in the state. I am not recognized as a genuine 
“cracker,” but I hope to live long enough to be known as one; to be known as be¬ 
longing to their creed and their clan. 

The people forming this organization are the people who have been leaders in thought and action; they have, perhaps, 
represented the greatest industry in which 
Florida is engaged, and to them is due more than any other, perhaps, what we g'et out of the soil. They have done a splendid work. I mean by that, that the most important things we know about fruit culture, orange growing' and truck growing in this state, have been learned principally through this organization. 
This has been the leader, and has led the state, and as I see what things have been accomplished and see where we have been benefited, the more I see what is still to be done on these lines, and the more I 
feel the need of the people for an asso¬ 
ciation of this kind. 

I took out a life membership, because 
T was afraid that I might possibly not live long enough if I didn’t take out one, 
to be considered a member at all. I want to go-down on the records as a life mem¬ 
ber. 

x 4 s I think of the splendid work this 
Society has done, the more I am inclined to believe that we will overcome the great¬ 
er problems that are before us. It is a good thing for us to have these problems. 
If we were always fortunate in our deals, 
and sold our oranges and vegetables at a big price; if we had no trouble with the transportation companies, the white fly and other insects, we could come to¬ 
gether and have a “Hoorah,” but no¬ 
thing would come of it. It is in over- 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


•oming difficulties that we become strong and great, both as individuals and as a nation. We must always expect them and be ready to meet them. We have them now. We have just suffered one of the greatest droughts that ever visited the state of Florida, and we have suffered a great loss, but we are going right on just the same. We propose to do more than we have done in the past, and to bring our land up to the highest point of production. 

That brings up, perhaps, the problemi of irrigation, not only in orange culture, 
but in trucking. Those of us who have been through the West and know what irrigation has done for those states, be¬ 
lieve that there is a great future for Flor¬ 
ida. I think that we will be able to solve this great problem. We also have to consider the problem of getting our fruit and vegetables to market. These are some of the problems that I believe the 
Association can take up and can solve. 
I think we can take them up and have a hearing. Let us see to it that our agri¬ 
cultural schools and our experiment sta¬ 


tions are given an opportunity to work along the right lines. Let us see that our 
Legislature makes an appropriation that shall enable us to make our work of ten¬ 
fold more value than what we have al¬ 
ready accomplished. Let us put it up to the state to see that our agricultural schools and our experiment stations are supplied with the proper materials and opportunities to make their work of the greatest value. Let these come in closer contact with the farmer; let farmers’ in¬ 
stitutes be held everywhere, and be sup¬ 
plied with the paraphernalia to go on with these experiments which will enable the farmer tO' compete with all his enemies of heat and cold, insects and drought, 
These are some of the problems that come to the farmer or horticulturist, and I 
think this Association can, and should, 
and will, help him to solve them. 

Now, in the name of, and in behalf of the Pinellas Orange Growers’ Association and of the Board of Trade of the City of St. Petersburg, I extend to you all a most hearty welcome. 


RESPONSE. 


Df* George Ketft Pierson* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We come among you, not as strang¬ 
ers, but as friends. Permit me to say that it was a happy moment in my existence when, at last year’s meeting, 
I cast my ballot with the great major¬ 
ity to hold this year’s annual meeting in this place. We have many valuable members in St. Petersburg and vicin¬ 


ity; indeed, all over South Florida. 
They are valuable because of the untir¬ 
ing interest that is taken by them in the business of the Society, its increase of membership, its larger attendance at annual meetings, and also in the gen¬ 
eral welfare. 

These are strenuous times, when one is judged by what he can do and by

the “square deal.’' I take it, that this is our platform. What we can best do for the good of all, and the “square deal” between man and man. 

I am authorized to say on behalf of the president, officers and members of this Society, that we accept your dec¬ 
laration of fealty and appreciation of our efforts, with all their heartiness and fullness. They are a stimulant to a higher plane of usefulness and great¬ 
er devotion to duty. 

Horticulture as a business ranks second 


to none. It came forth in the morning when the sun first kissed the footstool of the Creator as the waters receded, 
and in splendor brought it into life. 
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our her¬ 
itage. It is no gewgaw, or a second handed article. It comes as the free winds of heaven, unheralded, unbound¬ 
ed, chaste. Thus, we lead the proces¬ 
sion of all other callings. 

I say unto you who are not members, 
come with us, and we will do you good. 


President's Annual Address. 


By Prof* P* H. Rolfs* 


Members of the Florida^ State Horticul¬ 
tural Society; Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Before presenting the address to the 
20th meeting of the Florida State Hor¬ 
ticultural Society, allow me to congrat¬ 
ulate the people of St. Petersburg on the splendid success they have attain¬ 
ed in building this beautiful city. It is only the periodic visitor to your city that notes the improvement and prog¬ 
ress. Those who call for the first time never knew it to be different, and those who are here always see the changes go on so gradually that it is rather a development than a metamorphosis. I 
wish also to congratulate the Pinellas 
Orange Growers’ Association on the frequent and instructive meetings they have held. This young Association will make its presence known and felt before the State Society adjourns. 

Amid all of these congratulations, 
we feel deep down in our hearts the absence of our late genial president, 
whose invaluable advice has guided us. 
Always ready as a peacemaker; fore¬ 
most among the progressive; just en¬ 
tering upon a wider and more useful life for his county and state. Personal¬ 
ly, it is a loss of a kind friend and an able counsellor. To the Society it is an irreparable loss. In this hour, 
when the shadow is over us, we cannot see the design. We can only bow our heads in meek submission, and meekly say, “Thy will be done.” I would urge 


every member of the Society to read again his masterly address, which came to us as a parting advice. Let me quote one paragraph from this address, which sums up the whole thought in a rounded expression: 

“I have felt strongly impelled at this meeting to press upon your attention these important matters. To give vent to the thought that has been growin®' 
in my mind for some years, that the most vital and far-reaching questions now calling for solution by Florida pro¬ 
ducers were not cultural questions, but commercial; not planting, but market¬ 
ing; not fertilizing, but transportation. 
Let us think about these things, talk about these, study them, conquer then 
If this thought, talk and study, take not the form of action, then have we labored in vain.” 

Those of the Florida Horticultural 

Society who are favored with informa¬ 
tion on the commercial side of horti¬ 
culture, especially with marketing and transportation, should come forward and discuss these problems, just as our chemists have come forward year by year and given us the best their labor¬ 
atories and brains afforded. The bota¬ 
nists, the entomologists, and the plant breeders, all have placed before us in¬ 
formation that required years of toil and untold disapjDointments, until our reports are quoted and looked up to a = 
standards, even in far-off India and New 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


23 


Zealand. What we need is a careful, 
concise, and methodical study of this subject from the commercial point of view. Prof. Tenny will present to us a paper dealing with some scientific features connected with transportation. 
Why can we not have an equally able pa¬ 
per discussing this from a commercial point of view? 

CHEMISTRY. 

I have confidence in the ability of this Society to study and master all problems connected with successful fruit growing. Almost from its birth, 
has it taken up problems for discussion and study that would have been consid¬ 
ered heretical b}^ the Old School Horti¬ 
culturists. The Society has certainly shown its adaptability to new conditions as they arose. 

Chemistry, one of the oldest sciences, 
was among the first to be laid under tribute by the advanced horticulturist. 
At one time it was thought that all causes for crop failure, excepting those arising from climatic conditions, could be discovered by an analysis of the soil. 
Hence, we were taught that a chemical analysis of the soil would tell us exactly what elements w^ere lacking, and what elements were present in too great abundance. The small amount of truth upon which these assertions were based gave sufficient grounds for voluminous articles to be written in a most lucid language. Unfortunately, the most voluminous writers were deficient in scientific training, and proficient in lit¬ 
erary work. These men were unable to understand the restricting language in which the scientists had stated their proposition. Consequently, they budd¬ 
ed up wonderful theories and hypoth¬ 
eses, all of which had to fall because their 


major premise was only partially cor¬ 
rect. Unfortunately for the true sci¬ 
entist and the receptive reader, it is frequently impossible for the lay read¬ 
er to distinguish between scientific fact and scientific fancy. The whole struc¬ 
ture, the scientific as well as the fan¬ 
ciful, fell into disrepute. This condi¬ 
tion led to such terms as ‘‘Book Farm¬ 
ers,” “Theoretical Farmers,” “News¬ 
paper Farmers.” 

“Truth crushed to earth shall rise again. The eternal years of God are hers.” 

After clearing away the debris, the foundation truth stood there firm and immovable. We have learned not to trust in the flimsy paper structure that some still try to erect. The basic truths, founded in the science of chem¬ 
istry, are so much a part of our knowl¬ 
edge now that there is no horticulturist in my hearing but would rise in just indignation should any legislator intro¬ 
duce a bill looking to the abolition of the office of State Chemist. There are still many discourses written which are purported to be founded on facts from the science of chemistry. Usually, these discourses imperfectly veil their ad¬ 
vertising nature. In addition to ad¬ 
vertising essays, we have the pseudo- 
chemical and pseudo-horticultural es¬ 
says constantly thrust upon us. These are often a serious menace to our prog¬ 
ress. They usually contain a few grains of truth in a stack of chaff. 

PHYSICS. 

One of the most recent departures from the old school horticulture is the study of soil physics, or a study of the soil from the standpoint of the physi¬ 
cist. At first thought it would seem difficult to form any connection be- 


24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tween pure physics and horticulture; 
but chemistry as a science concerns it¬ 
self with the composition and materials that make up the soils, while physics concerns itself about the make up and conditions under which these various materials are found. The border lands of these two sciences overlap one an¬ 
other, so that a field may be approached from the realm of chemistry on the one hand, and from the realm of physics on the other hand., and find savants from both kingdoms rightfully encamped on the same ground. Battles for the mas¬ 
tery of these overlapping fields some¬ 
times occur, resulting in loss of time, 
and sometimes a loss of temper; all of which is a loss to horticulture and should not be tolerated. There is real¬ 
ly no harm in exploring a field from as many points of view as possible, and frequently a very great gain to all con¬ 
cerned. The able 'address before this 
Society last year by Prof Blair, shows how little we actually know about what goes on in the soil from a physical point of view. We had all along felt that there was a considerable loss of fertil¬ 
izer from the soil, due to leaching; but had been told repeatedly by trust-wor¬ 
thy witnesses that potash and phos¬ 
phoric acid became fixed in the soil. It is now demonstrated from a physicist’s point of view that a considerable amount of fertilizer is actually washed out and carried into the static water in the soil, from which it is impossible to reclaim any considerable portion. 

SOIL PHYSIOLOGY. 

The chemist has told us faithfully what he found in his crucible. The physicist is likewise telling us how dif¬ 
ferent natural and inert materials be¬ 
have in the soil ; how the water 


moves; what effect different elements produce in the soil when applied; but all of this still leaves us in the dark as to what role different living subjects play in the economy of plant growth. 

For the solution of these problems we shall have to look to the soil bac¬ 
teriologist and botanist. I need here only to mention the rather recent work that has been done on the nitrifying organisms, or the organisms which en¬ 
able leguminous plants to make use of the atmospheric nitrogen. 

We have here three distinct sciences, 
chemiistry, physics, and botany, which are each laboring actively to subdue the same realm, the soil. These three, 
however much they may discover, 
v/ill not complete the work for us. 
What we shall need when these three have secured the vast store of scienti¬ 
fic information locked up in the soil, is the physiological botanist to tell us what effect a variation of these factors has on our cultivated crops. Of what use is it to us to raise an orange that turns even the stomach of an insect, or to raise a variety of celery that has such a thick epidermis that even a fun¬ 
gus cannot pierce it? 

FERTILIZERS. 

There probably never has been a meeting of this Society during which the question of fertilizers was not dis¬ 
cussed, and it is to be hoped that this 
Society will not let the question rest, 
until all superstition and misconcep¬ 
tions have been cleared away. This ideal state will not be reached however, 
until we know more about our soil; un¬ 
til we know more about the needs of our plants; and until we know our fer¬ 
tilizers. What we believe as true of certain elements today, may tomorrow 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


25 


be proven to be a fallacy; and our be¬ 
liefs of tomorrow may likewise on the following day be shown to be incorrect. 
Let me cite a single illustration. Dur¬ 
ing the early history of our Society, we found earnest and eloquent advocates of the use of ground rock phosphates as a fertilizer for citrus trees. These ad¬ 
vocates have either been converted to the use of soluble phosphates, or have been silenced. Ground rock is no longer being actively advocated by any one. 
Now comes Prof. H. J. Patterson, Di¬ 
rector of the Maryland Experiment 
Station. He used nine different chemi¬ 
cal fertilizers as sources of phosphoric 
‘acid—all that are ordinarily found on the markets. Included in this list are ac¬ 
id phosphate, dissolved bone black, 
bone black, raw bone meal, and Florida soft phosphate. The plots were laid off in the regular form which is usual for such work, the same chemical being applied year after year since 1895 to each plot, 
making eleven years of continuous use of the same chemical on each particular plot. Now comes the most startling part, his conclusions. Two of them are of special interest to us. The third of his conclusions is that,—“Insoluble phosphates produce a slightly higher total average yield than soluble phos¬ 
phates, and at about one-half the cost.’’ 
The sixth of his conclusions is that,— 
“Florida soft phosphate produced the best yield of corn.” Let us not, how¬ 
ever, conclude that the use of insoluble phosphates is the best for us. In these experiments annual plants alone were used, and the soil upon which the fer¬ 
tilizer was applied was clayey, and for the most part contained considerable humus. The conditions therefore, are not exactly the same as ours; but these 


experiments do show us the necessity for careful scientific work, even on sub¬ 
jects that we regard as closed questions. 

Wheeler and Adams of the Rhode Is¬ 
land Experiment Station, working un¬ 
der different conditions, find that ground rock (or floats) is the best form of phosphates for squash and better than any of the soluble or treated phos¬ 
phates for corn. 

COMBATING DISEASES AND INSECTS. 

The question of combating insects and of controlling diseases is as old as the fertilizer question, and both are old¬ 
er than our Society. We have publish¬ 
ed valuable contributions on both of these subjects annually. Whatever we have attempted has been carried to a full and creditable consummation. Every year we have advanced slowly but sure¬ 
ly. Sometimes our speakers have been a little too far ahead of the average, but the foremost have usually been abreast with the leaders. One of the leaders has not had a spraying machine in his grove for years. Last year there was a large exodus from the camp of sprayers to the camp of those who use the natur¬ 
al enemies for combating scale insects. 
We must look upon use of the spraying iD'aiterials for controlling, insects and fungus enemies as temporary expedi¬ 
ents, which for the most part under our present knowledge are unavoidable. In certain cases it is absolutely necessary to spray in order that we may avert certain failure, but we are gradually learning how to keep our groves and vegetable fields from getting into such distressing conditions. 

The natural method of combating scale insects is meeting with most flat¬ 
tering success, and can be economical¬ 
ly applied. It is far cheaper to keep a 


26 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


grove from becoming affected with die- 
back than to cure the disease. Many diseases and insects cannot be treated in a similar way economically, because we have not yet learned enough about them. The cottony cushion scale, 
which at one time seriously threatened the sub-peninsula, has been reduced to a negligible quantity by introducing the 
Ved'alia cardinalis, an Australian lady¬ 
bird. California spent thousands of dollars in attempting to subdue this pest by artificial means. 

CONCLUSION. 

It is our province as a Society to teach every member of this Association what to grow, and how to produce the best of everything. The old adage that, 
“There’s plenty of room on top”, was never more true than it is in horticul¬ 
ture today. The man who markets the best product never has to complain of poor prices. It takes brains to do this, 
and brains will count whenever they are correctly applied. Sometime ago we had a call from a gentleman from Michi¬ 
gan who controlled considerable capi¬ 
tal, according to his representations. 
He was in Florida with a view of in¬ 
vesting and had visited every vegeta¬ 
ble growing and fruit growing section, 
and closed his visit to the state by call¬ 
ing at the Experiment Station. We discussed the various crops. Citrus growing, in his opinion, was not desir¬ 
able, since it took a long time to get returns from the investment, and then he was also told that the whitefly at¬ 
tacked the trees. Peach growing was also discussed, but that was given up because peach trees had to be fertilized. 
One crop after another was passed in review, every one having some weak 


point. Celery growing he considered to be remunerative, but he had seen some fields destroyed by blight. Final¬ 
ly he said what he wanted was to learn of some crop that would not be frozen out; that did not need to be fertilized; 
that was free from insect attack and fungus infection. He was very confi¬ 
dent that this infoimation could be giv¬ 
en him at the Experiment Station, and so came to get it. The Director told him that this was a very easy propo¬ 
sition and advised the man to plant saw palmettoes. I do not want any vegetable or fruit that is not relished even by a bug, or one too tough to be attacked by fungus, or too hard to freeze. Give me the pineapple that has to be packed in excelsior to keep from being squashed in transit; give me the orange that has to be scraped with a wooden bladed knife to keep from in¬ 
juring the peel; give me the cauliflower that has to be wrapped in tissue paper. 

Horticulture is affected more or less by nearly every science, and by nearly every art. Every walk in life is affect¬ 
ed by the horticulture of the country, 
and in turn as we are able to take ad¬ 
vantage of the best of everything, will we be able to prosper. During some periods, our greatest needs lie in the direction of better methods for controll¬ 
ing insects. At other times, informa¬ 
tion on diseases is needed most urgent¬ 
ly. At one time we were in great need of information on fertilizers. It seems to me that what we are now needing most of all is information that will en¬ 
able us to put our crops into the hands of the consumer at the least possible cost. We need a sort of horticultural political economy. 


Report of Committee on Grapes, Figs and Persimmons* 


By P* J* Wister* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Appointed Chairman of the Committee on Grapes, Figs and Persimmons, I com¬ 
municated with the two other members of the commiittee, Mr. Bacon, of Ormond, 
and Mr. Steele, of Switzerland, for their co-operation with reports of the northern part of the state where my, experience with these fruits has. been none. The require¬ 
ments of these fruits and their culture have at a previous meeting of the Society been so well and ably discussed that it would be only a repetition of what others have already said tO' indulge on these points ; and I have, therefore, limited my¬ 
self to a report relative to our experience with these fruits on the lower east coast. 

The southeast end of the peninsula has been settled, as you all well know, at a comparatively recent date, and as the set¬ 
tlers were attracted more by the culture of citrus fruits and pineapples, the grapes, figs and persimmons have been practically neglected altogether. As a side issue to citrus and pineapple culture, 
the majority O'f settlers seem to havie taken tropical fruits, such as mangoes, 
avocadoes, guavas, etc. Only in a few isolated instances have I found anyone planting the fruits under consideration. 
Very little systematic culture has been given these fruits, and the following notes have been made from very few plants and not large plantings. 

Of grapes, a number of Eastern vari¬ 
eties, as well as vinifera, or California 


grapes, have been tried. The experience of all who have tried growing grapes is that severe pruning is injurious, causing the vine to die back; and this is no more practiced by those \Vho are acquainted with our local conditions. Most of the vines that I have noted of late are train¬ 
ed on a trellis, or overhead, allowing the vines to grow, pruning away only dead wood, which system is being practiced on a trial vineyard at the Subtropical 
Laboratory. Our experience has only confirmed that of others, that the vines fruit well the first two or three years, and after that begin to die back and set very little fruit. The vigor and adaptability of the difTferent varieties vary greatly. The vinifera grape, which has been more un¬ 
der my observation than the eastern grapes, is very much subject to attacks from blackrot and mildew. Only by fre¬ 
quent sprayings with Bordeaux mixture is it possible to obtain good fruit. Again, 
the berries mature very unevenly in the bunches, which tends to make the fruit less salable, and I consider it very doubt¬ 
ful whether we will ever find a vinifera grape that will prove satisfactory. I have not noted any insects attacking the grape severely enough to be called a pest. Mr. 
Thomas Spence, Buena Vista, Florida, 
who has had more experience with grapes in the lower part of the state than any other person I know, writes me: ‘‘General¬ 
ly speaking*, I am, as you know, through with trying vinifera grapes, as T think 



28 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the mildew and other fungoid troubles will not admit of growing them success¬ 
fully. Last year, as you know, was a very poor one for grapes, and there were none that could be said to succeed. The year previous there were some nice grapes on Black Hamburg, Brighton, Delaware, 
Duchess and one of Roger’s Hybrids ; 
but I don’t consider that any of them have made the growth this season to warrant us in expecting any satisfactory results. 
They all seem to die back without ripen¬ 
ing their new wood properly, and they are very capricious as to starting new growth in the spring.” 

The scuppernong has not, to my knowl¬ 
edge, been tried. The ‘‘Key” grape has been much spoken of at previous meet¬ 
ings, but in addition to dying back, sim¬ 
ilarly to other grapes, and ripening its berries very unevenly on the bunches, it is very inferior in quality, and not to be recommended for planting. The Angu- 
lata (a California grape) and Delaware are (from limited experience) so far the most promising varieties. The ancestors to our cultivated grapes are indigenous to temperate climate, and their descend¬ 
ants have all been accustomed to a resting season in the winter. For plants of this character the winters in South Florida are hardly cool enough for plants adapted to a colder climate, and it appears as if the introduced vines did not quite know whether to grow or not, throwing out feeble growths now and then, and not ripening the wood properly. 

There are frequently found vigorous wild vines in the hammocks that bear fairly good-sized bunches of very palata¬ 
ble grapes. I have, during the past two seasons, noted three vines that look very promising and are apparently immune to 


the two diseases above mentioned. In the interest of every grape lover in the state I would ask that anyone who knows of such vines would try to get cuttings and try hybridizing these with either Cali¬ 
fornia or Eastern grapes. We might, 
in this >vay, find a variety more wholly adapted to our climatic conditions than an introduced grape. I am particularly interested in the improvement of the grape by means of hybridization and crossing, 
and I would be glad to receive communi¬ 
cations from those acquainted with wild promiising- vines. 

In looking up the figs, I find that in the upper end of the county (Dade) trees that had been planted eight or more years ago had made good growth the first few years, but later died back, or are doing poorly. The cause has generally been ascribed to the presence of nematodes. 
While this may be the cause in some in¬ 
stances, I believe that improper treatment is the cause in others. In still others, 
that they are planted in an unsuitable location. In Miami there were young trees planted in 1903 that now stand 10— 
12 feet high, with a spread of ten feet, 
that last year bore well and looked very promising. These trees have received good attention. The fact that these trees are doing so well, and that the fig does well further up the state, seems to prove that the fault does not lie entirely with the nematodes, which are well distributed throughout the southern states where the fig is well established and yearly gives good crops. Fig culture is with us very much in the experimental stage, and there is apparently considerable difference in the adaptability of the different varieties. 
The fig will hardly attain commercial im¬ 
portance on the lower east coast in c®m-

petition with citrus and tropical fruits ; 
but there is nothing more delicious than a well ripened fig or preserves made from it, and every family ought to have a few trees for home consumption. 

A year ago the Subtropical Laboratory received a consignment of caprifigs from 
California, through the Department of 
Agriculture, of which some varieties did very well last year, when the freeze of last winter killed nearly all to the ground. 
They have sprouted very well, however, 
and are making rapid growth. The fruits of these figs are not edible, but the plants are necessary for the propagation of the 
Blastophaga, which again is necessary in the caprification of the Smyrna figs. 
Later on, when the caprifigs are well es¬ 
tablished, Smyrna figs will be tried and 
Blastophagas introduced from California where this insect is well distributed in the fig region. The progress of this experi¬ 
ment will be watched with much interest. 

Persimmons can scarcely be said to have had a trial in the lower east coast. 
I have seen remains of trees that were planted several years ago, but I am satis¬ 
fied that the failures in many instances lay with the cultivators. 

Trees that I know receive intelligent 


culture are now making good headway for their age (four years), and are this year bearing their first crop. The native persimmon grows wild on river banks and moist land, and there is apparently no reason why the Japanese persimmon should not do well budded on this stock. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Gibbs—What is the color of the leaf of that wild grape to which you re¬ 
fer? Is it the wild scuppernong? 

Mr. Wister—It is very similar. 

Mr. Gibbs—Over on the Indian River peninsula where I live, nearly opposite 
Melbourne, there is an interesting grape slowly getting a foothold among the wild scuppernong. The foliage is much lighter in color, and the fruit nearly as large as the Concord, and is a dark red. It is very acid, but it is the best jelly grape we have tried. It is not a true bunch grape, but often shows clusters of three to five berries. It is sometimes found bearing heavily, but generally seems to be a shy bearer. I have heard it called the 
“Missim” grape, but have suspected it was an escape from some of the Munsons that were brought in by Dr. Hall, an early settler.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I have very little to say on the subject of grapes, figs and Japanese persimmons. 
There was a time, years ago, when I was familiar with all the varieties of figs which are grown in Florida, and with most of the northern varieties of grapes. But for several years I was engaged in other 


business, which prevented me from keep¬ 
ing up my acquaintance with them. Du¬ 
ring the last three years, circumstances have enabled me to learn something of present conditions. But the subject has been so thoroughly and ably discussed by previous committees, that there is but lit¬ 
tle left to report. So far as I know, no

new varieties of any of these fruits have been introduced within the past year. 
Possibly it may be well to call attention to some facts in regard to grape culture in this state. There is no difficulty in making the vines grow, that is, the diffi¬ 
culties are only such as are tO' be met in the culture of any other fruit, and the vines of most varieties will ripen good crops, beautiful bunches of fruit of ex¬ 
cellent quality, and they will ripen at a time when no other grapes are to be found in the markets of northern cities. 

About twenty years ago, being at that time connected with the Florida Dispatch, 
I was in Orlando at the time when the first crop of fruit began to ripen on the vineyard of the Niagara Grape Company. 
In company with several gentlemen of 
Orlando, I went by special invitation to visit the vineyard, to inspect the vines and sample the fruit. We found thrifty vines bearing a good crop, fully as large as the age of the vines would warrant. 
The bunches were large and the berries beautiful in appearance, and of as good quality as the Niagara ever produces. Yet within a few years the vineyard was abandoned. I never heard the full partic¬ 
ulars, but understand that it was owing to the fact that the cost of transportation was so great that no profit was left for the growers. Another instance where the express companies put on a rate which was not what the traffic would bear, but enough to kill it, as it did the early at¬ 
tempts at peach growing. 

A little later, a number of Niagara vineyards were set out near Moultrie in 
St. Johns county. Within a few years they also ceased to ship fruit to northern markets, probably for the same reason. 
That these vineyards have not been en¬ 


tirely abandoned, is shown by the fact that last year the St. Augustine papers contained advertisements of wine made fromi Niagara grown at Moultrie. 

Possibly you may wonder why straw¬ 
berries can be profitably grown and ship¬ 
ped from Florida, when they must be sent in refrigerators, while grapes can go by ordinary express. The difference is that the strawberries reach the northern markets when there is a scarcity of fruit, 
while the grapes ripen in midsumm.er and must compete in the markets with rasp¬ 
berries, blackberries, cherries, etc.; con¬ 
sequently they will not sell for so high a price. 

Fig culture in Florida has never be¬ 
come a commercial success. The fruit is so soft, when ripe, that it cannot be shipped to a distant market. So far as 
I know, no effort has been made to in¬ 
troduce the Smyrna fig, from which the dried fisfs of commerce are made. Thev are being successfully grown in Califor¬ 
nia, and I see no reason why their cul¬ 
tivation could not also be made profitable in this state. 

The greatest drawback to profitable fig culture in Florida is the fact that the trees are very susceptible to the ravages of root- 
knot. As was shown in the address of 
Prof. E. A. Bessey before this society last year (see the annual report for last meet¬ 
ing), the only remedy for this trouble is to starve out the nematodes which cause it. 

Japanese persimmon trees grow thrifti¬ 
ly and bear large crops of fruit. Yet very few have succeeded in making the culti-r vation profitable. The chief reason foF 
this is the fact that the fruit is yet so new in market that very few have ac¬ 
quired a taste for it; hence the demand

is small. But the same trouble exists that prevents grapes from being profitable— 
the transportation charges eat up all the profits. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Skinner—I would like to ask on what ground figs gTow best in South 
Florida. 

Mr. Wister.—On what w« would call low pine lands. The trees that I men¬ 
tioned in my report have been grown on low pine lands and cultivated the same as you would citrus trees. 

Mr. Skinner—I am fond of canned figs and would like to grow enough so that I could have a mess of figs oc¬ 
casionally. I have never been success¬ 
ful with figs grown on pine land, and thought of starting in on hammock land, and wondered if I could do it suc¬ 
cessfully. 

Mr. Wister—I see no reason why the figs should not do well on ham¬ 
mock land. 

Mr. Gibbs—I have only grown figs on a small scale, but in 1904 when I 
began planting, I found it stated in a nursery catalogue that the fig would not stand cultivation in Florida, and should be planted by the side of build¬ 
ings, or the ground under it be covered with planking or some equivalent; sO' I 
gave mine the protection of the fat coquina rocks. For one fast-growing 
White Adriatic, I disregarded Prof. 
Hume’s advice and laid a floor of an ever-widening circle of saw palmetto roots under it from stem to tips of outer branches, but it grows almost too fast for me. I have to keep carry¬ 
ing to it more big palmetto roots, and don’t know as I can find enough to prevent the tree’s escape by rapid ex¬ 


tension of its root system. And as for the figs, they are the finest figs I ever saw. 

Mr. Hubbard—In relation to grapes, 
I have heard that in addition to the great expense of transportation, the chief drawback in Niagaras is that the grapes will not adhere to the bunch, 
but drop off in great numbers and spoil the appearance of the fruit before it reaches the northern market. This, of course, very much affects the sale. 

Prof. Rolfs—Mr. Winters, can’t you tell us something about those experi¬ 
ments you tried on the kaki? 

Mr. Winters—American travellers returning from Japan have frequently told us about Japanese methods of fer¬ 
menting the persimmons. Almost without exception, these travelers have spoken in the most complimen¬ 
tary terms of the advantages to the fruit from this process. Briefly stat¬ 
ing, the process as practiced in Japan is to secure used saki casks. Roughly speaking, the Japanese saki corres¬ 
ponds very well to what we know as beer in this country. The Japanese secure used saki kegs, remove the head, 
and then pace in it the persimmon fruit. Care is taken by the Japanese horticulturist to select the fruit that has turned red but still very firm. We are told that much of the success in fer¬ 
menting kaki in this way depends on the expertness of the person who does the fermenting. First, in the matter of selecting the fruit, when it is suffi¬ 
ciently matured, and not over matur¬ 
ed; and second, in removing it from the casks at a time when it has fermented sufficiently. With a view of finding out something about this method, 
some experiments were taken up at 




32 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the Experiment Station last year with persimmons in different stages of ripe¬ 
ness. As saki casks could not be ob¬ 
tained, glass jars were taken in place of these, and alcohol was substituted for the saki fumes. 

The fruit used in this experiment were of the Costata variety. All of the fruit were mature, but still hard and totally unfit for eating at that time. 
The lot was made up of three grades according to stage of maturity. First, 
a lot of slightly bruised fruit which had been gathered for a few days and would have been ripe naturally in about three days; second, a lot of fruit that had been stored for a few days with the ripest fruit gathered on the date of experiment, most of which would have ripened naturally in about five days; and third, a lot of the firm¬ 
est fruit, which was fresh from the tree that day and which would have ripen¬ 
ed naturally in about a week or ten days. Equal quantities were weighed and placed in ten lots, sO' as to have the fruit in each lot as nearly the same size and stage of maturity as possible. 

We then prepared ten 2 1-2 gallon jars in which to do the fermenting. 
Glass was chosen because this would enable us to make observations from time to time without opening the ves¬ 
sels; and also because it does not give off any gas or liquid as wood might even absorb liquid or gas. Eight of these jars were then prepared by plac¬ 
ing some absorbent cotton in the bot¬ 
tom, to which had been applied approx¬ 
imately I oz. (25 cc—of 95 per cent, 
alcohol. A glass plate was placed over the cotton to keep the fruit from com¬ 
ing in contact with the alcohol and yet allow the gas of the alcohol to rise and 


fill the jars. The jars were then ready for the fruit, which was carefully placed. Another set of glass plates large enough to cover the jars were then placed on, being made fast and air-tight by paraffin. Two aquaria, to be used as checks, were prepared without the use of alcohol. Each jar was numbered, the stage of maturity of the fruit in each being noted. These were allovfed to stand away from the direct sunlight for nine days when one of the checks and a representative number of the others were examined. 
They were then examined every two days. 

In the two check lots, there was no external change to be noted in the fruit, except a gradual ripening which was shown in the darkening of the fruit. 
When one of these was examined, 
after standing nine days, the fruit was mellow and some of them even soft, but none of them were entirely free of the puckery taste. As the rip¬ 
ening continued, they became very soft before the astringent quality dis¬ 
appeared, and at this time the fruit had begun to mold. There was no striking internal change in color, ex¬ 
cept the natural darkening as the fruit became ripe. 

Among the fruit treated, the least mature fruit gave the best results. In the two aquaria containing the least mature specimen, the fruit remained very firm, was in excellent condition after sixteen days’ standing, and kept very much better than the riper fruit which was carried through the same process. When examined after the nine days, they were mellow through and through, and were free of the as¬ 
tringent flavor. The sickening sweet

33 


flavor of the naturally ripened fruit w^as replaced by a pleasant sub-acid fla¬ 
vor. 

It was in the g-reenest or firmest lot that the least external change and the greatest internal change took place. 
After sixteen days’ standing in the closed jars, this lot was entirely firm and the flesh was of a darker and richer color than those of the same stage not fermented. They were free from the puckery quality. It was a flavor that one would not as readily become tired of as in the case of the naturally rip¬ 
ened fruit. 

From this experiment, it is shown beyond a doubt that the fruit is im¬ 
proved by this process. It also clearly shows that tO' obtain the best results fresh, firm fruit, free from bruises, 
should be used. The fermented fruit keeps much better in closed vessels than when exposed to the air. We would suggest, therefore, that the fer¬ 
mentation vessels be so constructed as to allow them to be closed after a portion of the fermented fruit has been removed. 

Mr. Gibbs—Had the fruit used in your experiments ripened to its natur¬ 
al color? 

Mr. Winters—No, sir. It was firm and totally unfit for eating. 

Mr. Gibbs—A good many of them get their full color before they are fit for eating. 

Mr. Winters—This was not that va¬ 
riety. 

Mr. Rowe—What can I do to pre¬ 
vent my persimmons from losing nine¬ 
ty-five per cent, of their fruit after they are set? 

Mr. Hollingsworth—I have always found that non-cultivation is the best 

3 


for the persimmons. I have lost all my fruit by cultivation. 

Mr.-Do you fertilize? 

Mr. Hollingsworth—Where you find persimmons growing naturally, I think it is a mistake to fertilize. Persim¬ 
mons have off years, and some years they will produce heavily, while the very next year their yield will be very scanty. 

Mr.-What about mulching? 

Mr. Penny—Mulching is beneficial. 
The persimmon feeds almost on top of the ground. The roots spread out almost at the surface of the ground and where you use the mulch it gives them a chance to feed on the surface right where the roots are. It gives'the nat¬ 
ural conditions of the hammocks and low places where they grow naturally. 

Mr. Rowe—Do you have any trouble from dropping under the mulch system of culture ? 

Mr. Penny—When we have a heavy crop, we usually lose about nine-tenths of the crop and still have too much. 
I have seen our trees, breaking to pieces with the fruit on them, and at the same time they have lost nine-tenths of their bloom. I have shipped several thousand crates of persimmons, but we have cut the trees all down except a few on the outside of the grove. There is not enough money in them commer¬ 
cially in comparison with the citrus fruits such as oranges and grape fruit. 
There is also the same trouble with persimmons as that mentioned by Mr. 
Hubbard about grapes; they come in competition with northern fruits, and the transportation costs us too much for the prices realized by the fruit. We find that the persimmon grows well with us, and I cannot think of another 




34 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


crop in which we can do as well in the quantity of fruit produced. 

Mr. Bush—Do you cultivate these persimmons before using the mulch, 
or after? 

Mr. Penny—'Absolutely we do not cultivate. Sometimes, though, we work over the land with a mowing ma¬ 
chine to keep the weeds down. 

Mr. -What kind of land is 

best ? 

Mr. Penny—Low, flat woods that has been drained. 

Mr.-What distance apart? 

Mr. Penny—For persimmons, the trees grow well when set about 20 feet apart; 20 feet in the rows and 25 feet apart. They grow to be large trees 
25 to 40 feet high if they are not dam¬ 
aged. Their wood is very brittle and a heavy wind will break it down, espe¬ 
cially where it is loaded with fruit. We find another difficulty in persimmon.s. 
We Lould get a great deal more money for them if they could ripen on the trees, but the birds are very bad and will ruin a great deal of fruit. Then again, if there is a wet weather, the fruit begins to crack, and that ends the fruit for shipping purposes. 

Mr. -What form of fertilizer 

do you consider the best? 

Mr. Penny—I should say any good orange tree fertilizer that you would use for bearing groves would be ex¬ 
cellent for persimmons. 

Mr. Painter—Usually the best fer¬ 
tilizer for persimmons is one contain¬ 
ing' Ixit little or no ammonia. One of two per cent, of ammonia; eleven to twelve per cent, of potash and eight to nine per cent, available phosphoric ac¬ 
id, to be made from sulphate ammonia. 


Low grade sulphate potash and high grade acid phosphate. 

Mr. -What is the nature of 

your soil and sub-soil? 

Mr. Penny—Our soil is low, flat woods. The land was originally well timbered. The soil is rather dark and has a depth of three or four feet, I sup¬ 
pose. Occasionally we find a little 
“hard pan” as we call it, but it seems to be in spots. 

Mr. Gibbs—Did you say you under¬ 
drained that land? 

Mr. Penny—Not with under drains, 
but with open ditches. As I under¬ 
stand “under-drain,” it means pipes under the soil. We have to do that with our orange groves in places. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—In California, 
there is what is called the “muscat” 
grape and I would like to know if any¬ 
one in the State has made a success of raising it in Florida. It is the best grape I ever tasted. 

Prof. Rolfs—Lots of people have made a failure of it. But to come back to the persimmon question; it seems to me that it would facilitate our shipping and the sale of the persimmon very considerably if we can put into general practice the process described by Mr. 
Winters. It seems to me that the question of keeping this fruit for a practicable time is simply excluding the air. That is all this process amounts to. The alcohol or rather the fumes of alcohol, was used to fill up the spaces in the jars that otherwise would have been occupied by the air. The persim¬ 
mons subjected to this process were better than when allowed to ripen nat¬ 
urally because of the absence of the too sickish taste that frequently accom¬ 
panies a dead ripe persimmon. 











Report of Committee on Citrus Fruits. 


By G* M* Wakclin, Lane Park* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen '. 

After conferring* together the com¬ 
mittee decided that every member should present an individual report on whatever of interest had come to his attention. There appeared to be no particular phase of the topic for discus¬ 
sion and besides it was doubtful wheth¬ 
er more than one member could be present. 

The past eight or nine months have tried the soul of the orange grower. 
The usual fall^ drought spread over the whole winter and then, merged with the expected spring drought, has given many sections of the state the driest time known for years. The wonderful vitality of the orange trees has brought them through and will enable them, 
when properly helped by judicious care and fertilizing, soon to repair the dam¬ 
age. The effects however will be only too evident in a shortage of the com¬ 
ing crop and, where.-groves have suf¬ 
fered very severely, will reduce their blooming next February. 

Well, the lesson is—irrigate. Pipe is high and advancing all the time but it is not nearly so expensive as buying- 
fertilizer at $30 to $40 a ton to make bloom and fruit only to have it all fall off. The harrow is a wonderful irri¬ 
gator and mulching is also very helpful but both are limited and the grower finds he must add water to the soil or else stand by and see the bloom and 


fruit he worked so hard to get cover the ground. Especially is watering necessary in old groves where the trees are large and often too close together. 
Many of the trees of which I have charge are in this category and had they not been watered they surely would have died. I hope the commit¬ 
tee on irrigation has some new s.ggges- 
tions as to methods of irrigation. 

In addition to the long continued drought the poor orange groves had a freeze to contend with last December. 
It seemed as if-Jack Frost had a partic¬ 
ular grievance against those who had tried to escape him by migrating from the old orange belt to the southern counties. But in the eastern half of 
Lake county where I am located there was slight damage done. The tem¬ 
perature with us did not fall below 27 
degrees and fruit was uninjured. In many parts of the state however orang¬ 
es were badly frozen and alas! shipped to market as sound fruit. A suspicion was thus cast upon sound fruit even when under a guarantee, and buyers generally took advantage of the situa¬ 
tion to keep prices down to a frozen level. I am informed that up to a few days ago grape fruit that had been dam¬ 
aged by frost was still going into the 
Philadelphia market. Unless a grower has a particular trade to supply through some commission man it certainly will not pay him to consign fruit, however

sound it may be, after there has been a freeze in the state. 

We need to give more attention to hardy varieties. Trifoliata stock is not a success in light soils so its cold resist¬ 
ant qualities are not always available. 
But there is a variety of orange that is cold resistant and thrifty above the or¬ 
dinary. This is the Jaffa. Its heavy, 
thick, vigorous foliage protects its branches admirably, it bears, even while young, good crops of heavy, fine flavor¬ 
ed fruit that is sweet early in the fall and will hang on until late in the spring. 
The Jaffa has not had the recognition of its value to which it is entitled. It is unfortunate that so many of the trees planteli years ago are of no particular variety but just orange, like the man’s hound that was mostly 'Just dog.” 
Such trees not infrequently are charac¬ 
terized by second grade fruit and not much of that. 

In uniformity of quality of product 
California is away ahead of vis despite the fact that a good Florida orange is without a peer, here or abroad. In 
California the growers are effectively organized, and the various citrus un¬ 
ions exercise a strict supervision over the fruit marketed. Fruit in any way inferior is not shipped. We need to campaign toward this end and a higher sense of honor among shippers. There is too much green and frosted fruit shipped from Florida. The state is getting the name of shipping inferior oranges. 

Have any members had experience with what has been called tuberose blooming ? Sometimes trees young or old will put on, on a few branches, close packed bloom enough to cover the whole tree if properly distributed. 


Such bloom always sheds off leaving the tree bare of oranges. It is a serious matter for trees to so expend their en¬ 
ergy to no purpose. What is the cause of this and what can we do to make a tree properly distribute its bloom? 

As a mere curiosity I am going to place on the table a freak orange of some good qualities. It was discovered among some tardiff trees. While it has the navel feature it is quite seedy. But the skin is thin and silky and the flavor of the pulp really excellent. In form it is very flat so that the secondary or¬ 
ange within extends well above the me¬ 
dian line. This report is well estab¬ 
lished as there are a number of trees which bear this kind and no other. If the seeds could be educated out of it we would have a new navel of superior quality. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Penny—I would like to ask Mr. 
Wakelin more about that bloom he spoke of. We had last year on our tangerine trees a good deal of bloom that appeared to be very short—the bloom buds. Is that the way yours were? 

Mr. Wakelin—No, I never knew tangerine trees to do that. The bloom has been distributed over them. Other trees- would put on sometimes fifty blooms all on the terminal shoots, but they would not amount to anything because they all fell off. For all the good such blooming does us, the tree might just as well be dead. The blooms this spring resembled bridal wreath more than an orange tree. There was an exceedingly heavy bloom. 

Mr. Thornton—I have noticed that the trees are full of bloom—almost like the bridal wreath as Mr. Wakelin says, and this after the dry weath- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


37 


er we have had, too. I think it is the dry weather causes it. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—I wish to ask if this is the case this season more than usual. 

Mr. Wakelin—Our trees have al¬ 
ways done more or less of it, and I 
have not thought it was on account of the dry weather. We had a drought from the first of February to the first of April. Previous to their bloom they were not suffering for water. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—My experience on these lines has been simply and purely practical. I have corns on my hands like a small boy has on his heels because I have got right down and worked with my men. I think the same rules apply to the orange trees in 
Florida as to the peach and apple trees in Western Missouri, where I was rais¬ 
ed. I have found that any abnormal condition such as dry weather, or any¬ 
thing like that will produce an abnor¬ 
mal condition of the tree. If a limb is injured by rubbing or chafing, it tries to reproduce itself and perhaps goes to the other extreme in order to establish its. equilibrium. We had an old apple tree back in Missouri that had never borne, and it had a spot on it that I thought made a pretty good target, and I shot at it, and after that, 
it bore. I think a tree tries to offset the injurious effects and many of them will bloom out fully and never show that it is in an abnormal condition. 

Mr. Wilson—I would like to ask if the same thing happened all over the 
State that happened in my grove this year. An insect appeared, we call it the ‘hhrip” at Gainesville. I noticed it this year for the first time. It is a tiny insect resembling the hen mite. 


It looks like what comes in the rose in the spring and makes them blight. 

I was so very anxious about the grove and bloom on account of the drought that I suppose I noticed the bloom more than usual, and I think it is the same thing we call thrip, which de¬ 
stroyed die strawberry crop around 
Gainesville about ten years ago so that there have been absolutely none raised on account of it. 

I would like to say while I am up that my grove is like the grove the gentleman spoke of; the trees were heavily loaded with bloom, but we had no rain and I devised a scheme to water them. I went down with four teams and stopped at Ocala and got whiskey barrels and put them on the wagons and applied three barrels of water to each tree while the trees were in bloom and thought I had solved the problem of making the fruit stick. 
Now, the oranges vary in size from one the size of the end of a lead pencil to nearly a full grown orange, and they have never stopped dropping from the time they started. At what period can you tell when the fruit that is on is going to stay on? When can you safe¬ 
ly estimate your crop? 

Mr. Taber—I think there is one thing we should have settled. Did he thoroughly wash out those whiskey barrels before he began to water the trees. 

Prof. Rolfs—And I think we ought to know whether he got them from 
Ocala or Gainesville. 

Mr. Neil—I would like to ask Mr. 
Wilson if it was after that that the thrip did any harm. 

Mr. Wilson—I think it was before. 
I think there would have been a good 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


3)5 

many more if it had not been for the thrip, because they got into the bloom before they cracked open, and I expect in many cases they cracked the bloom. 
I noticed when the orange began to show itself, it was a very pale yellow, 
and I believe the thrip destroyed the life of the bloom. 

Mr. Neil—He asked when* he might estimate his crop. I have had some experience in that line, and I would say that the best time to estimate your crop is the day before you go to sell. 
There are so many circumstances that may affect your crop at any time, that it is difficult to say just when you can estimate with any degree of certainty. 
Now, about that dropping he speaks of. I have my very serious doubts whether a tree ever drops any more fruit than it ought to. We used to have these annual droughts; it was exceptional to go through a season without one and we used to fret a great deal about them. I used to water a great deal, but never saw that I had any more fruit than my neighbors who did not water at all. I don’t believe that a tree ever throws off any more than it should. 

Mr. Longley—I have had a little ex¬ 
perience with thrip. Year before last, 
I had considerable thrip in my bloom, 
but I had a good crop notwithstanding. 
Last year I saw a lot of it, and sent for some thrip juice. I sprayed my trees in the bloom and it cut off about half my crop. The thrip punctures the lit¬ 
tle orange when the bloom opens and you will often notice that the bloom be¬ 
fore it opens is punctured as though you had stuck a needle through it. You will find in one bloom a hundred of these little punctures. I believe we 


will have a pretty good crop of iruit this year, however. 

Mr. Wakelin—We notice our orang¬ 
es sometimes fall off after they are pretty well grown, and of a bright green color and glossy. They fall off and leave their stems on the tree. It looks as though something had gotten between the stem and the calyx and pried it off. You cannot see anything the matter with the orange, and the tree has not suffered for watei> either. 

Mr. Penny—I would like to ask the gentleman if he had a good crop of fruit after these fell off. 

Mr. Wakelin—No', I don’t think so. 
They robbed the tree. I notice often times where these oranges fell off, 
they would be the only ones on the ends of twigs and should not have fall¬ 
en off, for they had no neighbors to crowd them. 

Mr. Hubbard—The thrip has always been present with us more or less since 
I began orange culture some twenty- 
five years ago. Most seasons it has very little effect on the fruit. The thrip seems to get at and feed on the honey that is secreted at the base of the orange. In some cases, the thrip may be a benefit in mixing the pollen. 
I do not think it does much damage except to mar some specimens of fruit. 
They sometimes gnaw snaky, little tracks that run around on the peel.. 

As to the abnormal growth. I think it is caused by shock to the tree. The bloom and the foliage start from the same class of embryo and it depends on the condition of the tree at the time when that embryo is formed whether it will produce leaves or bloom. It depends largely on the climatic condi¬ 
tions. If the shock by cold is great.

it may go to an excess of bloom, and if a drought comes on, it may make more foliage than bloom. An exces¬ 
sive crop is usually caused by some shock, disease or starvation. 

Mr. Hume—I do not believe that anything done at the time of bloom has much effect. I am inclined to believe that shock is caused to the tree by cold, drought or some such climatic condition. As far as Mr. Wilson’s plan of watering is concerned, I think he should have started watering long be¬ 
fore he did, and done it about twice a week. I think his labor was all wasted. 
I think to get a good crop of fruit to hold on the tree, you should begin back a long time previous to the time that the bloom comes on. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—I experimented on the watering question this year for the first time. We had a rain nine weeks ago that caused the bloom to come out in just a few days. Certain parts of my grove were in full bloom and then we had nine weeks drought, 
and the trees were going to cast their bloom. I took a coal oil barrel, and excavated around each tree in a circle some six or eight feet. We designated six tangerine trees that were heavy in bloom. I gave three barrels of wa¬ 
ter to them as rapidly as it would soak down and then filled the excavation up with dry dirt so as to hold the mois¬ 
ture. Those trees have set a very good crop of fruit. I have the nucleus of an old grove of about forty-five trees that are about forty-five years old. They have had foot rot, die back, etc. (let me remark in passing that a neighbor of mine said his grove was of no use until the foot rot got into it) but still bear¬ 
ing very heavily. I watered a few of 


these trees at the same time we ex¬ 
perimented with the younger stock and find the same holds good in both cases. 
Through the middle of tlii's grove is a ridge, and on the slope of this ridge I 
had put out about a hundred sweet seedlings some six years ago. This drought overtook these seedlings. 
They shed their leaves in the tops two- 
thirds of the way down and directly after the rain, within a week, they put on a bloom. We had watered the trees in the middle of the first drought, and when the rain came, they were so vig¬ 
orous they reacted again. The second drought caused them to cast that bloom, and then about ten or fifteen days ago they put out a right good bloom, which set the second time on the same limb. That is a freak I can¬ 
not explain. They have shed oft* their 
J^loom and formed oranges about the size of peas and we believe they are go¬ 
ing to stick. 

Dr. Richardson—I have been much interested in the discussion, and I am particularly interested in the talk of 
Mr. Hollingsworth. I am inclined to think from his talk that the thinking he has been doing has made corns on his brains as much as hard work has made them on his hands. 

An eminent physiologist, when ask¬ 
ed what time he would begin treatment of a childl to make it a healthy, well de¬ 
veloped human being said he would go back one or two generations before the child was born. I think that applies to orange trees as well. It has been argued that the injury which the trees have received has been the the cause of excessive bloom. It has also been intimated that shooting into a tree or doing anything to bring

about an abnormal condition will cause bloom. I think our present difficulty can be traced back to the cold of last 
December. I am of the opinion that it was this that produced the abnormal bloom, and is more to blame than the drought from which we are all suffer¬ 
ing. I think that this cold left the trees in an improvident condition, but that when they recover from the shock they received last winter, they will again at¬ 
tend to business. I don’t think there is anything to worry about. 

Mr. Neil—I presume this will not end the discussion or get off the sub¬ 
ject of irrigation. I am afraid that if. 
it took as much as three barrels of water to a tree once a week and we had to apply that three months before the bloom and four months after, it would not be a practical proposition. I have • 
always been opposed to irrigation be¬ 
cause I 'do not believe that orange trees throw off any more fruit than they ought to throw off. I think an orange tree knows how much fruit it can bear and bring to maturity, and if you force it to maintain and ripen more fruit than it is able to, it is an irrepara¬ 
ble injury to the tree. We are supposed to have two of the best groves in. the eastern part of the coun¬ 
ty and I do not apply exceeding over one barrel of water, and that only once a week or ten days. Rain water is the best to use, lake water is the next and artesian water is the last. I have some trees pretty well loaded with fruit, but our watering them did not save their fruit, but kept the trees in fine condi¬ 
tion. I did not begin to water until the bloom had appeared. We are in hopes of having the second bloom, and 


I think we will have two-thirds of a crop in the State this year. 

Mr. Skinner—I would like to know how much of a crop we have, from the orange growers’ standpoint and the sellers’ standpoint. We ought to be able to get at a pretty accurate idea of how much of a crop we will have. 
I would like to have the men from the different sections get up and say what percentage of a crop they think they will get. 

I have tried the kerosene barrel method—not the whiskey barrel—and have abandoned it. If. Mr. Neil will go back to the season of 1897-98, he will remember that the drought at that time, was fully as bad as the one we have just had. Around Sutherland and Dunedin whole regions of pine woods and oak woods died. I tried to save my crop with barrels, and worked hard. I poured water under my trees, 
and my neighbor across the fence did not do anything, and when the time came to bear, his bloomed and mine didn’t. If you don’t water at the right time, don’t do it at all. My experience is that an irrigating plant nearly pays for itself every year you put it in. 

Mr. Stevens—I have tried a little watering, and I find that it keeps the wilt off the leaves and keeps the trees in growing condition, but some of the fruit is on the trees, and some on the ground. I don’t think they have drop¬ 
ped more than is necessary for them to drop. 

Mr. Sampson—I want to speak about a particular kind of dropping. 
Even where the growth appears per¬ 
fectly vigorous and healthy, the fruit will drop off, but the stem and calyx will remain green and will draw nour-

ishment from the tree all through the season. It is not a natural drop, but something is the matter with the tree. 
No insect work as far as can be seen, 
but a sap disease apparently. 

Mr. Waite—In speaking of this dropping. Last year, I think we had as normal conditions as we ever had in Florida; a warm winter, plenty of rain, and one of the heaviest blooms I 
have ever seen. The trees were white, 
we had a good crop of fruit set, but about the first of May we had for about ten days a cold wind from the east. 
The nights were very cold. Immedi¬ 
ately after, we found that our trees were shedding their fruit and the same conditions existed as mentioned by the • 
gentleman. The stems were green and kept green during the entire season. I 
was speaking to one of the oldest growers in that section, and he stated that in 1898 the same conditions ex¬ 
isted. Our crops were heavily dam¬ 
aged by the fruit shedding after that cold east wind. I find in some seclud¬ 
ed places in our groves (where they had protection) we had a good crop of fruit, while where the wind had a good sweep the trees had only about one-third of a crop. Where we expect¬ 
ed 75,000 boxes we had only 25,000. 

Mr. Willis—I am not old in the or¬ 
ange industry; only about four years. 
We put in a twenty-horse power en¬ 
gine and ran pipes all over the grove. 
We irrigate about every ten days. The trees are in fine condition and holding their crop very well. We began ir¬ 
rigating early in March, and our trees look as good as they would if condi¬ 
tions had been favorable, and growing all the time. 

Mr. Skinner—I would like to hear 


from Mr. Hume and Mr. Rolfs about that calyx dropping. I don‘t believe that the east wind does it. I am losing thousands of dollars right now. 

Prof. Rolfs—So far as I have worked upon it, I find that there is an irritat¬ 
ing agent there that gets in between the orange and the calyx. Under cli¬ 
matic conditions, such as drought, cold, 
etc., it would shed off below the pedun¬ 
cle so that there would be no calyx left on the tree. My scientific work has been limited to the small fruit, not larger than a hazel-nut and at that time I 
could not get the fungi that caused the fruit to drop to infect the fruit. After the fruit arrives at about the size of a hazel-nut, from this time until the fruit is colored, there seems to be a period of immunity. It is possible that this east wind or other cold wind has a de¬ 
pressing effect upon the plant and al¬ 
lows these fungi to infect and knock them off. 

Mr. Hart—I would like to air my views on these subjects, too. Accord¬ 
ing to my little experience, I think that the distance between the trees in a grove has a great deal to do in decid¬ 
ing whether it needs irrigation in a dry time, or not. My trees are mostly set twenty feet apart, some of them thirty. One of the groves has the trees set eighteen feet apart; that is on a piece of ground that has some oyster shells in it. At times, a few of these trees have the dieback, and I think for the past two years, to correct this, 
I have hardly put a cultivator in it. 
We had a dry spell as you all know coyering six months, and it was not broken until lately. On that grove, 
some of the oranges got soft, so that they began to drop from the trees in

.February, so I started to pick them. 
Perhaps I got two hundred boxes of soft fruit and I threw out what we could not ship and sold the rest at 
$2.00 a box. That, no doubt, was the result of the drought, and I am con¬ 
vinced that non-cultivation and close planting had a great deal to do with it. The trees are large ones, interlock¬ 
ing their limbs and roots so as to oc¬ 
cupy all available space. In my other groves, the trees have come through in fine shape; they show little curling of their leaves and have a good setting of fruit today. If there is a drought on, I would cultivate often and keep the surface very fine where this does not interfere with treatment of dis¬ 
eased conditions. You know it has been said that two cultivations are equal to a rain. 

The planting of trees according to the new horticultural method, which 
I suppose you all understand as the 
Stringfellow method, is also a matter 
I would like to speak about. Quite a number of years ago, our former presi¬ 
dent, Mr. Adams, and myself met Prof. 
Budd, who was one of Mr. Stri ngfel- 
low’s first converts, at an American 
Pomoloo'ical Societv Convention in 

o 

Washington, and we went over the ground thoroughly. Soon after, we planted according to this new method experimentally. On uncultivated ground, it is claimed to work finer than where the ground has been thorough- 
1 }^ cultivated beforehand. The roots put down and go deep and do not suf¬ 
fer from drought; the fruit is finely and highly colored, and will stand ship¬ 
ping better, according to the claims* of its advocates. I planted some of them by the Stringfellow method and, some 


of them by the old method in alter¬ 
nate rows, and during this drought those trees planted by the Stringfellow method have come through and show but very little harm from the drought, 
while the alternate trees set by the old method have suffered some. I think the conditions have been exactly the same except the difference in the meth¬ 
od of planting. Those trees have been planted at least eight years, long enough to have them; sho'w definite re¬ 
sults. 

Mr. -What is the size of the 

tree? How do they compare? He 
(Mr. Stringfellow) claims a larger growth. 

Mr. Hart—It is rather in favor of the 
“new horticulture” style of setting trees. I went over them just a short time before coming here to note that particularly, and it is in favor of those set out by the Stringfellow method, 
though not very marked. The ground in both styles of planting was thor¬ 
oughly cultivated. 

Mr. Longley—I set out a grove that way some twenty years ago. I did not know that it was anybody’s method in 
])articular. I had not found out that the roots went down straight, but that may be the cause my grove did not suf¬ 
fer. I know of a neighbor who was setting out some lemon trees some seventeen years ago and he tried the experiment. He set one of them ac¬ 
cording to my suggestion. For the first vear, the tree that had the roots spread out made the best growth, but the next year the other one came up with it, and the two are very much alike. I do not know that the roots have anything to do with it. 

Mr. Kerr—I was about to ask to have

the roll called of those present, so that we might comply with Mr. Skinner’s sug¬ 
gestion as to how much of a crop of oranges we can expect this year. 

Mr. Rolfs—^Suppose you conduct this, 
Mr. Skinner, as you were the one who suggested same. 

Mr. Hollingsworth (DeSoto)—For the last two or three years I have been trying to estimate the orange crop, and have missed it so far, and I have said I 
would never make another prediction. I 
think, however, that DeSoto county will not have as much as last year. The im¬ 
mediate neighboidiood of Arcadia will grow nearer to last year’s crop. Our county had between 700,000 and 800,000 
boxes. The county has shipped since 
1898 about 25 or 30 per cent, of the state’s entire crop. I think, however, this year DeSoto will not have more than half a million boxes, if that much. We hope the condition for the remainder of the season will improve very much, but even in that case we will not have much more than half a crop. 

I don’t think our grapefruit bloom was up to the average. We see now occasion¬ 
al bloom. The bloom is scattered over a long period. My estimate would be that if the conditions until the time of gather¬ 
ing are favorable, there will be 450,000 
boxes. 

Dr. Phillips—I am not a member of this association, but for the last two years have made a specialty of oranges. There h^s always been a haphazard way to esti¬ 
mate the orange crop. Nine farmers out of ten will decide what they are going to have, and their expectations are always colored by their desires, and they will say, 
“Oh, yes sir; we are going to have a magnificent crop.” I know there is a 


long-felt want in this state for definite statistics. I know it is of interest to me, 
and I think to everyone else in the state that is engaged in the orange industry. 

Mr. Waits (Manatee county)—We will have about 10,000 boxes. If it had not been for the freeze we expected about 
60,000 or 70,000 boxes. I have not been over the whole county. Outside of our own groves the trees seem to be setting a very good crop. From what I can hear, there will be one-half or two-thirds of a crop. The grapefruit crop is shy. 

Mr. Brown (Manatee county)—I cap not speak for the county, but in our own groves we will not have ten per cent, of a crop; less than ten per cent, due to the freeze and the drought. 

Mr. Hampton—I have been traveling around in a good many different sections of the state, and I don’t believe there will be on an average twenty-five per cent, 
of a crop. That is a very conservative estimate, for in many places there will not lie ten per cent. 

Mr.—^- (Polk county)—I think 

there will be about ten per cent, of a crop. 
I don’t think I have seen a grove that has even ten per cent. Only one or two groves have a crop worth mentioning. 

Mr.-Our grove has been very 

late and the fruit is so small it is hard to make an estimate. I would say that the crop at the end of our grove will amount to half a crop; in other words, 
about 12,000 boxes. 

Mr.-(Hillsboro county)—I don’t 

think our crop will be a heavy one, and I 
doubt if the grapefruit will come to half a crop. I do not know whether the east¬ 
ern part will have much of a crop or not. 
T have heard that it would be short. 

Mr. Hoard (Orange county)—I think 










44 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


individually we will have twice the crop we had last year, and I think it is due entirely to our irrigation. Our irrigation plant has more than paid for itself this year. 

Mr.Wakelin (Lake county)—Down in 
Lake county the trees bloomed in the reg¬ 
ular time. They continue blooming un¬ 
til about now. The younger trees bloom¬ 
ed at the regular time, and they have done pretty well. There was about two-thirds of a bloom until the latter end of March. 

Mr.-(Orange county) —>S o m e 

trees bloomed pretty well early in the season, but most of it fell. After the rains, many bloomed again, and now a part of the trees are white with bloom. 
I think in our neighborhood the orange crop will not be more than a third of a crop. 

Mr.-^(M a r i o n county)—Not 

over one-fourth of a crop, or less. 

Mr. Hart (Volusia county)—I will say that on the east coast where protected there is a reasonably good crop, and more have protected their groves this winter than ever before; but I think that on the west side of Volusia county in groves not protected, there is a short crop. 

Mr. Kerr (Volusia county)—In the northern part of Volusia county the groves are showing up well, the treees are looking fine, and we will probably have half a crop. I attribute this greatly to the excellent location of the county, etc. 

Mr.-(Lee county)—I do not 

think there will be more than half a crop. 

Prof. Rolfs (Dade county)—I know it is shy in Dade. 

Member—How much was the entire crop in the state last year ? 

Mr. Skinner—It was somewhere around 4,000,000. 


Mr. Tilton—How do you regard the 
June bloom fruit? • We have a little of it in our grove. 

Mr. Hubbard—^The scattering June bloom is usually thick skinned and dry and pulpy and of poor shipping quality. 

Mr. Hart—If you have nothing else on the tree it is pretty fair. If mixed up with the regular season fruit, it is poor. 
It is always thicker skinned. I had much rather it would stay off than come on, 
although when there is no other fruit on the tree it does very well. 

Dr. Phillips—^I want to bring up the' 
question again of getting up reliable esti¬ 
mates. I have heard various estimates gotten out by parties in the month of 
May, and perhaps they will get out an¬ 
other the next month that is entirely dif¬ 
ferent, and when the crop is gathered, it is entirely different from either estimate. 
I think this society should adopt a method to get the correct statistics, say, in the month of July, when experienced orange men can estimate a crop with a degree of accuracy. Then, I think, each county should be represented, this society ap¬ 
pointing a person or persons to go out and send in an estimate to headquarters. 
Then let the society force the railroad companies to prepare to handle the crop which we will give them. If we have a big crop, the transportation should be prepar¬ 
ed beforehand to take care of it. Suppose it is necessary to pay a man for his ser¬ 
vices ; it will be worth much more to the orange grower to have information he can rely upon. If it is rumored that we have a larger crop than we really have, it has a depressing influence upon the price and we lose a great deal more money than these statistics will cost us. 

Mr. Hart—^I would say that this could

45 


easily be done if we had an appropriation from the state, or some income more than we have at present; but we have had to economize in every direction. 

Mr. Long-ley—As far as my experience is concerned, I believe that all of the or¬ 
ange growers here and elsewhere would be willing to pay a bonus for just such information. The information is sent out all over the country that we will have an enormous crop of fruit by parties bent on depressing the price of our fruit. I 
have no doubt but that every orange grower has lost hundreds of dollars every year. If we assess every member five dollars it would pay big to get just that information. 

Mr. McLane—This is a very important question, and I move that the president appoint a committee of five gentlemen whose duty it shall be tO' formulate a plan to present to this body tomorrow by which statistics can be secured. I think that everybody will agree that it is a matter of vital importance; not only the men who produce the fruit, but the men who buy it should have some intelligent idea. We know that every other crop produced in the United States is estimat¬ 
ed. I make that motion and hope some¬ 
body will second it. 

Motioif seconded. 

Mr. Painter—While on this subject I 
wish to state that I undertook last year to get up information just like what you are talking about now. I sent out over 
12,000 letters, addressed to growers all over the state, asking themi for the very information that you are seeking for. 
How many replies do you think I got out of that 12,000? Just 1,200. The trouble is to get the information from the grower. 
They seem to be afraid to give the in¬ 


formation out, and seem to want to make you think they have a big crop, whether they have or not. 

Mr. Phillips—I can readily appreciate that very few people.will answer ques¬ 
tions like those, and realize how very hard it is to get this information. My sug¬ 
gestion is to get conservative business men, pay them for their time and let them go over the counties and get this informa¬ 
tion from an unprejudiced standpoint. 
Not one man in a hundred would refuse to let him estimate his crop. Not to have this estimate costs the state of Florida hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

Mr. McLain—The motion is already before the meeting that a committee of five be appointed to formulate and pre¬ 
sent to this body a plan whereby this in¬ 
formation can be secured. I call for the question. 

Motion put and carried. 

Mr. Cribb—^^There is a doubt in my mind if this information would be worth anything to us. I never saw an orange grower who could estimate his crop with¬ 
in ten or fifteen per cent. 

Prof. Rolfs—The following committee is appointed: P. Phillips, A. H. Brown and Wm. C. Richardson. 


WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Prof. Rolfs—The matter of citrus dis¬ 
eases being up for discussion, I wish to make a few remarks in connection with this subject. The most serious disease and the most peculiar one that we have had anything to do with recently is the one which causes withertip in citrus. The causative agent here is colletorichum gloeosporiodes. This species of fungus is probably the same as the one that oc¬ 
curs on the mango and the avocado; a 





46 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


fact which is of considerable interest to ns, especially since the avocado and man¬ 
go occur in the same region, and often in the same orchards, with the citrus. 
Mr. Neeld will remember that in 1893 
the mango bloom blight occurred pretty severely on the sub-peninsula. Up to that time the trees had fruited heavily. In 
1894 the bloom blight was so bad that only a small crop matured, and investi¬ 
gations were started at once with a view of establishing what caused the diseases. 
Some information was gotten as to the identity of the fungus, but in the winter of 1894-95 the trees froze to the ground, 
leaving us without an opportunity of carrying on the work already started. 
Since 1901 investigations on the same disease were begun in the mango or¬ 
chards of Miami. The mango bloom, 
when attacked b}^ this fungus,- soon turns black and falls off. 

During the period of bloom, various species of insects visit the mango blossoms for pollen and for honey. These crawl about over the blooms, passing from dis¬ 
eased blooms to healthy ones. As the insects pass over the diseased bloom, they come in contact with the spores of the fungus. Tliese adhere to their body or to their appendages, and the spores are then carried to the healthy bloom. In addition to the insects, the winds also help in disseminating the fungus spores. It therefore seems almost impossible for a single bloom to pass through this trying ordeal without becoming infected. As a rule, a small quantity of fruit sets in spite of all these adverse conditions. As soon as the calyx and corolla have fallen away from the flower, the young fruit is not in immediate danger of being infected. 
The recently set fruit stands in a perpen¬ 


dicular position, consequently the danger of fungus spores coming in contact with it is greatly reduced. When, however, 
the fruit has reached about the size of a pecan nut, the weight becomes too heavy and the fruit causes the peduncle to turn over and bend downward. This gives the fungus a chance again to attack it, 
since the spores from other portions of the tree may be carried, by moisture, down on to the fruit and infected. On some trees, where the fungus did not affect the bloom, or those which are not affected by bloom blight, the disease gets started sometimes on the young* fruit. In such cases the young fruit falls from the trees literally by thousands. While the fruit is quite small it turns entirely black be¬ 
fore falling off. As it advances in size to that of a hen’s egg, this blackening becomes less apparent. After the fruit has arrived at about the size of a hen’s egg the epidermis becomes too hard for ready infection. The fungus spores, 
however, are washed from the epidermis just as before. The fungus, however, in place of causing infection, merely causes irregular streaks over the fruit, or what might be called tear streaks. 

Treatment. —As soon as bloom blight makes its appearance on the mango, it is necessary to begin a vigorous campaign of spraying, using* the ordinary form of 
Bordeaux, going against all recommen¬ 
dations heretofore in regard to its appli¬ 
cation. Direct the spray here against the bloom and right into the open blossom, 
spray every third day, and continue this until a crop of fruit is set that is vastly heavier than the tree can bear. As soon as a very heavy crop of fruit is set, spray¬ 
ing may be discontinued until a large pro¬ 
portion of the fruit has become large

47 


enough to bend the peduncles over, and the fruit hanging in a pendant condition. 
Then spraying should be again resorted to. An application of once in two or three weeks will be sufficient at this time. After the fruit has arrived at the size of a hen’s egg no further spraying need be done. 

WITHERTIP OF CITRUS. 

For the last six or seven years, work has been carried forward actively on the study of withertip of the citrus. As said before, this disease and the mangO’ blight are caused probably by what is the same species. Colletotrichuni gloeosporioides. 
Similar to the bloom blight of the mango we have a bloom blight of the citrus, in¬ 
cluding grapefruit and lemons. Citrus bloom, when attacked by this fungus, 
sheds off in great quantities, leaving scarcely any fruit set. As soon as the grove owner discovers a condition of this kind, he should give careful attention to the blooms. If withertip fungus is pres¬ 
ent in this stage of the citrus bloom, a considerable number of the petals in place of being pure white, as they should be, 
or withering a brown, will have turned a brownish red. By means of the hand lens, one will be able to learn to distin¬ 
guish fungus infested petals from petals that are merely dropping and withering. 

Treatment.— Here again, as in the case of the bloom blight of the mango, 
our recommendations are contrary to the usual practice of spraying, in that we advise spraying directly into the bloom, 
using Bordeaux mixture of the ordinary strength. While this operation will de¬ 
stroy a quantity of the bloom, it will be comparatively insignificant when compar¬ 
ed with the amount that it saves. As new blooms open constantly, the spraying should be repeated at short intervals, prob¬ 


ably not more than three or four days apart. This, of course, will depend upon the severity of the disease in the grove, 
and the possibility of doing the work with the spraying machine. 

After the bloom has shed and a con¬ 
siderable quantity of the fruit has set, 
there is still considerable danger from withertip fungus. If a large quantity of young fruit is shed off free from the calyx, one should regard it as a very sus¬ 
picious condition and make careful examination for the withertip fungus. If the fungus occurs, the young fruit should be sprayed as promptly and thoroughly as possible. From the time the fruit is set until it reaches about the size of a large hazel-nut it is very apt to be attack¬ 
ed by this fungus. After the fruit has reached the size of a large hazel nut there appears to be little danger of its being attacked by this fungus. From this time until the fruit reaches the coloring stage, 
it seems to enjoy comparative immunity. 

During this period, when the fruit ap¬ 
pears to enjoy immunity from fungus at¬ 
tack, the tree itself seems to be vulnerable to its injuries. For controlling the disease in the tree we would not advise spraying, 
but would advise pruning. Prune out all dead and diseased wood, and do it as thoroughly as your time and pocketbook will permit. This pruning out should be done preferably before the middle of July in the summer time, and before the middle of February in the winter time. 

In the fall of the year, after the fruit has begun to color, it is again vulnerable to the attack of this fungus. The mark¬ 
ing on the fruit, whether it is grapefruit or oranges, is rather characteristic in that it makes a large brown sunken area, be¬ 
ginning usually with small size spots and

increasing in size. In groves where one notices considerable dropping of fruit, this disease should be suspected at once and a careful examination made for it. If the fruit is dropping from this cause, 
spray wtih an ammonical solution copper cai;bonate (ammonical copper carbonate). 
In using this fungicide, the spray should be directed toward the fruit as much as possible, keeping it away from the leaves and branches of the tree. We know from' 
experience that an application of fungi¬ 
cide is pretty certain to be followed by an attack of scale insects, since the fungi¬ 
cide kills off the fungus which attacks the scale insects, as well as the fungi which attacks the fruit. 

Mr. Gibbs—Did I understand you to say that you threw a good, strong spray upwards right into- the bloom? 

Prof. Rolfs.—Yes, we did. But the rains and dew carry the spores downward, 
and by spraying downward the fungicides follow the paths of the rain and dew drops. 

Mr. Skinner—I want to ask a question, 
too. We are all interested in the buying of nursery stock. We don’t want to get any more insects than we can possibly help, and I want to bring up a point that has been in my mind for some time. When the state inspector signs a certificate, say¬ 
ing that there is no white fly or other insects in a nursery, I think we ought to be able tO' place dependence on that certifi¬ 
cate I understand that last year some nurseries got certificates saying that they were free from white flies when I knew 

T 

positively that they did have white flies, 
and I think we should insist that if certifi¬ 
cates are given they should be honestly given; If the nursery that has white fly will clean their trees and promise to do 


the best they can to get them out, they should have a certificate to that effect, 
but they should not have a certificate say¬ 
ing that they are free from white flies. 

I think the experimient station, or who¬ 
ever gives the certificates, should give them honestly. I would like to make a motion that this society, as a body and as a society, shall request whoever is in authority to give these certificates that they give them strictly in accordance with the law, and not give certificates that are no good. 

Dr. Berger—I wish to say that these . 
certificates were given to the best of my knowledge, honestly and honorably. If there were any white flies I certainly did not know it. I know that so far as I am concerned I did not give a single certi¬ 
ficate where I had any doubt that the cer¬ 
tificates would not be telling the truth. 

Mr. Skinner—^How do your certificates read? Do they all read one way? 

Dr. Berger—Yes, sir. 

Mr. Skinner—^That this nursery is free from white fly? 

Dr. Berger—Yes, sir. 

Mr. Skinner—I will not mention any names, but I know of certificates being given when it was a patent fact known to everybody that the certificates were given when they did have white flies. I think the growers should have some protection. 

Mr. Bell—I move that a committee be appointed by the president to examine in¬ 
to this matter and report at some future meeting the course they think this society should take in relation to it. 

Prof. Rolfs—^In regard to the matter of giving these certificates that are given to the nurseries in Florida. The other states in the Union require that stock shall be certified before it can be shipped. The

state of Florida makes no provision for the inspection of nurseries; consequently our nurserymen are placed in the position of not ibeing able to ship their nursery stock into another state. Is Mr. Skinner going to sit down on the nurserymen and say they cannot ship their stock out on account of having no inspection? The other states, as a kind of waiver on the delinquency of this state, have said, “We will allow the stock to come into our state upon the certificate of the entomologist of the experiment station.” Dr. Berger, 
or one of his assistants, has made the inspection, has granted certificates, and if there were any white flies in there, 
they did not know it. You could do more about it if you had a state entomologist. 

Mr. Skinner—Well, I know there are certain nurseries in this state that have the white fly, but still have a certificate saying they have not got the white fly. 
I think a certificate ought not tO' be given saying that it is free from white fly when it really has them. 

Prof. Rolfs—'The state has made no appropriation for a State Entomologist. 

Dr. Richardson—There is a motion be¬ 
fore the house, which, I think, covers the ground fully. I do not think that Mr. 
Skinner meant to insinuate that there is anything maliciously wrong; at the same time it is possible that there is an in¬ 
spection that does not inspect, and if this is so, a very great wrong is being done. 
We do not want to send the white fly out of our state as the white cotton cushion scale was sent in. We have no means of inspecting except in the method that has been put before you, because there is no provision for it. Now, suppose a proper committee be appointed to look in¬ 


to it and settle this matter at this point without any further discussion. 

Qnesion called; motion put and carried. 

Mr. Bell—I move that the first vice- 
president be empowered to appoint this committee. 

Motion secoinded and carried. 

Dr. Berger—I would like to have the floor for a few minutes. I would like to ask Mr. Skinner if he ever saw any nursery stock sent out from a nursery with my certificate, when it had white 

fly? 

Mr. Skinner—No, sir. 

Dr. Berger—I wish to state that all certificates were given in good faith to cover shipments out of Florida, as there is no law in the state of Florida compel¬ 
ling any inspection of stock not going out of the state. Inspection is made for other states, and whatever the state of 
Florida gets out of it, it gets under the inspection laws of those states. 

Mr. Bell—It has been the practice of some nurserymen to defoliate everything, 
and I think we should require-that. In shipping stuff through the states some¬ 
thing may get on it. Some nurserymen make it a practice to defoliate everything; 
others do not defoliate at all. 

Member—A short time ago, trees were sent out of a certain part of the state to another place, and it was understood that there were white flies in that section, and when they came they were defoliated; 
but when trees came from another part of the state where there was no white fly, 
the foliage was on. 

Mr. Taber—^The first vice-president has announced that the following com¬ 
mittee is appointed to report on the ques¬ 
tion of certificates of inspection; W. C.

Richardson, chairman; H. B. Stevens and 
J. D. Bell. 

Prof. Rolfs—We have with us the 
State Entomologist from Georgia, Prof. 
Smith. We would be glad if he will give us a short talk. 

Mr. Taber—Can’t you tell us about the operation of your law, etc. ? 

Prof. Smith—I am glad to tell you about the inspection law in Georgia. In the hrst place, we have there a State 
Board of Entomology, supported by the state appropriation, and their work is laid down in the law which created the de¬ 
partment. One branch of the work is the inspection of the nurseries in the state. 
The State Entomologist, or duly author¬ 
ized assistant, is required to visit every nursery in the state each year and make a careful inspection of the nursery and surrounding conditions, and if the nurs¬ 
ery is found apparently free from the San 
Jose scale and other insects and diseases, 
the nurseryman is given a certificate un¬ 
der which he can ship stock to any part of the state, and that certificate is usually accepted by any entomologist in any other state where they require a certificate. 

I have been in Georgia only four years, 
but know somewhat about the working of inspection in other states, and I think that perhaps we make a more thorough inspection than the majority of the states. 
I want you to notice this point, that the lazv requires us to inspect the nurs¬ 
eries, and if we can do so consistently, 
we gi^’e a certificate saying that the stock is apparently free from San Jose scale. 
There is no entomologist in the world who can say that a plant is absolutely free from San Jose scale. You cannot say that a nursery is absolutely free; but after it has been carefully inspected by a com¬ 


petent inspector who has had considera¬ 
ble experience, he can tell you pretty well whether it is infected or not, and if he finds no sign of that pest, we feel safe in giving the certificate. 

Mr. Skinner^—You spoke of the San 
Jose scale. It seems, to me a couple of years ago a lady-bird was imported from 
China. What has become of them? 

Prof. Smith—Most of them have died out. Of all the colonies started in sev¬ 
eral states the one in Marshallville, Ga., 
was the most successful. In the summer of 1903 we found that they were destroy¬ 
ing some of the scale, but not enough to make any appreciable decrease. Next spring it was impossible to find many there, probably on account of the spray¬ 
ing that had been given the previous win¬ 
ter. In the summer of 1905 I sent one of my assistants to every place in Georgia where a colony had been established, and also sent him to DeLand, Florida, where we had sent some of those lady-birds, 
and he found almost none whatever. The general concensus of opinion is that the lady-bird will probably never become ac¬ 
climated in the United States. 

I might state further, with regard to the nursery inspection, that there is a need, I think, in Georgia and other states of some change in the nursery inspection laws. It is getting to the point where it is almost impossible for all the nurs¬ 
eries in the state to be free from the San 
Jose scale, and I feel that the time is com¬ 
ing when the scale will get in such a great number of the nurseries that it will be necessary to issue a different kind of a certificate than w'hat we have been issu¬ 
ing. If the nurserymen are prevented from selling their stock by reason of find¬ 
ing a little of the scale in a small block,

perhaps only in a little corner, of the nurs¬ 
ery, it will be an unjust law. 

Mr. Griffing—understand there is a movement among the entomologists to get a uniform law about inspection. 

Prof. Smith—Yes, sir; the entomolo¬ 
gists of the United States at their last meeting advocated that, and the nursery¬ 
men have also taken it up and tried to get them, to work together. They should work together, with the idea of getting some uniformity in the laws, or some one law that would be adopted by all the states. 

Prof. Rolfs—^Tell us how much is ap¬ 
propriated annually by the legislature for this entomological commission in Geor¬ 
gia. 

Prof. Smith—$10,000. Of course, on¬ 
ly a portion of that has to be used for nurser)/^ inspection. If we did nothing but keep with the nurseries, we would not need that much. Our work covers a larger field now. 

Mr. Waite—I would like to ask Mr. 
Rolfs in regard to this scab or scaly bark that I have noticed in a few groves in this section; that is, on the Gulf Coast, 
some time ago. I presume Prof. Rolfs can give you a better description of it than 
I can. 

Prof. Rolfs—^Last year, immediately 
Upon the experiment station being sep¬ 
arated from, the university, Mr. Fawcett took charge of that work on the scaly bark and has been working upon it since that time. 

Mr. Fawcett—•! was in hopes that the subject of scaly bark would not come up, 
but I will try to tell you all I can about it. This disease became known to the experiment station only about two years ago, when a specimen was first sent in to 


us from this vicinity for our examination. 
In investigating the distribution of this disease I found it was confined to a limit¬ 
ed area including this peninsula from just above St. Petersburg to a few miles above 
Tarpon Springs. 

The first infection covers only a small spot, and this enlarges until finally the whole limb becomes scaly and scabby and reminds one of the progress of leprosy. 
Almost nothing is known of a remedy for scaly bark, but we are beginning some investigations with a view toward pre¬ 
venting the spread of this disease. 

Mr. Longley—Does it appear only on the orange tree, or does it also attack other citrus fruits? 

Mr. Fawcett—It is confined almost en¬ 
tirely to the sweet seedlings variety. 
Grapefruit seems to be free. We have begun experiments with the Bordleaux mixture. 

Mr. Skinner—I think it was from my g'rove that the specimen you speak of came. I have experimented a little with this disease myself and inoculated the trees and the roots with a little bit of sulphite of copper with beneficial results. 
The scaly bark is almost identical, I think, 
with the “brown spot” that occurs through this section and makes the fruit rot. (The specimen referred to was sent in by the Secretary and taken from Mr. 
Skinner’s grove.) 

Mr. Fawcett—I might say that along in the fall about August, the fruit becomes covered witli these spots, and there is every indication that the fruit has be¬ 
come infected from these scabs. The disease is a serious one and needs to be looked into. 

Mr. Waite—I would also like to ask if, in treating the disease called “Mela-

nose,” blue stone under the trees would be beneficial. 

Prof. Rolfs—In connection with this subject I would like tO' say it is what some people call physiolog^ical disease. 
That does not express anything, but it is due to malnutrition. It is very closely related to dieback. You can cure a tree by spraying it with Bordeaux mixture. 
Melanose and dieback do' not usually oc¬ 
cur on the same tree, although I have seen the two diseases on one tree. It is what you might call “citrus tree indiges¬ 
tion.” 

In the case of the dieback we made very careful experiments to see whether an application of blue stone to the soil would be of advantage. We found no advantage in treating the dieback in this manner. We also applied it to the leaves and found it of no advantage. We tried the lime on the leaves of the dieback tree and saw nO' advantage. In these experi¬ 
ments we had untreated plots that we used as checks. In three plots that were treated with Bordeaux mixture they at once responded and showed beneficial re¬ 
sults. Now, I will say that, not having made the experiment of applying blue stone to the soil, we are a little inclined to doubt if it would be advantageous in treating this disease. 

Mr. Waite—'In one section of our grove last year we had a good deal of fruit af¬ 
fected by melanose, and a gentleman liv¬ 
ing up the river who had quite a large grove, told me it was so badly infested that nearly all the fruit dropped ofif be¬ 
fore it was matured, and he said he used about one or twO’ pounds of blue stone around the trees, and the next year very little fruit was affected, and the second year there was none at all. I applied 


some, but did not know whether it was the right thing to do or not. 

Mr. Hoard—I have used blue stone as a remedy for dieback for several years, 
and always with good results. Have cur¬ 
ed small trees that were almost dead and put them, in fine condition. Have also used it on large seedling trees which were so badly affected with dieback that nearly all of the fruit would split and drop off early in the fall. I commenced using it on these large trees the year before last, 
with the result that the fruit was much improved last year; sO' I gave them an¬ 
other dose last year and am using it again this year. In using it on small trees, 
care must be taken not to use toO' much, 
as an overdose would be fatal. Large seedling trees will stand from three to five pounds twice a year, broadcast. 

, Member—What else do you do besides that ? 

Mr. Hoard—Nothing at all. When¬ 
ever I see a tree with symptoms of die¬ 
back I get some pulverized blue stone and apply it just as I would fertilizer. I have used it in the liquid form and have also put small pieces under the bark, but have come to the conclusion that it makes very little difference how it is. applied so the tree gets it, and have adopted the easier method of throwing it broadcast. 

Mr. Penny—I use blue stone under the trees. I put it on the crown roots and cover it over. I have thought possibly that is where they get the most benefit from the Bordeaux. 

Prof. Rolfs—Where we applied it to the soil there was no benefit from the 
Bordeaux. 

Mr. Donovan—I tried the same ex¬ 
periment last summer with blue stone in spreading in a circle around the tree to

the outer edg^e of the branches. It seems to do my trees good. They are dieback stock, and the trees this year do not seem to show any dieback. I didn’t do any thing else, so I think it must be due to that treatment. I have also sprayed with 
Bordeaux and killed the dieback. 

Mr. Waite^—Prof. Rolfs, did I under¬ 
stand you to say that lime applied to the soil would not correct the conditions there ? 

Prof. Rolfs—In our experiments we wanted to find out what element in the 
Bordeaux corrected the disease, so we applied slaked lime to the soil in the plot, 
and in another plot we used lime on the leaves to find out whether the application to the leaves was necessary, or whether it was necessary to put it on the ground where it would be taken up by the roots. 
In the place where we used the lime on the leaves or on the ground, it gave us negative results; in other words, were no better than our checks. But in those cases where we used Bordeaux mixture on the leaves we got decidedly better re¬ 
sults. We had the lots laid ofif with about thirty trees in the plot and went through one set and then took another set. Our conclusion was that, from the test we made, Bordeaux miixture must be applied to the leaves to be of advantage in curing the dieback. Mr. Waite has spoken more of the melanose than of the dieback, but it is very analogous to it in its behavior. 

Mr. Waite—I have suggested that you use lime. I applied lime tO' the amount of 1,000 pounds to the acre and only this past winter, and I thought of applying it again this summer. 

Prof. Rolfs—There are a good many things that may cause this dieback, and you want to make sure just what is caus¬ 


ing it when it makes its appearance. Top pruning may cause it; carbonate in the soil may cause it; or if there is too much acid in the soil—humic acid^—that may cause it. If it is the latter, lime would correct the conditions. 

Member—Is blue stone an antidote for humic acid? 

Prof. Rolfs—I think not. I think it would have no effect. 

Mr. Waite—I would like to know if anyone has cured by inserting blue stone under the bark and kept check, so that he could tell if it had any effect. 

Mr. Cooper—I had' some trees on our place that had the dieback, and I tried the experiment. I took every dther tree down the row and put blue stone under the bark, and it set up a terrible ‘‘spew,” 
but it straightened them right out. Last year I applied it just as you would fertil¬ 
izer. 

Member^—What quantity? 

Mr. Cooper—A piece about the size of a grain of wheat. 

Member—^How large were your trees? 

Mr. Cooper^—fWe tried it on trees six inches through. I had one tree on a little five-acre place that certainly was a for¬ 
lorn object, and it was astonishing how it picked up. Last year we tried some by casting it broadcast and with as good results. I mean tO' keep the experiment up. ^ 

Mr. Hampton—I had some experience with this blue stone Inoculation and find where it is used carefully it is very satis¬ 
factory. I have taken trees and inoculat¬ 
ed them in three different places, but I 
never used more than a piece the size of a small grain of wheat. Where you use more it splits the tree until it looks as thought it had been frozen. 




54 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Member—Does this add to the growth of the tree? 

Mr. Hampton—The tree shows a big, 
thrifty green leaf, and I never found any bad effects if used carefully. 

Member—What is the chemical action of the blue stone that causes the beneficial action ? 

Prof. Rolfs—I don’t believe that has ever been worked by the chemist. I do not think that we know just what the chemical reaction is. 

Mr. Hampton—For the past two or three seasons I find that the kumquat, 
where budded on the rough lemon, espec¬ 
ially, has the sap oozing out right at the connection of the bud and the stock. I 
would like to know the cause. 

Prof. Rolfs—We have not succeeded in getting any cure or any definite in¬ 
formation as to the cause. 

Mr. Skinner—Isn’t that identical with the same disease that is in Cuba? 

Prof. Rolfs—I think not. As near as 
I can tell from observation without in¬ 
vestigation, it is not a genuine disease. 
It almost invariably occurs where it is budded on the rough lemon. 

Mr. Hampton—^I am of the opinion that the stock of the rough lemon out¬ 
grows the bud, and I think it throws out too much sap for the bud to absorb, and it throws it out in the form of gumi. 

Mr. Griffing—^Regardiqg the fungus asked about. Prof. Rolfs discovered this red fungus {Sphaerostible coccophila) 
about ten years ago. We have had it in mind since that time, but we didn’t have the courage to try it. In the meantime it cost us anywhere from a few hundred up to about four thousand dollars a year to keep the scale under control. That does not mean that the orchard was badly 


infested; you probably wouldn’t find one tree in a hundred that had any scale on it. We used the spray as a preventive to keep it down. At the Horticultural meeting last spring, in Jacksonville, F. P. 
Henderson reported that owing to his inability to spray he got this fungus into his orchard and it practically cleaned up the scale. We went to Mr. Henderson’s orchard and found the conditions exactly as he had reported them. You could see that ninety per cent, of the trees had been infested and the wood was pitted with the marks of the scale, but you could not find a live scale in the orchard. We immediately went tO' work to introduce the fungus in our 650 acres of peach orchards. Although it was the last of 
July, we tried to inoculate all the infest¬ 
ed trees by taking a piece of limb infested with either the red fungus {SpJmerostible 
Coccophila) or the black fungus (Myran- 
giiim durii), and binding on the limbs of the infested peach trees. Last fall we thought that the fungus was not go¬ 
ing to do the work, but, much to our sur¬ 
prise, this spring the orchard is coming out with practically no live scale showing. 
It took a lot of nerve tO' do it, but I be¬ 
lieved that if you have got the nerve to keep your spraying machines out and en¬ 
courage the natural enemy, it will help you out. 

Prof. Rolfs—Mr. Griffing left oft* the most important part, and that is the cost of applying the fungus. 

Mr. Griffing—We didn’t know where to find a supply of the fungi, so arranged with Mr. Henderson to furnish the limbs infested with the fungus and carry it to the orchard in sufficient quantity for five hundred acres for $200.00. I do not suppose it cost us to put it on the trees 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


55 


over $250.00 or $300.00. Since then we find that we could get quantities of the fungus by hunting up live oak trees that were infested with obscure scale. You can find it almost anywhere if you look carefully. You will find where the oaks are infested with the scale, the fungus will be growing out over the scale. I 
think the one that has done the best work is the black one, which seems tO' work equally well during either the wet or the dry weather. I don’t think the cost of applying the fungus will be over $1.00 
per acre. Mr. Berger, please tell them> 
what per cent, of the scale you found had been killed. 

Prof. Berger—We estimated some¬ 
thing like 99 per cent. 

Mr. Griffing—Prof. Smith from Geor¬ 
gia has just been in the orchard. He came to see what the results were, and he might tell you. 

Prof. Smith—I came from Georgia principally for the purpose of investigat¬ 
ing the red fungus on the scale, because if it will do the work in Georgia, it is of great importance to our fruit grow¬ 
ers. I visited that orchard last Monday and found that the scale was practically dead, as has been reported. In fact, a larger per cent, was dead than Mr. Ber¬ 
ger has reported in the majority of the orchard. We could not find much red fungus, either, at this season of the year. 
Of course, I am not well enough acquaint¬ 
ed with the work of this fungus to ex¬ 
plain the condition, but certainly some¬ 
thing has killed the scale in that orchard, 
and if not the fungus it is something equally valuable. In my own personal opinion, I think, there is very little doubt but that the fungus is doing the work. 

Mr. Griffing—I want to say right here. 


too, that when we visited the Henderson orchard last June we didn’t find any fun¬ 
gus. We simply found that the scale was dead. 

Mr. Rowe—Would it not be possible to dissect some ol those insects and find out what was working on the inside? 

Prof. Rolfs—^That is exactly what I 
did ten years agO' and presented the re¬ 
sults of my work to^ this society at the 
Orlando' meeting, and before I got through reading my paper I had the house entirely to myself. I never tried it again. 

The red-headed fungus has several stages in its life history, some of which are invisible to the unaided eye. The life history of this fungxis being unknown, 
it proved a serious obstacle in its practi¬ 
cal use as an insecticide. We found that the scale was dying off without any ap¬ 
parent cause. After learning the life his¬ 
tory of the fungus all of this difficulty disappeared. In my studies I found no difficulty in getting pure cultures of this fungus from insects, that showed no signs of disease to the unaided eye. (For a full discussion of this fungus see Bulletin 
No. 41 of the Florida Agricultural Ex¬ 
periment Station.) 

After we have discovered this peculiar¬ 
ity of the fungus we then found that by taking some of the diseased insects we could readily get cultures of this fungus from them, proving* quite conclusively that it was the cause of the death of those particular insects. Since that time» 
however, we have made considerable pro¬ 
gress, and have added the black fungus as an ally in killing off the San Jose scale. The red-headed fungus likes a moderately dry season, while the black fungus wants, or prefers, an extremely rainy one, such as we had last year. Con- 





56

sequently, the black fungus flourished bet¬ 
ter last year than the red-headed. I think it is a good plan to have both of these friends in our peach orchard. 

In this connection, I might say that the long scale of the citrus is also severe¬ 
ly attacked by these two^ fungi. In addi¬ 
tion to these we have the white-headed fungus which Mr. White has been using for several years with the greatest satis¬ 
faction to him and those people who are watching the operation. 

Mr. Hudson—Will someone please tell us how much time is required for apply¬ 
ing the fungus before the scale is dead? 

Mr. Grilling—Until last January or 
February we were afraid that the experi¬ 
ment was going to be a failure, but when the scale came out this spring it soon dis¬ 
appeared. 

Mr. Hart—I have talked so much on this subject that I am a little modest about saying more. It does do me so much good to hear Mr. Grifflng get up and talk about the nerve it takes to try the experiment he has been trying and found successful. That very nerve I have been preaching and urging on all my friends for the past twenty years. I am pleased beyond measure tO' know that so many are adopting the natural and rational method of controlling injurious insect pests, and when Prof. Gossard stated at the Miami meeting that over 50 per cent, 
had adopted these methods I felt like rest¬ 
ing the case and letting it go on. I be¬ 
lieve you are on the right track, and will do all I can to encourage it. 

Mr. Skinner—How about the natural enemy of the rust mite ? Has it got any ? 

Mr. Hart—^I have found quite a num¬ 
ber of these and have been careful not to drive them away by spraying. I never 


sprayed for the rust mite. I am not thick¬ 
headed enough to say that I would never spray under any conditions, for that would be foolish; but I would not spray until I had tried almost everything else, 
even should dire disaster threaten in some new form. 

Mr. Hampton—Let me tell you how I 
treat my trees for the rust mite. I powder the dry Bordeaux on the trees, and it keeps my fruit nice and bright. I have not given up spraying altogether, but find it injurious in many respects. I had much rather put the dry powder on than to spray it. I have also used the dry sul¬ 
phur. 

Mr. Hart—In my crop this year there was but a small part of one per cent, of rusty fruit. In fact, I did not pack a sin¬ 
gle box during the season. 

Mr. Hampton—^As I understand, your grove is in a hammock or in dark ham¬ 
mock soil. I have found that on light, 
clay soil the oranges will be more in¬ 
clined to be rusty than on the dark, clear soil. Now, I would like to know how that holds good with the balance of your experience. 

Mr. Hart—I think you are right in that. We all know that by covering the gTound with mulch it will do away to a great extent with the rust. The rust mite does not like a direct, strong light or reflected light. If you can cover the ground in some way, you can do^ away with a good portion of the rust mite. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—I never see results without looking back in an effort to locate the cause, and I have wondered if the climatic conditions have not had a great deal to do with the disappearance of the scale. I can think of nothing else to lay it to, and I think that the radical seasons

57 


we have had did a great deal towards, 
the destruction of the scale. 

Mr. Griffing—Last year we had a very wet, rainy winter and spring and early summer. This year we have had identi¬ 
cally the reverse, so I don’t see how the drv weather can be accountable for the disappearance of the scale. 

Mr. 'Hudson—I have noticed in setting out young trees, that the scale appears on the body of the tree within about ten months after it has been planted out. I 
have used a little coal oil and find that it works very well. The older trees can stand the scale better than the younger ones. I have also noticed that the scale takes more readily where there has been much vegetable matter in the way of beggar-weed, etc. 

Mr. Waite—Is there any injurious ef¬ 
fect to the orange trees by using sulphur¬ 
ous acid as a spray for foot rot? 

Prof. Rolfs—^There would be no in¬ 
jurious efTfects by using it in a diluted state. The dilution is about one to ten of sulphurous acid. The sulphurous acid is one of the first remedies recommended for foot rot, and you will find that it does no damage tO' the sound wood. Sul¬ 
phurous acid is what was recommended first, and by mistake some people have used sulphuric acid. This latter will cure the foot rot all right—so will a red hot iron. 


I would like to say in connection with the rust mite and the red spider, that in each of these cases I have found that diseases attacked thenii as well as higher insects. They do not exactly belong to the insects, but tO' the spider mites. They are attacked by diseases as well as higher life, but when you attempt to inoculate them with disease germs you will see that it is a very difficult thing. The practica- 
hility of the scheme falls down when you come to applying it. The difficulty is almost unsurmountable. Dry sulphur, 
or the sulphur and lime that Mr. Hamp¬ 
ton has recommened, is a perfect remedy for it. On my own trees I used this calcium sulphide and had it applied merely to the fruit. I gave the colored man special instructions to apply it to the fruit only. By use of a hand lens, one can tell when the mites are migrating tO' the fruit and causing it to turn them to a rusty or golden rust. If they are present in sufficient numbers tO' cause it to turn to a golden rust, the spray should be ap¬ 
plied. 

Member—How can you spray the fruit without spraying the leaves at the same time? 

Prof. Rolfs—The citrus fruits are nearly always on the end of the branch, 
and are away from the leaves. The fruit that is inside in the dark is not apt to be attacked by the rust mite. 





Report of Committee on Diseases^ Insects^ and Method 

of Control. 


By Ernest A. Bessey* 

(Pathologist in Charge of Sub-Tropical Laboratory.) 


Mr. Presidefitj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I regret that it is impossible for me to be present in person at your meeting in St. Petersburg, but my work compels me to be out of the State. My report, 
accordingly, will be read by the Secre¬ 
tary and will, naturally, be somewhat shorter than if I could be present to ex¬ 
plain the various points. I have confined my observations to the Southern part of the State and have asked Professor Hume to include in his report something about the diseases occurring in the Northern part of the State and diseases of nursery stock. 

Probably the greatest interest in the mhtter of diseases centers around the struggle with white fly. This has been gradually spreading but has not, so far as I am informed, made any very great jumps. According to a statement of Mr. 
C. B. Thornton of Orlando, the unpre¬ 
cedented drought the past winter and spring has been beneficial in one respect in that it reduced the injury from this pest. He states in a letter to me that ‘‘the red fungus stood the dry weather and is still active, while the yellow, while it spread very rapidly after its first appear¬ 
ance early last summer, has itself been attacked by a fungus enemy and is now virtually exterminated. My experience with the red fungus has been so satis¬ 


factory that I will have no further use for my spray-pump.” 

On the other hand, the dry weather has been favorable to the spread of the purple and long scale, but Mr. Thornton is con¬ 
vinced that the fungi will keep it under control. 

The exceedingly dry weather has had a more or less harmful effect on the Man¬ 
atee snail which requires a certain amount of moisture for its favorable development. 
Especially disastrous have been the fires which have run through the hammocks in many of the groves in that vicinity, 
since these totally exterminated this bene¬ 
ficial mollusk in the region burned over. ' 

The orange disease known as “blight,” 
or in some parts of the State as “wilt”, 
has slowly continued tO' spread through the State. It has now firmly taken hold in the lower end of Merritt’s Island and is doing great damage tO' the groves there. 
There is nothing new in the method of treatment that can be reported at this time although I have started to take up the ^ investigation of this disease again and hope, upon my return to the State this summer, to do a good deal of work upon it. In view of this, I would be very glad to get into communication with all orange growers who are troubled by this disease. In a few localities I have found the disease to attack severely not only the

orange, but pomelo and Tangerine, al¬ 
though the most serious injury is done to the orange. 

This past season a peculiar disease has l>een noted in several parts of 'the State. 
It resembles in some respecrs foot-rot in that there is observable diseased tissue from which gum flows, but diifering from that disease, it is found on all parts of the tree, in many cases being found both on the stock and cion if the bud is rather hig'h, and in other cases being confined to the cion alone. ' Mr. Thornton reports that he has treated some trees with sul¬ 
phuric acid solution, also boiling water, 
with apparently great improvement. I 
can at present say nothing regarding the cause of the disease for that is unknown to me. In some cases, however, it seems to be due possibly to unfavorable effect of the stock on the cion, for it is far more abundant in those trees where the cion is larger than the stock. 

Mangos and avocados suffered severely last summer from the rotting and spotting of fruit due to the anthracnose fungus 
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides which has l)een shown by inoculations with pure cul¬ 
tures to be the same as the fungus caus¬ 
ing the disease of the citrus known as 
‘bvither-tip”. The past winter has been so dry that the disease was not nearly as abundant as the previous winter, but yet in many groves the blossoms were de¬ 
stroyed by this fungus so that but few fruits were set. This is especially true of the avocado. In general, however, the fungus is far less abundant than last year and as a result a far greater number of mangoes and avocados set than last sea¬ 
son. It was noticed that those trees which were sprayed with Bordeaux mixture dur¬ 
ing blooming period set fruit far better than those which were not so treated. In 


this connection a point of great interest was observed by me in the vicinity of 
Miami regarding the effect of improper fertilizing upon the injury from the fun¬ 
gus. A grove of budded avocados set out two years ago near the city of Miami was fertilized with a formula about as follows : 

Phosphoric acid .15 per cent. 

Ammonia .3 tO' 4 per cent. 

Potash.3 to 4 per cent. 

As a result doubtless of the low amount of potash in the fertilizer and of the lack of potash in our soils, last year's growth did not harden up well; furthermore, 
probably as a result of the excess of phos¬ 
phoric acid, the young trees blossomed very profusely, although they were far too small to do so properly. The fungus promptly attacked the blossoms (for the trees were not sprayed) and spread through the 'blossoms into the stocks of the inflorescence and into the twigs, the tissues not having been hardened up the fungus did not stop, however, as it us¬ 
ually does, but kept spreading down the trees, in many cases killing them to the ground ; in others, girdling some of the larger limbs by running down short spurs. I think there is no reason¬ 
able doubt but that this excessive injury bould have been prevented had the trees been properly fertilized. Of course the destruction of the blossoms by the fungus would require more than proper fertiliza¬ 
tion to prevent, viz: spraying* with Bor¬ 
deaux mixture. 

Celery suffered quite considerably around Sanford this year, from two dis¬ 
eases ; one, a leaf spot disease caused by the fungus Ccrcospora opii, and the other, 
black-heart, probably caused by bacteria. 

Nematodes probably caused somewhat more than the usual amount of injury to 





6o

truck-growers on account of the drought, 
the affected plants showing the result of the injury much sooner on account of the limited water supply. Nothing fur¬ 
ther than was said last year can be stated now with reference to combating these pests. It seems probable, however, that where sub-irrigation can be used to soak 


the soil full of water for a period of sev¬ 
eral days, the trouble from; nematodes can be prevented, or very greatly reduced for some months or years to come. Possi¬ 
bly on this account, the trouble due to nematodes is less abundant around San¬ 
ford than at Orlando where this sub-irri¬ 
gation cannot be successfully practiced. 


Report of Committee on Control of White Fly. 

(Fumigation.) 


By Df. A. W. MoffilL 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The history of the use of hydrocy¬ 
anic acid gas for insect pests covers a period of nearly twenty-one years. 
The process was discovered and brought to its present degree of per¬ 
fection in California where it has steadily grown in favor until, at the present time, thousands of tons of potassium cyanide are used annually for controlling scale insect pests. This remedy has also become well estab^ 
lished in the orange growing sections of New South Wales and in South 
Africa. Wherever it has been adopt¬ 
ed, it has proven to be the cheapest and most effective of the direct rem¬ 
edies for citrus pests. 

Several years ago, Prof. H. A. Gos- 
sard, well known as the former exper¬ 
iment station entomologist, undertook some experimental fumigation work in this State and was led to conclude that the efficiency of this treatment against 


the white fly is such that if a fumigated grove were segregated from all others, 
one fumigation would render it so nearly clean that it would need no ad¬ 
ditional attention for two or three years. Prof. Gossard predicted that 
“a process that has been found so val¬ 
uable in every other part of the world, 
is certain to eventually come into favor in Florida.” 

Having in charge the white fly inves¬ 
tigation of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, the writer secured the assistance during the past winter of 
Mr. Stephen Strong, a horticultural commissioner of Los Angeles County, 
Cal., a man of wide experience in prac¬ 
tical dealings with citrus pests and probably as well posted on the subject of fumigation as any other man in that 
State. Modern fumigation methods as adapted for use with trees of all sizes, 
were employed for the first time in this 
State during the past winter months 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


6l 


and considerable data has been obtain¬ 
ed which shows the superiority of fum¬ 
igation over even the most successful spraying, both in regard to cost and effectiveness. 

It is the writer’s object to give in this paper a concise statement regard¬ 
ing the methods involved in the fumi¬ 
gation of orange groves and the results obtained thus far by the experiments along this line, looking to the control of the white fly. Much more extensive experimental work will be conducted next winter with the object of testing improvements suggested by past ex¬ 
perience, and of reducing the necessary cost to a minimum. 

CONDITIONS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR 
GOOD RESULTS. 

Isolation of an infested grove is the most favorable condition for successful control of the white fly by fumigation. 
Next in importance as a favorable con¬ 
dition is concerted action among the owners of adjoining groves, in the case of groves not sufficiently isolated for independent action. Whether or not this concerted action will be obtained in any particular instance rests with those interested in the success of the orange growing industry for the prob¬ 
lem of how to accomplish this was solved many years ago in California. 
In Florida, Orange county has already made a beginning towards the adoption of a systematic campaign against the 
\Yhite fly, having organized a Horticul¬ 
tural Commission with powers equivalent to those of similar commissions in Califor¬ 
nia. The officials having the matter in charge, however, have not felt justi¬ 
fied in attempting active field work on 


a large scale until careful experiments shall have determined what course can be followed with a certainty of uniform results. 

The third condition which strongly favors, if it is not absolutely necessary for good results, is the absence of the white fly food plants other than citrus trees. Chinaberry trees including the variety called ‘'umbrella” tree cause untold injury to orange growing inter¬ 
ests. While all of these trees do not become infested each year owing to various circumstances which it is unnec¬ 
essary to mention here, it is well known that in many localities, espe¬ 
cially in central and northern Florida, 
adult white flies produced by them occur in myriads throughout the towns in midsummer. Chinaberry and um¬ 
brella trees favor the rapid dissemina¬ 
tion of white flies from centers of in¬ 
fection, also their successful establish¬ 
ment in uninfested localities. They seriously interfere with the success of fumigation as well as of all other rem¬ 
edial measures by furnishing a favored breeding place where the white fly can regain its usual abundance in a much shorter time than would be the case if 

, 15 

it were entirely dependent upon the citrus trees for its food supply. Of the other food plants of the white fly, cape jessamine and privets should, like the chinaberry and umbrella trees, be classed as public nuisances in all or¬ 
ange growing sections. ' 

WHEN TO FUMIGATE. 

Fumigation for the white fly should be done during December, January and February, beginning about two weeks after the adults of the last fall brood have disappeared, in order that 


62 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


all of the eggs deposited by these adults may have time to hatch. It should be remembered that the pres¬ 
ence of adults is practically a positive indication of the presence of unhatched eggs. It is impracticable to attempt to destroy the egg stage by fumigation or, as a rule, by any other direct means. The scale-like stages, techni¬ 
cally kno'wn as the larval and pupal stages, are readily destroyed when the dosage is properly estimated. 

Ordinarily, it would be undesirable to continue fumigation after the adults begin to emerge in considerable num¬ 
bers in the spring. This time, of course, varies according to locality and weather conditions, but in general is between the middle of February and the first of March. 

For some not well understood rea¬ 
son, fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas in bright sunlight is liable to cause injury to the foliage even though in the absence of bright sunlight the same dosage might give entirely satisfactory results. On cloudy days, it is safe to fumigate during the middle of the day, 
but on clear days the work should not be started until between four and five o’clock in the afternoon. Fumigation should not be attempted in a strong breeze particularly if the tents have not been made gas tight or nearly so by one of the treatments which will be referred to hereafter. The presence of moisture on the leaves in the form of dew does not seem to have any del¬ 
eterious effect upon the foliage al¬ 
though in California it is considered necessary to increase the dosage in such cases to ensure effectiveness of work against scale insects. The tents are more difficult to handle when wet, 


and it has not yet been determined whether, everything considered, it is desirable to continue to fumigate when the foliage has become wet with a heavy dew. 

EQUIPMENT. 

Many different styles of fumigating outfits have been employed in orchard fumigation in California since the first discovery of the process. Ordinarily a person unfamiliar with the practices of recent years, pictures to himself some clumsy process of shifting bell or dome shaped tents from tree to tree by means of huge derricks, mounted on wheels and provided with gafts and an intricate system of ropes and pul¬ 
leys. Such methods, however, have long since become a thing of the past and their use is remembered only as in¬ 
teresting incidents in the early history of the fumigating process. 

Practically all modern tents for fum¬ 
igating purposes are made in the form of regular flat octagons, and are gen¬ 
erally made of six-ounce drill and eight- 
ounce duck. A tent of this pattern is. call¬ 
ed a “sheet tent” and its size is stated according to its diameter. In general a sheet tent is large enough for a tree that measures not over two-fifths of the given size. For trees up to 14 feet in height, bell or dome shaped tents, 
held open at the bottom by means of a gas pipe hoop are sometimes used. 
With small trees of uniform- size, they are easy to handle and they require less material in their construction, but they are not as adaptable for general use as are sheet tents, and hence are not as extensively used. 

It is the general custom in Califor- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


63 


nia at present to use untreated tents— 
that is, tents which have not been treated with any material either by dipping or painting for the purpose of making the canvas more nearly gas tight. This is not the result of such treatments having proven unnecessa¬ 
ry, but seems rather to be due to the practice of fumigating by the contrac¬ 
tor system, whereby the contractor for a certain price per tree furnishes the equipment and labor and the owner of the grove supplies the chemicals. The contrac¬ 
tor naturally prefers to use a larger amount of the chemicals per tree rather than to be put tO' the expense of treating his tents so as tO' better confine the gas. 
A tanning solution obtained from tan¬ 
neries and known as ‘^oak ooze”, and a decoction made from the prickly pear cactus, have been used extensively in 
California in years past for increasing the tightness of the tents. Linseed oil and flexible paints have also been used, 
to some extent. The subject O'f the de- 
sirablity of treating tents is one which needs further investigation. 

Tents when not over 48 feet in di¬ 
ameter, 'are placed in position over trees to be fumigated by means of so called '‘changing poles.” Larger tents are handled by means of uprights or derricks. The changing poles are light poles varying from 15 to 20 feet in length and attached to the tip of each, 
is a rope somewhat longer than the pole itself. Uprights or derricks are of simple construction, braced at the bot¬ 
tom to prevent them from falling side¬ 
ways, and provided with pulley blocks and ropes for raising the tent. Cypress is a very desirable material to use in making uprights on account of its 


lightness. Uprights are made from 25 
to 32 feet in length according to the size of the trees to be covered. They need be only within two or three feet of the extreme height of the tree for the uppermost branches readily bend forward when the tent is being pulled into place. 

The material used in the generation of hydrocyanic acid gas are Potassium cyanide (K C N), Sulphuric acid (H-2 
S O-4) and water. It is essential that the potassium cyanide be 98 or 99 per cent, pure, and that the acid show a gravity test of 66 degrees. The pro¬ 
portions of these materials used in gen¬ 
erating the gas are, one part of the cyanide, one part of acid (liquid meas¬ 
ure) and from 3 to 4 parts of water. 

The commissary consists of a mov¬ 
able table provided with balances for weighing the cyanide, a large stock pitcher for the acid, a measuring glass graded for fluid ounces, rubber gloves for the man who measures the acid, 
and a tin scoop and leather gloves for the man who weighs the cyanide. The generator tray is placed on top of the commissary table while “weighing up.” 

It is made with a removable upper rack for convenience. The upper rack contains two rows of tin cans for hold¬ 
ing the cyanide. Directly below each can in the lower rack or body of the tray is a pitcher for holding the acid for the given tree. The gas is gener¬ 
ated in earthernware jars of a capacity of from one and a half to three gallons according to the size of the tree. For large trees, two generator jars are fre¬ 
quently used. 

PROCEDURE. 

The systematic arrangement of de¬ 
tails is of great importance in fumiga- 


64 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tion. First, the dosage should be care¬ 
fully estimated and a so-called ^‘sched¬ 
ule’' prepared showing the location of each tree and the amount of cyanide which should be given in each case. 

The work done by the agents of the 
Bureau of Entomology during the past season has not been completely sum¬ 
marized as yet, and it is therefore im¬ 
possible at this time tO' present a table of required dosage for trees of different sizes. Before definite recommenda¬ 
tions of this kind be made, it is desir¬ 
able that further experiments be con¬ 
ducted with tents treated by different methods. A general idea of the amount of potassium cyanide required with an untreated tent of eight-ounce duck, can be obtained from the follow¬ 
ing table which‘includes only a few examples selected from the many rec¬ 
ords :

The measurements of a tent are eas¬ 
iest made by means of a tape measure attached to a reel. The measurement of the circumference is made within a few feet of the ground. To obtain the distance over, the end of the tape is held in one hand while the reel is thrown over the center of the tent and the measurement made from, 
ground to ground. Tables will be prepared in due course which will show the proper dose for trees of va¬ 
rious sizes, but with a little experience 


in calculating the dosage from actual measurement, a fumigator should be able to estimate the amount of potas¬ 
sium cyanide with sufficient accuracy. 

In each outfit, from two to five men are employed according to the size of the trees. For medium sized trees up to 22 feet in height, four men can work to advantage. This crew can handle thirty tents every forty-five minutes, and can treat about 400 trees in a night’s work of ten hours. For trees from 23 to 35 feet in height, der¬ 
ricks or uprights are used, and a crew of five men are needed to handle about 
12 or 15 tents every forty-five minutes. 

The changing of the bell or hoop tents from one tree to another is a sim¬ 
ple procedure, requiring but a few sec¬ 
onds’ time for two men. Sheet tents are placed in position over the trees up to about 22 feet in height by means of the changing poles described, and require from less than a minute up to a minute and a half for each tree. 
Trees from twenty-twO' to thirty-five feet in heiglit can easily be covered by means of the derricks or uprights. The uprights being placed in position, the tent is raised by means of the pulley attachments, the uprights are then pulled forward by means of a rope at¬ 
tached to the top, and as they fall the tent is pulled over the tree. The cov¬ 
ering of the largest trees can be ac¬ 
complished in between one and two minutes. It is readily seen even from this brief description, that the mechan¬ 
ical difficulties involved in this process are insignificant when compared with the labor required for spraying and in addition, it lacks the many disagreea¬ 
ble features which always accompany the application of liquid insecticides.

fumigators weigh the potassium cyan¬ 
ide and measure the acid, arranging the dosage for each tree in the racks of the tray, the cyanide in the upper rack directly above the pitcher of acid for any given tree. One man usually measures the acid and generates the gas and is known as the “generator/^ 
From two to three men look after the changing of the tents and are known as 
^^tent pullers.” Another man known as the *^tent kicker” follows the tent pullers and pulls or kicks in the tent at the bottom and also raises the edge of the tent while the generator passes in with the can of potassium cyanide, 
pitcher of acid and the generating jar containing the required amount of wa¬ 
ter. The jar is placed near the base of the tree and the acid poured in follow¬ 
ed by the cyanide, after which the gen¬ 
erator passes out quickly and the edge of the tent is dropped into position. 
The commissary is usually located where it will be most conveniently sit¬ 
uated for the entire night’s work. Af¬ 
ter shifting the tents and generating the gas, all hands return to the com¬ 
missary and the materials weighed up for the next change of tents. This procedure is varied somewhat accord¬ 
ing to the number of tents operated and the individual practices of the fum¬ 
igators. 

POISONOUS NATURE OF THE GAS. 

The necessity of observing simple precautions in fumigating with hydro¬ 
cyanic acid gas is so well known that, 
although this is one of the most dan¬ 
gerous poisons, there is no record of a fatal accident resulting from its use as an inseoticide. After removing the tent the contents of the jar should be emptied between the rows of trees and 


covered with earth. When emptied close to the trees the roots are likely to be in¬ 
jured, especially when the soil is very porous. Great care should be taken to avoid pulling the tents over any of this material even after it is supposed to be carefully buried. 

EXPENSE OF FUMIGATION. 

Wherever the surrounding condi¬ 
tions are such that a grove would re¬ 
ceive full benefit from the almost com¬ 
plete extermination of the insects, the cost of fumigation would ordinarily be about the same as three sprayings, but its efficiency in checking the white fly would be equal to at least six sprayings at the rate of three per year. At the outside, the cost, making ample allow¬ 
ance for wear and tear of tents, should not exceed that of four sprayings. 
Even on this basis, the cost of fumi¬ 
gation in a period of two years would not exceed two thirds the cost of the best of spraying while the results ob¬ 
tained would be far more satisfactory and uniform. These estimates are based on the cost of fumigation with untreated canvas. With canvas made approximately gas tight, the cost would doubtless be reduced fully lone- 
third. 

Fumigating tents are expensive as a first outlay; those large enough to cover a thirty foot tree costing about 
$90.00 and to cover a fifteen foot tree, about $20.00. It is not advisable as a rule for an orange grower to in¬ 
vest several hundred dollars in fum¬ 
igating tents for his exclusive use, al¬ 
though many with extensive groves would doubtless prefer to do this. In some citrus fruit growing countries where fumigation is practiced against scale insects, several growers form a 


5 


66

club and share the cost of the fumigat¬ 
ing outfit, which is kept at the disposal of each of the members in turn. Such a plan might be followed in many cases in this State. A few orange growers with a crop worth annually $10,000 or 
$15,000 would not be put to an unrea¬ 
sonable expense in the joint ownership of an outfit costing $1,000. Fumigation by the contractor system as it is now done to a great extent in California, 
may also come into use. The plan which can be most strongly recom¬ 
mended is for each orange growing county in the State, when the proper time arrives, to maintain an outfit large enough for the needs of the orange growers within its limits, and to pro¬ 
vide for fumigation under the direction of a County Horticultural Commission. 

The average annual loss due to the white fly in the infested groves in 
Florida may be conservatively estimat¬ 
ed at 33 per cent. Taking* into consid¬ 
eration the reduction in number and size of the fruit and the indirect loss through the necessity for washing the fruit and subsequent deterioration in its shipping quality, the total loss for the state is not less than three hun¬ 
dred thousand dollars per annum. Ac¬ 
cording to the Eighth Biennial Report of the Florida Commissioner of Agri¬ 
culture, there were in 1903, slightly over three million citrus trees in the 
State, more than one-half of which were non-bearing. The foregoing esti¬ 
mate of a loss of $300,000 per annum is based upon these figures, placing the number of infested groves at one- 
eighth of the entire number. Accord¬ 
ing to this estimate, there are at pres¬ 


ent, omitting nursery stock, about four hundred thousand infested trees in the 
State of Florida. An avreage of fifty cents per tree would be an ample al¬ 
lowance for fumigating the infested citrus trees in the State. This would give us $200,000 as the estimated ex¬ 
pense of fumigating these trees. The work of Prof. Gossard and the work of the Bureau of Entimology during the past few months furnishes evidence that no further loss would be occasioned by the white fly for two or three years; hence the sum of $200,000 invested by the citrus growers of Florida who suffer losses from the white fly, would result in the prevention of a loss of at least $600,- 
000. This point is made not as a prac¬ 
tical recommendation, for the adoption of the practice of fumigation should be gradual, but simply to' provide a basis for the estimation of the desir¬ 
ability of using this treatment in indi¬ 
vidual groves. 

While it is generally considered that in Florida the natural enemies of the purple scale are so effective that any direct treatment is unnecesarry or un¬ 
profitable, citrus groves are frequently met with where this scale is a serious pest, and where the losses prevented by fumigation would amount to sever¬ 
al times its cost. In conclusion, the writer would express his conviction that in the case of the majority of the groves, the destruction of the purple scale and other true scale insects would represent an increase in profit which would, by itself, offset the actual cost of fumigation, leaving as clear gain the benefits derived from reducing the white fly to a negligible quantity.

Control of White Fly by Stamping Out. 


By H. B. Stevens. 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The loss of fruit by thieving had be¬ 
come so great, that the growers at De- 
Land about decided to organize a fruit growers’ society for self protection, and to help in other ways, that such an organ¬ 
ization could; but like most si^ch move¬ 
ments, it was only talk until the white fly was discovered on some trees in the very center of the town. 

That called for prompt action and there was no trouble found in getting the grow¬ 
ers together and organizing the ^‘St. 
Johns River Fruit Growers’ Association.” 

One of the first things they did, was to appoint a committee to devise means for combating the white fly; that com¬ 
mittee first tried spraying with pure ker- 
dsine, with a result that they destroyed about 90 per cent, at one application, but the difficulty was to reach the other 10 
per cent. Soon after, the cold of Decem¬ 
ber come, and it took off so many leaves from many of the orange trees in the part, 
that the committee thought was the infect¬ 
ed district, that they decided the best plan would be, to gO' into' the matter thoroughly and defoliate all infected trees or shrubs. 
The matter was brought up before the society and they voted an assessment to meet the expense, and instructed the com- 
mitttee to go ahead. 

The way they went about it was this, 
first, they examined the trees and shrubs that they thought might be infected, and if they found any of the larva or pupa of the fly, then they took a few of the infect¬ 
ed leaves and with a glass showed them to 


the owner, and asked his or her permis¬ 
sion to remove the plants, or defoliate, as the case might be. If the party objected, 
then they let him alone, and went to the next place, knowing well, that after he had time to think the matter over, and to understand what an injury the pest would be, and how we were offering to remove it without any expense to- him, he would consent later, and so it proved, in every case but one, and in that case the party had to be persuaded by other means than reason. 

It was soon found, that wherever there were Cape Jessamine bushes there was apt to be white fly and in following 
Up the fly they went over an area of four square miles, and defoliated every infect¬ 
ed orange tree or Jessamine bush and also privet hedges. 

Had we anticipated in the beginning, 
that we should have to go over anything like SO great a territory, we might have shrunk from the task, but after we began we did not turn back. 

After going over every place we found anything on, around DeLand, we turned our attention to near-by places, and soon found that the fly had gotten quite a strong hold at DeLeon. 

We called the attention of Mr. Mc¬ 
Bride to what the flies were doing in his grove at DeLeon Springs, and he at once put a force at work defoliating a ten acre grove, and he says he got it done for $135. Adjoining him, was a grove equally effected, that we could not prevail on the owner to do as Mr. McBride had

done, but they consented to our doing it for them. 

Now any grower who has ever spray¬ 
ed for white fly, knows that he has got off easy, if he has not spent more than 
$135 on ten acres, and still he knows that he has not killed them all and that enough are left to keep him working the next season. If he could only be sure that he had stamped them out, he would not mind that expense. 

We have not found a live fly, so far, 
this spring, in or around DeLand, and all it cost us, was $158.80 to do the work. 

We consider it a good investment, even if the flies get in next year, for all our groves are free this year anyway. 

From the experience we have had I 
feel sure the fly can be stamped out of 
^drnost any section of the State, if the growers will only go at it in earnest, and be willing to lose all the leaves, where- 
ever there are any signs of the fly found. 

By doing this work as late as possible, 
in the spring before the fly begins its general hatch, or the trees to bloom, the work can be done with the least expense, 
and it need not diminish the crop any more than the fly itself would do, if as much. 

I wish to say right here that our com¬ 
mittee was greatly helped by two visits from Prof. Rolfs, he encouraged us to believe that we could make a success of it, and he helped to make the skeptical growers willing to allow us to take the leaves from their trees. 


Our society was also greatly helped by a talk he gave us on insects, and dis¬ 
eases, and I am sure that if the growers in the different localities of. the State, 
would organize as we have done, and then when a difficult problem comes up, invite 
Prof. Rolfs to pay them a visit, they would soon find that his talks would save them in the expense of working their groves, much more than the society would cost them. So far our society has cost none of its members more than seven dol¬ 
lars apiece. 

One lesson we have learned at DeLand, 
that is if you fear the white fly watch your jessamine bushes as the fly will ap¬ 
pear on the Cape Jessamine first and if you want to delay their coming destroy all such bushes in your neighborhood. 

The fly will spread faster from one jessamine bush to another than from one orange tree to another. 

In many cases we found larva on Jessa¬ 
mine bushes and no sign at all on orange trees near by, but if there were many of the larva on the jessamine bushes we de¬ 
foliated the orange trees as a precaution. 

To overcome thieving, we allow any member of the society who wishes to do so, to post a notice of $25 reward offered by the society for evidence that will convict any one, other than a child, for stealing fruit, and the society does the prosecuting, which makes it easier to pun¬ 
ish a thief than if an individual had it to do.

Control of the White Fly by Natural Means. 


Df. E. W. Bcfgfcf. 


Mr. Presidentj Ladies and Gentlemen: 

A study and discussion of the different phases of this subject are exceedingly in¬ 
teresting and important whether consid¬ 
ered fromi a purely practical or from a purely scientific standpoint. When con¬ 
sidered from a purely practical standpoint it involves mainly the knowledge neces- 
sai*y for successful insect control. This, 
however, includes a knowledge of the life history, habits, and conditions of exist¬ 
ence of the insect pests to be controlled, 
of the fungus or insect parasites or other enemies that feed upon the pest, and the plants or animals that we desire to protect or rid of their injurious insects or other pests. And last but not least, a knowl¬ 
edge of the methods for propagating and distributing the natural enemies of the insect pest that we desire to control is absolutely necessary. Thus, to take the ease of the citrus whitefly as an illustra¬ 
tion, I find that I cannot arrive at a rational understanding of this “whitefly problem” without a comprehensive under¬ 
standing of the life history, habits and conditions of existence of the whitefly, of its fungus enemies and of the citrus tree itself. The methods for distributing, or propagating and distributing, the fungi must be solved in reference to the case at liand, guided, of course, by previous ex- 
]:)erience and the established principles of the subject. 

When considered from a purely scien¬ 
tific point of viezv this subject involves phases of the mutual dependence and re¬ 
lationship of living things as a whole. 


Aside from the many interesting facts of this relationship the question arises, how came this relationship about?—^^this de¬ 
struction of one kind of living thing by another kind. 

The truth of the matter is that nearly all animals are a “pest” in so far as some other animals or plants are concerned. 
Animals that live on decaying animal or vegetable matter are the only exceptions to this" among animals. Plants are thus about the only living things that live with¬ 
out breaking the commandment. Thou shall not kilf if you will allow me to temporarily extend this mandate to all living things. But even among higher plants we have those that kill other'plants and animals or at least live upon their substance. Thus the dodder in part lives upon and finally kills other plants; the In¬ 
dian pipe, beech drops and the green mis¬ 
tletoe feed Upon the sap of other plants. 
A few of the higher plants are also carni¬ 
vorous, feeding in part at least upon in¬ 
sects and the like, which they capture. 
Thus the drosera, or sundew, the Venus flytrap, the pitcher plant and bladderwort belong to this group. But the chief des¬ 
troyers in the plant kingdom, are the bac¬ 
teria and fungi which attack both living plants and animals as well as dead ones, 
and many of these are to be feared as a scourge, only too frequently leaving com¬ 
plete desolation in their path. To this class belong the cholera germ, consump¬ 
tion, typhoid, diphtheria and others, of which there are varieties attacking ani¬ 
mals as well as man. Among such pests 



70 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


of plants can be mentioned the several blights of vegetables and fruit trees and some root diseases, all caused by bacteria or fungi. In fact, nearly all plant dis¬ 
eases not caused by insects or other ani¬ 
mals belong to this class. 

A printed list would be a long one. 
But, were plants and animals to vote on the greatest pest of all living things, no doubt mian himself would receive a un¬ 
animous vote as the most wanton des¬ 
troyer. And the object of all this so- 
called fighting of pests, in sum and sub¬ 
stance, is but to make for man, that larger parasite, a little easier living, a little purer atmosphere to breathe, and perhaps add a span or two, to his human existence. 
Briefly stated, the present relative signifi¬ 
cance and abundance ot each animal and plant group is the result of a struggle to make a living. In this struggle differ¬ 
ent groups began to prey upon other groups and the whole kingdom of living things (plants and animals) has become in a manner somewhat delicately balanced in regard to relative numbers. 

NATURE BALANCED AND UNBALANCED. 

But nature occasionally gets a little out of balance, so to speak. Either some plant or animal group gets out of its place and begins to feed upon some other plant or animal group not normally its food, or it increases abnormally either in propor¬ 
tion to its food or out of proportion with its natural enemies. In either case, it be¬ 
comes a pest proper, in the sense that we ordinarily use the term. Our so-called fighting of pests consists also' in nothing more than in an endeavor tO' restore the equilibrium! in nature or in overbalancing the same in favor of the crop that we wish to harvest. To accomplish this we may use artificial means for combating the 


pest, such as spraying, poisoning, fumi¬ 
gating, etc., or we may artificially spread, 
or propagate and spread, some known enemy of the pest that we desire to con¬ 
trol, or in other words, propagate a pest of the pest. 

As already stated, nature is generally quite balanced in the relative proportion of each kind of living thing. It is only when any one of these finds a great abundance of food, or some calamity keeps its ene¬ 
mies in check, or it is transplanted into some other country or district where its enemies have not followed, that it can in¬ 
crease abnormally. I refer, of course in particular, to plants and animals ordinari¬ 
ly known as pests. Thus if we plant an or- 
ange gTove, we bring into existence an enormous amqunt of food for orange in¬ 
sects, with the result that the latter may increase enormously, much more rapidly, 
for a time at least, than their enemies. If left alone, the natural enemies of some of these would (in fact have done so), very likely at sometime strike a balance and control, if they did not exterminate, the same. 

NATURAL ENEMIES OF SCALE INSECTS IN 

FLORIDA. 

However, we do not ordinarily care to wait for nature to strike this balance, as it might necessitate replanting our grove for a life-time, and we either try to keep the insects off by some artificial means, or we try to discover their enemies and un¬ 
dertake to propagate them artificially, or in some manner encourage their increase. 
In the case of several of the scale insects of trees, in Florida, the fungus parasites of these have become very efficient when¬ 
ever the same were not destroyed by ex¬ 
tensive spraying, or whenever the grower 


FLORIDA STATE FrOTTriCULTURAL SOCIETY. 


7T 


undertook to spread and encourage the same. 

The several fungi parasitic upon scale insects in Florida are the Red-headed 
Scale Fungus (Sphaerostilbe coccophila), 
the Gray-headed Scale Fungus (Ophi- 
onectra coccicola), and the Black Scale 
Fungus (Myriangium durii ). 

Several insect friends have also heen ac¬ 
tive in keeping the scales oif orange trees in check. Among these insect friends are several species of lady-bugs (beetles), the larvae of lace-'winged flies (Chrysopidae), 
the larvae of the Hemerobians (Hemero- 
biidae), related to the lace-winged flies, 
and perhaps several fly-like parasites be¬ 
longing to the Hymenoptera. The efli- 
ciency of all these fungoid and insect friends is so great that many citrus grow¬ 
ers as well as some others have learned to depend upon them altogether. 

FUNGOUS ENEMIES OF SAN JOSE SCALE 

IN FLORIDA. 

The remarkable mortality among the 
San Jose Scale some ten years ago near 
DeFuniak w'as discovered by Professor P. 
H. Rolfs. (Bull. 41), to be due to the red¬ 
headed scale fungus, already mentioned. 
About two years ago Mr. F. P. Hender¬ 
son, of Arno, Florida, introduced some of this fungus intO' his peach orchard, and later discovered that the scale had been killed to such an extent as to amount to its control, if not its eradication. Based upon this extraordinary success in his own orchard, Mr. Henderson succeeded in con¬ 
vincing the Gainesville Orchard Company and the Grifling Bros. Company to intro¬ 
duce this fungus into the peach orchard of the former near Gainesville, and into the five-hundred-acre orchard of the lat¬ 
ter at Komoko. Mr. Henderson collected 


the fungus necessary for this work in great part from oak trees, upon which it frequently occurs in great abun¬ 
dance, growing upon the obscure scale 
{Aspidiotus ohsciinis). Judging from in¬ 
spections made last February iit these or¬ 
chards by Prof. H. S. Fawcett and the writer, 95 per cent, to, 99 per cent, of the scale was dead at the time of inspection. 
The black scale fungus (Myriangium durii) has also' been instrumental in re¬ 
ducing the amount of scale in these or¬ 
chards, and Mr. Henderson has stated, if 
I recall rightly, that he finds more of this black fungus in his orchard at Arno than of the red. Which one of the two fungi in question has been the most effective in these orchards we have not at present been able to decide. 

OTHER ATTEMPTS AT CONTROL BY 
NATURAL ENEMIES. 

Not a few successful and unsuccessful attempts have been made along this line with other insects. The most notable of these has been the attempt to control the increase of the chinchbug in several of the States by means of a fungus disease of this insect. The introduction of the Aus- 
tralian lady-bug to control the cottony cushion scale, orginally introduced into 
California, is too well known to need anv- 
thing more than more mention. The former has not been a complete success, 
and I believe has been generally aban¬ 
doned, while the latter appears to have been an unqualified success. The failure of the former is due to the general lack of favorable moisture conditions neces¬ 
sary for the rapid development of this fungus at the time when the chinchbug is most destructive. Whenev'er the condi¬ 
tions of moisture were favorable, the 



72 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


fungus appears to have been abundantly successful in checking the chinch bug. 

The fact that past efforts at obtaining an enemy fromi China of the imported 
San Jose Scale have not been successful does not indicate that this will not event¬ 
ually be accomplished. Efforts are being made to find and import the natural ene¬ 
mies of the gypsy moth and the brown- 
tail moth into Massachu'setts from Eu¬ 
rope. Efforts are also at present being made to introduce the parasites of the purple scale of citrus into Italy where this scale appears to be on the increase. The officers of the Pasteur Institute are un¬ 
dertaking the introduction of an American robber fly into Algeria for the purpose of reducing the numbers of a certain taba- 
ni'd (a member of the horsefly tribe) 
known to be instrumental in spreading a certain disease of the dromedary. 

While Americans have not been idle in the matter of propagating fungus and in¬ 
sect parasites of insect pests, on the other hand some very interesting work goes to the credit of foreigners. I have already referred to the presence of the purple scale of citrus in Italy and the effort to obtain a parasite of the same from Florida. It is now nearly a year that I prepared (at the request of Dr. L. O. Howard) a box of citrus leaves and twigs heavily infest¬ 
ed with this scale to be shipped to Dr. Ber- 
lese of Italy for this pui*pose. I have also previously referred to the efforts of the 
Pasteur Institute in behalf of the drome¬ 
dary in Algeria. I shall next briefly re¬ 
view a few more instances of like nature and interest. 

Experiments have been made by Ger¬ 
man and French investigators to destroy the grubs of cockchafers by means of a fungus frequently found parasitic upon these. An effort has been made in France 


(but only partially successful) to control a certain turnip weevil by infecting the soil with a parasitic fungus in order to destroy the grubs. In South-west Africa grasshop¬ 
pers have been in part controlled by means of a species of mucor {Mucor locustici- 
da), a relative of the gray bread mold. 

One of the most successful as well as important efforts in this line relates to the destruction of field mice in Thessaly by the use of the Bacilliis typhi murium, 
or in plain English the bacillus of mouse typhoid. This germi is distributed (1903) 
on small pieces of bread or other culture media used for growing fungi and bac¬ 
teria in the laboratory by several of the states of Germany and Austria. It is not known to be injurious to man or domestic animals. A disease-producing microbe of rats has also been discovered by a French- 
mian. 

In 1906 six disease-producing bacteria were cultivated and recommended by the state laboratories of Russia. These were recommended for the destruction of the following animals: House-mouse, rats, 
marmots, wood-mouse, field-mouse, ear¬ 
less-marmot, and the Norway rat. 

THE WHITEFLY AND ITS FUNGUS ENEMIES. 

With this fragmentary review before us, I desire next to take up in some detail the work done in Florida on methods of distributing the several fungi, parasitic upon the whitefly. The remarkable in¬ 
crease of the whitefly is perhaps best ex¬ 
plained by the probable fact that this in¬ 
sect is a foreign importation with but a few of its natural enemies, the fungi, 
coming along with it. The great in¬ 
crease of this insect in newly infested sec¬ 
tions of the state can also be explained in this way: The fungi do not at once fol¬ 
low the fly to these newly infested sec-

73 


tions. The generally persistent presence of the fungi parasitic upon the whitefly in whitefly infested groves after they have once been introduced, and the thorough¬ 
ness with which they do their work, when once well under headway, places these fungi among the most remarkably efflcient of fungus parasites. These fungi came unbidden to begin their good work, and not a few growers have learned to spread them from tree tO' tree and from grove to grove, and are depending altogether upon them' to keep the fly in check. The num¬ 
ber of the fungi parasitic upon the white¬ 
fly is generally given as three, although a fourth one, the red headed scale fungus already mentioned, occasionally develops upon the whitefly larvae ; but the number it destroys, so far as observed, is insignifi¬ 
cant. These three fungi are the Red, the 
Yellow and the Brown. The red and the brown are pretty generally distributed throughout the whitefly infested groves of western Flodda from. Fort Myers to 
Lake City, and as far east as Orlando. 
The red fungus has been known for about fifteen years, and the brown for about eleven. I desire to emphasize that this red fung'us of the whitefly is not the same as the red-headed scale fungus al¬ 
ready mentioned several times. The yel¬ 
low fungus was first recognized as such by Prof. P. H. Rolfs last September on specimens sent in from: Winter Park, 
Florida. At this writing the yellow fun¬ 
gus appears to be limited to Eastern 
Florida, and is found in the groves at 
Orlando, Winter Park, Oviedo, and 
Mims. The scientific name of the red fungus is Aschersonia aleyrodes, Web., of the yellow Aschersonia davo-citrina, P. 
Henn. The fruiting stage of the brown not being known, this fungus has received no definite name. It is this so-called 


Brown fungus, furthermore, for which some evidence exists that it represents two fungi. Professor H. S. Fawcett, of the 
Florida Agricultural Experiment Station has several times observed a form of this fungus that he thought might be the fruit¬ 
ing stage and even succeeded in getting artificial cultures from which he again succeeded in infecting whitefly larvae. 
This fungus, however, appeared to be a species of Verticillium, and somewhat dif¬ 
ferent in appearance from that of the 
Brown as it or'dinarily appears. Recently a similar condition, but not fruiting, was observed by him on some specimens sent in by the writer from Palmetto, Fla. 
These latter specimens presented two forms of Brown on the same leaf, thus indicating very strongly the presence of two fungi, each working on the larvae of the whitefly. Further observations must determine whether these different appear¬ 
ing fungi are different forms of the same fungus or distinct species and also their relative efficiency. 

A UNIQUE PHENOMENON. 

The phenomenon of these several fungi parasitic upon the larvae and pupae of the whitefly in Florida is unique in several ways: (i.) The fact that there are at least three of the fungi practically lim¬ 
ited to- a single food supply (the larvae and pupae of the whitefly) is surely re¬ 
markable; (2.) The abundance of infect¬ 
ing material generally at hand in infected groves practically ready to be used for starting the fungi in other groves, to¬ 
gether with (3.) The relative ease with which this can be applied in infecting other whitefly-infested groves are facts of great importance to the man in charge of the grove; (4.) The favorable climatic 


74 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


conditions generally existing during a good part of the year in Florida is not the least of these. 

In the majority of instances where nat¬ 
ural enemies of an insect pest were em¬ 
ployed for its control the material either had to be imported or cultivated at some laboraitory and distributed fromi there. 
Again, since it could not well be foretold when an outbreak of the pest would occur, 
it became necessary to keep a supply con¬ 
tinually under cultivation. In the in¬ 
stance of the whitefly the grower need not fear any sudden outbreak of the pest. He knows, belorehand just about what he may expect and what the situation is. Nei¬ 
ther does he have to depend upon the 
Station for a supply of fungus. I shall add, however, that we do expect to culti¬ 
vate these fungi at the Experiment Sta¬ 
tion, and we expect to leave no stone un¬ 
turned until we are able to do so. That our 
Professor H. S. Fawcett has made some progress along' this, line will be evident from some of the lantern slides which I 
will show later in the evening. I must frankly add, however, that our first effort along this line on a large scale was not a success. But, unless some unforeseen and; 
unisurmountable difficulties are encoun¬ 
tered we hope to succeed. 

DIFFICULTIES. 

I have one regret, namely, that the freeze of last December, together with the pro¬ 
longed drought of the past six or seven months, has so reduced the amount of the fungi that it will be difficult tO' obtain any large quantities for some time this season. I hope, however, that by the middle of this summer a new crop will have started. The frost reduced the amount of the fungi by causing the leaves 


to drop from the trees, while the drought has caused it, as well as the leaves, to curl and large quantities have been loosened fromi the leaves and dropped to the ground. 

Another factor which may possiibly in¬ 
terfere somewhat with the efficiency of the 
Yellow Fungus is the discovery of a fun¬ 
gus (a species of Cladosporium) that lives upon the yellow. This has been observed by Dr. A. W. Morrill at Orlando and by myself at Mims (near Titusville) and 
Winter Park. When I first observed it at Mims last December it was on some trees that had been sprayed and I then lightly passed it over, thinking that the yellow fungus having been injured or killed by the spray this other fungus came on as. a saprophyte. Dr. Morrill observed it more carefully at Orlando and consid¬ 
ers it a parasite of the yellow fungus. My observations lead me to believe that this second fungus comes onto the pustules of the yellow fungus later in the season after the pustules of the latter have matured and have perhaps undergone some degen¬ 
erative changes. Again, from, the fact that this second fungus occurs in three of the strongholds of the yellow fungus, al¬ 
ready mentioned, I cannot help but feel that its presence is of no great significance so far as the efficiencv of the Yeffiow 
Aschersonia is concerned. If it were a se¬ 
rious pest of the yellow fungus I believe that the latter would have been seriously retarded in one or the other of the four places mentioned where the yellow fun¬ 
gus has been very effective. Besides, I 
do not believe it probable that this second fungus could have infested the yellow fungus in all four of the localities men¬ 
tioned at one time and I therefore infer that the same has been present for per¬ 
haps several years without seriously re^

75 


tarding the usefulness of the yellow fun¬ 
gus. Dr. Morrill observes (circular to the 
Press) that the Red Aschersonia is rarely attacked by the Cladosporiuni. 

Dr. Morrill has recently called my at¬ 
tention to another fungus in the Manatee country which he believes may be a super- 
parasite of the brown. This fungus which occasionally overruns the brown much re¬ 
sembles a certain stage of the black scale 
'{u\\g\\?>,Myrangmnh duryii, but a com¬ 
parative examiination of these two by 
Professor Fawcett has so far failed to verify the possibility of their indentity. 
Personally, I believe in regard to this fun¬ 
gus as I do in regard tO' the Cladosporium overrunning the yellow fungus previously considered, that it attacks the brown fun¬ 
gus only after the latter has become weak¬ 
ened from old age or other causes such as drought, etc. To sum, up, it appears that we have in these two possible super-par¬ 
asites a new issue for investigation. 

CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR THE FUNGI. 

Nearly all fungi thrive best in the pres¬ 
ence of an abundance of moisture, es¬ 
pecially in a moist atmosphere. The past year has given me abundant evidence that the fungi parasitic on the larvae and pupae of the whitefly spread and increase but little during cool or dry weather. 
This fact limits the time for their intro¬ 
duction into whitefly infested trees and groves to the rainy season of the year or to the months of June, July, August and parts of May and Septtember. These are the months during which success is most assured, but other periods of rain and warmth will be favorable. The moisture conditions may also be favorably supple¬ 
mented by permitting plenty of vegeta¬ 
tion in the nature of cover crops, wind¬ 
breaks, etc., to grow at the proper season. 


Irrigation or sprinkling, where the outfit is at hand; will help in creating and con¬ 
serving a moist atmosphere in a grove. 

INTRODUCING THE RED AND THE YELLOW 
ASCHERSONIAS. 

The chief drawback to introducing the fungi has been the supposed difficulty of starting (“planting”) them in whitefly- 
infested trees. The matter appears 'to be much more simple than was heretofore supposed. At Lake City the writer suc¬ 
ceeded (June 20 and August 8th, 1906) 
in introducing the Red Aschersonia into four out of five trees by pinning leaves, 
with an abundance of fungus pustules upon them, to the leaves of the trees. In two instances the fungus started in an¬ 
other part of the tree some distance from the pinned leaves, but as no other infected trees could be found within one-half mile of these, it is considered safe to assume that the fungus started from the infected leaves placed there. In two of the success¬ 
ful instances the leaves with the fungus pustules Upon them were dry and had been picked about a month before being pinned into- the trees, showing that the spoi'^s of the fungus retained their vitality for at least a month and nO' doubt longer. 
It was also' found that the fungus had started in three different trees at Lees¬ 
burg, into which Judge J. B. Gains had pinned some leaves. No' Red Ascherson¬ 
ia had hitherto been observed at Leesburg. 
Since writing the first part of this para¬ 
graph, the writer has found the fungus started in each of thiTty-seven trees into which he had pinned leaves of the Red 
Aschersonia six weeks previously (August 
15th) at Leesburg. In all, forty-two trees had been treated in this manner, but five of them were not examined for lack of 


76 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


time. In many of these trees the fungus had made'^good headway, and in one in¬ 
stance Judge Gaines reported that it had started at the end of two weeks from the time of infection. W. H. Maxwell of 
Titusville, also reports that he has ob¬ 
served the Yellow Aschersonia to start in two weeks after “planting” (pinning leaves) the same in trees infested with whitefly. 

The writer has also succeeded in start¬ 
ing the Red Aschersonia by spraying a mixture of spores and water on the under surfaces of the leaves in trees infested with whitefly. This method of applica¬ 
tion was successful in starting an infec¬ 
tion in two out of three citrus trees, spray¬ 
ed at Lake City (July lo, 1906). In each case (leaves pinned or spores sprayed) 
the fungus was observed to have started in three to four weeks from the time of application of the spores or leaves. Eight trees were also sprayed at Leesburg at the same time (August 15th) that the fungus was started there by pinning on leaves, and examination six weeks later, 
showed that the fungus had started in each tree. 

These experiments are a complete dem¬ 
onstration that this fungus can readily be started either by pinning on leaves or by spraying on spores, there being only one failure in fifty-two trials made during the months of June, July and August, 1906. 

Hitherto, planting into a grove small trees with fungus-infested whitefly larvae upon them has been considered the only sure way of introducing it. This method is good and sure, where the trees can be kept from dropping their leaves, but is rather impracticable on a large scale. The infected trees should be planted so that their branches and leaves extend among 


the leaves of the tree to be infected. If necessary, the infected trees may be plant¬ 
ed in tubs and raised on platforms or oth¬ 
erwise elevated. 

One serious objection is raised in re¬ 
gard to the efficacy of the fungus, namely, 
that when it has practically killed off the whitefly and the fly starts to infest the grove anew, it takes the fungus so long to start that the fly has done considerable damage before Ihe fungus gets it under control. The situation appears to be about as follows. During one year the fungus cleans up the fly; the second year the grove is generally clean, also the fruit; the third year the fly re¬ 
infests the grove, and the trees and fruit are ag'ain black with sooty mold; 
then the fungus does its work again; etc. 
Now, in view of the fact, that the fungus can be introduced by pinning on leaves or by spraying on spores, the fungus should he started at the same time that the zahitedy Ictrvae are first observed, and while the progress and injury of the fly may not be wholly offset, yet I believe a great deal can be done in this way to les¬ 
sen the injury. It is purely a question of helping nature (the fungus) along by guiding her at the critical moment. This is an important point. A grower should not wait for the fungus to start of its own accord but should start it himself as soon as he discovers the presence of the white¬ 
fly and this should be done whether the fungus has previously been present or not. 
The fungus should be introduced and han¬ 
dled with the same rational consideration with which spraying or fumigation is car¬ 
ried on. Because the fungus is a natural remedy and will of itself (generally) 
spread and reduce the whitefly is no rea¬ 
son why rational means for artificially spreading the same should not he used.

77 


BY SPRAYING ON SPORES OF THE FUNGUS. 

If it is decided to^ introduce the fungus by means of spraying on spores, care should be taken to spray against the under surface of the leaves. Future experiments may show that this precaution is not nec¬ 
essary but we are not likely to go very far astray by adopting it for the present. 
Forty well developed pustules having the bright red spots upon them are sufficient for a pint of water. Two well infected leaves may be taken as representing the forty pustules but one leaf will frequently have the required number and often more. 
A pint of the solution, I believe, should be sufficient for a tree of ordinary size where a very fine spray is used. From this it will be seen that spraying is the most eco¬ 
nomical in so (far as infecting material required is concerned. Three thousand leaves will about fill a bushel measure. 
Two leaves per tree to make the spray, 
gives us fifteen hundred trees that can he treated with this number of leaves. Where an abundance of leaves are available the spraying solution may be made stronger; 
it cannot be made toO' strong. After hav¬ 
ing poured the water over the leaves and stirred the same about for a few minutes, 
fifteen to thirty minutes should be allowed for the spores to become dissolved out of the red spots on the pustules of the fun- 
• gus. Then the mass should be stirred again, thoroughly, in order to wash out all the spores possible. Do not permit the solution to settle but strain the liquid at onee through a piece of cheesecloth or fine wire sieve. An atomizer spray is to be preferred because it does not require so much liquid to spray the tree. At all events, a nozzle that produces a very fine spray should be used. The above esti¬ 
mate of one pint of liquid per tree was 


based upon an atomizer spray. If on the other hand, no atomizer is available, a spraying machine may be employed. The spraying solution should under no condi¬ 
tions be permitted to stand in a copper or brass tank, for the amount of copper that would go into the solution might be fatal to the spores, as these are very sensitive to copper. If a spraying machine made wholly or in part of copper or brass, must be used, the same should be thoroughly cleaned before using, and then the work should be done as expeditiously as pos¬ 
sible. If it is necessary to use the copper or brass reservoir connected with the spray pump or spraying machine this should be partially filled with the solution, 
enough only being put in, to spray three or four trees. Spray the solution on the under surface of all the infested leaves giving special attention to the heavily in¬ 
fested new growth. If it happens that only a limited amount of the spraying solu¬ 
tion is available it may be diluted with water. Thoroughly spraying all the trees with a weaker solution is considered pre¬ 
ferable to spraying half the trees, or only part of each tree, with a stronger solution. 

It goes without saying, that it would be futile to introduce fungus into a tree not infested with whitefly. The fungi in ques¬ 
tion, so far as known, can thrive only upon the whitefly, so that there would be nothing for them to live upon in a non- 
infcsted tree. It will also be well to wait before introducing fungus into a tree until the whitefly larvae can be abundantly found under a considerable number of leaves. To spray every tree in a grove re¬ 
gardless of the individual requirements of each tree would frequently lead to waste of material and labor. The writer’s plan of campaign would be as follows: 
Start the fungus in all the trees in which 


78 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the 'whitehy larvae can be readily found. 
Later, say in three or four weeks, inspect the grove and spray all the trees not pre¬ 
viously sprayed and which now show the presence of whitefly. In another three or four weeks inspect again and spray. Each tree should be considered individually and treated accordingly. Any trees not show¬ 
ing a good start of fungus in three to six weeks should be sprayed again, wholly or in part. This kind of procedure should be continued from year to year, and the pre¬ 
diction is made that in a comparatively few years, when the citrus growing sec¬ 
tions of the State have in this manner been thoroughly saturated with the fungi, there will be no whitefly problem. 

I have stated above that the fungi in question can thrive only upon the whitefly larvae and pupae and this is probably true in nature. In the laboratory, however. 
Professor H. S. Fawcett has been success¬ 
ful in growing the Yellow and Red As- 
chersonias, and to produce spores, upon several of the media generally used for such work. There is but little doubt that the Brown Fungus can be cultivated • on the same media. This opens up the pos¬ 
sibility of producing spores of the fungi in the laboratory for use upon trees. But as an abundance can generally be obtained from infected groves it is not likely that we shall very soon be compelled to depend upon artificial means for a supply. The fact, however, that a fungus can be cul¬ 
tivated artificially gives the scientific in¬ 
vestigator greater opportunity for careful and varied experiments and observations that may eventually lead to broad scien¬ 
tific principles of practical value. 

I wish to state again that if the first attempt at introducing the fungus fails to produce a good start in a grove, or in individual trees of a grove, a second at¬ 


tempt .should be made and a third one if necessary. This kind of spraying is much cheaper (and I believe spraying on the spores is preferable to pinning on the leaves; but both methods can be used) 
than spraying with insecticides, and is perfectly harmless to the trees. This point, Lirthermore, should not be lost sight of, that the increase of the fungus in a tree (other things being equal) is in the same proportion that we succeed in starting it in that tree. Thus, if we suc¬ 
ceed in starting loo pustules of fungus in one tree an'd 300 in another, it will be ev¬ 
ident that the spread of the fungus in the last tree \Vill be three times as rapid as in the first one, and hence the importance of making .as *good a start of fungus as possible by repeated sprayings. 

Attention should also be directed to the fact, that for subsequent sprayings, fun¬ 
gus from the trees previously treated may be used, provided it is sufficiently develop¬ 
ed. This will be evident as the pustules increase in size and become a bright scar¬ 
let red in the Red Aschersonia or a bright yellow in the Yellow Aschersonia. 

BY PINNING ON LEAVES. 

To introduce the fungus by pinning on leaves I would suggest that from one to a dozen or more well infected leaves be pinned to a tree. The number will be de¬ 
termined by the amount available. At 
Leesburg 12 leaves per tree were used. 
Each infected leaf should be pinned to the under surface of the leaf on the tree, with its under surface down, that having been its position before it w'as removed from the tree and is in closest keeping with nature. 
The infected leaves might be pinned with the infected (or under) side against the under side of the leaves on the tree, and I 
have obtained good results in this way, 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


79 


but for the sake of keeping close to na¬ 
ture I advise the other way for the present. 

Each infested leaf should be pinned as high up in the tree as is convenient, that 

is, at least as high as a man can reach. To pin it higher is desirable. It should, fur¬ 
thermore, be so placed that the drip from 

it, when it rains, will drop onto a cluster, 
or several clusters, of leaves beneath it. 
Use two pins for each leaf. I have ob¬ 
served that the fungus sometimes starts on the leaves beneath the pinned leaf rather than at the leaf to which the in¬ 
fected leaf was pinned. It is well to pin a small piece of paper on the upper surface of the leaves to which the infected leaves are pinned as a mark. This will greatly facilitate later inspections. 

THE BROWN FUNGUS. 

What has been said for the Ascher- 
sonias applies (with one probable excep¬ 
tion) also to the Brown Fungus. The spores of the Brown Fungus have not been discovered, and this fact makes it uncertain whether it can be successfully introduced by spraying. This leaves two methods available for introducing the 
Brown Fungus; (i) to pin leaves having whitefly larvae infected with the fungus upon them onto the leaves, of the tree into which it is to be introduced; (2) to plant small trees, having the fungus upon them, into the grove as previously ex¬ 
plained for the Aschersonias. (See also 
Bull. 88, by the writer, Florida Agricul¬ 
tural Experiment Station). 

CONCLUDING STATEMENT. 

So much on the subject of the fungi. 

I should be extravagant were I to herald the same as an absolute panacea. They are, however, a very valuable adjunct to a whitefly-infested grove and with a 


thorough knowledge of how to best intro¬ 
duce the fungi, together with a little extra fertilizer for each tree, the grower will be able to continue the growing of citrus fruits profitably, other things being equal. 
I should not hesitate, however, to recom¬ 
mend judicious spraying in isolated groves (i. e., isolated by sufficient distance or forest barriers from other groves) 
or on small trees where the work can be done thoroughly. By judicious spraying 
I mean that the man knows the proper time to spray and to spray thoroughly. 
And then, I should recommend spraying only in the nature of a makeshift to tide over a certain period pending either the in¬ 
troduction of the fungi or fumigation. 
Following Dr. Morrill’s careful’ experi¬ 
ments and observations on fumigation for the whitefly during the past year, I antici¬ 
pate that many growers will take up this method of controlling the whitefly, and that rightly so. And, as more experience along this line becomes available it appears not at all improbable but that many grow¬ 
ers will prefer to control the whitefly as well as other insects by fumigation. This will be especially true for growers or dis¬ 
tricts so isolated as to be comparatively safe from becoming immediately reinfest¬ 
ed from nonfumigated distriots. 

In regard to the subject of insect con¬ 
trol by means of their natural enemies in general, many efforts along this line have been only partially successful or complete failures while perhaps only a few can be accorded complete success. But the fact that there are failures does not indicate that any particular effort along this line will be a failure, since each case must be worked out on its own merit. This brings us to another important fact which may be of much value in guiding our efforts to control insect pests by means of their 


8o 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


insect or fungoid and bacterial enemies. 
We may roughly divide insect pests into 
(I), those which are always with us, such as scale insects and the whitefly, and (2) 
those whose appearance in sufficient num¬ 
bers to be destructive is uncertain. Among such may be mentioned the several leaf- 
hoppers, destructive 'to corn, beans, etc., 
grasshoppers, chinch-bug, and others. 
The fact that these latter can generally be found only in small numbers, or practi¬ 
cally disappear altogether, except, during periodic and sporadic periods of increase, 
this results in a natural decrease of their enemies to a minimum. It being practi¬ 
cally almost impossible to cultivate a sup¬ 
ply of their insect enemies on artificial foods 6r other insects, and generally diffi¬ 
cult enough to artificially cultivate their fungoid or bacterial enemies, it follows that the enemies of these pests are gener¬ 
ally not at hand in sufficient abundance to meet the requirements when an outbreak of such a pest occurs. All this, together with the possibility of unfavorable weath¬ 


er conditions, in case the enemy supplied is a fungus, makes the proposition a difficult one. 

When considering the proposition of controlling the first (i) class by means of their natural enemies we have this great advantage, namely, that the insect is gen¬ 
erally with us in abundance at all times and hence also its enemies; and our work is simplified to this extent, that about all we have to do is to devise methods of spreading its enemies to' keep them abreast of the pest and to protect them by creating conditions favorable for their increase. 

If we desire to supplement their natural increase by cultivating themi in the lab¬ 
oratory, it will be mainly for the purpose of observing them at closer range and un¬ 
der peculiarly favorable conditions other¬ 
wise unobtainable. It is under the favor¬ 
able conditions accompanying this first 
(i) class of insects that we are laboring in our effort to control the whitefly and scale insects of Florida.

The Influence of Packing Methods on the Carrying 

Qualities of Citrus Fruits* 


By Lloyd S* Tcnny* 

(Assistant Pomologist.) 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

The agricultural interests of the world have made immense progress in recent years, especially true is this in this coun¬ 
try. In a single generation there have been developed our modern system of State 
Experimental Stations and the National 
Department of Agriculture. It was only recently that the primary object of these institutions and frequently the only real one, was the studying of plant diseases. 
This in turn gradually led into’ the work of plant breeding in all its phases, the securing of varieties resistant to certain diseases, those especially adapted to one soil or one climatic condition, and thus the work has broadened, not only along this line but along every line, until now we find the Department of Agriculture and many of the State stations undertaking a careful scientific research along a mul¬ 
titude of lines connected with the farming interests. No phase of the subject is considered too small or too unimportant tO' be left out. 

One of the subjects into which this situdy has led us at the Department of 
Agriculture is the transportation side of fruit handling. The wonderful extension of our railroads and the great headway that has been made in the methods of transporting perishable produce, has made it possible for every section of the country to produce those fruits and vegetables best 

6 


suited to its soil and other conditions. 
And so the vineyards and orchards of 
California, the gardens of Texas, and the semi-tropic fruits and vegetables of Flori¬ 
da have come to be well known things over vthe country. But the one thing which has made all this practicable and has enabled the man of New York or 
Denver to have Florida fruits upon his table is the development of the transpor¬ 
tation side of agriculture. The study of these transportation subjects and the methods of harvesting and packing fruits intended for distant markets is a study 
-worthy of real investigation. What com^ 
mercial advantage would it be to Floricla to produce a delicious orange if you grow¬ 
ers and shippers were unable to put this on the market at a profit. 

Uniformly almost during recent years has good fruit demanded excellent prices. 
Methods of orchard management have been improved, so that the yield is nearly certain and the quality of the fruit high, 
the various fungous and insect diseases are watched and methods of preventing 

their spread sought, and so along every line we find the conditions such as tO' jus¬ 
tify us in expecting an industry at a very high point of development, and such do we find to a great measure. The fact re¬ 
mains, nevertheless, that while we are pro¬ 
ducing something like a 4,000,000 box 



82 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


crop in this State, worth some ten millions of dollars, that the profits to the ordinary shipper are comparatively small. I real¬ 
ize at the same time that doubtless most of the orange men here today are conduct¬ 
ing their business on a liberal margin of profit: at the same time you will admit that there are those in your immediate neighborhood who are not so fortunate. 
These conditions exist in a measure at least from the great losses there are in transit from decayed or wasty fruit. 

THE EXTENT OF THE LOSS FROM DECAY. 

It is difficult to estimate the extent of this loss, since no accurate and detailed inspection reports are made, but not one of you will deny that there are heavy loss¬ 
es. As we have come into closer touch with the shippers throughout the State, 
we continue to get more of the inside in¬ 
formation regarding this sort of loss. It is not uncommon to hear of cars arriving at destination Avith 20 or more per cent, 
decay; even in some exceptionally bad cas¬ 
es it runs as high as 50 per cent. From personal conversation Avith many of the large Florida commission men in New 
York City, a 15 per cent, loss seems a conservative estimate. One of the very large houses and one that favors Florida fruits, expresses their opinion as follows: 

“The past season has been an exception¬ 
ally good one, and 10 per cent. AA^ould cover the losses in most of the cars, but in former years a 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, decay was not uncommon. We should think that a 15 per cent, v/aste would be a fair average for several years.’’ 

But for our purpose let us be even more conservatiA^e in our estimate of the loss from decay in transit and place it at 10 
per cent., which means but 7 or 8 rotten oranges in eadh half bix of 150s. With 


this moderate loss, it means on a crop of three million and a half boxes, the loss of three hundred and fifty thousand boxes, 
or over one thousand cars of fruit. If the cost of picking, packing and shipping amounts to one dollar and a quarter a box, 
then you are paying out over $400,000 to harvest rotten oranges. If you are a ship¬ 
per and buy your fruit at a dollar a box, 
that means another loss of over $300,000, 
or to put the figures into one sum, you orange men of Florida are losing each year close to one million dollars from this one cause alone. The purpose of the De¬ 
partment of Agriculture in opening this line of experimental work is to determine whether this loss is a necessary one, and, 
if not, Avhat are the causes and how far are the present packing methods to blame for the present condition of affairs. The subject is one that cannot be covered in an investigation extending over one sea¬ 
son alone, nor over two, but it is one that must be followed for a series of years, or long enough to determine experimentally the effects of different methods of picking, 
hauling, packing and shipping, season af¬ 
ter season. So let me say now that any statements made today or any results given, are only preliminary and subject to change as the work develops. The work was begun this past season, and, at the best, only a preliminary survey could be made the first year. Had it not been that the results obtained sO' far Avere so uniform and so suggestive, we would not feel jus¬ 
tified in bringing before you even this pre¬ 
liminary report. I should like to say fur¬ 
ther that we are beginning this work with no set idea as to the influence of the pack¬ 
ing methods on this subject, and so have no pet theory to advance. The Avork will be Avholly experimental in nature, and our aim will be to devise methods of handling

the citrus crop with the least amount of loss in transit. 

THE CAUSE OF DECAY. 

The decay which causes practically all the wasty arrivals is produced by the growth of a common blue mold fungus, a low form of plant life. The spores which form the blue covering on the surface of a rotten orange act as the seed for the repro¬ 
duction of this plant. These are ever present, the dust of the air is laden with them, and each orange doubtless has many of them on its surface. Before decay takes place, three things seem to be neces¬ 
sary, as they are necessary for the growth of any plant, a soil in which to grow, heat and moisture. 

One of the characteristics of the blue mold fungus is that it seldom if ever lives on living tissue. A perfectly healthy un¬ 
injured orange on the tree is seldom seen decaying. When the fruit is picked the life of the orange does not stop immedi¬ 
ately, the cells continue active for some time after. It should, therefore, be im¬ 
possible for the fruit tO’ decay soon after harvesting, and from experiments we see that a perfectly sound orange may be covered with these spores and held in a warm, moist room and yet no decay takes place. But once bruise the fruit or injure its skin, thus killing some of the cells, and one of the conditions for the growth of this decay fungus has been supplied; it has proper soil conditions. If you place this injured orange on your desk in a very dry place, or put in a very cold room, 
it probably will not rot, but pack it in a box, wrapped in paper, so that any mois¬ 
ture there may be retained, and then place the box in a warm, moist spot and the decay will be very rapid. 


With this understanding of the nature and cause of the common decay, it be¬ 
comes easier to see how the harvesting methods might have an important bearing on the keeping quality of the fruit. If the methods are such as to injure it by bruising or cutting the skin, then we would lookdEpr decay, and in turn carelul methods should give sound fruit. 

THORN PUNCTURING. 

Starting our investigations with the fruit as it hangs upon the tree, some in¬ 
jury has been done already by thorn punc¬ 
turing and branch injury. In seedling or¬ 
chards this damage at times may run quite high, and after a period of warm, moist weather, decaying fruit may be found on the tree. Close inspection of some of these in the early stage of the rot will generally show that the decay is begin¬ 
ning around some sort of a mechanical injury, although it may be so small that it is scarcely seen without the aid of a hand lens. This class of injury is in¬ 
creased by the method of picking, namely in the setting the ladder, by the picker pulling the branches about, and by his hitting the fruit against the thorns. In examining fruit from the same tree, 
picked by different men, it is common to find in one box five or six fresh thorn bruises, while in another not one is seen. 
A small number of counts made so far indicate that about 6.6 per cent, were thorn or tree injured. This varies from, 
one to 22 per cent. Lots with 5 per cent., 
3.9 per cent., 6.6 per cent, and 6.8 per cent, were found. 

CLIPPER CUTTING. 

Enormous damage may be done by puncturing the fruit with the clippers in the act of picking. On the other hand, it 


84 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


is not necessary to do any damage. 
Three years ago when Mr. G. Harold 
Powell, of the Department of Agricul¬ 
ture, began his work with the California citrus fruits, he found as high as 15 or 20 
per cent, of the crop made subject to de¬ 
cay from this thing alone. He and his associates made records on hundreds of boxes, with the result that at that time a 
5 per cent, injury was as low as could of¬ 
ten be found; frequently the per cent, ran to 25, not infrequently to 40 or even 50, 
and with some individual pickers even to a higher amount. The shape of the Navel orange as grown in California, with a sunken area around the stem, favors this injury with the clipper. In attempting to cut the stem as close as possible, the shears punctured the skin. To a much less extent, this damage is found in Florida. 
The round orange is more easily clipped with a short stem, and there is much less danger of its being cut. A count of a considerable number of boxes show 5.9 
per cent, clipper cut. In many cases no injury was done at all, and in a few the percentage ran high. 

Mr. Powell has demonstrated by many shipping tests, and it is accepted as a fact among California shippers, that an orange with a broken skin is liable to decay in transit. Boxes of that class of fruit have reached New York City this past season with as many as 105 rotten oranges in a box of 126s. When injured fruit is ship¬ 
ped under ice or during cold weather, the decay upon arrival is often small. This same fruit shows a rapid breaking down, 
however, when it is held a few days upon the market. 

The following chart will indicate the amount of decay in injured fruit as com¬ 
pared with sound lots: 


CHART I. 

Apparently free from mechanical 

injury. 2 per cent decay. 

Mechanically injured.48 per cent decay. 

The average for the sound fruit is 2.9 
per cent, decay, while the injured fruit ran as high as 48.7 per cent, rotten. 
These figures are the results of the work done in Florida, and while the tests have been few in number, yet they only confirm the results obtained in California with series extending over a long period of time. 

LONG STEM PUNCTURES. 

Another type of injury is the punctur¬ 
ing done by long stems. Some pickers leave a considerable number of stems suffi¬ 
ciently long to pucture other fruit. This damage may be done as the fruit is drop¬ 
ped into the picking bag, from the move¬ 
ment of the oranges in the bag, in the hauling, or somewhere in the packing house. 

INJURY FROM DROPPING. 

It was a question, however, whether all the decay which develops in a car of oranges in transit from Florida could be attributed to the above causes. With 3 or 
4 per cent, thorn punctured fruit, 8 or 10 
per cent, clipper cuts, and some additional stem punctured oranges, it is difficult to explain a 40 or 50 per cent, decay. These high percentages seem to indicate that at times at least nearly or all of the fruit was made susceptible to decay. To a fruit man, unaccustomed to your methods of hervesting and packing, the most probable explanation of this condition would be in the amount of rough handling and drop¬ 
ping to which the fruit is subjected. The picker in his hurry lets the fruit fall into 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


85 


his basket or bag and generally takes pains to give each orange an extra shove with his shears as he aims the fruit toward the basket. He often holds the branch with one hand and allows the oranges to drop the 18 inches or 2 feet into the basket. 
In an ordinary gang, a drop of 12 inches seems about the minimum which any or¬ 
ange receives in the picking; two feet is not uncommon. In pouring into the field crate, which is 13 inches high itself, the mouth of the bag is held 6 inches above the box, and here is another drop of 18 
inches onto the bottom. Not counting the rough handling in loading and in hauling, 
sometimes over very rough roads, there is another very dangerous drop into the hopper. This is often large and the fruit rolls down a steep gravity run and hiits again.. With another tumble into the bins the oranges are ready to pack. The question then is, does dropping make the oranges susceptible tO' decay? The only way to settle such a question is by experi¬ 
menting. Pick carefully some boxes of oranges, pack half the lot as they are, 
drop the other half a certain known dis¬ 
tance—we selected 18 inches—^then pack them and hold along with the first lot for 
10 days or two weeks. Do this, not once, 
nor twice, but a hundred times, and you will begin to know whether an 18 incli drop will cause any decay. Here are some of the results of our first year’s work. 
These experiments were done in your own packing houses, through the courtesy and excellent co-operation of the owners and foremen. At the same time that the ex¬ 
perimental lots were packed, several box¬ 
es from the regular house pack of the same fruit were set aside. These were picked, hauled, and packed in the usual manner and by the regular workmen. In preparing the series of dropped fruit, un¬ 


usual care was taken to have the oranges picked carefully and not dropped into the bag and box. All mechanically injured fruit was removed and there were no long stems. Just before packing each orange was held 18 inches above the floor or bot¬ 
tom of the box and dropped separately this distance.

ed 2.9 per cent, decay and that which con- 


86 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tained 20.1 per cent, was in the drop of 
18 inches. How much of the 22.9 per cent, 
waste in the house pack may be attributed to a similar cause, we will leave to you to judge, who know something about the amount of rough handling a box of fruit ordinarily receives. 

SUMMARY. 

It does not seem best at the present time to make any very definite recommen¬ 
dations. I should like to present, how¬ 
ever, the following questions for your consideration. 

Is there not an immense amount of rough hanidling in your orange groves and packing houses? 

Is it not reasonable to expect, and do the experiments not indicate, that the in¬ 
jured and dropped fruit has been made susceptible to decay? 

Other conditions, such as the amount of moisture and heat at the time of packing, 
the length of delay in shipping, the time in transit and the character of the weather encountered, all have their bearing. But as a preliminary consideration, is it not more than probable that the packing meth¬ 
ods have much to do with the keeping quality of citrus fruits ? 

DISCUSSION. 

Member.—What is the character of the land? High pine land fruit? 

Mr. Tenney—^All kinds. This is one of the things of which more defi¬ 
nite notice will be taken another year. 
We did not find a great deal of differ¬ 
ence in the results where the experi¬ 
ments were made with high pine land or hammock land fruit. There were, 
however, striking differences in indi¬ 
vidual lots of fruit. 

Mr. Hart.—A question I have in mind is whether, if that fruit was kept 


a little while and cured and softened up, it would not have gone through with less percentage of rot. When an orange is just off the tree and rigid, 
the drop would injure it considerably more than after it had been off the tree for 24 or 36 hours, and that brings up the matter of whether curing is de¬ 
sirable or not before shipping. 

Mr. Tenny.—Oranges that have been picked some time will probably not be injured as much by dropping as those that are freshly picked. The difficulty, however, lies in the fact that a large proportion of the damage is done in the picking, hence curing some time after picking will not remedy the trouble. Under your present harvest¬ 
ing system, the trouble is in getting your fruit into the packing house. 
There is little doubt that an orange that is cured will stand a drop better than one that is just picked and conse¬ 
quently hard. 

Mr. Hart.—Then another important point is that where fruit is shipped in small quantities, it is loaded largely by the freight handlers, and it is not unusual for them to shoulder the box and give it a shove and let it go. Now, 
if we had cured the fruit, I think it would have been injured less than when packed immediately from the tree and crowded into boxes. 

Mr. Tenny—The matter of delaying the shipment will be taken up before our work is finished. I could give you some of the results from the California end, but do not feel justified in doing that, because the same conditions might not hold good here in Florida. 

Mr. Hart—In putting on the cov¬ 
ers of the boxes considerable injury might be done, while, if partly cured.

it might get into market in better shape. 

Dr. Richardson—There has lately come into use a different kind of pack. 
We used to put the oranges in and press the top down and nail it. Now, 
the market seems to like a loose pack. 
The ends of the top are nailed down and the center at the partition, is not nailed down, and it bellies out. Was the pack you used the loose or the firm pack ? I think the loose pack permits the fruit to* be bruised. 

Mr. Tenny—We use the firm pack. 
In any case, there was no damage in our experimental lots after the fruit was packed. Any injury that appeared on this fruit was made before the box was nailed up. The boxes were set in the packing houses very carefully and no injury was done by the drop¬ 
ping or the rough handling of the boxes. 

Mr. Skinner—In my opinion, this is one of the most important sessions. 
Now, about the picking of the fruit; at the start I want to say that I don’t see what we are going to do. I had one man six feet and over picking for me, 
and found him with his arms extended full length and dropping them down to the basket. I don’t know how in the world we are going to get rid of the trouble. Last 3^ear, I provided my men with a bag to tie around them that had a kind of a proboscis. I also agree that there is a great deal of trouble in the packing, but how to overcome it is a question. Naturally, 
this brings up the labor question. I 
shipped this past season about 60,000 
boxes, and every time I saw a fellow dropping an orange, it touched me right on a tender nerve. You can im¬ 


agine that by the end of the season I 
was a nervous wreck. There seems to be seasons when everything carries well, and then another season when everything rots. . Mr. Sampson ship¬ 
ped a carload of oranges to Augusta, 
Ga. and they were not over three or four days in transit, but when they ar¬ 
rived there, they were entirely worth¬ 
less. I do not know how to meet these conditions. I expect to tiy a blower to see if I cannot dry my fruit. The atmosphere in this country is saturated to the full point with moisture, and sometimes the oranges are dripping wet with moisture from the atmos¬ 
phere. I would like to know your opinion as to whether it would be prac¬ 
ticable to use a blast of that kind to keep the fruit dry. 

Mr. Tenny—This is a question con¬ 
siderably discussed in California. I 
am not willing tO' venture an opinion on it. The point in question is this: 
If the climatic conditions are such so that the atmosphere contains 90 per cent, or so of moisture, and this moist air is blown over the fruit, it may ap¬ 
parently dry them off, but in reality' 
the air which is around the fruit after it is packed is still very moist. As the oranges continue to give off moisture after being packed, it seems probable that if the weather is moist, there would still be sufficient moisture to al¬ 
low decay to take place. Regarding the question as to^ why one lot ot fruit will decay while another packed appar¬ 
ently under similar conditions arrives in a sound condition, is possibly be¬ 
cause the atmospheric conditions at the time of the two shipments were en¬ 
tirely different. One shipment may have been injured by the pickers, and 



88

at the time of packing the weather was dry, while in a short time the condi¬ 
tions may be entirely different, and a lot of fruit injured in a similar manner to the first lot may show a heavy de¬ 
cay. The relation between the climat¬ 
ic conditions here at the time of har¬ 
vesting and the decay conditions upon arrival on the market is something we want to investigate further. How much good may be accomplished by blowing air over the fruit, I do not know. 

Dr. Phillips—I would like to ask what the gentleman thinks about using the brush. 

Mr. Tenny—If your fruit is not dirty, do not brush it. Do not handle your oranges any more than is abso¬ 
lutely necessary. If they do not need washing or brushing, don’t do it. They may be washed or brushed probably without serious damage, but make a practice of handling your fruit just as little as is possible. I know of no wash yet discovered that will kill the spores of the decay fungus and at the same time not injure the fruit. This fungus is the same that causes the blue mold on bread and other things, so the spores are ever present. It is not a parasite, it is a saprophyte; that is, it lives on dead tissues. It will not live on a live, healthy orange. 

Mr. Gibbs—What class of labor do you depend on in California for picking oranges ? 

Mr. Tenny—They have the Japanese, 
Chinese, Mexican and hoboes. I realize that you have hard labor conditions here in Florida, but we had this same thing to meet in California. But let me ask you this. If all your orange trees were transformed in a night to peach trees, 


wouldn’t you gather the entire peach crop without punching them or dropping them? Wouldn’t you? 

Mr. Hart—This seems to be an ex¬ 
perience meeting. Mr. Skinner was speaking about the question whether we could overcome the careless picking or not, and I would offer one suggestion which I got from Mr. Stevens in regard to that matter that has been of great help to me. That is, to have all your field pickers have a piece of chalk and put their numbers on the boxes. When it comes into the packing house, if there is any injury to the fruit that has been picked, you can identify the picker who did that work; then, of course, you can speak to your foreman and have him see that the trouble is corrected or the picker discharged. Where you have care¬ 
less pickers (and they will get careless if not closely watched) they think that their fruit goes in with all the rest so you can¬ 
not identify it, and consequently they take little pains. 

The next point is about the current of air in the packing house. I can take an orange and with my thumb nail cut through the cuticle clear around the or¬ 
ange and put it up on a beam and it will dry up and the wound will become air¬ 
tight. It can go into the market, if the conditions are fairly good, after it has left my packing house, in good shape. 
I believe a current of air is very import¬ 
ant in a packing house, and if you can sweep a dry current of air through, it will heal those wounds. 

Now, about the moisture in the atmo¬ 
sphere. If the fruit gets, cold during the night, and the morning comes up bright and warm, the orange does not warm up as quickly, and the warm air deposits 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


89 


its moisture on the oranges and makes them wet. I have my packing house so built and arranged that I can close it up entirely. If the night has been cold and the days are warm I close it up early in the day and keep my oranges dry until packed. If I open a window or a door, 
even for a few minutes, the oranges are wet. 

As to the picking boxes, to avoid too deep a drop, I would have my field boxes shallow. I would not have them as deep as some do. For the picking receptacle 
I would not use a bag. There may be less danger of injury from dropping, but you can tell your men to put them into any receptacle without a drop. When they put them into a bag they are climb¬ 
ing over the tree. It is a thorny tree, 
and they cannot help but get the bag against the thorns and branches of the tree, or thumping it against the ladder. 
There is a gentleman here, I think, who invented a metal receptacle, so that you can stoop down and allow the oranges to slide though the lower end without any drop. I believe we can pick into these picking baskets safely. They are the best of any kind that I h^ve found, when of the correct shape. The baskets are made by the Wakefield Rattan Company in 
East Boston. I have paid all the way from $1.00 to $2.50 for them. 

Member—What size of basket is most desirable? 

Mr. Hart—I think those that hold about half a box, fairly deep, but not wide from the body outward. The out¬ 
side should be higher than that next to the picker. 

Now, about brushing and washing. I 
do not believe you can put your fruit in really first-class shape with a brush. 


unless you have water connected with it someway. I wash mine particularly on account of the fly-specked fungus which gives the fruit a little cloudiness. Fruit shipped without has not such a tempting appearance, but that which has been wash¬ 
ed meets more the demands of the very best trade and looks like pure gold. If you run a brusher over a rotten orange, 
you are apt to inoculate every bristle. I 
do not think that you can get satisfactory results without using water. To put the fruit on the market in the best possible condition, I think it must be washed. I 
think more and more will come to that conclusion and adopt the washer, and there is at least one washer on the mar¬ 
ket that will do it in fine shape and with¬ 
out injury if properly handled. 

Out of my grove this year we lost simply one box of oranges from the whole packing. The lot in which that was, was shipped under extremely severe conditions after it left my hands. This year I shipped until the middle of March. 
I speak of this to show you that washing does not injure the fruit; if anything, 
it is of benefit. I have taken fruit picked by the same man, put half of them through the washer and the other not, 
and stored them away in the packing house and left them there for six or eight weeks, and in each test the unwashed fruit gave away first. 

Mr. Tenny—I would like to ask Mr. 
Hart if his orange crop was a peach crop, 
if there would be any bruises on it when it was shipped. 

Mr. Hart—Not if I could help it; nor are there any on any oranges if I could help it. I am especially particular about that, and not only have my pickers to be careful, but when the fruit goes into the 


90 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


washer there is not an orange goes through, but that there has been a finger, 
thumb or eye on the calyx, and no long stem goes in. If there is a puncture in that fruit, that fruit is laid aside, every orange is examiined again by the grader, 
and all found injured in any way are dis¬ 
carded. 

Mr. Gibbs—Do' you use any mechani¬ 
cal agency, such as potash? 

Mr. Hart—Up to this year I used soap, 
but this year I have not used any at all and found the results equally as good. I 
prefer soft water, though I use some pump water. I prefer soft water, and think the oranges can be washed without soap successfully. 

Mr. Julian—Could you put up five cars of fruit and do this? 

Mr. Hart—Well, yes, sir ; I would 


wash every orange. Of course, it is pret¬ 
ty nearly impossible for the very large shipper to give the careful handling to the fruit that a smaller shipper can, but 
I would do it just as nearly as I could, 
anyway, or sell off a part of the grove and get the same or a little better income by giving more care to the balance. 

From the drying rack they go into the drying crates. These in my packing house, are made five by six feet and set on a bearing that allows of tipping to run the fruit tO' either end. The oranges are never two deep when curing. I do not intendl to ship in less than forty-eight hours after my fruit is picked; a little longer is just as good. By that time in¬ 
jured fruit shows up and is culled out more easily and surely. 


Report of the Committee on Fertilizer and Irrigation. 


By £• S« Hubbard^ Chairman* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In considering the question of fertil¬ 
izers I shall pass by the question of sources and percentages of the necessary elements, and devote my time to some of the problems of application and effects. 
An immense amount of valuable and often contradictory facts can be gathered on these questions, and it seems almost im¬ 
possible to draw any exact conclusion on the subject, except that each individual user of fertilizers should strive to use the formula or mixture that will give 


the best average results under the varying climatic conditions his crop and soil are subject tO'. It is needless tO' say that the past winter has been the driest in the memory of the oldest inhabitants, and I 
will use the Irish potato crop grown in my vicinity for a few illustrations. 

It has been demonstrated that the grasses transpire through their foliage between 500 and 600 times their dry weight of water in making their growth, 
and I estimate that Irish potatoes use

between two and three inches in perfect¬ 
ing the crop. 

As the evaporation in a season of av¬ 
erage warmth and sunshine is doubtless fully as much more a minimum rainfall of between five and six inches must be registered, provided it is well distributed over the growing period, and no fall is 
SO great as to run off in the drainage ditches. 

Measured by the Weather Bureau rain guage, the rainfall the past winter was as follows: November .06 inches; De¬ 
cember .44; January .47; February 1.07; 
March .96. The total during the grow¬ 
ing months of January, February and 
March being just two' and one-half inches, 
mostly in small showers that wet in very little, the greatest fall being just one inch on February 5th. The soil was already dry from the only one-half inch com¬ 
bined rainfall of November and Decem¬ 
ber, and the evaporation owing to the unusual number of warm, sunshiny days was greater than the average. The rain¬ 
fall, therefore, was less than half what was necessary for an average crop, while the crop averaged about two-thirds; the deficiency of rainfall having been some¬ 
what made up by the subsoil water rising by capillarity towards the surface. 

I noted exceptions, however, that were interesting. New Year's eve one man had over two acres of seed dropped by hand in ridges split by a bull tongue, 
so that the fertilizer mixed in the soil was practically exposed. That night there was a shower of .05 inches, and the man woke in fear and trembling lest his seed should freeze before morning. He covered it early next day with a disc ridger and harvested 45 barrels per acre, 
the average annual yield being about 40 


barrels. This .05 inches of rain, there¬ 
fore, by dissolving his fertilizer and sur¬ 
rounding his seed with wet soil nearly doubled his yield over an adjoining field planted two days earlier. 

Another man had his fertilizer in the opened ridges exposed to two showers, 
December 20th and 21st, aggregating .29 
inches, and harvested 35 barrels per acre. 
Another man irrigated with an artesian well running the water in ditches between his lands which are some forty feet wide, 
and harvested fifty barrels per acre. 
Later planted potatoes are usually more prolific, and some irrigated fields at Has¬ 
tings are reported as yielding 80 barrels per acre, while newly broken, unirrigated fields were not worth digging. 

This illustrates the advantages of dis¬ 
solving fertilizers and irrigation in dry seasons; but, on the other hand, the prob¬ 
lem of very wet seasons is equally serious. 
The previous winter the rainfall was 1.42 
inches in November, 3.54 in December, 
3.72 in January, 3.51 in February, and 
2.25 for March; the total for the three latter months being 9.48. There was much cool, cloudy weather with small evaporation, and the rainfall was twice what the potato crop needed. This sea¬ 
son, nitrate or soda applied to the mix¬ 
ture befoi'e planting was undoubtedly nearly all lost, and similarly tO' other seasons, the crop was so slow growing and maturing, I judged large percentages of the potash and phosphoric acid leach¬ 
ed also. I therefore sent a sample of soil to Prof. Blair for test tube experi¬ 
ments of leaching. The soil was about one foot deep in the test tube, and the first application of four inches of water leached 37.8 per cent, of the solul)le phos¬ 
phoric acid. The second application of 


92 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


three inches of water leached 15.8 per cent., and the third application of three inches leached 6.9 per cent.; a total for ten inches of water of 60.5 per cent, of the small amount of soluble phosphoric acid mixed with the test soil. The ex¬ 
periment with sulphate of potash was even more striking. The first four inch ap¬ 
plication of water leached 67.3 per cent., 
or over two-thirds of the potash; the sec¬ 
ond of three inches 17.3 per cent., and the third of three inches, 6 per cent.; a total for the ten inches of water of 90.6 per cent, of the sulphate of potash mixed in the test tube soil. Now, the condition of fertilizers covered in a ridge of soil is not half SO favorable to leaching as these test tube experiments, and when these soluble salts are diffused through the soil, 
the humus must hold more of the atten¬ 
uated solution, yet, at the same time, 
when the soil is fully saturated with rain and the water table gradually sinks be¬ 
low the surface, a large percentage of the soluble fertilizers must be carried with it. 

If we lose half as much fertilizer as was leached in the experiments, it is a most serious loss and drawback to har¬ 
vesting good crops. If we only knew when a wet season was coming, we would apply our fertilizers on the installment plan, or when a dry season was coming we would apply soluble fertilizers in ad¬ 
vance ; but undoubtedly the safest plan from lack of this knowledge is to apply the less soluble fertilizers and have in reserve an irrigation plant with which to meet the emergency of drought. 

In this, however, the individual must work out the problem; according to his peculiar needs, or average the good sea¬ 
sons with the bad to determine profit or loss. 


In fruit tree fertilizing, especially if the sod method is used part of the year, 
soluble chemical fertilizers are a neces¬ 
sity, as they will dissolve without evapo¬ 
ration or loss. Nitrate of soda is of ex¬ 
treme solubility, and sulphate of ammonia probably leaches about as fast as phospho^ 
ric acid. Broadcast applications to or¬ 
ange trees, for instance, which have a healthy and unlacerated system of fibrous roots, may be depended upon unless rain¬ 
fall is excessive, to be practically all available for plant growth. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Wakelin—Let us hear from the gentleman who has Mr. Chase’s property in charge. 

Mr. Hoard—The pump we are using at Chase & Company’s grove is of simple construction and great capacity and is en¬ 
tirely different from any I have ever seen used in this state. It consists of a wood¬ 
en box two feet square inside and eighteen feet high, with a steel shaft running through the center from top to bottom. 
This shaft has a water wheel at the bot¬ 
tom end and another wheel of the same kind) in the middle and an eight inch pul¬ 
ley on the top end which is connected with the engine by an eight inch belt. The box stands on end in the edge of the lake where the water is about three feet deep. The lower water wheel is so con¬ 
structed that when revolving rapidly it raises the water to a height of seven and one-half feet where the upper wheel catch¬ 
es it and carries it out at the top of the box. This gives us an elevation of fifteen feet above the lake and six feet above the highest point in the grove and con¬ 
siderable pressure. From the top of the pump the water runs through a ten inch 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


93 


terra cotta pipe across the grove from east to west. This pipe is cemented to¬ 
gether and buried undler ground and has a five inch outlet every 90 feet, which may be opened or closed as desired. From these five inch openings the water is conducted through five inch galvanized iron pipes to all parts of the grove. This five inch pipe is in ten foot lengths and is connected in the same manner as stove pipe. We can run four lines of this five inch pipe at once, or if we are short of piping, we use three lines and run the fourth opening iiito' open furrows. We can run five of these furrows from one opening, or if we used the furrow system alone we could run twenty furrows at one time. These furrows are about eight inches wide and two tO' three inches djeep and 500 to 600 feet long. This will give you an idea as to the capacity of the pump: We commenced using this irri¬ 
gation plant about March ist, and kept it going every day for over two months. As a result, we will have twice as many or¬ 
anges as we had last year, and in all probability three times as many as we would have had this year without irriga¬ 
tion. In other worcjs, an increase of at least 5000 boxes over last year. 

Member—^What kind of land is it ? 

Mr. Hoard—Hammock land; very porous and thirsty. 

Mr. Griffing—How many gallons per minute do you get? 

Mr. Hoard—I have never figured that out, but a man from- California estimated 


it at 120 miner’s inches as they measure water out there. He says this irrigation plant in California would be worth $100,- 
000. 

Member—What is the cost of that plant ? 

Mr. Hoard—I cannot give the exact cost, but it is a much cheaper system than those of like capacity in general use in this state. I believe I would be safe in saying that the whole cost did not exceed $1500.00. The pump alone cost about $150.00 in New Orleans. 

Mr. Griffing—He speaks about irriga¬ 
tion in open ditches. We have alwa3'S hadj the idea that we had tO' pipe the water to get it over Florida sand, therefore con¬ 
sidered irrigation too expensive for practi¬ 
cal purposes. The past season, we start¬ 
ed pumping water in open ditcJies or furrows and final that all it is necessary to do is tO’ get the water to the highest point from which we have no trouble in running it from 500 to 700 feet. The cost is so low that almost any planter can do it. A pipe line sufficiently large to de¬ 
liver 60 to 70 g'allons per minute, 1600 
to 1800 feet long ought not to cost over 
$700.00 or $800.00. This is exclusive of pumping plant. This line in this climate can be simply strung out on top of the ground and movedl as occasion demands, 
thus being able to irrigate a large area with it from' one source of supply. A 
gridiron of pipe lines in the field or grove is not necessary for practical, efficient and economical irrigation. 



Lime as a Remedy for Acid Soils* 


By A* W* BIair« 

ji 

(Florida Experiment Station.) 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Before taking up directly the relation 
O'f lime to acid soils, it may be well first, 
to refer to the amount of lime in differ¬ 
ent soils, the ease with which it is wash¬ 
ed out, etc., and discuss very briefly the functions of lime in agriculture. 

Calcium, which is one of the elements of lime, is found in the ashes of all plants, 
and some lime is found in practically all soils. As naturally found in soils, lime exists in combination with other groups of elements; for example as calcium phosphate (phosphate of lime), cal¬ 
cium carbonate (limestone), calcium silicate, etc.; and from these com¬ 
pounds it is dissolved by soil waters and taken up by plants. 

THE AMOUNT OF LIME IN SOILS. 

According to analyses made by the 
Florida Experiment Station, the aver¬ 
age amount of lime in a number of sam¬ 
ples of soil taken on the Florida East 
Coast, between Lemon City and El- 
dred, is .012 per cent., and taking the weight of an acre foot (the soil on one acre to the depth of one foot), to be 
4,000,000 pounds this would give us 
496 pounds of lime, or approximately 
1-4 ton to the acre-foot. The average amount of lime in samples of soil rep¬ 
resenting Orange, Hillsboro, and De- 
Soto counties is .028 per cent., which is equivalent to 1,120 pounds, or a little over 1-2 ton to the acre-foot. Many soils in the humid regions of the United 


States contain from .2 per cent, to .4 per cent, of lime and if we take the aver¬ 
age of these, .3 per cent., and the weight of an acre-foot of these soils as 3,500,- 
000 pounds, we find that they contain 
5 1-4 tons of lime to the acre-foot, which is twenty-one times the amount in the 
East Coast soils. Snyder gives the av¬ 
erage amount of lime in 200 fertile soils as 2.16 per cent., equivalent to 37 4-5 
tons per acre-foot, which is approxi¬ 
mately 150 times the amount in the 
East Coast soils, and 67 1-2 times the amount in the samples representing Or¬ 
ange, Hillsboro and DeSoto counties. 

It is evident from the foregoing that many of the Florida soils contain com¬ 
paratively small quantities of lime. The same is true, in a measure, of other bases, as magnesium, potassium, iron, 
etc. This is to be expected where a soil is composed so largely of sand. 

LIME EASILY WASHED OUT OF THE SOIL. 

Undoubtedly there was a time when these same soils contained much more lime than at present, but through years of cultivation and leaching it has been lost. The amount removed by crops each year, though small in most cases, 
must not be lost sight of, especially where no part of the crop is returned to the sdil. In addition to this loss there is a constant leaching going on which depletes the soil of its lime. From an examina¬ 
tion of the composition of drain-waters from unmanured land, it has been 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


95 


shown that in all such waters lime is the ingredient most abundantly leached out, and the same has been shown to be true of the waters of some of the world’s largest rivers. Reade, in his treatise on Chemical Denudation in 
Relation to Geological Time, calculates that 143 1-2 tons of lime carbonate are annually removed by solution from each square mile of land in England and 
Wales, and the average amount remov¬ 
ed annually from each square mile of the earth’s surface is about 50 tons. 

SOILS OF LIMESTONE ORIGIN MAY BE DEFI¬ 
CIENT IN LIME. 

It is commonly believed that soils of limestone origin are rich in lime, but this is not necessarily the case. The relative ease with which limestone dis¬ 
solves in carbonated waters partly ac¬ 
counts for this fact. An instance has been cited where two soils were thought, by the owner, to be rich in lime, derivedi from lime-stone rock, but while the parent rock in one case con¬ 
tained 92.6 per cent carbonate of lime, 
and in the other 91.3 per cent., the soils contained only 3.28 per cent, and .40 
per cent., respectiv'ely. In another in¬ 
stance, the parent rock contained 30 per cent, carbonate of lime, and the result¬ 
ing soil .14 per cent. 

THE FUNCTIONS OF LIME IN AGRICULTURE. 

Although all plants require lime, it is not usually regarded as a fertilizer in the sense that phosphoric acid, potash, 
and nitrogen are, since it usually ex¬ 
ists in tlie soil in quantities far in excess of the actual food requirements of the plant. (Among the other elements which are required by plants, but which exist in the soil in quantities quite suffi¬ 


cient for their requirements, may be mentioned iron, sulphur, magnesium, and sodium). However, there may be rare instances where the soil has been so thoroughly exhausted of its lime that an application of this material would be of value from the standpoint of a fer¬ 
tilizer. As we have just seen, lime has a part to play in building up the plant. 
This is shown by the fact that calcium, 
one of the elements of lime, is found in all plant ashes. This may be termed its physiological function. 

Physically, lime improves the condi¬ 
tion of the soil; if it be a clay soil it becomes more mellow, and is more eas¬ 
ily drained and cultivated; if it be a san¬ 
dy soil the lime acts as a cementing linaterial, binding the grains together, 
thus lessening the loss of water and plant food by percolation. 

Chemically, lime aids in rendering more available, elements of plant food which are locked up in the soil and are unavailable to the plant; especially, is this true of potash. 

In the processes of the nitrification of organic compounds, nitrates are formed, 
and if no base is present to unite with these, they are easily lost by leaching ; 
however, if lime be present, they will unite with the calcium of the lime, and in this form, calcium nitrate, they are readily available as plant food. Lime hastens the decomposition of organic matter, and aids in the formation of ammonia and 
Other nitrogen compounds from this or¬ 
ganic matter. 

A function of lime which we have been slow to recognize, but which nev¬ 
ertheless is an important one, is its power to correct acidity, or sourness, 
in soils, due partly at least to the pres¬ 
ence of organic acids. Such soils are 


96 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


now known to be quite general, even where the land is high and well drained. 
These soils are unfavorable to the growth and development of nitrifying organisms, and as a consequence the pro¬ 
cesses of nitrification would tend to cease. Further, the tendency of these organic acids would be to attack such bases as are present in the soil, and if iron be one of these bases, salts of this metal would be formed, and these salts would prove injurious to micro-organ¬ 
isms, and possibly also to the tender rootlets of the plant. 

It is believed by some that lime aids in the production of root hairs, and that by this means the absorption of p-otash is encouraged. 

IS THIS CONDITION OF SOIL ACIDITY 
A GENERAL ONE? 

If then there is a tendency under some conditions, to the formation, in the soil, of organic acids, the questions which will naturally present themselves to those interested in agriculture and horticulture are: To what extent are the soils with which I am concerned thus affected, how may I recognize such a condition, and has lime proved an effi¬ 
cient remedy? Perhaps the most ex¬ 
haustive work along this line has been done by Wheeler and his associates, of the Rhode Island Experiment Station. 
For something like twelve years they have been working on this problem, and they have shown beyond a doubt, that the sandy soils of Rhode Island do very generally give an acid reaction; and they have further shown, as will be pointed out more fully later, that lime is an efficient remedy. Hilgard has noted a similar condition in the sandy 
* upland soils of Mississippi and other 


southern states, and earlier, Ruffin call¬ 
ed attention to extensive tracts of that character in Virginia. French investi¬ 
gators have mentioned large areas of sandy soil in Brittany, Limousin, and other sections of France, as distinctly acid; and in German writings refer¬ 
ence to sandy, sour soils is not wanting. 
Hilgard in speaking of sour soils writes as follows: “The acid reaction characterizing the ulmic substances, is also characteristic of many woodlands, 
notably in the. United States of the soils of the long-leaf pine region of the Cot¬ 
ton States, both upland and lowland, as well as of many deciduous forests in northern climates. Hence, liming, 
whether artificial or natural, effects a most notable improvement together with a marked change of vegetation in these lands.” Previous to the work of 
Wheeler, Hartwell, and others, it was generally considered, in America at least, that only low wet lands, or those that were largely made up of muck, 
were subject to the sour or acid condi¬ 
tions ; but we now know, beyond a doubt, 
that in many places, upland and well drained soils do show a decidedly acid reactibn. The question as to how we shall recognize this condition is not al¬ 
ways the simplest. It may sometimes be recognized by the character of the vegetation, or the crops grown on it, 
but the surest way is a test of some kind. The one most generally used is the litmus paper test, though this is not always satisfactory, since it gives us no very definite idea of the degree of acidi¬ 
ty, and undoubtedly fails in some in¬ 
stances, to indicate an acid condition which really does exist. And here it may be said that our knowledge of methods of determining soil acidity is 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


97 


very general. Even the best soil chem¬ 
ists are not agreed upon a uniform method, although a number of methods have been proposed and are being tried in various laboratories. When such methods are perfected, as they ulti¬ 
mately will be, we can determine the exact acidity of any soil and then cal¬ 
culate to a nicety the amount of lime required to neutralize this acidity. Un¬ 
til such methods are perfected, investi¬ 
gators and agriculturists will have to content themselves with using tenta¬ 
tive methods and with field trials, using different quantities until the right amount is found for the different class¬ 
es of soils. One thing, however, seems definitely settled, and that is that we must recognize the fact that an acid condition in the soil is more generally prevalent than has heretofore been be¬ 
lieved to be the case. 

WHAT CAUSES THIS ACIDITY? 

In wet locations where large quanti¬ 
ties of organic matter undergo decay, 
enormous amouts of humus accumu¬ 
late as a result of the decomposition. 
Such humus is said to be usually, 
though not always, in an acid state. 
The acidity is naturally dependent upon the lack of bases with which the organic acids may combine. Until compara¬ 
tively recently little reference has been made to an injurious degree of acidity from such causes, in upland or well drained soils. That a dangerous degree of acidity may and often does exist in such soils is now well recognized. We have, however, been slozv to recognize this fact, and on this account, no doubt, 
we have often attributed the failure of crops to cold, poor germination of seeds, drought, excessive rains, attacks 


of insects or fungi, which should have been attributed to soil acidity. 

The formation of organic acids by the decomposition of organic materials in soils deficient in bases, would then seem to be a reasonable explanation, in part at least, for the existence of acid soils. 

WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF AN ACID CON¬ 
DITION IN THE SOIL? 

« 

We cannot answer this question in full; we do not know. As the subject is further studied we shall know more. 
If I should say that it causes the wilt of the orange, I might be very wide of the mark, but on the other hand, no one can say absolutely that it does not cause this disease. We do, however, know some of the effects. We do know that it interferes with the processes of nitri¬ 
fication, and thus prevents the plant from getting certain food elements that it should have. We do know that in many instances clover, alfalfa, and other legumes, have failed almost entirely on acid soils, but have done well when the acid of these same soils has been neu¬ 
tralized with lime. 

IS LIME A SATISFACTORY CORRECTIVE ? 

Volumes could be written showing the beneficial results obtained by the use of lime on acid soils, but here it will only be necessary to make brief reference to a few instances. The experiments con¬ 
ducted by the Rhode Island Experiment 
Station have shown that something like thirty-one plants, including vegetables, 
grasses, fruit trees, etc., are benefited by the use of lime, while nine are indifferent to its use, and four are injured by it. The 
Maryland Experiment Station reports that most of the crops grown in that state are benefited by the application of lime, 
and includes one—Indian Corn—in the

98 

list of those benefited, that is placed by the Rhode Island Experiment Station in the list of those that are indifferent. 
Veitch, of the Department of Agriculture, 
reports a very decided increase in the weight of clover, cowpeas, and alfalfa, on soils that were limed over those that were not limed. In fact, in the case of the alfalfa, no crop was secured on the un¬ 
limed plot; and he further shows that in no case does the yield on the plots where the acid was only partially neutralized by lime, equal the yield on those where it was completely neutralized. At the Ohio 
Experiment Station they have found it difficult to get a good stand of clover on acid soils, the clover dying out in patches, 
and being supplanted by a growth of sorrel. In one case this unfavorable con¬ 
dition was aggravated by the use of fer¬ 
tilizers compounded with acid. With a ton of lime to the acre they secured a lux¬ 
uriant growth of clover. The report sug¬ 
gests that a smaller quantity might have sufficed. Others have noted the decided improvement brought about by the use of lime oUi clover, alfalfa, and cowpeas, 
where the soil was acid, where before these crops had been a partial or total failure. The beggarweed also is a legume, 
and may it not be true that the difficulty which so many have had in getting a good stand of this crop is due to an acid condition in our soils? In this connec¬ 
tion it is of interest toi note the following statement taken from the Rhode Island 
Experiment Station report for 18931 “"Rhe application of lime on our soils has en¬ 
abled us to secure a good catch of clover where it was before im[p0'ssible.'’ 

ARE FLORIDA SOILS GENERALLY ACID.^ 

No systematic study has been made of the soils of this State with reference to 


this particular point, but judging by tests which I have made of soils representing rather widely separated portions of the 
State, and by the statements of others, I 
feel justified in drawing the conclusion, 
that our upland soils are more generally acid than we have heretofore supposed them to be. That our muck soils are de¬ 
cidedly acid I think no one will question. 
Many of the muck soils are quite rich in nitrogen, and in addition contain some phosphoric acid and potash, and should prove quite valuable as a fertil¬ 
izer, but in many places they are under the ban, because they have been accused of ruining groves and pineapple planta¬ 
tions. It is very probable however, that it was the organic acids in the muck that were responsible for the damage, and if those who have thus basely slandered muck will try a liberal applica¬ 
tion of lime, and by liberal I mean enough to make a fair sample of the mixture show an alkaline and not an acid reaction, there is good reason to believe that their slander will be turned into praise. 

WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THIS ACIDITY IN 
FLORIDA SOILS? 

As was pointed out in the early part of this paper Elorida soils are generally very deficient in lime, and likewise in a number of other bases, and this in itself may explain, in part at least, why our soils have a tendency toward acidity. 
There being a scarcity of bases to neutral¬ 
ize the organic acids formed by decaying organic matter, the acid tendency prevails. 
Moreover, the large quantities of com¬ 
mercial fertilizers that we are constantly using undoubtedly tends to aggravate this condition. There are present in most soils hydrated silicates, and non-acid organic compounds which have a strong affinity for sodium, potassium, calcium, and mag- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


99 


nesiuiiT. When these bases are dissolved by the soil waters, or when they are added in alkaline compounds, they immediately combine with these neutral constituents— 
silicates and non-acid organic compounds 
—and thus the soil is prevented from be¬ 
coming alkaline until the above mentioned affinity is satisfied. This condition, while harmful to sensitive plants, is probably not so harmful as the presence of free acids or acid salts. Further than this, there is good evidence going tO' show that the reaction which takes place between cer¬ 
tain of these soil constituents and added chlorides and sulphates, produces positive¬ 
ly acid salts. There can be but little doubt that it is due, partly at least, to the acidity thus produced, that the injury arising from the use of chlorides and the sulphate of ammonia on neutral or acid soils is to be ascribed. It was found in experiments at the Rhode Island Experiment Station with different forms of nitrogen on acid soils, that sulphate of ammonia was pos¬ 
itively poisonous to plants when it was not used in connection with lime. When the acidity of the soil was corrected by ap¬ 
plications of air-slaked lime, the sulphate of ammonia was beneficial. This benefi¬ 
cial effect is attributed to the fact that the lime restored the alkaline condition of the soil necessary to the transformation 
(by nitrification) of the sulphate of am¬ 
monia into nitrates, sO' necessary to most crops. I would not therefore, recom¬ 
mend a reduction in the amount of fertil¬ 
izers to be used, but would remedy the evil by a liberal application of lime once in two or three years, or oftener if found necessary. 

The causes above mentioned are gen¬ 
eral ; there may also be local causes which are responsible for this acid tendency. In some parts of the State sulphur water (wa¬ 


ter containing hydrogen sulphide, H2 S) 
is used for irrigating purposes. Now when hydrogen sulphide gas comes in con¬ 
tact with air, the hydrogen unites with oxygen to form water; but it is also^ true that some of the sulphur may be oxidized to sulphuric acid, and where this system of irrigation is carried on for years at a time, 
keeping the ground wet during a good part of the year, the aiccumulations of sul¬ 
phuric acid and sulphates may reach con¬ 
siderable proportions. Under such con¬ 
ditions injury to crops may eventually be expected, unless lime is used in liberal quantities. A statement made to me re¬ 
cently by a celery grower of Sanford would seems to bear out this theory. He said that a few years ago only a few barrels of lime were used in Sanford, but that now the market could scarcely supply enough. No dou 1 )t this increased de¬ 
mand is partly due to the increased aicre- 
age, but it is no doubt also' due in part, 
to the fact that the growers are learning that without it they cannot get good re¬ 
sults. This same grower said that he used about a ton to the acre. Notwith¬ 
standing this fact, a test of several soils at this point, his among others, showed an acid reaction. Examples of the oxidation of sulphides, with the formation of sul¬ 
phuric acid, are to be found in the vicinity of coal mines. Whole tracts of land have become priactically sterile from having been saturated with water containing free acid and ferrous sulphate formed by the oxidation of iron pyrites. 

WILL THE CONDITION OF FLORIDA SOILS 
BE IMPROVED BY THE USE OF LIME.^ 

On this point also there has been no systematic investigation, but if the sandy, 
sour soils of Rhode Island and Massachu¬ 
setts, of France, England, and Germany, 



lOO 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


and of Virginia and Mississippi, have re¬ 
sponded well tO’ the use of lime, then there seems good reason to believe that the same will be true of Florida soils. De¬ 
tached instances might be given showing the value of lime on Florida soils. I have noted Bermuda grass growing luxuriantly where a mortar* bed had formerly been located, and where plaster had been thrown out and ashes scattered, when only a few feet away where the soil had not been thus treated, it was difficult to get the grass to grow. As already noted, the celery growers of Sanford are using large quantities of lime and say they cannot pro¬ 
duce crops without it. Perhaps almost every one has noted the more luxuriant growth of vegetation on spots where piles of logs and brush have been burnt, and while this is perhaps due in part to the potash contained in the organic matter, it is no doubt due also to the fact that the lime in the ashes has neutralized the acid¬ 
ity of the soil. 

LIME SOMETIMES INJURIOUS. 

Excessive amounts of lime may have an injurious effect on almost any crop, 
while any excess of lime whatever seems injurious to a few plants. Under some conditions, too, lime seems to favor the production of the potato scab. For these reasons it is important that judgment be used in the application of lime to the soil. 

If lime is used directly with sulphate of ammonia, ammonia gas will be set free and lost. It may, however, be used direct¬ 
ly with nitrate of soda and organic fer¬ 
tilizers. 

FORMS OF LIME TO USE. 

Where the neutralization of acidity is the only object tO' be sought, caustic or quick lime will probably be more economi¬ 


cal, since fewer pounds are i“fequired. 
However, quick lime, slaked or hydrated lime, and air slaked lime, or carbonate of lime, are probably equally effective pound for pound of actual lime. 

Marl is a form of carbonate of lime and contains from 5 tO' 95 pounds of car¬ 
bonate of lime per hundred pounds of the material. A good quality of marl would prove quite effective in correcting soil acidity, its effectiveness depending on the fineness of the material. 

Phosphate of lime, that is phosphate rock, when finely gTOund has also been found effective on acid soils. This is valuable not only on account of its neu¬ 
tralizing effects on acid, but also on ac¬ 
count of the phosphoric acid which it con¬ 
tains, the phosphoric acid gradually be¬ 
coming available after having been in the soil for some time. 

THE LITMUS TEST. 

This must be made with considerable care, else erroneous results may be se¬ 
cured. The following method if careful¬ 
ly carried out will give satisfactory results. 

Having secured from a drug store strips of both blue and red litmus paper, 
take one or two ounces of the soil to be tested, moisten in a clean glass or cup with pure water (water that will change the color of either paper must not be used), bringing* the mass to about the consistency of thick paste. After allow¬ 
ing this to stand about fifteen minutes, 
part the soil in two places with a clean knife blade and insert a strip of each kind of paper, carefully pressing the soil against the paper with the point of the knife. Allow to stand for about five min¬ 
utes then remove and wash off adhering particles of soil with the pure water. If the blue paper has become red, or shows 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


lOI 


red spots, the soil is acid; if the red has been turned blue, the soil is alkaline, and if neither has been chang’ed the soil may be neutral. Do not put the fingers or hand upon the end of the paper that is to be placed in the soil. 

DEFINITE EXPERIMENTS. 

The Experiment Station is beginning 


some systematic work with reference to the effect o'f lime on acid soils, and we hope at no distant day to be able to report some definite results. 

We shall be glad of the co-operation of any of the members of this society who are interested in the subject. 


Principles in Tree Pruning. 


By H* Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

To understand the underlying princi¬ 
ples of pruning, we should know some¬ 
thing of the structure of the trunk of the tree, and its branches. If we examine a cross section of the wood of an oldl tree, 
we note in the centre, the pitch surround¬ 
ed by the heart wood. Around this is a band of sap wood and outside of all a protecting cover, the bark. Just between the bark and sap-wood lies the cambium layer in which all growth takes place. 
From it, wood is formed on one side and bark on the other. 

WHERE A BRANCH STARTS. 

Branches always develop from budls and, where produced normally, the branch is formed from a bud developed the year previous. In consequence the base of the branch is generally one year younger than the part of the tree on which it grows. 
We commonly refer to the portion of the branch extending into the wood as a knot. 
This knot has its origin at the pith. If we examine a section cut through the 


branch and the trunk on which it grows, 
we will note that the grain of the knot runs tO’ the center of the tree. 

From this we learn the lesson, that if for any reason the branch should die and rotting should commence, that the rot will extend along the knot into the center of the tree and) there continue its work in the trunk. 

THE HEALING OF THE WOUND. 

With the removal of the branch all in¬ 
ner portions of the tree are exposed by the wound made. The bark being re¬ 
moved, the wood is laid bare and decay has an opportunity to begin its work. 

Every tree in healthy, active growth makes an effort to cover over the wound. 
The healing does not take place over the whole surface. A tiny ring, or cushion of woody tissue protected by bark, is thrown out from the cambium layer all around the wound. This is called the callus. 
This callus gradually shoves out, increases in size and) ring after ring of growth is 




102 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


added until the wound is covered. If the wound is small this may be done in a single season, but if large it will take several years. 

THE STUB. 

If a branch is cut off a few inches from the tree the cut end of the stub does not generally heal over. There is no life in it, it dies back and acts as a foreign body. 
In ninety-nine per cent of cases, the tree makes an effort to heal over the wound at the base of the stub. It is impossible how¬ 
ever for it to succeed as the tree cannot exert sufficient pressure to cut it off and the callus frequently formis a mound about its base. 

The stub usually disappears in time by rotting off and the result is a knot hole. 
The first principle in pruning is to leave no stubs. 

KNOT HOLES. 

When the stub I'ots away, leaving a knot hole, the rain enters, sand and dirt are blown into it. Sufficient soil is fre¬ 
quently formed for plants to grow in it. 
Everything favors the extension of the rotting process. The heartwood in the trunk and branches sometimes even down into the roots is destroyed. A strong wind blows the tree over, and we wonder why it fell. 

The rotting of the wood is not due to chemical or atmospheric action. It is due to minute plants^—fungi andl bacteria. 
These live and grow in the wood and bring about its destruction. The fruiting parts of some of the fungi are quite large, 
those of the shelf fungi for instance. 

WHERE TO CUT. 

We have learned that the stub is objec¬ 


tionable and injurious to the trees in that it prevents the healing process. Leave no stubs. Make the cut as close as possible to the part that is to remain and in making the cut hold the 'saw*parallel to^ the branch or trunk from which the branch is i*emov- 
ed. 

The cut should be as smooth as it is pos¬ 
sible toi make it. It heals better. 

TO PREVENT SPLITTING. 

If the branch is large and) heavy, an accident often occurs in close cutting. 
When the branch is half cut off, its weight causes it to split and frequently the injury extends down along the trunk of the tree. 
This may be prevented by making a cut on the underside of the branch half way through it a foot or two out from the trunk. Then on the upper side three or four inches farther out another cut should be made half way through. The branch will drop off. The resulting stub can then be cut off where it should be. 

WOUND PROTECTION. 

A wound has been made and the inner portion of the tree is exposed, how can rotting be prevented? By covering the cut surface with something which will prevent the entrance of decay. The most desirable substance is one which will stick well, wear well and at the same time not interfere with the healing process. x\s a dressing for tree wounds many different materials have been used, such as shellac, 
grafting wax, tar and paint. 

Ordinary grafting wax is not good, it curls up around the edges and peels off. 
A formula used by Mr. W. S. Hart is ex¬ 
cellent : One pound of resin and two ounces of tallow; 'melt these anci mix thoroughly. Remove from the fire and 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


103 


after cooling slig'litly, add slowly six ounces of alcohol and one ounce spirits of 
•turpentine. 

Shellac likewise cracks and drops off; 
tar is likely to prevent the healing process. 
Of all the substances which have been used from, time tO' time no material so nearly fills all the requirements of a wound dressing as pure lead paint made up with good oil. Sufficient coloring should be addled to make the paint about the color of the bark. 

Paint the wound as soon as it is made for no amount of paint will keep the wound sound if rotting has already be¬ 
gun. 

TIME TO PRUNE. 

It is not advisable to prune trees during the time when the sap is in active motion. 
At this time it is well nigh impossible to properly protect the woundj; the neces¬ 
sary coat of paint will not stick to a sur¬ 
face wet with sap, which has bled fromi the tree. The best time to prune is during winter and early spring before growth starts. If it cannot be done then, the trees should be pruned in spring just after they are well out in the leaf. 

PRUNING TOOLS. 

Some people like to use an ax, but in the hands of the average individual it is a poor tool tO' use. About one man in five hundred knows, how tO' handle it. It should be banished from the orchard and the street. In the writer’s opinion the only time that the ax should be used either on a fruit or shade tree is when it is vigorously applied just above the roots, 
when it is dleemed advisable to remove a diseased or worthless specimen. The ax 


is synonymous with hacks, cuts, stubs, 
knotholes, rotten trunks, decayed trees and general neglect. It is opposed to good treatment, intelligent care and a true ap¬ 
preciation of the needs and nature of a tree. Banish it! 

Get a good pair of pruning shears, a pruning saw and knife. The dearest in price are the cheapest. Keep them sharp and with these the right sort of work can be done. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Neeldi—I think the best time to prune a tree is after the sap has fallen and the leaves have fallen. I would like to have your idea. In connection with this subject, I would like to say that our trees lost their leaves in the freeze, and when the leaves came forth again they were little bits of leaves—they never developed. 
That was largely because there was no moisture in the soil. There were a great many water sprouts, and they put on large leaves. 

Prof. ‘Hume—In reply to the first ques¬ 
tion as to the best time of pruning: an old 
German adage says, “Prune apple trees while in the bloom.” One of the best sea¬ 
sons is after the tree comes out in full leaf^ 
speaking of treeis that drop their leaves in autumn. I dO' not believe in pruning when the sap is moving in the trees, when the wound is likely to^ bleed freely. If we prune it at that time, we cannot get oiir covering to stick. Wait until the tree comes out in full leaf. Either then or prune when the tree is entirely dormant. 
One of the thing's that makes spring pruning the best, particularly if you are desirous of removing dlead wood, is that dead wood is much more easily found. 



104 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


About those water sprouts you speak of; I have seen a good many cases where a tree had been severely injured, and these water sprouts had come out with vigorous leaves on them. I think it is a good plan to leave them there. I don’t know that I 
would take them off at all. 

Mr. Hart—It seems to me there are a few more points that we might touch up¬ 
on. Now, ‘‘water sprouts.” I would say by all means let them grow and make leaves just as quickly as you can. They furnish lungs to the trees. If it is an or¬ 
ange tree that has been cut back by a freeze, and those sprouts are sour, let them go until they get a good top on the tree, then bud and lop the tops down but don’t cut them off. The sap will flow to the highest buds and these sour sprouts will, while bent to the ground, nmintain the large root system and growth until we have a good sweet top there. When the buds get well started, bend them out and spread them out, making a wide tree. 
They may be long and slim and apparently of very little use, but bend them out and do not cut them off. The result is that you check the flow of sap near the trunk. 
Where the sap is checked it will push out a new growth and in a little while you get plenty of fruit, the limbs become strong, other limbs surround these and you get a symmetrical tree. The orange tree will become a symmetrical tree in a few years if given a chance and do it with¬ 
out pruning to any great extent. There are a few cases where it will be well to nip in and in rare cases to cut a_limb, but 
I think it far better to force limbs in place than to cut them off. 

Now, in regard to stubs. There are a few cases, perhaps, where it may be well 


to leave a stub for awhile. For instance, 
if we have a nursery tree of pretty good size and lop the top down from above the bud, when that bud is grown large enough so that you can remove that old top, it sometimes, is best, I think, to cut the olcll wood off leaving quite a little stub, 
and wait until the bud has gotten large enough and has strength so that by cut¬ 
ting the stub off close just before the spring or summer growth, it will be cover¬ 
ed up quickly and no serious wounds or rotten wood remiain in the tree. I find it practicable to do this in many cases where trees have been injured in some way and heavy pruning of partly dead wood has to be done before renewed growth is strong enough to cover wounots promptly. 

Mr. Sheppard—I have found a pretty good wound covering in coal tar. It keeps out all the water, is flexible and the wounds will heal right up. 

Mr. Hume—In my opinion, it is a very unsafe thing tO' use. I have seen injury done tO' the trees by it, and the healing of wounds prevented by its use. 

Mr. Sheppard—I have seen where it has been beneficial. 

Mr. Hume—Some people still recom¬ 
mend the use of gas tar, and the practice is still prevalent in Europe, but has never been followed to any extent in this coun¬ 
try. I have used it on oak trees andl it works very nicely. On peaches and cher¬ 
ries as well as some other fruits, I would not use it. 

Mr. Sheppard—sit works pretty well on orange trees. 

Prof. Hume—Some men I know had the experience of killing some three hun¬ 
dred trees with tar. You cannot convince them that tar is all right.

Mr. Griffing—Have you used shellac? 

Mr. Hume—Yes, and it is very good while it lasts, but it soon flakes off. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—I agree with Mr. 
Hume on every point he has made, except in the use of utensils. I pruned two or three years with a saw and used the long clippers and the hand pruner. I think I 
have used) every outfit that any pruner ever did use, and I must say I like an axe the 


best. You can take a pruning axe and grind it down very thin, and then after you have had practice enough you can cut exactly in the right place. Always strike from the under side of the limb. I am heartily in favor of the axe system over any saw. A saw wound will hold more water than an axe wound. It is the water in the wound that causes the rot. It is very much quicker also. 


Report of Committee on Ornamentals. 


By Mrs* E* S* Hubbard. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Let us imagine that we have chosen our new home. Our house and buildings are finished and our grounds are leveled and ready for planting. 

We have selected a spot in middle 
Florida where the temperature occasional¬ 
ly touches the frost mark, and where in extreme seasons, ice is formed. 

We, therefore, must use plants and shrubs that will thrive in our peculiar sit¬ 
uation. The first consideration is our lawn. St. Augustine grass will prove most satisfactory, for it resists cold weath¬ 
er. When frequently clipped, it forms a nrat of bright green, and after a severe freeze, it soon regains its freshness. It is planted by slips and roots and is easily destroyed when desired. Bermuda grass thrives best on dry soil, but is browned by frost in winter and is hard to eradi¬ 
cate. 

Our piazzas are furnished with supports 


for vines. Strips of poultry netting three feet wide, are, at intervals, set up¬ 
right two or three feet from the ground, 
extending to the eaves. With this ar¬ 
rangement, the beloved vines can be en¬ 
joyed to the utmost, ’without injuring buildings or interfering with the painter in his work. 

First in our list is Rhyncospermum jasminoides. Its dark, ever green foliage forms a thick screen during the winter. 
In April, its profusion of dainty white blossoms, transforms it into a drapery of lacework. If allowed to do so, it will reach the highest chimney with its trail of graceful fragrance. Akebia quinata, its characteristic foliage and its clusters of ruddy purple blossoms lasting from early 
March until May, must not be forgotten. 

Chinese Wistaria, if kept in subjection by persistent pruning, will give a wealth of great, fragrant, purple pendants.

The English honeysuckle must not be mistaken for the paler and rampant va¬ 
riety which will not be satisfied with its own space in the border, 

but which will not be content unless it overruns everything within reach and even usurps the grass plot and 

ruins the lawn. The English honey¬ 

suckle, on the contrary, seldomi suckers and needs only occasional pruning. It will reward the grower with bloom' and delicious perfume throughout the year. 
The bark is red and the foliage dark green. The buds are deeply roseate without, and the flowers are pure white within, turning to cream color and. finally to a dull orange. In the early, dewy 

morning, when the perfume of this honey¬ 
suckle mingled wiith that of the Rhyncos- 
permum and Magnolia float through the open windows, the combination is ex¬ 
quisite beyond description. 

We must not tarry too long with the vines, but mention in brief succession, 
Bignonia venusta, that gloriious vine with its masses of .flame colored trumpet- 
flowers ; another variety with wax-like flowers of white and canary, and still an¬ 
other rightly named the Gloria, with large throated blossoms of delicate lavender, 
veined with purple. These vines are har¬ 
dy, enduring any cold which visits this section, and also thriving during the heat of the long summer. 

Many tropical vines can be successful¬ 
ly grown here. We must expect them to be cut back, sometimes, by cold weather. 
They spring up again as if by magic, and seem even benefited by the disaster. 
Among these are Clerodendron Balfouri, 
Antigonon leptopus, the showy Rosa de 
Alontana from Mexico, the climbing Alla- 
manda with great golden flowers, so very 


noticeable at Miami; Thunbergia frag- 
rans with snowy blossoms and graceful twining stems, and Bougainvillea, Thun¬ 
bergia grandiflora, a very elegant climber, 
has large, white-throated, sky bTie flowers and handsome foliage. Lastly, I will rec¬ 
ommend Cobea Scandens and its large purple bells always in blooni. Its method of climbing is unique, for it attaches itself to supports by clinging tendrils growing at the ends of its compound leaves. 

Our list of shade and ornamental trees beg'ins with the evergreen oaks which need neither praise nor description. Fol¬ 
lowing the oaks are Magnolia grandiflora, 
loblolly and sweet bay, umbrella tree, syc¬ 
amore, one of our grandest native trees; 
Vitex or chaste tree, with purple spikes and whose palmate leaves smell of laven¬ 
der ; the starry leaved sweet gum. Ilex or 
American holly; scarlet maple whose bril¬ 
liant red seed pods appear in midwinter; 
and lastly the Liriodendron tulipfera, 
whose oddly cut leaves and large, showy, 
tulip-shaped flowers have given it its name of tulip-tree. 

Cornus canadensis, or white flowered dogwood is most charming with its level masses of foliage and bloom. It savors of the picturesque having a marked indi¬ 
viduality. In the same class will be found 
Camellia Japonica, so prized for its large perfe'ct flowers, and Azalea Indica, whose wondrous display of lovely blossoms of an infinite variety of shadings and col¬ 
ors is a marked feature of northern Eas¬ 
tertide. Magnolia fuscata and some va¬ 
rieties of Magnolia from China and Ja¬ 
pan which are deciduous, and whose flow¬ 
ers are richly colored with rose and pur¬ 
ple, are very desirable. Olea fragrans or sweet olive must be included, for the unctuous perfume of its small clustered 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


white bloom is unique and delicious, and it will group well with Judas tree or red bud and Gardenia fragrans both single 
'and double. 

The trees and shrubs which I have chosen are perfectly hardy and will give entire satisfaction. 

Among some tropical shrubs which grow again after frosts, are Pleroma pur¬ 
purea, Tabernamiontana, night bloonir ing jasmine and the charming group of 
Hibiscus. 

We associate palms with the tropics. 
The following species, however, have been thoroughly tested andl we can safely plant them ; Cocos iVustralis, Sabal palmetto, our own cabbage palm, and also another handsome variety from Cuba, 
Chamoerops Excelsa, Chamoerops humilis, Phoenix Canariensis and Phoe¬ 
nix sylvestris. Latania Borbonica, and 
Phoenix dactylifera, our date of com¬ 
merce, are sometimes nipped by severe freezing but we must risk something for their beauty and in the latter for its fruit. 
These palms will make trees; some of them growing to a height of 40 
more. They, with many others, are noW' 
growing in the grounds of the late E. H. 
Hart at Eederal Point. 

We must not overlook some very charming acaulescent palms and their kindred. Chamoerops hystrix or needle palm growing wild in many parts of 
Florida and also near Savannah, Ga., 
must be planted in the shade of tall palms, 
and it will then send out a host of glossy leaves with long slender stems, admirable for cutting. Cycas revoluta cannot be sur¬ 
passed when well grown. Cycas circin- 
alis, a more tender variety, is exquisitely beautiful. 

Some fourteen years ago, in June, we 


107 

made a trip on the St. Johns river on the steamer “City of Jacksonville.” As we went into the brilliant light from the out¬ 
side darkness, we were dazzled by a vision of color andl beauty. On a table in the cen¬ 
ter of the salon, where the light fell upon them from above, was placed a wonder¬ 
fully beautiful arrangement of aquatics. 
In the center was a large bowl of great glowing* blood red water lilies, wide open and in bud—Nymphea Zanzibarensis, the large night blooming* water lily from 
Zanzibar. On either side, and around, 
were bowls filled with smaller blos¬ 
soms ; pale blue, white, yellow and blush, 
all with foliage. A stand, near by, was devoted to a single specimen. It was floating in a large bowl. Its abundant, 
shining, dark green leaves and spikes of buds and open flowers, lilac shaded with purple and a dash of yellow, attracted universal attention. 

Mr. Fuller, who was taking this charm¬ 
ing collection from his home. Edge water on the St. Johns, to his summer home in 
New York, told us that this interesting plant which he viewed with pride, was 
Eichornia crassipes, a new, rare aquatic, 
and that he had paid $10.00 for a small plant some time before. It had, however, 
increased so enormouslv that he had thrown several cart loads of it into the 
St. Johns river, and he wondered if it would grow there. You doubtless recog¬ 
nize that plant, which so greatly admired by some, is heartily detested by others—- 
the water hyacinth. 

The most fascinating of all garden beds, our water lily pond, is made by dig¬ 
ging out the earth to a depth of 2 or 3 
feet and cementing the excavation. Put a la3^er of muck and sand at the bottom and fill with water.

Our rose garden, to which we turn when wishing* to express regard or sympa¬ 
thy with others, by sprays, or a basket perhaps of fragrant roses, must* be care¬ 
fully planned. Mrs. McCarty has given us in her report for 1905, most complete and valuable directions for planting and caring* for roses. My list will include 
Bride and Bridesmaid, American Belle, 
Richmond, Andre Schwartz, Kaiserin 
Augusta Victoria, Madam: Lambard, Pa¬ 
pa Gontier, Madam Cochet, La France both pink and white, Cecil Bruner, Duch¬ 
ess de Brabant and Magna Charta. Climb¬ 
ers Devoniensis, Gloire de Dijon, Chrome- 
tela or cloth of gold, Reve d’or. Madam 
Peary or climbing Kaiserin, Adelia Prae- 
del and climbing Meteor. 

These roses are well adapted to our cli¬ 


mate and conditions. Madam Lambard is 
'unsurpassed as a geoieral uitility rose. 
During the entire year this rose with Ce¬ 
cil Bruner and Duchess de Brabant will continue to give us fine buds and flowers. 
Even the thrip, that inveterate rose pest, 
has little taste for these three varieties. 

In our planting and arrangement we must give due attention, not only to detail but also to general and harmonious effect. 

From the lists which I have given, com¬ 
binations and groupings can be made of infinite variety. 

I will close with mention of that won¬ 
drous vine, so dear to tourists and so faith¬ 
ful in its efforts to adorn the waste places as well as the gardens. The native flora of Florida would lack its crowning glory in the absence of the Yellow Jessamine. 


Report of Committee on Peaches^ Plums and Pears. 


By Aubrey Frink. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I have not prepared any paper on peach¬ 
es, pears and plums, for the reason that I 
could not get, prior to coming here, just the information that I wanted. I under¬ 
stand that Mr. Shooter is now in Europe, 
andl today I talked to Mr. Klemm and he has no report to make. 

This season has been a hard one on peaches as well as oranges. In fact, for a year they have suffered. Last year being wet, was hard; then coming* that severe cold at Christmas time which alone would not have done so much damage, but comi- 


bined with wet weather and succeeding dry weather, together with the April cold, 
has done a great deal of damage to peach¬ 
es. From information that I can get, it seems that the crop is very short. Some people claim that their crop will not be more than twenty-five per cent. At some places around Lake Helen and DeLand the per cent is a little better. The trees, 
also suffered 'a great many offsets on ac¬ 
count of the cold, wet and drought. 
However, I do not think that they are in any worse shape than the oranges, which suffered by drought and cold.

Now, as far as varieties are concern^G!, 
there are four or five varieties that do well and are a good market kind. Perhaps the one entitled toi first place is the Jewel. 
That is planted more largely, perhaps-, 
than all others combined. Following that is the Waldo. Those two' peaches are very similar; in fact I doubt if you could tell much, if any, difference either in size, 
ciuality or appearance, except that the 
Jewel is a trifle larger and is alsoi from ten days to two weeks earlier. This is one of the earliest varieties we have, making it on that account a desirable market variety. 
It is also a free stone. 

Then come the varieties of the Bidwell- 
Peento type; Bidwell Early, Maggie, Su- 
ber and) Yum Yum, which are very similar in appearance, character and tree growth and time of ripening, being right along with the Jewel. These are cling stones. 
The Peento and Honey types are far preferable, in fact, the only ones that give us our market peaches. Those of mixed strain like the Jewel and Waldo, also seem to be preferable. The Peento seems tO' be a more vigorous grower, making a longer lived tree than the honey. They are on a par with our native seedling trees in vigor. 

As far as pears go, I dO' not think that I 
have anything new to- say. Pear growing is all right if 3^011 can keep out the blight, 
but I do not know of any remedy or any preventive. About the best thing seems to be non-cultivation. The two varieties grown most generally are the LeConte and the Keiffer. 

As far as plums are concerned, there is a general opinion that they do- not do well in Floridla; but this is a mistake for there are several varieties of plums that do well. 
The Excelsior was the original one intro¬ 


duced some twelve years ago. This is a cross between some variety of the Japan¬ 
ese type and the Southern Chicksaw type and bears very well. There is also the 
Terrell plum. This is very similar to the 
Excelsior; a trifle larger and I think of a little better flavor. Then there is a yel¬ 
low variety, the Queen; also the Howe, 
very similar to Excelsior ; and a new va¬ 
riety called Miller, which is later than any of the others, but which is one that I think will succeed very w-ell in Elorida. The 
Excelsior has been tried and proven very satisfactory. TEe others are comparative¬ 
ly new, but being similar in tree growth and of the same type, I think they will do well throughout the whole state. 

Mr. Hampton—What about the Rival peach ? 

Mr. Erink—I am not .so well acquainted with that. I unGlerstand it is very similar to the Hall’s Yello-w. Hall’s Yellow has not been a success commercially. It was planted a good deal a few years ago, but for some reason or other it has not made a demand. The demand for that class of peaches has fallen o-ff very considerably. 
At one time we could not furnish near enough trees to supply the demand, but now we have to be careful not to over¬ 
stock ourselves. 

Mr. Gibbs—What is the matter with the Dorothy, or the Angel ? 

Mr. Frink—^The Dorothy is good, but for market purposes I think it is a little too late. The Angel peach is a good peach, 
and a pretty one— d. little acid for some tastes, and perhaps' a little late for the best market. It comes a little too near the season of the Georgia peaeh. 

Mr. Gibbs—^What time would you think an early peach would begin to ripen? 

Mr. Frink—That is a little hard to 



I lO 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


answer. The different seasons makes them ripen at different times. 

Mr. Gibbs—When I left home on 
Saturday, the Angel peach was almost in full, brilliant coloring. I think that is a little early. 

Mr. Hart—The Suber, how about that? 

Mr. Frink—That is one of the best and should have been included in the list of the 
Bid well varieties. 

Mr. Penny—I would like to ask about what time wouldl be the best tO' plant the 
Excelsior plum. 

Mr. Frink—^That question might cover a good many different kinds of trees— 
generally, the late fall or early winter. I 
consider December the best month. 

Member—I have an Excelsior plum tree in my yard which has borne well for four successive years, but for the last two years it has been father shy. I have ex¬ 
cused this, though, on account of the ex¬ 
treme weather conditions. I have some other trees of different varieties of plums that have not given me a quart of plums in twenty years. The Excelsior is the one that has always given the best satis¬ 
faction, in my experience. 

Mr. Longwood—Do you know any¬ 
thing about the Satsumia plum? 

Mr. Frink—It is very erratic. Some report great satisfaction while with others the results are unfavorable. Around 
Tampa, I understand they do fairly well. 
It is something like the Kelsey. I would not advise planting it generally. 

Mr. Penny—I would like to ask the gentleman who siaidi his Excelsior plum did well, what kind of land he has. 

Member—It runs about four feet of 


yellow sand. After that, clay phosphiate below, and water on an average of fifteen feet. 

Mr. Penny—^Do you think they would do well on low land? 

Member—I have tried all kinds of land, but I don’t know that I can tell you exactly what the solution is for the plum problem. It seems tO' be a very erratic kind of a tree, and they sometimes do well or ill for no apparent reason at all. Some graft pears on the wildl haw and say they do well. 

Mr. Neil—A man in my county told me to spray with the Bordeaux mixture and 
I would always have a good crop. 

Mr. Waite—I have succeeded in hold¬ 
ing the fruit better this year than before, 
and I sprayed with the Bordeaux. 

Mr. Frink—‘Now, if you take a peach, 
for instance, that is a native of a different country and bring it down here, it is al¬ 
most impossible to make it bear. Occa¬ 
sionally you can get a few fruit, but as a general proposition, it never is very suc¬ 
cessful. I think the Kelsey plum is out of its proper environment. 

Mr. Hudson—iHow can you get a peach that will mature later in the season, say in August? 

Mr. Frink—There are varieties that will db that^ larg-ely of the native Spanish type. There are several of those peaches; 
just now I do not recall any of the names. 
It is hard to get them to bear so well when budded as when they arf? 'seedlings; 
that is, speaking of the Spanish type. 
Probably one of the best here is the Estel- 
la, which is very late and, unojer favorable conditions, bears well.

Strawberry Culture, 


By J* M* Brownlee. 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen : 

The soil furnishes anchorage for the roots of the plants, and a reservoir for food and moisture. It makes almost no difference to the plant whether the soil be ligTit or heavy, sandy or clay, so' long as these objects are accomplished. The plant lives on the foo'dl it finds in the soil and not on the soil itself. It is true that the strawberry—like any other crop^—must generally thrive best on rich sandy loam. 
But is this not the ideal soil for any crop? 
It holds fertilizer and moisture, but is not easily puddled. It becomes sufficiently compact without getting hard or lumpy and it admits air. These qualities are es¬ 
sential and they can usually be had with less labor and care in sandy loam than in any other soil. Here in Bradford county you may see all kincils of soils planted to strawberries, from low stiff, tO' high sandy loam, and with little difference in the yield. I don’t believe there is any crop grown that is less particular than the strawberrv about the kind of soil on which it is grown, not even grass. 

KIND OF BERRIES GROWN. 

There is very little discusision to be had on the berry most grown here, as the 
Klondyke is grown almost exclusively throughout Florida. There may be a few 
Lady Thompsons grown here, but very few indeed. The Klondyke was origi¬ 
nated in Louisiana some years ago. It has a very vigorous bush, free from, rust or blight, and a very dlark green foliage. 
The fruit is simply perfection, being large 


and exceedingly high colored, and very firm, which makes it a good shipper. 

This berry was introduced here about six years ago, and has held its own better than any other variety ever planted here. 
The Klondyke is a very prolific berry. 
When we have anything like a good sea¬ 
son you may expect anywhere from nine¬ 
ty to one hundred and ten bushels per acre. 

PREPARATION OF LAND AND METHOD OF 
CULTIVATION. 

In preparing landl for strawberries, it is very essential tO' have your ground free from grass and well pulverized, for when you make your ground up you do not want any cavities underneath the plant. 
It makes it difficult in getting plants to live, and even if they should live over a cavity, the plant will be a shy bearer. I 
usually plant berries after oats; plow in the oat stubbles before the grass comes through and then keep it thoroughly disk¬ 
ed until ready to bed, which may be from 
July 15th to September ist, just as you may choose. In bedding my groimof, I 
use eight and one-half feet for bed, and put four rows of berries to the bed, make the two center rows 18 inches apart and outside rows 22 inches from center rows. 

The cultivating is done with a hoe and hand cultivator. Run the hand cultivator about once a week if the ground is wet. 
This keeps the ground loose and prevents grass from comiing through. I use a horse cultivator to plow out my water furrows. 



112 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


It is very essetiitial to keep the groiind well pulverised tO' prevent it from forming a crust on top and thus drying out too easily . 

BEST METHOD OF MARKETING. 

Marketing the berry crop is a very diffi¬ 
cult matter. Almost anyone can grow them, but when it comes to marketing them it takes one whoi has studied the con¬ 
ditions for several years. My method is to select one good reliable commission house in each city that I expect to ship to 
(I use New \Mrk, Philadelphia and 
Boston for my markets) and ship tO' him regularly. It is well to have berries on the market every day if you possibly can. 
Put up your berries in good honest pack¬ 
ages and mark your name on the crate and it will not take your commission man long to secure a good tradle on your fruit; 
one that the trade will call for. Or, if you expect to sell to buyers at your own town, it is best to put up honest packages and you will never have any trouble in selling. The buyers soon learn who puts up good berries and are always ready to buy that kind. 

GROWTH AND EXTENT OF INDUSTRY IN 
THE STATE. 

The strawberry industry has grown wonderfully in this state in the last few years. Ten or twelve years ago the ship¬ 
ments from this county on the heaviest days were no more than from three to four hundred bushels, while last year its heaviest day would reach five or six thousand bushels. Last year there were 


$9,000.00 worth of berries sold at Starke on the wharf in. a single clay, besides several hundred bushels shipped on con¬ 
signment. The net sales tO' the groovers of this county last season were between 
$350,000 and $400,000, and there seems to be no limit to the industry. Several years ago, I thought that the market would be glutted if we grew too' many berries, but last season, with our large supply of berries, there was a continued cry for more berries. 

DIFFICULTIES AND DRAWBACKS OF STRAW¬ 
BERRY INDUSTRY. 

The principal difficulty in the straw¬ 
berry industry is the drought in the sum¬ 
mer in the setting season. The plant is very delicate, and unless we have plenty of rain dluring the setting season it is very difficult tO' get a stand, and in order to get a good yield we must have a good stand of nice large bushes, as a small bush can never produce the fruit a large one will. We sometimes have a drought dur¬ 
ing the picking season that also hurts us very much as it makes the fruit small and of an inferior quality. The blight gener¬ 
ally strikes us during the dry season. An insect (commonly known as the thrip) 
often sucks the bloom and kills it and then they work on the small berries. I 
have seen them djestroy an entire fruit crop. 

We sometimes have a late freeze that destroys a great quantity of fruit, but we can’t call this a drawback as it is most generally to our advantage as it keeps berries back north of here.

Report From Pinellas Fruit Growers^ Association, 


By Mr. J* G* Julian, President. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

This association started here among the pineapple and then the orange growers took it up here, forming the Orange 
Growers’ Association some four or five years ago. We have the meetings quar¬ 
terly the first Saturday of each month of 
March, June, September and December, 
which have proved very interesting to some sixty or eighty. Every now and then we say we must take all the orange growers in, but all of them can’t get in at the same time. I think we are on a per¬ 
manent basis and at least 50 or 75 of the orange growers would say positively that we are. We find our quarterly meetings- 
very interesting. We generally have two sessions on the days we meet; one in the forenoon and one in the afternoon. Then, 
if there is any special point that we want to know miore about, we call on the Ex¬ 
periment Station for that specific point and one of Prof. Rolf’s assistants comes 


down. I believe the Prof, himself was djown here once and started to give us a 
30 minute talk, but we were all so inter¬ 
ested that when he finally did look at his watch, he found he had barely time to catch his train. We meet at different points. Largo, O^ona, Clearwater, St. 
Petersburg, so that if it is impossible for some of the members to leave their homes, 
the meetings are brought to them, and it does not work a hardship on anybody. 
We think it is a good organization for the betterment and general diffusion of ideas. 
New members are coming in all the time, 
and I think it is now on a firmer footing than it has been for the last four or five years. We hope to- make it a great good anal benefit. 

Prof. Rolfs—I can assure the meeting that this Association is a wide-awake body and as intelligent a lot of people as any¬ 
one would want to see. 


Report From Pasadena Farmers^ Club, 


By B. w. McLam* 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In response tO' the courteous notice from your president that the Programme Con> 
mittee had reserved a date for a report from the Pasadena Farmers' Club, I now have the honor to introduce the Pasco 
County Fledgling. 

This 3-year-old Agricultural Society 

8 


was born. September 24th, 1904, at the residence of Mr. C. F. Gardner, on the shores of Lake Pasadena. 

Actuated by a common impulse of co¬ 
operation and an earnest desire to master the problems involved in agricultural pursuits, twelve gentlemen and nine la¬ 
dies organized the Pasadena Farmers’ 





FLORIDA state HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


II4 


Club and elected Mr. A. Roberts, Presi¬ 
dent,. Mrs. C. F. Gardner, Secretary, and 
Mr. Stephen Soar, Treasurer. 

Monthlv meetino-s have been held and 

j 

the officers proven so satisf actory that they have been annually re-elected; while the membership has increased from 21 to 68, 
w*ith an average attendance of 30. 

The distingaiishing feature of this club is its combination of home and social in¬ 
fluences with the practical and scientific discussion of the problems incident to ag¬ 
ricultural life. 

The ladies and children contribute most eft'ectively to the general entertainment as evidenced by Master Butts, a sturdy 3- 
year-old, who at our last meeting made a happy hit of “My Country ’Tis of Thee” 
and “I belong to the Band, boom ! boom I” 

The social relations are further pro¬ 
moted by meeting in turn at the homes of members, each family bringing a basket of lunch, which is assembled by the hos¬ 
tess and spread in a home brewed dinner, 
which is thoroughly discussed before the purely practical and scientific subjects are introduced. 

“Weir’, I hear you ask, “What has 
• been accomplished?” I answer,—First, a method has been found tO' bind together in a coherent group those interested in the products of the soil so that their indi¬ 
vidual development reacts one upon the other, and the experience of the unit mem¬ 
ber becomes the property and knowledge of all. 

Second, the animated discussions and interchanges of practical experience have already developed a strength and confi¬ 
dence which will be efficient in originating and shaping the new projects of irrigation and culture, which must be perfected be¬ 
fore general and liberal results can be ob¬ 
tained by Florida farmers. 


Third, a power has been organized and a spirit developed which enables the farm¬ 
er to get into closer touch with other or¬ 
ganized workers and thinkers; and the practical and personal assistance already accorded us by members of the Agricul¬ 
tural Station has had a marked influence in awakening the interest and encourag¬ 
ing perseverence in the work. I believe that the ensuing three years will witness an unprecedented development in Pasco county. 

It is eminently proper, in this connec¬ 
tion, to note the intelligent, unwearying and genial spirit of its President, Mr. A. 
Roberts, who from its inception to the present moment has studied its interests and presided over its deliberations. 

This brief sketch of the origin and poli¬ 
cy of the club does not contemplate details of the practical work done or a view of the scientific and technical grounds cov¬ 
ered. 

I assume that the office of presenting it has come to me because of my very ear¬ 
nest interest in all such matters rather than any practical knowledge or exper¬ 
ience of the subjects involved; and there¬ 
fore, in bringing to you this greeting from the Pasadena Farmers’ Club I have at once the honor and pleasure of introduc¬ 
ing to you my associate delegates,—gen¬ 
tlemen who are not unknown to you and who, by long residence and practical ex¬ 
perience, are eminently qualified to in¬ 
form you upon every point of interest con¬ 
cerning agricultural and horticultural mat¬ 
ters in Pasco county: 

Dr. J. F. Corrigan, St. Leo; W. J. Ells¬ 
worth, Jessamine; J. C. Carter, Dade 
City; J. W. Hudson, Dade City. 

I regret my inability to be present in person.

Legislative Help* 


Prof. Bartlett—I had not expected to bring* this matter up at the present time. 
It is a matter of so much importance that several of our people have desired me to bring it before you, possibly through a committee. I have spoken to some of the older members in regard tO' this, and have also spoken to some of the 3ADunger mem¬ 
bers. There are three things I wish you to consider. One of the things is in re¬ 
gard to the experiment station. VVe have an experiment station here, but we get very little benefit from it, compared with what we ought to get. We would like help along the line of irrigation, es¬ 
pecially the truck men and fruit growers, 
better than what we are getting now. 
We have to go up to the experiment sta¬ 
tion and bring the men down, paying their expenses, and then when they have j ust .opened’ a little vista to our eyes, they are gone. The people in the experiment station are dbing all they can, but they have a limited amount of money to do it with. $15,000 is all that they get. Flor¬ 
ida has never given them a dollar. Every state in the Union is allowed $15,000 
through the Hatch Bill for an experiment station. I suppose our state gets $15,000 
because every state is entitled to that. All through the west they are giving many dollars. In Illinois, in Wisconsin, in 
Nebraska, and in Kansas, they are doing great things for their agricultural experi¬ 
ment stations. Where they put out thou¬ 
sands of dollars, they have been taking in millions. We are doing very little, 
and I think a sentiment should be stirred up in the state so that the matter would 


be taken up by our Legislature anal that it would give us for this purpose at least as much as the Government gives. 

I understand there is a bill before the 
Legislature now to give $5,000 for the 
Farmers’ Institute and $30,000 for build¬ 
ings needed by the Experiment Station, 
and I think it is the duty of every agri¬ 
culturist to see that it does not fail. Our 
State has great prospects in agricultural and horticultural lines, and I think we should use every means in our power to realize these prospects. 

The Interstate Commerce Commission is doing a great deal for the whole coun¬ 
try. California has done a great dleal for itself because of its compact organization. 
We want to do the same. We want to go before the Interstate Commission and get themi to co-operate with us. We should have a comimittee appointed tO' go before them and see that we get what we want. We ought to have half the ship¬ 
ping rate we are getting now. 

We had an appropriation from Con¬ 
gress for $5,000 last year with which to fight the white fly, and $10,000 this year. 
The State has not been doing enough. 
Congressman Sibley has done all that one man could do and our Congressmen Mr. 
Sparkman and Mr. Clark, have co-oper¬ 
ated with him and they have been able to get this $10,000. The United! States 
Government comes in and helps us, and we do nothing. Now, our Legislature should d'o something to eradicate this curse of ‘orange culture. Let us show that we are interested ourselves and give

our legislators no peace until we get some help from, them: 

These are the three things, and I ask that you have a committee of five appoint¬ 
ed to look into these several propositions and report on them and the advisability of presenting and handling them. I put it in the form of a motion. 

Motion seconded 

Mr. Painter—A good many members will probably remember that Mr. Hart at two different meetings put in a resolu¬ 
tion somewhat tO' the effect that we want¬ 
ed to get aid from the Government to help fight the blight. I went to Wash¬ 
ington and presented it to Secretary Wil¬ 
son myself. He said he wanted to do all he could, but just then the appropriation was all taken up and he said “What are yon doing yourselves?” You can count on his helping you and meeting you more than half way on anything you will un¬ 
dertake that will be of benefit. He also said, “If you will get your people to¬ 
gether and) show that you mean some¬ 
thing, then we will help you.” 

Dr. Richardson—There are some things that nobody can find out. Mr. 
Painter knows that. You know that this 
Society has gone tO' the trouble time and again of preparing bills to be presented to the Legislature. Have they ever gone through? No. I do not know; what be¬ 
came of them'. Nobody else, it seems, 
can find out. We simply have apathetic members, an apathetic society and an apa¬ 
thetic political party. By that I mean the men who are in control of the Legislature of our state. I know of no better way to wake them up than to wake up ourselves. 
I think every member of this organiza¬ 
tion should take it upon himself to see that the legislature is fixed. I don’t mean 


fixed in the political sense, because I do not think that the horticulturists of this state are in a position, financially, to fix anybody. I do not think we shouldl fix them as it is ordinarily understood, in the underhanded way, but in a way that will serve our purpose perhaps, better. I 
mean by that in a way that will make them think they are going to be fixed definitely and permanently and finally. 
Let us fix them' in their political graves if they dO' not do something for us. 

I do not think we should be ojiscour- 
aged by our failures in the past but that we should try again. I know of no bet¬ 
ter time than right now, and I am heartily in sympathy with the motion offered by 
Mr. Bartlett, and hope that you will ap¬ 
point a committee that will do something. 
Let us get at the Legislature of the State so that we may be able to report, if we de¬ 
sire more help from the Government, 
that Florida has at least done something for herself. Let us ever bear in mind the old adage that “the Lord helps those who help themselves.” Let us help our¬ 
selves first and then apply to the Govern¬ 
ment. 

Prof. Bartlett—I think Dr. Richard¬ 
son’s remarks are well put, and I think we should get help from our own Legis¬ 
lature before applying to the Govern¬ 
ment. I was at a banquet where Mr. 
Sparkman was present, and he said, 
“What are you doing to help your¬ 
selves?” Of course, there was nothing that could be said. 

Prof. Rolfs—I would like to say a word in explanation. We ha\’e slightly more funds than Mr. Bartlett spoke of, 
on account of the creation of the Adams 
Fund, but these are so circumscribed) by law that we must use this fund for origin- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


'al investigation only, and the work that 
Mr. Bartlett wants done and that we all want to do, is classified as Farmers’ In¬ 
stitute work and demonstration work; in other words, putting into practice well known principles, and where principles are well known, the money received from 
Congress cannot properly be used. How¬ 
ever, the experiment station staff once in a while, if it is possible to slip out to some of these farmers’ gatherings, are very glad to do so. When a body of 
* local agriculturists get together aridi say that they will pay our expenses, we are very willing to go out and give therni our time. But we cannot justly charge ex¬ 
penses for work of this kind to the funds mentioned. The Federal Government is this year expending something like $6o,- 
ooo for agricultural work in the State of 
Florida; that is, investigation work. You are perhaps surprised at the amount. 
There is the Hatch Fund, the Adams 
Fund, a Subtropical Laboratory Fund and the white fly appropriation, in addi¬ 
tion to the local demonstrations arid) ex¬ 
periments. 

You will see where Mr. Tenny and Mr. 
Powell and men of this stamp are costing 


117 

the Federal Government a great deal, and you will see how much the Federal Gov¬ 
ernment does and how little the State does. Consequently, the federal officers have the right to feel a little discouraged. 
The people at Tallahassee are contem¬ 
plating an appropriation to give to the experiment station a home. I suppose there is nothing more important than a home. We have had none up to the present time. This bill proposes about 
$30,000 to^ be expended for the buildings and $5,000 annually for Farmers’ Insti¬ 
tutes. 

Mr. Skinner—I was at Tallahassee sev¬ 
eral years ago when one of the bills came up that the Society recommended. The difficulty seems to be that the Horticul¬ 
tural Society seems to be identified with the orange industry. The state of Flori¬ 
da is much larger than the orange indus¬ 
try. If you miake the people in each part of the State think that they are to be benefited by the passing of a bill, it is pretty likely to go through. They are willing to pass any bill that does not call for money. Let them all see that it is a benefit to the state, arid) I think there will be no trouble. 


Japanese Matting Industry for America. 


Prof. Rolfs—I understand that the office of the Seed and Plant Introduction is now looking for a place to plant the 
Japanese matting rush, and we have their agent with us this morning. Probably you will be as interested as I am in this matter, and I will be glad if Mr. Tull will give us a few remarks. 

Mr. Tull—The matting industry in 
America so far is very young; it is still 


in its infancy. This is an entirely new thing in America and the office of Seed arid) Plant Iritroduction under the Bureau of Plant Industry has recently taken it up. 
The growing of this grass was tried by private individuals but they made a fail¬ 
ure. They succeeded in getting machin¬ 
ery, but could ndt get raw material. They went to China and Japan and finally se¬ 
cured a number of plants and sent them 




ii8 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


over here to be grown. Japan sent a representative over here and found we were trying to compete with them so they immediately stopped oiir supply of straw. 
The American Company sent a man to 
Japan again andl got a small supply of the 
Chinese straw and they are now making a very fine §a"ade of matting but the sup¬ 
ply of raw material is very limited. At this point, the Department of Agriculture took up the work of introducing these two grasses from China and Japan. 

Some experiments have been tried with our native grasses on the coast of South 
Carolina, principally in the abandoned rice lands. The rice industry along the 
Atlantic Coast, which at one time was so thriving, has within the last ten years, en¬ 
tirely died out on account of the rice in 
Louisiana and Texas being grown by the use of machinery. The Department thought tiiat by introducing the matting grass into North and South Carolina, they might bring back into' cultivation the abandonee! rice fields, but so far have proved unsuccessful with the native grass¬ 
es. 

Last yeai* we got a special appropria¬ 
tion through to send a man to Japan to get the roots, as the plant is propagated in this way. I went to Japan last fall and finally succeeded in getting a great many roots of the twO' different kinds of Japan¬ 
ese and Chinese roots. These roots were finally landed at California but in very bad condition, so to save them we left them at 
Chico, Cai., to grow for the summer. The plants are now doing very nicely. We are now planning tO' distribute those roots next fall, beginning at Texas andl running along die Gulf into Florida and up into 
South Carolina. The plant requires al¬ 
most the same conditions that are re¬ 


quired in rice culture. It is planteol in the 

winter and then water put on. The water, 
with plenty of fertilizer, forces the plant 

into a very long, slender growth. We have arranged now for an experiment with some Japanese in Texas who have put out about one and one-half acres of it. 

We wish to distribute the plants now at 
Chico in two or three different places in 
Florida as well as Texas. There is now a ready market for the straw at $80.00 per ton. In Japan, the grass yields from four to six tons per acre. 

The way the Chinese and Japanese grow it is much cheaper than the methods we woulcil have to employ. The labor conditions there are nothing compared to what they are here. The plant is peren¬ 
nial and you can put it in the ground and leave it ; with the aid of water and the proper use of fertilizer you can continue to harvest year after year. 

Our object is to first find out if the grass will grow. Then we will have to work it out by practice and find out the best methods of growing it. I will be glad to answer any questions or talk to anyone on the subject. 

Mr. Hart—What is the price of grow¬ 
ing and preparing for market; putting it in shape? 

Mr. Tull—The two kinds of straw are cured entirely different. Two days of hot sunshine will cure it. The process of curing in Japan is very crude and very long compared to the way in whicli we would have to' do it. The grass is cut and spread out in the field, and after two days of hot sunshine, the farmer considers it cured.

Camphor for Florida. 


119 


W. O. Reichtmanii:—I regret that I 
cannot make quite as explicit report as I 
would like. Probably the thing that most of you are interested in, is whether camphor can be produced commercially in the United States. The first thing to be ascertained is as to whether the plant can be grown at all successfully or not. 
The natives of Florida can probably answer that question much better than I 
can, as they have it here with them, and have undoubtedly noticed the habits of its growth. From; the trees which are present, it seems to me that there is but one answer to this question, and that is, 
that the tree can be grown, and grown successfully. 

The second point I would mention, is as to whether the camphor tree as grown in this country is producing camphor. 
You have already had two reports, one presented in 1896, by Ffenry Hubbard, 
stating* that he had received as high as one and fonr-tenths per cent, of camphor from the fresh twig ot the camphor tree. 
The second was from; Dr. Walker, last year, in which he presented soine of the work of the Department and the results of his own personal experiments. 

Our work has been confined to Florida and in California, but at the present time we have not as yet found a single tree but that an appreciable quantity of cam¬ 
phor was contained in tlie leaves and twigs of the tree. The amount of the camphoii* does not compare with the amount reported as being found in the trees grown in its native oondition. This may be due tO' several reasons. The chief reason is perhaps that we are work¬ 
ing only one side of the matter and the 


people of Formosa are working under entirely different conditions. They may be working on the basis of dry material, 
and we on fresh material, which would give a variation of sixty per cent. 

The last point tO' be mentioned, and perhaps the most important point in con¬ 
nection with the camphor work, is the' 
camphor as produced in the United States of a quality that it can be used commer¬ 
cially. Samples of the camphor that have been produced in Florida have been sub¬ 
mitted to the trade for their own demon¬ 
stration and observation, and the report sent tO' the Department from the firms who have been testing it, is, that they would have thought it was from Japan or 
Formosa if tliev had not known where it Came from. 

Secondly, does it have all of the quali¬ 
ties, physical and chemical, that the For¬ 
mosa and Japanese camphor have? It has. )• I 

Lastly, I can only state that one firm has taken the matter up, and has started planting aTract of three thousand acres with camphor in your own state. 

I regi'et that I cannot go into the de¬ 
tails of the work and give you a more detailed talk. This, I trust, may be done in the immediate future. 

Dr. Walker produces samples of cam¬ 
phor. 

Dr. Walker—I am not in a position to give you much further*information about the matter. Mr. Reichtmann has taken charge of the camphor plant. I am doing my best to' cultivate as much cam¬ 
phor as I can. Mr. \Vood is now in charge of the work at Huntington. Dr. 



120 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Reichtmann has taken charge of the large establishment at Satsunia. 

I verified miy own statement made last year, and find that camphor can be grown more than successfully. The experiment as far as it has gone, is perfectly satis¬ 
factory. I have written and advised peo¬ 
ple to go into this, and a great many have said that there could not be anything in it, because if it was as good as I said, I 
would want to keep it all to myself. The sample just displayed was made from trees that I planted myself and had puri¬ 
fied in Washington, and is of a miost satisfactory nature. I can only say to any of my friends who- are interested in camphor—I fancy the best thing they can do is to plant it. 

Mr. Sheppard—What degree of cold will a camphor tree stand? 

Member—^In Marion county, I have 


not seen one that showed the slightest de¬ 
gree of being injured by the cold. 

Mr. Hart—Does the variety have any¬ 
thing to do with its power to withstand the cold? 

Dr. Walker—I think the condition of the tree at the time the frost comes has 

more to do wi'th it than anything else. 
The leaves will stand a considerable amount of cold and when they fall, retain a considerable portion of their camphor. 
Fromi the very small amount of opportu¬ 
nity we have had, we discovered that the camphor makes its growth as a rule pret¬ 
ty regularly. I have noticed a few that have made a very irregular growth. A 
peculiar advantage is that they will stand more cold than an average orange tree, 
and when cut down you can get your camphor from- the dead wood.

Necrology* 


Report Submitted by G* L* Taber, W* S* Hart and Wm*C^ Richardson* 


Mr. President^ Ladies and Gentlemen : 

There are times in the lives of socie¬ 
ties, as of individuals, when we are called upon to cope, as best we may, 
with the feelings that overwhelm us, 
and to give expression, in some form, 
however inadequate, to the esteem and love and honor in which we hold our departed dead. 

This is one of those sad occasions and our lips falter and the words we grope for come haltingly and broken and seemingly powerless to convey the thoughts we would utter. We stand apalled at the calamity that has over¬ 
taken us. Since last we met our honored and beloved President, 
Charles Tobin McCarty and five others of our highly esteemed number, have passed into the Great Beyond. The sad ’ recordl in chronological order is as follows: 

L. J. Sawyer of Tibballs, Saint Lucie county, died at Oswego, N. J.» July 
20th, 1906, aged sixty-eight years. 

George Rainsford Fairbanks of Fer- 
nandina, Nassau County, died at 
Suwannee, Tennessee, August 3rd, 
1906, aged eighty-six years. 

Denis Redmond of Saint Nicholas, 
Duval County, died at Jacksonville, 
September 24th, 1906, aged eighty-two years. 

Abner Atwood of Pawtucket, R. L, 
died at his home in Pawtucket, Novem¬ 
ber 23rd, 1906, aged eighty-two years. 

Charles Tobin McCarty of Eldred, 


Saint Lucie County, died at Fort 
Pierce, January 30th, 1907, aged fifty years. 

Henry George Sartorious of Semi¬ 
nole, Hillsboro County, died at Las 
Vegas, New Mexico, March 30th, 1907, 
aged thirty-two years. 

Your committee on Necrology, to whom the sad duty was assigned, beg to report the following resolutions: 

Whereas, during the past year, death has removed our beloved chief execu¬ 
tive officer and several of our most worthy members, and 

Whereas, it is due their honored memory that fitting tribute be paid them and expression given to our deep sense of loss, therefore. 

Resolved, that in the death of 
Charles Tobin McCarty, our society has lost a President whom we loved, 
an executive officer of high ability, a man, a brother and a friend who was in every sense one of “God’s noble¬ 
men that in the death of George R. 
Fairbanks we have lost a zealous work¬ 
er for the interests of our society, a historian of note and an honored 
Christian gentleman; that in the death of Denis Redmond we have lost one of our esteemed honorary members, who for many years was noted in literary work and zealous in horticultural pur¬ 
suits; that in the death of Abner At¬ 
wood, L. J. Sawyer and H. G. Sartor¬ 
ious, we have lost three of our worthy and esteemed members. 

Resolved that we extend our sym- 



122 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


pathies to relatives and friends of these deceased members. 

Resolved that these resolutions be spread upon our minutes; that suitable memorial notices be printed in the forthcoming Report of the Society; 
that the same report shall be dedicated to the memory of our deceased Presi¬ 
dent, Charles Tobin McCarty, and that this dedication so appear on the title page. 


CHARLES TOBIN McCARTY. 


“Our self-made men are the glory of our institutions.” 


Charles Tobin McCarty was born at 
Green Bay, Wisconsin, on February 
24th, ia the year 1857. 

He came of blood which had proved its staunchness amid the dangers and hardships of a new land; he owed his being to parents noted for energy of brain and brawn, in a community where each person must of necessity, 
have possessed something of the he¬ 
roic; he sprang from a race which could not be moulded into unchangeable austerity even by the exigencies of pioneer life. He was the son of a frontiersman and he early took upon his young shoulders his share of that father’s burdens. Here it was that his inheritance from his Celtic ancestry stood him in good stead. It made him cheerful in the midst of difficulties; it gave him the power to see poetical beauty as well as practical opportunity in the pine forests about him; it fired him with ambition, and whispered to him continuously of great things to be done in the world, even though that 


world seemed an unconquerable wilder¬ 
ness. 

He was a boy in whose sturdy man¬ 
liness his father felt a just pride, upon whose gentleness his mother relied; 
whose courage won the respect of his brothers and whose courtesy made glad the hearts of his sisters. 

He gave of himself freely, of his warm sympathy, of his mental activity^ 
and by this very generosity created for himself a little higher plane; opened up for himself the way along which he resolutely trod toward loftier ideals. 

He was, from his earliest years, con¬ 
sumed with a thirst for knowledge, for education, apparently realizing from the first that without this he could not reach the heights on which he had fixed his eyes. Only those who are acquainted with the limited education¬ 
al advantages of the West in those days, can appreciate the difficulties in his way. Whatever they were he surmounted them, and in 1878 entered 
Tilford Collegiate Academy at Vinton, 
Iowa, with so many credits that he graduated from that institution a year later. 

In the class with him was Miss 
Elizabeth Matter, whose record in school work was equal to his own. As he had been one marked and set apart, 
so had she been a leader, a forceful, 
independent spirit. Upon the stage from which these two delivered their addresses, they were made man and wife, on the day of their graduation. 
Life as they could see it ahead of them, 
was not a path of roses, but they enter¬ 
ed upon it confidently, secure in the knowledge of their tried powers, ani¬ 
mated by kindred ambitions, and sure that the depth of their affections would

not only help them overcome all pos¬ 
sible difficulties, but would make the struggle together, a real happiness. 
Their faith was justified. The dark days came, but they were not cast down, for they had each other and that to them, always meant more than any¬ 
thing else. 

The happiness of their home life, the remarkable harmony of their union, 
deeply impressed all who were allowed the privilege of intimate association, 
and the desolation of such happiness weighs heavily on the hearts of their friends. 

In 1882 Mr. McCarty entered the 
Lawr Department of the Iowa State 
University, graduating with honor at the close of his course. After devoting a year to the practice of his profession lie was induced to accept a professor¬ 
ship at Tilford, where he remained un¬ 
til 1888. 

His work as a teacher was of a high order, adding markedly to the strength of the school and leaving an imperish¬ 
able impression upon the minds and hearts of the hundreds of young people who came under his influence. His power was felt outside as well as in¬ 
side the class-room. He was friend as welt as instructor. He not only drilled his students in the acquisition of knowledge, but he interwove facts with a broad philosophy, which gave them warmth and vital significance. 

On February 19th of this year the alumni of Tilford held a memorial service in honor of their beloved tcachei*. Hundreds attended and their sincere sorrow showed that the years had not lessened their regard for Mr. 
McCarty, nor their appreciation of his worth. Thus it is that fellow students 


and pupils after an interval of twenty years, declare that Mr. McCarty, '‘en¬ 
riched and inspired their lives and generously helped to lead them out to broader and better fields.'’ 

In the year 1888, driven by ill health, 
he severed his connection with Tilford, 
left a state where friends were legion, 
and with his brave wife and three small sons, began his struggle with the wilderness of Southern Florida. In a tiny clearing at what was then Ankona, 
but is now Eldred, he built his humble dwelling. On its site there now stands a handsome residence, and the wilder¬ 
ness has given place to broad, highly improved acres. The mighty change stands as a monument to his unusual keenness of foresight, to his tireless industry and his inflexible determina¬ 
tion. 

He entered into the cultivation of his pineapples, not only with the shrewd practicality of the business man, but with the eagerness of the earnest student entering a new field of knowledge. As it was with pineapples, 
so it was with the citrus fruits, or in fact, with anything which gave promise of becoming a valuable resource of his newly adopted state. He was always student and scientist as well as culti¬ 
vator. 

In 1895 the English Government was looking for a person competent to judge of the possibilities of the Baha¬ 
ma Islands and instruct the people living there, in the art of turning such possibilities into valuable facts. At that time Mr. McCarty had become so widely acknowledged as* an au¬ 
thority on semi-tropical industries, that he was chosen to fill this important and honorable position. 


124 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


As a result of his labors in the is¬ 
lands, he published at Nassau in 1896, 
^‘The Farmer and Fruit Grower’s Al¬ 
manac for the Bahamas Colony.” 

This almanac had nothing to do with the calendar, but was a clear, concise and thoroughly valuable treatise on citrus fruits, vegetables and pine¬ 
apples, by C. T. McCarty, Agricultural 
Instructor. It met with the hearty ap¬ 
proval of His Excellency Sir Wm. F. 
Haynes Smith, K. C. M. G., Governor of the Bahamas, and proved of incal¬ 
culable value to the people of the islands. 

His numerous addresses on subjects interesting and helpful to Floridians, 
have been widely copied and quoted. 

At the time of his death, January 
30th, 1907, he owned and operated the largest pineapple plantation in the world. He had however, of late years, 
placed the active management of this vast acreage in the hands of his capable eldest son, Daniel T. McCarty. 

As the East Coast country develop¬ 
ed, Mr. McCarty’s abilities as a lawyer and as a well informed and intellectual citizen were in great demand, and he gave his entire time to affairs in the conducting of which he was eminently qualified to shine. He had as a lawyer a large and ever-increasing practice, 
serving at the same time on the legal force of the F. E. C. Ry Co. In part¬ 
nership with A. C. Dittmar, of Ft. 
Pierce, he was engaged in an extensive real estate business. 

He was a heavy stockholder in the bank of Ft. Pierce, and a member of its Board of Directors, president of the 
Florida State Horticultural Society, 
president of the Ft. Pierce Board of 


Trade, the animating spirit of the county good roads association and a 
Mason of highest rank. 

To quote the words of a fellow- 
townsman: ‘‘He was always found in the front ranks of those working for the improvement of Ft. Pierce, St. 
Lucie county, the East Coast and the 
State of Florida. 

Mr. McCarty was shot on the streets of Ft. Pierce, the morning of January 
30th of the present year, and died the afternoon of the same day, leaving the entire community shocked at “the cruel cutting off of a noble life,” in deep gloom over the loss of such a friend and citizen, and with the firm belief that his place could never be filled. 

He was a quiet man, with quiet tastes, and he lived a quiet life, yet when he died there came expressions of sorrow and affection from, hosts of friends scattered over sixteen states of this great union, and from almost every county of this beautiful state he loved so well. Some of these friends occupy posts of honor among their fellowmen; others are from the hum¬ 
bler walks of life; all are alike bereft and grieving. 

Comfort and sympathy, without stint, has been given to the heart¬ 
broken wife and her three grief strick¬ 
en, but manly sons. Words are feeble; 
all we can do is to say: “Thy will be done.” 

“God calls our loved ones, but we lose not wholly 

What He has given; 

They live on earth in thought and deed, 
as truly 

As in His heaven.”

GEORGE RAINSFORD FAIRBANKS. 

To mention the name of George 
Rainsford Fairbanks is to bring to mind one of the leading characters in the history of this and adjoining states for the past sixty-four years, and one whose literary ability has contributed much to perpetuate that history. 

Major Fairbanks was born in Water- 
town, in northern New York, July 
5th, 1820, and died at his summer home at the University of the South, Suwan¬ 
nee, Tennessee, August 3rd, 1906, in the eighty-seventh year of his age. 

Entering the Sophomiore class of 
Union College, Schenectady, New 
York, at the age of sixteen, he gradu¬ 
ated with the class of 1839, at nineteen. 
He received the degree of M.A., both from his alma mata and from Trinity 
College, Hartford, Connecticut. 

In 1842, he was admitted to the bar in New York State. In the same year he came south. This was three years before Florida was admitted to the 
Union, and he remained a citizen of the 
Territory and State for the next sixty- 
four years. 

He first settled in historic St. Augus¬ 
tine, but later made his home in Fer- 
nandina. 

For four years (1842-46), during the territorial days, he was clerk of the 
United States Superior and District 
Court for the northern district of 
Florida; and the year after Florida’s admission to the Union in 1845 was a member of the State Senate (1846- 
48). He became Vice-President of the 
Florida Historical Society, honorary member of the New York Historical 
Society, and held other positions of trust and honor, but was best known 


to many of us as a fellow-horticulturist and the efficient President of the Flori¬ 
da Fruit Exchange, from its first real business meeting up to 1895 when the big freeze put the Exchange out of business. 

Throughout most of the period of its existence, he has been a valued member of this association, and records of the part he has taken in its discus¬ 
sions, and the papers contributed by him, form some of the most valuable portions of the Society’s annual re¬ 
ports. 

Over the inscription, “George R. 
Fairbanks, Historian,of Florida,” his likeness will be found in the report of 
1901. * 

“History and Antiquities of the City of St. Augustine, Florida;” “Fair- 
bank’s History of Florida,” “Florida 
Freezes” (the latter ^a short sketch contributed to this society in 1895 and to be found in its annual report of that year), and the many other products of his fertile pen will be found helpful, 
instructive and entertaining, but the work nearest his heart was the estab¬ 
lishment and fostering of The Univer¬ 
sity of the South, Suwanee, Tennessee, 
of which institution he published a history in his eighty-fifth year. 

At a convention of the Episcopal church, of which he was an ardent member, held on Lookout Mountain, 
July 4th, 1857, the plan of the institu¬ 
tion had been promulgated and formal 
OFganlizaition effiected at a notable meeting of representatives of ten 
Southern states. 

At this meeting he was appointed delegate and trustee for Florida. 

From .that time it became the leading 


126 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


interest and aim of his life to which he devoted unceasing energy. 

Its re-founding and re-organization, 
and hence the actual existence of this noble seat of learning, after the war, 
was primarily due to his labors and those of Bishop Quintard, of Ten¬ 
nessee, and it was a point of honor that he had been present in session at every meeting of its Board for forty-nine years, including the one in 1906 before his death. 

A pamphlet issued from the press of the University of the South, in October last, plainly shows the high esteem in which he was held by the trustees and faculty of that institution, the last few sentences of which are copied and read as follows: 

^‘As of everything that meets our 
• eyes on this mountain, he was more than all the rest of us put together, 
the layer out and maker and keeper of it. 

‘‘There is nothing here that did not know and own him in it. 

“There is nothing here that does not and will not feel and mourn his loss.” 


DENIS REDMOND. 

Mr. Denis Redmond, was born in the 
County of Wicklow, Ireland, Feb. 3, 
1824—the distinguished members of the Irish Party, in the English Parlia¬ 
ment, John E. and William Redmond, 
arc of the same family. In his youth 
Mr. Redmond lived for a time in Balti¬ 
more, Md. Later, he went to Augusta, 
Ga. There he was at first connected with the leading paper, “The Augusta 
Chronicle,” afterwards with the 
“Southern Cultivator,” of which he be¬ 
came owner and editor, and which he 


conducted successfully for over twenty years. 

He founded the Fruitland Nurseries, 
now owned by P. J. Berckmans & Sons, 
and built many beautiful homes in the neighborhood of Augusta, that are still monuments to his good taste and love of trees and flowers. 

He was a lover of books, owning a very rare and extensive library, and was considered an able literary critic and an authority on English poetry. 
He traveled widely in this country, 
and his love of nature was his religion. 

After the war he went further south, 
living at different times in New Or¬ 
leans, Pass Christian and Pascagoula, 
then to Florida, where he made his home for thirty years and was con¬ 
nected with fruit growing and journal¬ 
ism. He was twice married. He had two children by the first marriage, 
who survive him, Mrs. Locke, of New 
York City, and Mrs. Mel Redmond 
Colquit, of Washington, D. C. 

Summed up, Mr. Redmond’s life was one of great usefulness and devo¬ 
tion to the good and beautiful. He was endeared to many by reason of his loving, magnanimous nature and his beautiful mental gifts and attainments. 
He was one of the three honorary members of this society. 

He died on the 24th of September, 
1906, after a brief illness, in Jackson¬ 
ville, Fla. His wife followed him to the grave in three days.

Leicester J. Sawyer was graduated from Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y., 
class of 1859, graduated from Union 
Theological Seminary, New York City, 
1862. October 8th, 1862 he enlisted in Co. H. 27th Conn. VoL At the bat¬ 
tle of Fredericksburg was wounded three times in active service, and twice while lying on the battlefield waiting for removal. 

In 1864, he was ordained to the min¬ 
istry at Menasha, Wis., and for twelve years remained in the West preaching at Sheboygan, Wis., and Burlingame, 
Kansas. In 1876 he returned East, be¬ 
came pastor of the Presbyterian church at Oriskany, N. Y., and in 1877 took charge of the Presbyterian church at 
Whitesboro, N. Y. On March ist, 
1889 accepted a call from Emmanuel church, Amsterdam, N. Y., which po¬ 
sition he resigned in 1898 to remove to 
Tibbals, Fla., and began regular serv¬ 
ices at Eden and Jensen in 1900. Later he accepted the pastorate of a Union church at Ankona and Eldred, which charges he held until ill health caused him to resign in April, 1906. 

Rev. Mr. Sawyer was a man of bril¬ 
liant intellect and one whose brain force seemed never to grow weary, a speaker who could hold an audience at will, a scholar of great attainments, 
speaking eight languages fluently;-al¬ 
ways ready to respond when called up¬ 
on, and using no manuscript, he made his services valuable at all times and places. He was a genial companion and earnest friend. Mr. Sawyer had been a member of this Society for sev¬ 
eral years, but much to our regret, his health did not permit him to attend our annual gatherings. 


ABNER ATWOOD. 

Mr. Abner Atwood was born at 
Carver, Mass., in a house that had sheltered three successive generations of his family. He came from good old New England stock, John Atwood, 
the common ancestor of the family in 
America, having settled at Plymouth, 
Mass., in 1633. 

The youth of Abner Atwood was passed in school and helping his father on the farm until he attained his nine¬ 
teenth year. He then went to Taun¬ 
ton and entered the employ of William 
Mason & Company, then one of the largest cotton machinery builders in the country, to learn the trade of ma¬ 
chinist. After an experience of five years, he took charge of a section in the works of the Taunton Locomotive 
Company, remaining until 1858, when he formed a partnership with J. O. 
Draper in Bedford, Mass., for the manufacture of soap. In 1862 the firm of Draper & Atwood removed to 
Pawtucket, R. I., and in 1866, upon the death of the junior partner of the firm of R. & G. Cushman, spool manufac¬ 
turers, Mr. Atwood was invited by the surviving partner to an interest in the firm and business. Until 1875 the style of the firm was Cushman, Phillips 
& Company. Mr. Cushman then with¬ 
drew, and the firm of Atwood, Craw¬ 
ford & Company was formed. The product of the firm is spools and fancy wood turning. In 1890 this company was incorporated under the name of the Atwood Crawford Company, and 
Mr. Atwood was elected president, 
which position he held to the time of his death. 

He was a prominent member of the 
Central Falls Congregational church.

and for the past 22 years one of its deacons. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Young 
Mens' Christian Association, and a member of the building committee. 

As a member of the latter body, he manifested a deep interest in the build¬ 
ing of the association’s new home. 

Mr. Atwood purchased^ his place at 
Thonotosassa, Fla., a little over twenty years ago, and he and his wife had spent their winters there, with one or two exceptions, for over fifteen years. 
He took much interest in his Florida place and in all things pertaining to orange growing and the welfare of this society. 

He died at his home at Pawtucket, 
R. I., after a short illness, on November 
23rd, 1906. His wife had preceded him to the grave but a few weeks. He left no children. He was a man of sterling worth and character, and one that any community could ill afford to lose. 


HENRY GEORGE SARTORIOIS. 

Henry George Sartorious was born in Grundy County, Iowa, April 23rd, 
1875, and came to Seminole, Fla., with his parents in the fall of 1890. His 


early education was obtained in the public schools; his close application and wide reading gave him a fund of knowledge on a wide range of subjects. 

On August 6th, 1896, he married 
Miss Lenora Whittle. Mrs. Sartorious died a year later, leaving him with a little ten-day-old daughter, who very shortly afterward followed her mother to the grave. 

After this, Mr. Sartorious taught the public school at Seminole for three terms, then took a course in the Tampa 
Business College, following which he worked as an express messenger on the A. C. L., running between Tampa and Jacksonville. 

Feeling that his aged parents needed him at home, he gave up his position and returned to Seminole, taking direct charge of his father’s grove properties. 
In March, 1906, he was married to 
Mrs. Eva Drew Lewis. During the spring of 1906 his health began to fail, 
tuberculosis having developed. He went to New Mexico hoping to regain his health, but died at Las Vegas, 
March 30th, 1907. Mr. Sartorious was a noble, upright Christian, a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, an earnest worker in the Christian En¬ 
deavor Society, and active in temper¬ 
ance reform.

Secretary’s Report. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

At the beginning of the year, the pros¬ 
pects for a large menibership were not at all flattering, and when the report of our president’s death was confirmed, it seemed at the time that the shock to the Society would tend to dwarf it. But this calamity which has befallen us, seems tO' have awakened the interest of every one in the

Report of the Executive Committee. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen \ 

The Executive Committee met in Jack¬ 
sonville on July 29, 1906, tO' consider the publishing- of the report, and the appoint¬ 
ment of the Standing- Committee. This 
Committee instructed the Secretary to have the report published folio-wing the form of previous years. Owing to the lack of funds in the treasury, however, 
all half tones and the catalogue of fruits were omitted so as to bring* the expense of publication as low as possible. The 
Committee then adjourned. 

On March 4th, the Executive Com¬ 
mittee met in the office of the secretary in 
Jacksonville, with the following members present: Prof. P. H. Rolfs, Gainesville ; 
G. L. Taber, Glen St. Mary; E. S. Hub¬ 
bard, Eederal Point; O. W. Connor, 
Tangerine and E. O. Painter, Jackson¬ 
ville. It was mo-vecl and! seconded that the date of the next meeting be placed at May 
14th, i5ih, i6t'h and 17th, commencing on the evening of the 14th. 

It was also- moved and seconded! that 
Mr. J. D. Bell, of St. Petersburg, be ap¬ 
pointed Chairman of the Local Com¬ 
mittee with power tO' choose his associates and report the names and rates of the different hotels there. 


It was moved and seconded that the secretary write to- Mr. Jos. Richardson and secure the best rates possible for the 
Association. 

The following- committee on Necrology was appointed: G. L. Taber, Glen St. 
Mary, chairman; W. S. Hart, Hawks 
Park, and Dr. W. C. Richardson, Tampa. 

The secretary was authorized to get out advertising matter for business houses to send out. 

The meeting 'was adjourned. 

In St. Petersburg, May i6th, the Ex¬ 
ecutive Committee met with the following members present: Mr. E. S. Hubbard, 
chairman; G. L. Taber, P. H. Rolfs, E. 
O. Painter, and W. S. Hart. The minutes, o-f the previous meeting were read and approved. It was moved by Mr. 
Taber that the report and bills of the secretary be approved It was moved by 
Mr. Taber that the report of the Treas¬ 
urer, W. S. Hart, be accepted, as same was examined and found correct. Bills presented by the secretary were audited and ordered paid.

Report of Committee on Nursery Inspection. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Your committee to whom was referred the matter of nursery inspection find that the question is a very annoying one and that the only report we can make, much 


as we deplore it, is a rather negative one. 

We have had the subject un'dler careful consideration for two days and beg leave to report as follows: 

We find the inspection as now conduct- 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETV. 


eel is done by the entomologist attached to the State Experiment Station and is pure¬ 
ly a voluntary matter on his part, made at the request of, and to accommodate the nurserymen, andl. is not required as a regular duty or in any way provided for bv statute or other law. 

The present Experiment Station Ento¬ 
mologist states that he has only made eleven inspections during the past year, 
and that his methods and practice, in¬ 
cluding form O'f certificate, are and have been in accordance with the customs and rules established by his predecessors in ofiice. 

The fee charged for an inspection is 
$5.00, which is turned into the Experi¬ 
ment Station treasury. In adldition tO' his fee the Entomologist is paid his traveling' 
expenses by the parties requesting the in¬ 
spection, thus making him substantially their agent. It seems that the certificate of inspection is desired by the nursery¬ 
men to enable them to market their pro¬ 


131 

ducts in other states and foreign countries which require inspection, and is, there¬ 
fore, unfortunately so' far as home pur¬ 
chasers are concerned, more in the inter¬ 
est of the nurserymen than the planter. 

We feel that this is all wrong and that this society should take such action as may lead to a more extended, legally authorized, well regulated and beneficial system which will properly safeguard the purchaser rather than the seller, andl at the same time be reliable and equable for all. 

We therefore recommend that the 
Legislative and Executive Committees be and are hereby instructed to do all that may be in their power tO' secure the adop¬ 
tion by the legislature of requisite and specific laws for a proper, reliable and systematic method of inspection. 

Respect fully submi tted, 

Wm. C. Richardson, 

E. G. Sampson, 

H. B. Stevens. 


Statistics of Orange and Grapefruit Crops. 


Mr, President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

We, the undersigned committee, reconi- 
mend that the State Horticultural Society take in hand the plan suggested by Dr. P. 
Phillips, of Orlandlo, to- obtain statistics from all the orange growing counties of the state, the approximate number of box¬ 
es of oranges and grapefruit that will be raised during the year. This we feel will be a benefit to the grower as well as pack¬ 
er, and the country at large in order that the railroad companies, packing houses and box factories may make due preparations for the coming crop to han¬ 


dle it properly. It will also give the grower an additional advantage that he might know what price to put upon his fruit, and not be governed by haphazard and unreliable estimates that are being macile, which mean considerable loss to the 
State of Florida annually. We, there¬ 
fore, recommend the following plan : let the society appoint in each County not less than three members of this Society, 
or more, according to- size of county. 
These members should be carefully select¬ 
ed as being conservative and responsible gfrowers, and each one shall report to the 




132 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Association direct, how much fruit there will be in his own section and also in the county. These reports shall be carefully considered anoj published; only those that are considered the most conservative esti¬ 
mates, or prorated by the Secretary from each county as he may think will be the best. The beginning of the estimates shall not be earlier than the latter part of 
July, anal the publication of same shall not be later than the latter part of August, 
usless conditions of the growing crop may be required to do otherwise, and said re¬ 
ports shall be published in all the leading papers of our State and all the leading fruit journals of the country, giving the returns by counties. 

We further recommend that the Society shall request of the railroad companies 


carrying such fruit in the state, to fur¬ 
nish the Society tabulated report from each shipping point at the end of each season, that we may compare with the statistics and estimate made by the So¬ 
ciety. By doing so, we will readjily see at the end of each season whether or not the Society is doing efficient work. 

We further recommend that should such Railroad Companies refuse the So¬ 
ciety the above reports, that the Society should apply to the Railroad Commission of the State of Florida and compel them to do so.

Report of Committee on Legislation. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Your Committee on Legislation recom¬ 
mends that our state legislation now in session be urged tO' adopt the bill now be¬ 
fore it providing for the erection of a buiIdling for the experiment station, and the appropriation of funds for institute work. 

They also recommend that active steps be taken to bring our transportation facil¬ 
ities and rates for fruits and vegetables to the attention of the Interstate Com¬ 
merce Commission, with a view tO' their equitable and speedy adjustment, and that this society, individually and collectively. 


co-operate with any and all other organi¬ 
zations in the State in their efforts to se¬ 
cure these results. 

To carry'out above recommendations, 
we suggest that a permanent committee on legislation be appointed who shall be authorized to raise funds andl use all pro¬ 
per means in their power to accomplish these ends.

Resolution of Thanks. 


Whereas : The Florida Stafe Horti¬ 
cultural Society during its regular an¬ 
nual meeting, has been so royally enter¬ 
tained by the citizens and Board of Trade, 
it is fit and proper that we give some ex¬ 
pression of our appreciation of the courte¬ 
sies extended; therefore, be it 

Resolved, That we wish to thank the 
Tampa Bay Transportation Company for the use of their beautiful steamer, ^^The 
Favorite” for a free trip up the Manatee 
River, the ladies of the Town Improve¬ 
ment Association for the elegant lunch 


so generously served, and the citizens of 
St. Petersburg as a whole, for their uni¬ 
form courtesy anal hospitality during our stay, and also we wish to thank all of the transportation companies for the special rate given us.

Question Box. 


No. I —What is the best method to de¬ 
foliate ? 

Member—It is to take your thumb and finger and pull the leaves off. 

Mr. Hart—I would like to ask if you think it is practicable to defoliate, say, 
four square miles of trees in this way? 

Mr. Painter—A large per cent, of trees or shrubs can be defoliated by spraying with a strong solution of Bordeaux mix¬ 
ture. By a strong solution I mean one in which the copper has not all been neu¬ 
tralized by the lime. Thrip juice in the proportion of i to 500 will also defoliate trees and shrubbery. 

No. 2—Which is the best time to plant cabbage palms ; can they be transplanted any time in the year? 

Prof. Rolfs—I have seen them live when transplanted during any one of the 


twelve months. The best time to trans¬ 
plant is after a long diry spell and before that dry spell has been broken. 

Mr. Sperry—I contemplated setting out a large quantity of palms. Before doing so I talked with a man who had a large experience in planting palms, and he stat¬ 
ed the best time is during the wet season in the summer. 

Mr. Chilton—From my experience, I 
would say Februar}" or March. We have our wet times during those months. I 
have been informed that in digging them up it is well to trim off the small roots and plant them deeper than when they came out of the ground. Trim them close to the ground anal plant them, one foot deeper than they were originally. 

No. 3—I understand that this society frowns down any attempt made by ad- 







134

vertisers to call attention to their goods at its annual meetings. Would it not be well to let them exhibit in the hall, inas¬ 
much as some of the imiproved machinery would, if sho'wn by salesmen who under¬ 
stand it, prove interesting to us and we would have a chance to compare the va¬ 
rious styles in such a way as is not often our privilege. They might even grant a discount to us in return for the adlver- 
tising privilege. 

Mr. Hart—I think our constitution bars out anything of diis. kind. I do not see how we could grant the room to any¬ 
one to exhibit their goods even though it would be of benefit to us. They are at perfect liberty to exhibit their goods out¬ 
side the place of meeting. I do not think it would be policy to grant an^^one this privilege because it would unavoidably disturb our meetings. 

Mr. McCarty—I met two* or three men yesterday who are interested in irriga¬ 
tion. It seems to me that with as much space as we have here, it would be a goodl idea to allow them tO' exhibit where we could all get the benefit of it. This space could all be filled up with goods of the fertilizer men, machinery men, nursery men, etc., without detriment to the meet¬ 
ing. It seems to me it would be a great addition. 

Mr. Painter—I think the gentleman has a wrong idea of the proposition. He thinks that the society does not want an exhibit ol fruit trees, machinery, etc. We do want it, but we don't want it on the floor where the meeting* is held, By the floor, I do not mean literally speaking. I 
mean any particular wares shouhlj not r)e advertised during our sessions. Any per¬ 
son or firm can luring or send anything they wish to display or advertise to the 


place where the meeting is held and make any arrangements they choose outside the place O'f meeting. The society itself can¬ 
not take the position of endorsing or ad¬ 
vertising any comimodities. 

No. 4—Do hard wood ashes actually djestroy or check the mildew on the to¬ 
mato? 

Prof. Rolfs—It is not likely that they would have any effect. 

No. 5—Is the white fungus of the to¬ 
mato transmitted through the tomato seed? Is it continued from year to year through the same soil? 

Prof. Rolfs—It is transmitted from plant to plant. 


No. 6—At what stage of the tomato growth should the Bordeaux be applied to check or destroy the white fungus or mildew ? 

Prof. Rolfs—Three of these cpiestions appear to be asked by the same person. 
The tomatO' in Florida is rarely attacked by miildew and it is probable that the author of the'se questions had in mind the condition that is produced by a small spid¬ 
er mite. They should be fought by dry sulphur, sulphur spray or sulphur com¬ 
pound. They are easily killed and usual¬ 
ly disappear by the use of potassium sul¬ 
phite or soda sulphite. 


No. 7—Orange and grapefruit trees to plant; which are the best and most profit¬ 
able for planting with normal conditions, 
large, small or medium size trees, nil presumably healthy? 

i\Ir. Taber—Medium are the best. 

'Mr. Hubl)arcl—Conditions make a dif-

ference. I think the more vigorous grow¬ 
ing the tree is, the better it is. 

No. 8—What is the best month in the year to plant an orange tree ? 

Mr. Waite—November. 

Mr. McLain—I should say, December. 

Mr. Hart—May, if wet, is a pretty good month. 

Member—You would not approve of 
May unless the rainy season had started in, would you ? 

Mr. Hart—In my part of the country, 
it is sure to start about that time. 


No'. 9—I would like to know if the So¬ 
ciety approves of cutting the trees back at the time of setting out ? 

Mr. Hampton—Cut them back every time. And about that planting of trees; I 
would prefer to plant them in the month of December to any other month in the year. Some say November. Don’t you think that is a little too soon? They are likely to start to growing and the January or February cold! snap will take them in. 
If you plant them in December they are not so apt to* start to grow. 

No. 10—I would like to ask whether it is best to use the Stringfellow method for planting on low ground? 

Mr. Hart—I have not had experience in that, but if the ground is low, you can¬ 
not push the roots down far. They have to grow on the surface. If there is not room above permanent water line for tlie tap root, little can be made in that direc¬ 
tion. I would prefer fairly high land for planting orange trees. 

Mr. Taber—In relation to that Striiu>-- 

o 

fellow method, I want to say that 1 don't think that the Stringfellow method is a 


good habit to get into unless one qualifies every assertion that he makes. If you take a great big tree like Mr. Hubbard would recommendl planting, you can’t suc¬ 
cessfully treat it that way. I have set out thousands of little nursery trees and taken off all the fibrous roots. It is. the proper way to plant them. Line up a row, open it with a spade and stick in nothing but little sticks. But you can’t do that with a five or six year old tree. 

Member—I think the success of a new¬ 
ly set tree depends as much on the weather following the time of setting, as the meth¬ 
od of setting. As to the Stringfellow method, I would say do not prune the roots quite so close. 

Mr. Hume—I have seen a few attempts at setting trees by the Stringfellow meth¬ 
od which were entirely successful. I have seen some that were a dismal failure. It requires careful study of the conditions, of the soil, of the weather and of the kind of tree you are planting before you de¬ 
termine whether you are going to plant by the Stringfellow method. He makes absolutely no exception tO’ the kind, char¬ 
acter, or size of the tree, and I think any¬ 
one who fohows him implicitly is going to get into pretty deep water 

Mr. Hoard—Three years ago, I moved 
600 bearing trees without losing a single tree. Some of them had had a ]);vx of oranges the vear before, andl I saved all the roots I could get. 

Mr. Hart—I am not advocating the 
Stringfellow method in all cases, or any¬ 
thing of the kind. I l)rought the sul)ject up to- see what experience others had liad. 
1 am interested in it. All my earb' ex- 
])erience was much in that line in the planting of trees. Wdien I came tli.e east coast all of our groA'es were set out

from big, wild trees that we got from the hammiocks. Some of them had no tap root and where they did, we dug down and cut them off short. We cut the large trunks off not over a foot high and cut the roots off close up so that a tree with a six inch trunk wouldl gO' in a hole eighteen inches to two feet across, and those trees made strong, healthy and rapid growth and were in profitable bearing in three years. The nursery trees were budded when set, but these were allowed to sprout and thien buds were inserted in these sprouts after the trees were set in grove form. 

I would tell you that it is best to set out big trees. “Big” may mean six or sixty years old. You can get a fine bear¬ 
ing tree very quickly if you put such out when the conditions are favorable, While small trees suffer seriously from every adverse conolition and it may take several years to get them tO’ a fair, bearing con¬ 
dition. 

Mr. Skinner—During the discussion, 
Mr. Mason sat alongside of me, and he says there is no question but that cutting off the roots will make them grow deeper. 

Mr. Taber—I do not think you can ap¬ 
ply the same ruling to trees of all sizes. 
Mr. Hart mentions citrus trees as being transplanted at any sjze, but there are few other trees that can be treated like a cit¬ 
rus tree, and live. I claim that a citrus root is one of the hardest things in the world to kill. Take a peach or pecan tree, 
for instance. Regarclless of the age or size of the tree, regardless of the season it is put out—Stringfellow just makes the sweeping assertion that it should be close¬ 
ly root pruned, which I do not believe is always proper or advantageous; and that is the reason why I say that one should 


be careful to designate What he is talking about. If you put out trees at the begin¬ 
ning of the dormant season, you can suc¬ 
cessfully transplant a larger tree and you can prune the roots harder than you can at the time when growth should com¬ 
mence. He makes no exceptions at all. 

Mr. Hollingsworth—Mr. Hart, were not those trees you spoke of transplanted on very damp soil ? 

Mr. Hart—They were transplanted in any kind of soil. In some places it was eleven feet to water, and in others the ground was cowered with water a good deal of the time. 


No. ii-^Can anyone advise concern¬ 
ing the soap tree, how it is planted and 
What distance apart? Why does not the 
California Pepper tree fruit here? 

Mr. Stevens—I have seen a soap tree growing wild around Orange Lake. That is the only place I have ever seen one in 
Florida. 

Mr. Painter—The soap berry tree has been grown near Tallahassee for years. 

No. 12—I would like to ask why the olive tree grows finely here, but does not bear any crop? 

Prof. Rolfs— That is a question that is as yet unsolved. 

Mr. Wakelin—We have an olive tree on our place. It bloomed very heavily and when I left home for the North it had small green olives. When I came back they had all fallen off, except a fev/ dried up specimens. This year it has had no bloom. 

Mr. Hampton—^The olive tree has been talked over a long while, and some seem to think they won’t bear, and some con-

tend that they will. I have more or less olives every year. I believe I could raise plenty of olives, but whether I could raise enoug^h to pay commercially or not I do not know, but I have plenty for my home consumption. 

Prof. Rolfs—There is a place near San¬ 
ford and one just east of Malabar and 
Drayton Island, I think, where they fruit quite heavily. I think that the probability of making it a commercial success is a small one. 

Member—Does Mr. Hampton use any¬ 
thing special in the way of fertilizer? 

Mr. Hampton—No, I don’t use any¬ 
thing special. 

Member—Last year I gave my olives slacked lime, and I think I am on the right track to getting enougb olives for our¬ 
selves. 

Mr. Hart—This matter has been pretty carefully g*one over by Mr. Rooks, one of our members, who is much interested in 


anything of the kind. I think the general opinion is that there is but one variety of olives that fruit well in Florida. I have seen some with trunks nearly two *feet through, but they never bore what you might call a full crop. I think there is one variety that will prodluce a fairly good crop, but do not remember what it is. 

Member—I live close to Mr. Rooks and see his olives, but I have never seen any¬ 
thing like a full crop. 

Mr. Taber—I have fruited some four or five different varieties of olives, includ¬ 
ing which are the Queen, and they do not even get to maturity, but drop before they mature. I have gotten olives from several 
Cijifferent varieties, but would not recom¬ 
mend them for anything more than home use. 

Mr. Hampton—I never had any trouble with the fruit dropping. They stayed pretty well to maturity.

CATALOGUE OF FRUITS. 


ADOPTED BY THE SOC3ETY AT THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL 

MEETING. 


In making a complete Catalogue of the Fruits of Florida, indicating intel¬ 
ligibly, in summarized and tabular form, the relative value of varieties for different sections, the wide-stretching territory, diversity of soil and climate, and the limited range of each of the numerous fruits, render it essential that the State be divided, so that regions allied throughout in their adaptability to fruits may be designated and referred to. 

To this end, four districts have been formed, as described below. Geographi¬ 
cal lines cannot be made to indicate pomological conditions with accuracy. More than approximate correctness could not be expected from an arbitrary division of this kind, especially where local conditions vary so greatly as in Florida. Work¬ 
ing by general averages, some sections are unavoidably left in the wrong districts, 
judging by the standard of local conditions. The divisions, however, will be found to answer this purpose better, than any that could be made without further sub¬ 
divisions, which would be impracticable. 

WESTERN NORTH ELORIDA—That part of the State west of the Au- 
cilla river. 

EASTERN NORTH ELORIDA—That part of the State between the Au- 
cilla river and a straight line drawn across the State from the mouth of the St. 
Johns river to Cedar Keys. 

CENTRAL ELORIDA—That part of the State between the line above re¬ 
ferred to and the counties constituting South Florida. 

SOUTH FLORIDA—The counties of Brevard, Dade, Monroe, Lee, DeSoto and Manatee.

CITRUS FRUITS. 

SWEET ORANGES —Citrus aurantium. 


Note. —The development of orange culture in this State has given rise to a multiplicity of varieties, many of which, while meritorious, have no distinctive qualities, or superiority as compared with others. It has been deemed advisable to omit the names of many varieties which have disappeared from cultivation. The list, however, is still large. 

The names in heavy type are designed to constitute a complete list for the State, em¬ 
bracing varieties of the- highest excellence in all the desired characteristics of season, quality, 
distinctiveness, productiveness, etc. The names in light type are those whose characteristics are possessed in an equal or superior degree by other varieties which appear in heavy type. 
Some varieties in light type equal others in heavy type having the same characteristics but where there is a difference it is in favor of the varieties in heavy type. In cases of equal excellence, the best known has the preference. So that the varieties in heavy type, as a whole, and without disparagement to other excellent sorts, may be said to embrace the leading kinds for general culture. 

New, or comparatively unknown varieties also appear in light type; but for this distinction see “Adaptability” column. 


Note. —In referring to the time of ripening in the column headed “Season,”’ “very early” applies to varieties marketed in September and October; “early,” to October and No¬ 
vember varieties; “early medium,” November and December; “medium,” December, Janu¬ 
ary and February; “late medium,” February and March; “late,” March and April; “very late.” April, Ma}^ and later. 


Note. —The region of orange production proper extends southward from Central 
Florida, overlapping the upper portion of Southern .Florida. Therefore, under “Adapta¬ 
bility” below the varieties have been starred for “Southern Florida;” here, however, the starring applies more particularly to the upper portion of the district.

CATALOGUE OF FRUITS. 


Of Sweet Oranges, the leading fruit crop of the State, and great staple of the Cen¬ 
tral region, over five million boxes were produced in the season of 1894-95. 

The Navel Varieties are much esteemed on account of the delicate texture and su¬ 
perior quality of their fruit. They are usually shy bearers, although experience indicates that they are much more prolific upon ‘‘rough” lemon and trifoliata stocks than, as generally grown, upon orange stocks. 

The Blood Varieties are sweet, and therefore marketable early in season, as indicated by the abbreviations in the “Season” column. At this time their distinctive character is not apparent, and they have little advantage in market over other early sorts. As the season advances, their ruby tints develop, until quite apparent on the exterior, and their quality continues to improve until, at full ripeness, they are equaled by few and surpassed by none. In locations sufficiently exempt from frost to permit their being held on the trees until they reach perfection, they bring high prices and are exceptionally profitable. 

Other Varieties.—Excluding the Navels, Bloods and Satsuma, noted above, and with¬ 
out disparagement to other sorts of equal merit, the following are suggested as a desirable list for general planting, arranged in order of succession : * Very Early, Boone, Sweet 
Seville; Early, Enterprise Seedless, Parson Brown; Early Medium, Nonpareil, Centennial ; 
Medium, Pineapple, Jaffa, Homosassa; Late Medium, Majorca, Du Roi ; Late, Bessie, 
Maltese Oval; Very Late, Hart. 

Varieties distinctly marked in their exterior appearance, like the Navels, Bloods, 
Du Roi, etc., are, other things being equal, most desirable for market.

Remarks—No. i, a favorite in the New Orleans market; No. 2. the favorite of the group. The 
Satsuma is valued on account of its hardiness, which is increased by being budded on the entirely hardy C. trifoliata. It is much planted in sections north of the usual range of oranges.

The Pomelo. —Growing the Pomelo for market is a development of the past fifteen or twenty years; but large quantities of this fruit are now shipped from the State and its culture is rapidly extending. It has proved popular in the general market and its culture is very profitable. Its range of adaptability is about the same as that of the orange. Most of the older trees were planted before named varieties were introduced. The above list comprises the leading varieties now generally planted.

The Lemon.—Lemon growing in Florida is an industry of some importance, the crop of 1894 being estimated at 150,000 boxes. The tree stands less cold than the orange, and planting is confined to lower latitudes and locations of comparative frost exemption. The foregoing varieties are highly esteemed and generally planted.

Remarks.—The Peach is successfully grown in localities throughout the greater part of the State, and in some districts is extensively produced for shipment to Northern mar¬ 
kets, As a rule, for this purpose, only those varieties are grown which are marked “early” 
and “very early” in the above tabde, and which come in before the general crop farther north. To this there are some exceptions, notably in Western North Florida, where some mid-season varieties, like Elberta, are successfully grown for shipment. 

While the list of peaches grown in theState embraces many varieties, the various sections, covering a wide range of latitude and longitude, differ to such an extent in soil, 
climate and conditions of local environment, that the varieties adapted to a particular region are comparatively limited in number. A first and vital essential to successful peach produc¬ 
tion is the adaptability of variety to locality; in general this is true of peaches to a greater extent than other fruits, and especially so in Florida. 

No. 21 is of peculiar shape, being elongated, with deep suture, and sharp recurved point. It is very sweet as its name “Honey” indicates: This variety comes from China and is the progenitor of a race of peaches well suited to the central and northern sections of the State. No. 38, tlje Peen-to, is also possessed of marked individual characteristics; its shape being flat like a tomato, and unless grown with fertilizers rich in prosphoric acid and potash is apt to be possessed of a bitter almond or noyau flavor. It_comes from South 
China or Java and the varieties that have originated from it have given us a sub-tropical race of peaches well adapted to Southern and Central Florida. It is safe to say that nine- 
tenths of the commercial peach culture of peninsular Florida is confined to the varieties that have been originated from the above two introductions from the Orient. It should be mentioned, however, that neither the varieties that have originated from the Honey or from the Peen-to retain to such marked extent the shape of the parent. Those that have originated from the Honey show a tendency to the recurved point but in a less marked de¬ 
gree. Those that have orignated from the Peen-to are of regular peach shape.

Remarks. —2, 9, ii, almost free from fungous diseases; i, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, subject to fun¬ 
gous diseases in wet seasons; 7, 12, 14, subject to fungous diseases; 7, stars apply especially to the East Coast. r - 

Grapes. —In many locations throughout the State varieties (as indicated by the star¬ 
ring above) succeed well, and are grown for shipment to Northern markets as well as for local consumption and the manufacture of wine. i 

For Market. —Delaware, Niagara, and Ives (only) have proved a success as shipping grapes for distant markets (when properly packed). Diamond, on account of its compact¬ 
ness and tendency to crack, does not stand long shipment. , i 

For Red Wine. —-Cynthiana, Norton and Ives are the red-wine grapes of Florida, as they are the red-wine grapes of the United States. Especially is this true of the first two named; their juice is dark and rich in saccharine matter, and the wine made from these two grapes is said to possess great medicinal properties, owing to its large percentage of tannin. 

For White Wine. —Elvira, Delaware and Niagara are, among the varieties above named, the best grapes for white wine— especially dry wine. It is from Elvira that the famous San Luis Sauternes are made, which have established the reputation of Florida wines. Delaware is better adapted to the manufacture of sweet wine, and from Niagara a good dry wine can be made—much superior to the article made from Northern grown 
Niagaras, our Florida Niagaras being almost entirelv free from that foxy taste so promi¬

European Varieties (V. vinifera.) —The U. S. Department of Agriculture, Division of 
Pomology, has established an experimental vineyard of European varieties, about 550 vines of 175 varieties at Earleton, under the charge of Baron H. von Luttichau. They are all grafted on V. riparia and V. rupestris, are now in their fifth year and so far are remarkably successful.

The Kaki succeeds well throughout the State, and is generally, though not extensive¬ 
ly, grown. For market this delicious fruit has the merit of shipping well and keeping long. 
While new markets are often reluctant to take hold of it, wherever known it sells well. 

Nomenclature.—-While there has been much confusion in regard to the names of varieties, the above kinds are now as well known as the leading varieties of other fruit; 
they embrace the most valuable kinds, and the names as given are correctly applied. 

Characteristics.—Some of the varieties have dark flesh, others light flesh, still others a mixture of the two. The light and dark flesh differ radically in texture and consistency as well as appearance, and when found in the same fruit are never blended, but always dis¬ 
tinct. The dark flesh is never astringent; the light flesh is astringent until it softens. The dark-fleshed fruit is crisp and meaty, like an apple, and is edible before it matures. Some of the entirely dark-fleshed kinds improve as they soften, like Hyakume and Yeddoichi; 
others are best when still hard, like Zengi and Tabers No, 129. As they are good to eat before they are ripe, it is not so important that the dark-fleshed kinds be allowed to reach a certain stage before being offered to consumers unfamiliar with the fruit. The light-fleshed kinds, and those with mixed light and dark flesh, are very delicious when they reach the custard-like consistency of full ripeness. In some the stringency disappears as the fruit be¬ 
gins to soften, as the Yemon, and in a less degree with Okame and Tanenashi; in others it persists until the fruit is full ripe, as with Tsuru. The light-fleshed kinds should not be offered to consumers unacquainted with the fruit until in condition to be eaten. A person who has attempted to eat one of them when green and “puckery” will not be quick to repeat the experiment. Seeds accompany the dark flesh. The light-fleshed kinds are seed¬ 
less. The kind with mixed flesh have seeds in proportion to the quantity of dark flesh, 
Hyakume, Zengi and Hachiya are usually overspread at the blossom end with penciling or net-work of dark lines, and this sometimes occurs in other kinds. 

Varieties.—Tanenashi, Okame, Yemon and Yeddoichi excel in quality, perhaps in the order named. Okame (on account of the difficulty of getting the fruits all in the same stage of ripeness) and Hachiya are not as good shippers as the others; the latter is valued for its immense size and showiness. Okame, on account of its long season, exquisite beauty, and superior quality, is the best for home use and local market. Zengi and Tabers No. 129 are valued for their earliness, as are Tsuru and Costata for their lateness. Costata is very dis¬ 
tinct and handsome in both tree and fruit. Hyakume is most generally grown of the dark- 
fleshed kinds. Tanenashi is, perhaps, most highly esteemed in the market. 

Stock:—The Kaki should be grafted on the native persimmon, on which it is much more satisfactory than upon its own imported stocks.

Apples and Apricots —Are not recommended for general culture, although the varie¬ 
ties named give fair results in the home orchard in the regions indicated. 

The Fig—'A most delicious fruit for the table and culinary use, thrives everywhere. 
It is not grown for shipment, except when canned or preserved, in which form it finds a ready market at high prices, but is one of the most valuable and generally grown home- 
use-and-local-market fruits. All the varieties named are desirable. 

Mulberries —Are well adapted to all sections. They are largely grown for swine, 
poultry, and as a toll for birds; and. by some, the more acid kinds arc esteemed for table use. 

The Pomegranate— An agreeable fruit, desirable for occasional use, and especially valuable as an ornamental shrub or tree, is not generally grown for market, but most plan¬ 
tations have a few trees. There are several new choice varieties being tried.

Dewberries, also Blackberries in some varieties succeed admirably in the regions indi¬ 
cated, but are not cultivated to any considerable extent, owing to the abundance of native, 
wild berries. The Manatee Dewberry, and the Northey, presumably a hybrid, have proved satisfactory in many localities. 

Loquats —Are grown in a small way for home consumption. They are a desirable fruit for table, as well as culinary use. At present the Loquat is propagated largely from seed, and the fruit varies greatly in size and quality. A number of varieties have been in¬ 
troduced from California and are being tested. 

Olives. —Many trees have been planted, and there are some old groves. The varieties, 
of which there are many, are not sufficiently known in this State to catalogue.

tion, though three-fourths of the acreage is unprotected and escapes in ordinary winters without material damage from cold. In South Central Florida they require artificial heat to protect them from frost during the winter. Further North they cannot be successfully grown except under glass. 

The Spanish, Porto Rico, and Cayenne are grown most extensively for market. The 
Egyptian Queen, and Pernambuco are grown for market less extensively. These remarks apply to the East Coast. 

Ill the numerous and extensive shedded pineries of Orange County and the West 
Coast, which are cultivated on an intensive system, the Cayenne is planted almost exclu¬ 
sively.

Remarks—On varieties as numbered above. Nos. i, 2 and 4, general market; 3, 5 and 
7, home use. 

Commercial Banana Culture is confined to the extreme lower portion of the penin¬ 
sula. 

Varieties.-—The Baracoa is the ordinary Red Banana of commerce. The Cavendish 
(M. Cavendishii) is a dwarf species, also known as “Dwarf,” “Dwarf Jamaica,” “Chinese.” 
Except the Orinoco, Hart’s Choice has a more northern range than the other sorts. The 
Orinoco matures further north than any other variety, it is an ordinary plantain (M. para- 
disaica sapientum) as distinguished from the Banana or Sweet Plantain (of which Baracoa and Golden are varieties); when allowed to ripen on the plant, it is of good quality, and desirable for home use, in sections too far north for other kinds.

The Guava is extensively grown in Central and Southern Florida for home use, local market, and the manufacture of jelly. It is a most delicious fruit for dessert, as well as cooking and preserving. There are numerous varieties, as yet unclassified. The hardy kinds, Cattley and Chinese, have about the same range as oranges. 


MANGOES —Mangifera Indica. 


(See Explanation of Abbreviations on page iii.) 



Remarks. —A large number of seedling mangoes are grown. Many of these are re¬ 
ferred to as No. II, and, while they have a group resemblance to one another, still they are dis¬ 
tinct in varietal characteristics. A considerable number of named varieties are now being tested. Among these may be mentioned, Alfonse, Soondershaw, and Gordon.

Nuts.—The pecan has long been grown in the State in a small way; it flourishes in many localities and its culture is profitable. In addition to the four varieties listed, other good varieties as yet only of local repute, will undoubtedly become prominent in the near future. The Japan chestnut, of comparatively recent introduction, has proved fairly well adapted, but hardly worthy of extensive commercial culture. The Japan walnuL of still more recent introduction, bears well and makes a remarkably handsome tree, but is not up to the standard of the best English walnuts in quality. 

Extensive Cocoanut plantations are to be found on the southern coast. Little or no attention has been paid to varieties.

Remarks.—Since 1895 strawberry culture has been largely extended, especially on the 
Western slope of the peninsula. The Newnan has been allowed to degenerate and the fruit is now rather small for shipment. The Hoffman does better on clay than on sandy lands and needs high fertilizing. The Cloud is vigorous in North Florida and stands drouth well; 
prolific early in the season. Not liked so well in South Florida. Rising is very vigorous and prolific, a firm berry and an excellent shipper. Its foliage, however, grows rather open and it does not protect its fruit well against a frost. The Phenomenal seems to be al¬ 
most identical with the Hoffman in physical characteristics, but it has a longer season in 
South Florida. In Bradford county Aroma and Middleton’s Early have been tested by in¬ 
dividuals and reported on favorably. Glen Mary, Hood River, Dollar, Warfield, Star, 
Early, Splendid, Pride of Cumberland and Gandy have been tested and condemned. Klon¬ 
dike is a recent introduction of great promise, and has been given a place in the list of de¬ 
sirable varieties.
