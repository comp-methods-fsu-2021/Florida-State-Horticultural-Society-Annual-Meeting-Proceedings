 Tractors for Grove Cultivation@@    Frazier Rogers@@ Gainesville@@   Since the standard by which American farming is measured is production per man and not yields per acre, the value of improved farm machinery per farm can be taken as an indication of not only the efficiency of the farmer but also his actual labor income. Numerous farm surveys have brought this fact to our attention. Don’t misunderstand me, for I do not mean to convey the idea that the way to make a success with citrus is to purchase every new-fangled machine that comes on the market, but I do say that your chance for making a profit on citrus is dependent to a great extent on the use of machinery. The wheat farmer of today using modern methods and machinery can grow as much wheat in three months as the old Roman farmer could grow using his methods and working io hours per day six days a week for all of his three score and ten years.  In 1850 it took four-fifths of the pop¬ ulation of the United States to feed them¬ selves and the other fifth. Now thirty per cent of our population are feeding themselves and the other seventy per cent. The yield per acre has increased only a very little during this period, and we are far behind the Japanese in this re¬ spect. Their average wheat yield was 21 bushels in 1920, while our yield was 13.8 bushels for the same year. Does that mean that we should turn from our meth¬   ods of agriculture and go to those of Japan? Far from it, for in Japan the bushel is what counts while in America the man is the important factor. The farm tractor is one of the many improved farm machines that has enabled a man to handle more acres. It is rapidly becoming one of the essential machines of our farms. Already the value of the tractors produced yearly has exceeded that of all other farm machinery. In 1920 the value of all machinery produced, including the tractor, was 535 millions of dollars; of this sum 270 millions of dollars represents the tractors produced.  The subject as given me by the chair¬ man of our committee was the utilization of the farm tractor in the cultivation of citrus groves. While I can never think that the horse can be entirely replaced on the general farms of the country by me¬ chanical power, I am confident that it can replace the horse to a great extent on the citrus groves in this State. There are a number of reasons why the tractor could be very profitably used by our citrus growers; the first of which is the rate at which the tractor works. The average number of acres cultivated by a tractor in a io-hour day was shown to be 20 acres. This data comes from men who are actu¬ ally operating tractors in groves. The ad¬ vantage then in being able to cultivate at      the proper time in order to conserve the moisture in the soil can be readily seen. Even though your tractor is not in use all of the time it is better to have it idle part of the time than for the trees to suffer on account of the lack of water or injury by weeds.  The second reason is a very important one in Florida, viz., the inability of horses to do their maximum work during the hot summer days. Doubtless most of you are familiar with this condition. If a careless driver is handling the team you have to keep constant watch on him to see that he does not over-heat your team. I do not mean to infer that we are exempt from careless drivers of tractors, for they furnish us a source of constant worry. However, if you see that your machine has plenty of oil and water in the morning and at noon, there is little else to fear from a careless driver. This, too, is the period of the year when we want most out of our teams. In the hot days of March, April, May and June, the evaporation is enormous unless we cultivate often, and these are the months in which our teams are not capable of doing the most work. The tractor does not take exception to the hot days. In fact it operates better. Your fuel evaporates more readily in June than in December.  LIFE  One question in which all tractor users or prospective tractor owners are inter¬ ested is in the life of their machines under grove conditions. How many years will it last? This will depend upon a number of things. We can increase or decrease the number of years of service by the way   in which the machine is handled. The figures that I shall give you represent only average conditions and not maximum possibilities. Circular 12 of the Exten¬ sion Division shows the average life of a tractor under grove conditions to be ap¬ proximately four years. This doubtless seems to be a very short period when com¬ pared with the life of a tractor in other sections of the United States, but we must not lose sight of the fact that these tract¬ ors were in use on an average of 123 days per year, more than twice the number of days used in the corn belt. Doubtless it would be better to give the number of days of work to be expected from a tractor rather than lasting so many years.  Virtually all of our grove cultivation is done with harrows, either the cut-away disc or the acme. When the cut-away penetrates to too great a depth, wooden spools have been used between disc to pre¬ vent this. Using either the disc or acme the average number of acres harrowed was shown by data received from tractor users to be 20 acres in a io-hour day. This was for an eight-sixteen h. p. tractor, the size of machine most commonly used for grove work. Quite a few of the grove owners reported having done away with all horses on their farms and using tract¬ ors exclusively and have gotten splendid results. The fuel consumption as well as the amount of lubricating oil used per acre in cultivating would of course be consid¬ erably less than that required to plow an acre. According to the data obtained from growers this would amount to about of the fuel and oil required to plow an acre, which would be from y 2 to           of a gallon gasoline and from l / 2 to I pint of cylinder oil.

REPAIRS  The yearly repair charges are very dif¬ ficult to obtain but according to Circular 12 of the Extension Division they would be approximately one-twentieth of the ini¬ tial cost of the tractor the first year, one- twelfth of the initial cost the second year and one-eighth of the initial cost the third year.  SELECTION  The conditions under which farm ma¬ chinery must operate in Florida are un¬ doubtedly the most adverse of any state in the Union. Downpours of dust and sand always accompany their operation in the citrus grove, due to the sandy nature of our soils. Therefore in order to reduce the wear to a minimum, all of the work¬ ing parts of a tractor must be encased or the life of your tractor is very short. The entire transmission system must be pro¬ tected, steering joints, etc., should be sup¬   plied with large grease cups that feed freely. As long as grease works out of the bearings sand does not get into them. A tractor must be provided with an effi¬ cient air filter. If you allow air filled with grit to be drawn into the cylinders of your motor, it forms with cylinder oil a splendid grinding compound that soon cuts away the cylinder walls and you be¬ gin to have trouble. The moist air filters seem to be somewhat more efficient than other types in removing the dust and sand from the air. However, these should be looked after very carefully and cleaned real often, especially if it is very dry.  The slippage of the wheels of a tractor that is bound to occur in our sandy soils is much more destructive than are heavy loads, and especially is this true of the bolted and riveted framed tractors. The unit frame tractor seems to have a decided advantage in this respect for the gears and other parts are in a fixed relationship to each other. The wide wheels are a ne¬ cessity in order to give traction. A pro¬ tected radiator is something that should receive attention from the manufacturers, for the circulation of air is very easily in¬ terrupted by leaves, etc., especially if you happen to be working in rank vegetation. This can be done by the operator by using a heavy ^4-inch mesh wire, mounted about 5 inches in front of the radiator, which will catch the leaves and the currents of air to the radiator are not cut off.  There is much more to be said on the question of tractor selection for grove cul¬ ture, but in a paper of this kind I have made an attempt to give only a few of the most important.            Types of Implements Used in Cultivation of Groves, Frequency of Cultiva¬ tion and Cost -   L. H. Kramer, Lake Wales   A. The types of implements common¬ ly used in cultivating citrus groves may be listed as follows:  1. Plows—  Walking: Turning.  Tractor: Disc.  2. Harrows and Cultivators—  Disc (Tractor) : Eight-foot tan¬ dem, i o-foot doubles and sin¬ gles, 12-foot single.  Acmes: Three-foot single (tree row work), 4-foot single (tree row work), 6 and 8-foot 2-horse (tree row work), 12-foot tract¬ or (middles), 16-foot tractor (middles).  Planet Jr.: Five and 7-tooth us¬ ing three sweeps (optional) (tree row work and grass patches).  Spring Tooth: Ten-foot tractor harrow, use in grassy middles in young grove where plowing would not be done during cer¬ tain seasons; careful operator required to keep from injuring roots.   B. The frequency of cultivation is as follows:  1. Plowing—Once yearly, probably in fall or early winter.  2. Discing — Immediately following plowing or before if extremely heavy cover crop stands on ground. Ordinary cover crop in middles can be cut up and fairly well mixed with soil by using disc two ways; an exceptionally heavy cover crop, three ways. Use of acme after disc in fall work depends on condition of land. In case of heavy winter growth a light discing may be necessary in spring before acme will do work satisfactorily. Where trees are larger, requiring fertilizer to be spread some distance from them, the disc is probably best implement for working in. This applies especially to spring ap¬ plication where grass and weeds may be heavy.  3. Harrowing—As a leveling opera¬ tion the frequency and amount of work depends on condition of ground.  As a part of the active cultivating pro¬ gram, it depends and varies:  (a) Upon moisture content of soil.  (b) Presence of grass and weeds.   IS            Where moisture is present in generous amount, no set time can be given for go¬ ing over grove; but where maintenance of a dust mulch to preserve moisture is prac¬ ticed, we find that trees in their first and second years should be gone over on an average of once every ten days or two weeks under ordinary conditions; but in case of prolonged drought, they should be harrowed every five to seven days. This applies to older and bearing trees as well.  We believe many growers and caretak¬ ers fail to acme bearing groves as often as they should, apparently believing that the size of trees with their larger and more penetrating root system make them practi¬ cally immune to drought; but if they would stop to consider the immense amount of water required to support old bearing trees, they would readily appre¬ ciate the dependency of such trees upon the protection of a dust mulch. Where the Planet Jr. or similar cultivating harrows are used, the frequency of their use will ordinarily depend upon growth of grass and weeds, but where they are used in place of acme harrows, the frequency of operation should be approximately the same.  C. The cost of cultivation based upon our own experience is as follows:  i. Plowing.—We find that plowing can be done as cheaply by mules as by tractors (where the tractor does not pull over three or four bottoms), but the speed of operation gained by using tractors make their use very desirable and neces¬ sary in large acreages. This is especially true where only enough stock is kept to work the tree rows, and tractors are de¬   pended upon to do all other work. Plow¬ ing or breaking rough land with tractors will cost approximately $1.85 per acre, and the plowing of cultivated groves only about $1.38 per acre.  Cost of plowing grove is arrived at by using 4-bottom plow cutting 40 inches, making three rounds to the middle in 25- foot middle, cutting a total of 240 inches out of 300 inches, which is width of mid¬ dle from tree to tree. This leaves 5 feet of unplowed ground, or a strip of 2j4 feet on either side of tree, at a cost of $1.18 per acre and figuring depreciation at 20 cents, and an average of 9 acres per day makes a total cost of $1.38 per acre. Cost will decrease with increase in size of trees and will cut down cost in proportion to number of rounds per middle. This es¬ timate is made on a year-old grove. At the rate of $1.38 per acre for 3 rounds, or 6 trips of a 40-inch plow, the cost per round would be 46 cents per acre, and the cost per trip 23 cents per acre. Taking these figures you can arrive at cost on any age of grove, depending on width of mid¬ dle you have to plow. A grove of 8 years old, having a space of 10 feet in the mid¬ dles to be plowed, could be plowed one way at 69 cents per acre. The probable minimum cost per acre, plowing one time around tree row, using $5.00 per day op¬ erator on tractor, is 27 cents per acre; two times around tree row, 54 cents; solid middles 81 cents. Using mules the cost for solid plowing rough land runs approx¬ imately $2.25 per acre.  2. Discing.—The cost per acre of double discing with tractors, in young groves, using 8-inch discs, should run       about 38 cents per acre, running three times in 30-foot middles, based on a period of five weeks or more of steady work and using a $5.00 per day tractor operator. Running two times in 25-foot middles should be 32 to 34 cents per acre, allowing 5 cents per acre per day for de¬ preciation. The cost for discing diagon¬ ally with io-foot singles should run ap¬ proximately 26 cents per acre, while the cost per acre using 12-foot singles is ap¬ proximately 28 cents per acre, running two times in 30-foot middle.  The acreage of grove covered will vary with direction of operation, 1. e., east, west, north and south, or on one or two of the diagonal directions; and naturally the cost will vary accordingly. A very important factor in cost of discing, or in fact, any tractor work, is the length of rows which cause much time in turning, which will increase the cost from one to several cents per acre, depending on length of same.  3. Harrowing.—The cost per acre using 4-foot walking acme doing tree row work depends on whether you run straight down both sides of row or zig¬ zag. The cost of straight harrowing should be around 9 cents per acre, while the cost of zig-zag should be about 12 cents per acre. The cost of using 6-foot two-horse harrows zig-zag should be about 18 cents per acre, while straight work will be a few cents less. Tractors pulling 12-foot acme harrows (which act¬ ually stir 13feet of dirt) should turn out work at the average cost of 26 cents per acre, running straight and harrowing the entire surface of the ground; while   runnning diagonally down rows the cost should not exceed 20 cents per acre. Pull¬ ing the 16-foot acme (which stirs 17/4 feet) one time per middle, in 25-foot mid¬ dles, tractors should turn out work at 23 cents per acre.  The method of cost accounting used at Mammoth Grove to arrive at the above, given on work of 16-foot acme is as fol¬ lows: (See Reports 1 to 8.)  Reports 1 to 6.—Sheets for one week on tractor pulling 17-foot acme—Driver $5.00 per day.  Report 7.—Minimum cost per acre on 85-acre day.  Report 8.—Maximum probable cost during week showing one-half day lay-up, break-down and parts used.  report 1  Tractor No. 6 Report.—Operator, Jones, Otto; date, March 20, 1922; gas consumed, 16 gallons; oil consumed, 4 quarts; amount acreage, 45 ; kind of work, acme harrow, middles, 16-foot implement; amount operating time, 8 hours; location of work, Section 30—hilly.

 Grove Factors Influencing Citrus Fruit Quality@@   George V. Leonard@@ Hastings@@   Upon receiving notice from Secretary Floyd that I had been appointed to serve on a committee representing citrus fruit quality at this meeting, I was at first at a loss to know what was expected of me, and, having an opportunity to talk this over with Mr. Floyd, I learned that we were expected to come before you, this body of citrus fruit growers from all parts of the State, many of whom have had a great deal more experience in grow¬ ing fruit than I have had, and tell you how to go about to raise fruit of the best quality. Quite an undertaking, is it not?  Let us first consider just what are the requisites of fruit of the best quality. Good quality fruit should be smooth, thin skinned, it should be uniform in appear¬ ance and highly colored when fully ripe, as well as juicy and sweet. Fruit of this description will not only be attractive and pleasing to the eye, but also to the taste.  There are a great many different fac¬ tors that must be considered in attempting to produce fruit of the best quality. First, we might say we should consider locality, then stock or root, variety and strains of varieties, cultivation, fertilizing, spraying and pruning. These are only a few of the important factors to be considered, but I   do not wish my paper to be too lengthy, so will not take up but these few important factors.  LOCALITY  Climatic and soil conditions should have our consideration here. For the past few years my work has carried me through different sections of the State a great deal and the experience thus gained has led me to believe that citrus fruit can be raised more or less successfully on almost any type of soil in the State; some, of course giving better results than others. I have seen citrus growing on the low flat woods, the high pine land, the low hammock and the high hammock, the high sandy ridges of the lower East Coast, as well as the low muck lands of the same section, the oak ridges of Polk county, and many other types of soil. And as I have stated, I be¬ lieve that oranges are grown successfully in all of these sections, but in growing them for the best quality I should favor a rather heavy strong soil, one that would not require as much fertilizing as the lighter soils might.  ROOT STOCK  Just a word in regard to the stock. I should say that under average conditions        4   that sour orange root is preferable for growing fruit of the best quality, but there are some sections of the State, such as the Polk county ridge land and the red sand ridges of the lower East Coast where it would seem as though rough lemon root gave good results. However, it would be well in setting out young trees to investi¬ gate this point very carefully, for I have seen in some localities where Valencias had been budded to lemon root that the fruit had a tendency to dry out at the stem end, as well as show green around the upper portions of the orange. In some cases, this being noticed as early as the first of March, and of course, such tendencies would greatly lower the quality of such fruit.  VARIETIES  It is always well for one to acquaint himself with the varieties best suited for his special locality as far as may be pos¬ sible, and in speaking of this, I would call your attention to the fact that there are undoubtedly two or more strains of some of our best known varieties of citrus fruits, some of which do not bring forth fruit of the best quality. Take for in¬ stance, the Parson Brown orange; this orange, as we all know, has not the flavor when at its best that we expect in some of our mid-season varieties. Yet it has its place in our industry, in that it ripens earlier, giving us an orange for market¬ ing during the latter part of October and November. Therefore, to produce a Par¬ son Brown of the best quality, one must be sure that it is of a strain that matures among the earliest. Another well known   variety, the pineapple orange, has at least two distinct strains, one the truly high- colored type, another strain exactly the same in every description with the excep¬ tion that it has not the high color. I have seen these two strains growing in the same grove and of the two, the high colored one is always the more preferable.  Having selected a suitable locality and planted thereon trees of the best varieties and root adaptable to our location, we have complied with the first section of our problem and come now to the second sec¬ tion, that of cultivating, fertilizing, spray¬ ing and pruning for quality in fruit.  CULTIVATION 1  Cultivation should be done with the idea in view, not only of producing fruit of the best quality, but also that we might keep our fruit trees in a healthy growing condi¬ tion and so expect quantities of quality fruit. This subject of cultivation has been discussed at many of our meetings, from all of its different angles, and I do not think it necessary for me to enlarge upon it, only to say that I have for two or three years and am still carrying on ex¬ periments in non-cultivation in one or two small plots in several of the groves under my supervision. It is my opinion that from a fruit quality standpoint that a practice of cultivating lightly from early spring until the summer rains commence is preferable. In the heavier soils the disc and spring tooth harrow may be used if spools or sleds are used to govern the depth. In the lighter soils the disc har¬ row on spools, followed by the acme har¬ row is recommended.       FERTILIZING  Like cultivation, fertilizer should be ap¬ plied not only to produce fruit of good quality, but to keep the tree vigorous and healthy. The subject of fertilizing for quality is one that we can not take too seriously, one that deserves a great deal of our attention and one that I am sure is getting a great deal of study from all of us. There is of course, no standard ferti¬ lizer formula that may be employed in every grove. A certain treatment that might bring forth good results in one grove possibly would not do as well in an¬ other grove of a different locality. In fertilizing, we must ever keep quality of fruit before us. It is easy to give the right kind of fertilizer in amounts as to make a tree grow off vigorously, but it is also easy to fertilize a tree so heavily as to lower the quality of the fruit. Too much fertilizer lowers the quality, too little, in most cases, improves the quality of the fruit, but as is often the case, at the ex¬ pense of the tree, for it reduces the vital¬ ity of the tree, and if followed up, will naturally interfere with the crops to come. It is, therefore, necessary for our pocket- book’s sake, in fertilizing to endeavor to strike a happy medium. In fertilizing for quality there is another condition that I think that it might be well to mention and that is that we sometimes have drouths during the late summer and fall, such as we had last year, to the extent that the trees are unable to take up the fertilizer that was applied in early summer, so that when it comes time to put down the fall   application, we would do well to consider this fact and put on a lighter application than otherwise. An over-dose at this time will show up later in the fruit on the trees, having a tendency to make the skin peb¬ bly and rough, as well as retarding the maturity. Much has been said about fer¬ tilizers at our meetings, what fertilizers best to use, how and when to apply them and I do not think it necessary to enlarge upon this factor in fruit quality.  SPRAYING  Spraying is by no means a minor factor in the producing of good quality fruit. There is nothing that can lower the qual¬ ity of fruit more successfully than a heavy infestation of either white fly, purple scale, rust mite or thrips, to say nothing of melanose, scab and other fungus dis¬ eases, all of which may be controlled by proper spraying. By proper spraying, I refer to the spraying being done in a very thorough manner at the opportune time. An orange or grapefruit affected with thrip marks, rust, melanose or citrus scab is an unsightly thing, even if the eating qualities are really good; while on the other hand, fruit infested with white fly and purple scale not only lose greatly in appearance, but are also totally lacking in flavor. It is not my purpose to tell how or when to spray, nor what materials to use. I can only say to produce first qual¬ ity fruit these pests must be controlled and this can be done by spraying. By a care¬ ful study of Bulletin 30 of the Agricul¬ tural Extension Division of the Univer¬ sity of Florida, we may select a spray schedule to fit our own peculiar needs,   4        that when carried out faithfully, will prac¬ tically eliminate our grove pests.  PRUNING  There is not a great deal to be said about pruning as related to fruit quality.   However, by keeping our trees in a good healthy condition, and by pruning out so far as is practicable all of the dead branch¬ es and twigs, we reduce greatly our source of infection and consequently will have less melanose.@@   
 Citrus Fruit Quality@@   A. H. Brown@@ Manatee@@   Your president has asked me to give you something bearing on production of quality in citrus fruit. This is a subject that I think falls more in line with scien¬ tific research and not for the lavman. However, it might seem best not to depend entirely on the scientist and we can at least give the society the benefit of our observations along these lines.  There are at least four features of the business that must have more or less bear¬ ing on the subject in question.  soil  The soil feature is one of the most im¬ portant.  We think, in our section of the State, that we can raise a heavier and thinner skinned fruit on our low to medium low hammocks than can be raised on the higher sandy soils of other sections of the State. We cannot, however, raise the fine appearing fruit that is raised in the Indian river section on a soil that is more or less of a shell formation. Even in our own section of the State we raise, on a very light sandy soil, a fruit that has much the appearance of the Indian river fruit, but this same fruit is thicker skinned and is lacking in the quality, which we might designate “character,” that is found in this hammock land fruit.   In past seasons we have covered, in our shipments to the markets of the country, the larger cities from Boston to Denver. This, of course, has included New York. Our experience has been, in the case of New York, that if we have not something that is very attractive in appearance you would better stay away from that mar¬ ket. While it is a discriminating market, it discriminates in favor of appearance rather than quality. Boston, on the other hand, has paid us good money for quality at a time when most of the growers of the State were holding back shipments be¬ cause they could not see their way clear to pick and pack their fruit and be at all sure of getting their fixed charges out of their shipments.  FERTILIZER  Fertilizer used has a very important bearing on the quality of the fruit. Dur¬ ing the war, and for some time afterward, potash was very high and the grower hesi¬ tated to pay the price of a grade of goods containing 7%, or more, of potash, and I think the quality of the fruit declined and it is now only getting back to where it was before the war. Personally, in the fertilizers used in the groves in which I have been interested for more than 20 years, we kept up our content of potash        and I think it not only added to the qual¬ ity of our fruit but increased our produc¬ tion. We think our crop of last season, with an average of 700 boxes to the acre for our entire planting of 170 acres, would be rated as very high.  STOCK  The stock on which your trees are bud¬ ded also has a great influence on the qual¬ ity. It goes without saying that on our low hammocks, we would not think of planting anything but that which was bud¬ ded on the sour stock. Our friends in this vicinity, Lakeland, and all through Polk county, I believe, figure that the rough lemon is the proper thing. Undoubtedly, a larger tree can be produced in the short¬ est possible time by the use of the rough lemon for a budding stock. However, when it comes to thinness of peel and the character of the pulp, we think the sour stock is in the lead.  variety  Variety has an important bearing on quality.  Our own grove is budded largely to the Walters variety and we consider it one of the very best quality grapefruit grown.  We have, however, some 40 acres of the Marsh Seedless, and while it has fea¬ tures that are desirable, i. e., late ripening and holding on the tree until the latest and the tree is very prolific, yet in quality it is not to be compared with the Walters or Pernambuco. It simply lacks the char¬ acter found in the above mentioned varie¬ ties, which goes to make a fruit that is pleasing to the taste.   cultivation  Another feature that has much to do with quality is cultivation or, we might say, lack of cultivation. We find that the very few inaccessible portions of our grove, that have grown up in Bermuda sod, really gives us some of the finest texture fruit that we raise. However, these neglected corners always suffer dur¬ ing a drought and never develop trees with the bearing capacity that the other trees have. If we could give them all the fer¬ tilizer and water that they needed, they might have the combination of both qual¬ ity and quantity.  The writer well remembers, and I pre¬ sume many of the older members of this society remember, that the late Dudley Adams, for many years president of this society, was an advocate of non-cultiva¬ tion and in his day there was no finer brand of fruit on the market than his “Mocking-bird Brand.” You never heard him bewailing the fact that his grove was infested with Bermuda grass.  A subject so important to the future of the citrus industry as quality should be given more time than will be consumed in the reading of these short papers, and your committee figures that these papers are but the introduction of the subject. More in the future than in the past, will this feature have a most important bear¬ ing on the biggest industry of this State. Buyers and consumers are going to be more critical and they will demand more in the way of quality than they have in the past. They will demand a fruit with less rag and more quality juice.  Only recently I saw in one of our State      papers an instance of where a consumer of oranges was deploring the fact that he had been stung in buying California or¬ anges as he said that he could get a full tumbler of juice from two Florida or¬ anges where it took seven Californias to produce the same amount, and the quality of the Florida juice was much superior to the California. Well, we trust he has learned a lesson and in the future purchase none but the best, viz., Floridas.  Hume: In continuing this portion of our program I am going to ask Mr. Skin¬ ner to speak along this line at this time.  Skinner: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen—I was asked a few minutes ago to speak a little on the importance of quality in the marketing of citrus fruits. When I bring to my mind the word qual¬ ity in fruit, my mind immediately resorts to the names of Sampson, Wartmann, Green Label, Blue Goose and certain oth¬ ers. These names stand for quality in fruit. Back of these men was the soil. The soil is of the greatest importance. If you look at the grove of Mr. Sampson you will see quality of soil to start with. Look at Wartmann’s beautiful groves. That brings back the remark of Mr. Sampson made years and years ago in 1890. He made the remark that it was the extra 50 cents he was after that no one could take from him. The railroad company could not take it from him. That extra 50 cents is alone. He says that it is that extra 50 cents I am after, and he is here and he may remember that conversation.  We cannot plant pineapple oranges on high pine lands. If you plant on high pine lands, plant stuff that is adapted to it.   Don’t put pineapple oranges there. My experience is that when you put them on high pine lands they are not at home. If you have the soil for pineapple oranges plant pineapple oranges on it and nothing else. We want to be awfully careful about this quality of fruit. I have not men¬ tioned the government men, Shamel and Scott, who are devoting their energies to producing quality of fruit. Mr. Yothers is trying to help us and Mr. Winston is devoting his energies that we may have quality in fruit.  There are a few ways and means to pro¬ tect yourself from pests and other things, and if we will not be bull-headed, can get that extra 50 cents.  Hume: Mr. Burton, will you please continue this discussion for us.  R. P. Burton: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen—I had not intended to make a talk when I came here, but came to listen. In fact, the longer I am in the citrus fruit business the more I have to listen and the less I know. I happen to belong to the old school who began in the citrus business when the men considered themselves unfit if they did not get into hammock land on which they could plant sour stock.  I think one of the most important things today is to advertise. In years gone by, outside of the State of Florida the only orange known was the Indian river orange. There was a gentleman by the name of Lee, at Rockledge, and he owned the hotel on the Indian river and the tourists were permitted to go out and eat these oranges, and they were the finest in the world. Florida was advertised             through this hotel. Rockledge was only shipping 100,000 boxes of oranges and Florida was shipping over a million of boxes. They got the price and they got that extra 50 cents which Mr. Skinner spoke about. I have a man in mind at Leesburg who I don’t believe has ever been out of the county and was never on a railroad train until some friends put him on, and he produced the finest fruit in that section. When anyone else would pro¬ duce 5,000 he got 1,200 and 1,500 boxes. Now is the question whether we want that i r 500 boxes at $1.50 per box or 5,000 boxes at 90 cents and sometimes 50 cents. We used to have a tremendous number of varieties in this State. I got the Cunning¬ ham orange from a budding at Orange Bend, and New York used to pay more for this orange than any, because it had the quality. Today you cannot find a Cunningham orange. It was the soil it was grown on. You cannot take a piece of pine land and produce on it the pineap¬ ple orange that they can produce at Citra, and you cannot produce an orange with the quality; you can probably produce a commercial orange, but not the quality. They do produce some quite fine Valen¬ cias in Polk county.  I ship from 2,000 to 5,000 boxes of Parson Brown oranges and I ship the most of them from the 15th of December to the 15th of March. I originally got the Parson Brown oranges in Webster coun¬ ty. I planted the seeds. There is suffi¬ cient acid in it that you can eat it in No¬ vember and December and you can eat it the last of October if you want to ship a green orange. I would rather ship a car¬   load of pineapple oranges in January and take 40% less money for them than to ship that same car in September when every car would give the market a black eye. Now the question of quality is what in¬ terests the man on the other end of the line, the man who buys this fruit.  You will pardon me for referring to California, but they have taught us a great many things. They used to ship into Bos¬ ton their first, second and third grades in the same car and they could not under¬ stand why Boston would not pay the same for the second grade as for the first. It would give 50 cents more for the first than for the second grade. Boston would not pay for pale fruit, but New York would take pale fruit, but would not take granulated fruit. When you get west of the Mississippi river you never see a rus¬ set orange. They do put some out from the San Diego section. There is not any¬ thing that pleases so well as a good rich¬ looking orange.  About twelve years ago there was hard¬ ly a decent packing house in the State. Those people recognize the fact that they must not only have the quality of fruit, but they must have the quality of pack, and it must be placed on the other end of the line in the most satisfactory manner possible. I don’t know of anything else to be said on this subject.  Coming back to the Indian river propo¬ sition. The production of oranges and placing them on the market to sell are dif¬ ferent things. I have hammock soil and I have the sour stock, and I can produce good fruit if I will do it. We cannot all produce the best, but we can if the oppor-       tunity will permit. Ten years ago Cali¬ fornia was marketing Buffalo east, but she went to the Pacific. You can go to the Mississippi Valley. You have California handicapped as she cannot produce juicy fruit. Their orange has only one-third as much juice as the Florida orange, but people have the habit of California or¬ anges because of the beauty of the orange and they are not going to change that hab¬ it until we have an orange that appeals to the eye.  Hume: Any further discussion of  this?  Mr. Sadler: I have a question I have been trying to get answered for several years. I would like to find out what is the best root for tangerines?  Mr. Sampson. I have my tangerines all on sour stock.  -: Mine are on lemon stock, and  sour stock and those on sour stock hang on until April. They are always good, and you get that extra 50 cents and some¬ times $1.00, $2.00 and $3.00. I think that is a very important feature; I think the sour stock is the stock. I think the quality of the soil and the moisture from that soil is what makes your tangerines.  McCabe: I think the soil has more to do with the color and size than the stock.-  Skinner: If anybody here has budded grapefruit on bitter-sweet orange I would like to know it.  Sadler: I have some grapefruit on both bitter-sweet and sour stock and so far as I am able to observe, I cannot distinguish any difference in the quality of the fruit   and comparatively little in the quantity. However, there is a difference in the char¬ acter of the trees as to work and ferti¬ lizer, particularly on the same soil. The oil cells are not quite as well distinguished on bitter-sweet as on lemon and the quan¬ tity of production is very closely allied.  Hart: I have tangerines on both rough lemon and sour orange stock in the same grove and I have to pack the tangerines on the rough lemon as soon as they color, otherwise they get puffy and very soon get dry. Those on sour orange stock in the same grove will remain and hold shape. I also find a marked difference in the quality of fruit in that same grove. I made the mistake of budding a Washing¬ ton navel on lemon stock, and a friend of mine has a story of bringing a friend of hers to Jacksonville whom she wanted to give a real treat. She bought a 15-cent orange which was a fine big Washington navel. It happened to be one of my or¬ anges, and it was very sour. I certainly think the stock has a very marked influ¬ ence on the quality of the fruit, especially in soil like mine, which is high clay ham¬ mock and there is no coquina rock under it until you get down about 12 feet. I don’t think that affects the fruit.  -: I am glad I am not the only  one that feels that way. I don’t think lem¬ on is the thing for tangerines.  Hume: I wonder why Polk county people are so quiet.  Krome: There is considerable reason for this difference in the matter of tanger¬ ines. It is due to looking at the wrong end of the trees. I have tangerines bud-          ded on rough lemon stock which can be marketed in October. They took prize at the fair. I never ship any of my tanger¬ ines until November. The color is about the same. I have another planting I reg¬ ularly ship in February, budded on rough lemon. I have another budded on rough lemon and up until two weeks ago they were perfectly juicy. There are many kinds of Dancy tangerines in the State. I believe the difference is due more to dif¬ ference in strains rather than difference in root stock.  Carson : When they talk about tanger¬ ines I know a little myself. I have three varieties, viz., Dancy, Willow and India. They are each one distinct. The Willow and India are very much alike. We have some on sour stock and also have them on sweet seedling stock. They keep very well but the Dancy keeps best. They all get puffy. As far as we are able to see, those on rough lemon are practically alike. We have not been able to observe much differ¬ ence. That does not answer the question, but that is only from my experience. The older the trees get the better they get. I have some trees budded on lemon stock that have made a very splendid develop¬ ment for the age, and the fruit ripens in standard time. I think that tangerines in our country would be profitable budded on rough lemon stock. I don’t think them profitable budded on bitter sweet stock.  Mr. O’Byrne: I understand the tan¬ gerine is being used on a stock. I think   I am correct in my statement, although I am unable to confirm it.  Krome: I do not know of any nurser¬ ies that are budding on tangerine stock, but I do know that there are experiments of that kind being carried on by the Bu¬ reau of Plant Industry. They have been growing the Cleopatra seedling for stock for this purpose for the tangerine. Have seen one or two instances where the tan¬ gerine was budded on that stock and they looked to have very promising results. If Mr. Robinson is here he could give some information on that.  Robinson: We have made tests along that line but not of any actual value. To the best of my knowledge there is just one grove in the State in which there is a large number of trees budded on that stock, and we cannot reach any final conclusion from that, but in that one grove the results are very satisfactory. But of course we can¬ not recommend the stock until more ex¬ periments have been made. I certainly hope that no enthusiast will make a gen¬ eral recommendation on the opinion of one grove.  Hume: Along with the quality of the fruit there is another phase that can be vastly improved upon, and that is the out¬ side appearance. This afternoon we will get at that subject. California sells on looks and gets away with it, and Florida could do a great deal more in the improve¬ ment of appearance.@@     
 Avocado Explorations in Tropical America@@   Wilson Popenoe, @@Agricultural Explorer, United States Department of Agri¬ culture@@, Washington, D. C.@@   The manifold problems which are faced by Florida avocado growers can only be solved by concerted effort on the part of all those interested in the development of this new industry. The United States De¬ partment of Agriculture, desirous of do¬ ing its share of this work, has, during the past five or six years, conducted a rather exhaustive survey of the principal avo¬ cado-growing regions in tropical America, where the avocado is native and has been cultivated since prehistoric times. The objects of this survey have been several: First, it was desired to bring to light and introduce into the United States, the most promising varieties which could be found; secondly, it was thought that a study of the avocado in its native home might yield knowledge concerning the requirements of the tree which would be useful in connec¬ tion with its proper cultivation in the United States; and thirdly, it was desired to find, if possible, the wild prototypes of the cultivated avocados, and to study the wild relatives of the avocado, with a view to utilizing such of them as seemed val¬ uable in the work of breeding new forms, or perhaps as stock-plants on which to graft the avocado itself.  Not knowing exactly how far we would   be able to carry this work, we thought it best to commence with the most promising field, rather than to pursue a geograph¬ ical sequence. Thus it was that in the late summer of 1916 I sailed for Guatemala, where I spent sixteen months, and whence I sent twenty-three selected varieties of avocados to the United States for trial. Some of these have already borne fruit in California and Florida; several are now offered by the nurserymen in both states. In addition to the introduction of these varieties, several wild relatives of the avo¬ cado were obtained and introduced for trial—notably the coyo, Persea schiede- ana, and the anay, Hufelandia anay; near¬ ly a thousand photographs and many ob¬ servations on avocado culture were se¬ cured; twenty-five thousand avocado seeds were packed and shipped to Wash¬ ington, for use in growing stock-plants on which to bud the superior varieties; and seeds or roots of a number of promis¬ ing economic plants, likely to be of value in the southern-most United States, were secured.  The results of this first expedition have been made known through several publi¬ cations, notably Bulletin 743 of the De¬ partment of Agriculture, entitled “The           Avocado in Guatemala,” and a lengthy paper published in the Annual Report of the California Avocado Association for 1917. Our next undertaking was a de¬ tailed survey of the more important avo¬ cado-growing regions of Mexico, most of which had already received attention at the hands of Californians in search of de¬ sirable varieties for culture in that State. Mexico and Guatemala have, in fact, sup¬ plied practically all of the avocados which have been planted in California up to the present time.  In November of 1919 I sailed from the United States upon the third voyage of avocado exploration, this time with the in¬ tention of covering all the important terri¬ tory which had not yet been touched, and thus completing the survey. I should mention, at this point, that the exploration of eastern Brazil carried out in 1913 and 1914 by Messrs. A. D. Shamel, P. H. Dorsett and myself, while primarily un¬ dertaken for the purpose of studying the navel orange in its native home, served also to give us a sufficient knowledge of the avocados of that part of South Amer¬ ica, and to show us that there was nothing of great interest there, so far as desirable varieties were concerned. Later, in 1914 and 1915, I was able to visit Cuba and Porto Rico, and to study the avocados of these two islands. We therefore had left before us, when I started upon this last voyage, the Central American countries south of Guatemala, and the western part of South America; certain portions of the latter region, in particular, were terra in¬ cognita so far as avocados were con¬   cerned, and I looked forward to an inter¬ esting, though somewhat long journey.  My first stop was in Guatemala, which could scarcely be passed by, since we were in need of a further stock of seedling plants, and there was no better place to se¬ cure the necessary seeds. I had completed my work, and was about to proceed south¬ ward when I was overtaken by an acci¬ dent and laid up in the hospital for a month, during which time a revolution broke out. Things finally quieted down so that I was able to pick up my baggage, which I had stored in Guatemala City when I was sent to the hospital, and go through Salvador, which seemed to have nothing to offer in the way of valuable avocados, to Costa Rica, where I thought I might find something of interest. I was not disappointed, for on the slopes of the volcano Irazu, Oton Jibenez and I dis¬ covered a wild avocado which we believe may be the prototype of our cultivated West Indian and Guatemalan varieties.  This question of the wild avocado has always interested me greatly. I have seen the wild Mexican avocado growing on the slopes of the volcano Orizaba in Mexico, and I have occasionally run across it in the mountanis of Guatemala, where it may not, however, be indigenous; but I have never felt that the West Indian and Gua¬ temalan varieties could have been derived from this small, thin-skinned, Mexican species. When we found the wild avo¬ cado of Irazu, therefore, I was altogether delighted, for this species may be not only the wild prototype of the cultivated sorts, but also—and this of more practical im-      portance—a vigorous stock-plant on which to graft some of the more delicate avocados, and a wild species for use in breeding. In recent years, plant-breeders have come to place much emphasis on the value of the wild relatives of our culti¬ vated plants, some of which have been utilized in breeding with excellent results. The wild avocado may, therefore, prove extremely useful, even though its fruit is not worth eating.  This wild avocado of Costa Rica— agaacate de anis , or anise-scented avo¬ cado, it is locally called—grows in small ravines and on moist slopes at elevations between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. The tree much resembles that of some of the Guate¬ malan varieties, except that the leaves are thicker and stiffer, and strongly anise- scented when crushed. In this latter re¬ spect they resemble the Mexican race of avocados, and it may appear at first glance that the Guatemalan and West In¬ dian varieties, which do not possess any of the anise-like odor, can not have been derived from this wild species. But all studies of cultivated avocados have shown that this odor is not a definite character; it varies in amount, and it is altogether possible that long cultivation has entirely eliminated it from the cultivated forms. The fruits are about the size of a baseball, quite round in form, dark green on the surface, and extremely hard-shelled. The seed is large, and is surrounded by a small quantity of yellow, rather gritty pulp, which is oily, rather dry, and has, in ad¬ dition to the typical avocado flavor, a large amount of anise, so that it is scarcely eatable.   Seeds of this wild species were sent to the United States, as also budwood, but the latter failed to reach Washington alive. Further supplies of both will be obtained through Sr. Jimenez, a young botanist of San Jose de Costa Rica, who has collaborated with us very generously.  Aside from the wild avocado, two or three of the best cultivated varieties were obtained from the region about San Jose, and have been established in this country. These seem to be of the West Indian race, and are worthy of trial in southern Flor¬ ida, since they may prove to ripen at a dif¬ ferent season than the sorts now cultivated in this State. In quality I do not believe they are quite as good as several of our present commercial sorts.  From Costa Rica I went down to the Canal Zone, and then shipped for Santa Marta, Colombia. Before leaving the States on this last trip, I had talked with Mr. Krome of Homestead, and he had em¬ phasized the importance of securing an early-ripening variety of the West Indian race, for cultivation in southern Florida. He had mentioned the fact that avocados reach New York from Santa Marta, Co¬ lombia, in the month of June, and he sug¬ gested that I might there find unusually early-ripening sorts. I had also heard that avocados grew wild in the mountains back of Santa Marta, forming small for¬ ests. I was therefore, keen to see this re- gion.  It proved something of a disappoint¬ ment. The cultivated trees are of the West Indian race, and shipments to New York during the month of June are pos-          sible because, firstly, the climate of Santa Marta is extremely hot and the fruits ma¬ ture more quickly than in Florida, and secondly, the natives gather them before they are fully mature. I found, however, that there were some very choice seedlings in this region, and I selected one of the best and sent budwood to Washington. This variety we have named Fernandez, in honor of Sr. Fernandez, who was local manager of the United Fruit Company at the time of my visit, and who has since died of one of those malarial fevers which desolate the tropical American sea-coast.  As to the wild avocados of Santa Mar¬ ta, I found that they are escapes, and of the West Indian race. Such a lot of in¬ ferior West Indian seedlings I had never seen! In some places the mountain-side was covered with the trees, which formed veritable forests, and the fruits lay upon the ground in thousands. The quality of these fruits is scarcely good enough, save in exceptional instances, to warrant shipping them to New York.  From Santa Marta I went up the Mag¬ dalena river, and across the Andes to Bo¬ gota, the capital of Colombia, where I headquartered for several months. The avocados of this region proved to be in¬ ferior West Indians, and there was nothing of value to be had; so I finally left Bogota, after collecting some very in¬ teresting and remarkable blackberries, and a number of other things, and rode across the Andes to the Pacific coast, where I shipped for Guayaquil, Ecuador, and went thence by rail to Quito, a fascinating old Spanish city which lies high up in the   Andes, only twelve miles from the equa¬ tor. Here I headquartered for eight months, during which time I covered the Andean region of Ecuador from one end to the other.  While in the northern part of the coun¬ try, I spent a few days in the town of Ibarra, and here, in the market-place, I came across some avocados which imme¬ diately commanded my enthusiastic atten¬ tion. They appeared to be of the Mexican race, but were larger and finer than any I had ever seen in Mexico, or in Califor¬ nia. I was told that they came from the valley of the Rio Chota, half a day’s ride north of Ibarra. Immediately I made my plans to visit this valley, and I was just about to depart when I was unceremoni¬ ously grabbed by the police and whisked off to jail. Ordinarily I do not mind a thing of this sort—I had become quite accustomed to it in Guatemala—but just at this moment, when I had some new and remarkable avocados almost within my grasp, I found it decidedly annoying. The chief of police refused to tell me the nature of my crime, but informed me that he was familiar with my past. This, of course, explained my arrest; in fact, I often wondered that I had so long been allowed to remain at liberty. I argued; I entreated; I attempted to bluff a little, in a half-hearted manner, but all to no avail. I was to be held until orders came from Quito.  Realizing that a mistake had doubtless been made, I telegraphed the American Minister, and before morning received his reply, which read: “Have presented your      case to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Orders for your release will be issued to¬ night by the Minister of the Interior.” This brought joy to my troubled heart, and I again saw the avocados of the Chota valley within my grasp. In the morning I was allowed to depart, after learning that I had been mistaken for a German who was reported to be escaping from Colombia with stolen property, and I was soon in the hottest and dryest spot I had seen in many a month—the Chota valley of northern Ecuador.  This remarkable region contains several thousand avocado trees, most of them be¬ longing to the Mexican race. There are a few West Indians, and perhaps a few hy¬ brids. The Mexicans were probably car¬ ried there by Spanish monks, who owned and operated a large Hacienda in the val¬ ley for two centuries or more.  For the following three months I was occupied in getting out bud-wood from this valley, and shipping it home to Wash¬ ington. It was about the most difficult job of this sort which I have ever tackled. First of all, the trees were dirty and in bad condition, which made it impossible to secure first-class bud-wood, and sec¬ ondly, I had to cut it, carry it on mule- back to Quito, a journey of three days, then pack it and ship it down to Guaya¬ quil, whence it was carried by steamer to New York. It took a full month to land the bud-wood in Washington, counting from the day I cut it in the Chota valley, and out of three shipments which I made, we saved only a few buds of five varie¬ ties. The most promising of these I have named Tamayo, in honor of my excellent   friend, Jose Felix Tamayo, a young Ecua¬ dorean who gave me all possible assistance during the time I was in northern Ecua¬ dor, and without whose good offices it would have been well-nigh impossible to secure the Chota avocados. Tamayo is, as far as can be judged from its appear¬ ance, a Mexican avocado; but it weighs eighteen ounces, has a small seed, and the flesh is free from fiber and of excellent quality. The four other varieties which have been successfully introduced are slightly smaller than Tamayo, but all of good size and quality. If these avocados are true Mexicans, they ought to prove as hardy in the United States as other varie¬ ties of the Mexican race, and in this case they will be extremely valuable; for every¬ one is learning that it does not pay to plant any but the hardiest avocados in most parts of California and Florida. At least, there is a frost-hazard which is sufficient¬ ly serious to merit consideration.  Outside of the Chota valley, I found nothing of interest in Ecuador, so far as avocados were concerned, though I got some very interesting blackberries and raspberries, a remarkable cherry, and sev¬ eral other promising fruits. I went down to Peru, and looked over the avocados in the vicinity of Lima, but they proved to be ordinary West Indians, inferior to the best varieties of southern Florida, so I did not tarry, but proceeded to central Chile, where I knew there were many avocados of the Mexican race. In the vicinity of Quillota, between Valparaiso and Santi¬ ago, I found several thousand trees, but from all I could learn, they are small- fruited and not likely to be of much value            to us. I therefore filled a huge trunk with strawberry plants, native varieties of ap¬ ples, peaches and plums, and a few trees of a remarkable dwarf orange which was given me by Salvador Izquierdo, one of   Chile’s best known horticulturists, and then climbed on board a direct steamer for New York, which port I reached after twenty days, just two years from the time I had embarked for the tropics.@@   
 Possibilities of Sub-Tropical Fruits in Florida@@   H. E. Stevens,@@ County Agent,@@ Lee County, Fla.@@   In a paper before this society last year, Mr. Krome brought to your attention some recent developments of sub-tropical horticulture in Florida. Today I would like to consider for a short time the fu¬ ture possibilities of some of our present known tropical fruits, omitting entirely the citrus group, which has long since be¬ come our leading fruit crop. We have made considerable progress during the last decade, especially with the avocado, and I believe the day is not far distant when the commercial production of avocados will assume proportions equalling that of cit¬ rus, in a good many sections of our State. There is a large area in Florida where the avocado may be grown and as soon as we can settle on the more desirable varieties to grow, which is rapidly coming about, there will be a great impetus to the plant¬ ing and production of the avocado. The food value of the avocado is a strong point in its favor. It is more than a luxury al¬ though it may be considered as such now, when we think of the prices some of these fruits bring, on the northern markets. The food value of the avocado will en¬ courage its greater production for local use, and, if properly distributed and ad¬ vertised, I do not believe there will be any danger of over production in commercial plantings, for years to come. Our prox¬   imity to the markets, our climate and the large area within the State that may be devoted to the growing of avocados pe¬ culiarly fits Florida to lead in the produc¬ tion of this commodity if the growers of the State wish to assume that lead. The industry is yet young, but interest is be¬ coming more manifest and unless I am badly mistaken, there will be a large acre¬ age planted to avocados during the next few years. There will be mistakes and some failures as is true in the building of any new industry, but we may expect these and we must overcome them. Mis¬ takes and failure are more apt to be due to the individual rather than the principles underlying the industry.  The growing of fruit or other crops on a commercial scale is a business propo¬ sition, and business principles can no more be ignored in the production and market¬ ing of avocados than in any other busi¬ ness.  In my own section of the State, Lee county, considerable interest has been awakened during the last year or so in planting avocados. There are several commercial plantings now under way and one small nursery that had 4,000 trees for sale this season sold out its entire produc¬ tion and could have sold twice or three times as many. This, to me, is a favor-        able sign for the industry, and the demand for trees far exceeds the supply.  Every home owner in Florida may have an avocado tree in his door yard if he so desires, and I heartily indorse the slogan of '‘Plant an avocado tree or seed” where it is possible to do so. The Mexican avo¬ cado is very hardy and will withstand the low temperatures in northern Florida if the tree can be brought up to three or four years without severe freeze injury. For home use, especially where the more ten¬ der varieties can not be grown, the Mexi¬ can type will serve every purpose. It is not desirable as a commercial fruit. The Guatemalan types can be grown in the cen¬ tral and southern parts of the State where the temperatures are not so low. This type will, no doubt, furnish us with our leading commercial varieties. The West Indian type will have to be confined to the southern part of the State as they are very susceptible to low temperatures. I will not attempt a discussion of the different varieties at this time as a great deal has already been written on this subject and we have much more yet to learn before the matter is finally settled.  The critical period in the growing of an avocado tree is in its first few years of growth. If it can be protected from frosts or freezes until it has attained three or four years’ growth, I see no reason why a grove or planting could not then be carried through any ordinary freeze by some system of orchard heating.  In addition to the avocado we have other sub-tropical fruits that in my opin¬ ion offer wide possibilities for develop¬ ment. We do not seem to have made as   extensive use of some of the fruits we have in our midst as we might. As citrus culture has been developed and as we are developing the avocado, why not apply this to the mango, the guava, banana, pa¬ paya, Surinam cherry, carissa and other fruits we are now growing largely as nov¬ elties ?  The increased production of these fruits may be considered from two view points: that of home use and commercial produc¬ tion.  For the home we should make use of as many different fruits as possible and ar¬ range our plantings to have fruit the en¬ tire year. In many sections of Florida, especially the southern part of the State, this is possible.  We should confine ourselves to the fruits that are adapted and do well under our particular climatic conditions, and, if we do this, there is generally a wide field to select from.  I find that it is difficult for the new comer in our section, especially if he comes from Northern states, to forget his taste for northern fruits, and he will in¬ variably want to plant out many of the fruits he has been accustomed to. He wonders why peaches, pears, plums, ap¬ ples, cherries, gooseberries and the like will not grow as well in Lee county as they do back in Illinois, or some other state.  Nature has seen to it that the northern and southern fruit growers will not come into direct competition with each other as far as the same commodities are con¬ cerned, and we can not always make a sat¬ isfactory change in the laws of nature.      I suppose there are few of our northern friends, or southern either, for that mat¬ ter, who would think of planting citrus, mangos, or avocados in either Michigan or New York, yet each of these are fa¬ mous fruit producing states. So why waste time with fruits peculiarly adapted to our northern climate here in the South when we have so many at home that can be readily utilized.  For the home, lack of space is no valid excuse for not having a liberal supply of fruit. The ordinary building lot or door- yard will supply space enough for a suf¬ ficient variety of trees to keep the family in fruit. Our tropical fruit trees do not object to crowded conditions, as this is more nearly their natural environment. A single citrus tree, by the simple process of budding, can be made to carry early, mid-season and late oranges in addition to grapefruit, and on three trees the entire list of citrus fruits of economic value may be had. These should supply the ordinary family with citrus fruits in season. A seedling mango tree can be made to bear, by top working, four or five of the choice varieties, and the avocado can be treated in a similar way. Guavas, papayas, ba¬ nanas and other fruits can be added to the list until the home planting is made com¬ plete and sufficient to meet the needs of the family.  It appears to me that we have neglected the home planting sadly in many cases, and that we are not utilizing the fruit trees we have at hand to the best advan- tage.  The home planting can be made the means of stimulating a wider use and de¬   mand for a number of the tropical fruits which are now grown as occasional speci¬ mens. By using more of these fruits our¬ selves and by preparing them in a variety of ways, a greater demand can be created for them.  Many of us may not care particularly for some of these fruits in their raw state, but, if they are cooked, preserved, made into jelly or conserve, a pleasing and ap¬ petizing product is produced. In this con¬ nection the ladies of the State, the Home Demonstration Clubs, and the Home Eco¬ nomics Department of our Extension Service can aid materially in creating a demand for these fruits, by finding new ways for serving them or new uses to which they may be put.  If you will pardon a local reference I would like to cite one illustration along this line which brings out the point I have tried to make. The ladies of the Home Demonstration Council of Lee county, re¬ cently published a cook book. This cook book is rather unique in that the recipes were furnished by various ladies of the county, and they applied chiefly to the use of the local grown products. Many of them were new and original. Some fifty or sixty of these recipes apply to the use of the fruits grown in Lee county. So if the ladies interested in our home fruits will exercise their ingenuity a little further on some of our lesser known tropical fruits, I feel sure that a greater demand will be created for these fruits and their products. If we use these more extensive¬ ly among ourselves, it will not be long be¬ fore our tourist friends become acquaint-   5       ed with them and a market practically un¬ limited will be created.  Turning again to the commercial pro¬ duction of sub-tropical fruits the mango may be considered next in importance to the avocado. There is a ready market for the finer varieties of this fruit grown in the State at the present time, and the com¬ mon seedlings are easily disposed of local¬ ly. The uncertainty of the crop has been a drawback to the development of the in¬ dustry, and if we can overcome this by suitable varieties and better cultural prac¬ tices, there is a future for the production of mangos in Florida.  In Lee county the common seedling mango trees make a rapid, vigorous growth, with very little care and practi¬ cally no fertilizer. The fruit is generally small, full of fibre, but of fairly good fla¬ vor. It is not suitable for shipment to the northern markets in competition with the better varieties. The crop is uncertain al¬ though the trees bloom profusely every season.  If we can put a larger and better qual¬ ity of fruit on such trees and insure the production of an average crop each year, there will be large profits for the mango growers in this section. These are some of the problems to solve in connection with the growing of mangos, and I believe in time they will be solved. It is an in¬ dustry that offers promise and one that should command more interest.  In the guava there are commercial pos¬ sibilities that have barely been touched upon as yet. This fruit grows well in South Florida with very little attention or care, and it produces well. If proper va¬   rieties were developed, planted in grove form and brought under cultivation as any other fruit crop, the production of guavas could be made to pay well. It is a fruit that lends itself to a variety of uses, and the products made from it have met with favor in many places in the North. Guava jelly is a well known commodity and easily disposed of, and other products of the guava would no doubt find a ready market. Except locally, the guava can never be marketed as a fresh fruit, but the canned guavas, jelly, preserves and other products could be put on every market in the United States. I believe the canned guava would take well. I see no reason why it should not easily compete with the canned peach, if put up as attractively and given a reasonable amount of advertising.  We consume thousands of cans of peaches in Florida each year which come from other states in the North. May we not substitute canned guavas for some of these and in addition send our canned guavas into the northern markets. A guava industry would necessitate the es¬ tablishment of canning factories in the State and these could be put to use in car¬ ing for other products, that annually go to waste.  A canning factory or enterprise for tak¬ ing care of waste products is an important adjunct to any fruit industry, and it is something sorely needed by the fruit growers of this State. We can create a ready market for all the guava products we can produce and there are acres of land in South Florida today producing only sand spurs and palmettoes which might be devoted to the growing of guavas.      The banana is another fruit that we have done very little with, and which has latent possibilities both for home con¬ sumption and commercially in a local sense.  We pay handsomely for the fine ba¬ nanas furnished us from the South Amer¬ ican countries by the American Fruit Company. These usually sell for 50 to 60 cents per dozen in our local markets, while the home grown product can be bought for half that much when obtainable.  I recently read a little booklet on the banana, published by the American Fruit Company, which gave in detail the trou¬ ble and expense involved in supplying us with the excellent banana. They may be fully justified in the charges they make for their product, but why should we, here in Florida, pay such prices when we can grow bananas at home for about half that price ?   There is a lot of land in Florida that will grow the banana, and it should not be an expensive crop to produce in a small way.  I believe that in any county where the banana can be safely grown, sufficient soil can be found to produce fruit enough to supply the local markets in that county, and a few banana plantations in the State could easily take care of the Florida mar¬ kets and some of those in our neighbor¬ ing states.  We have done much to develop and ex¬ tend our citrus industry and it will con¬ tinue to extend, always remaining the leading fruit crop in the State. However, it seems to me that there are great possi¬ bilities in some of these fruits I have men¬ tioned if we devote the same interest and energy to their production and market¬ ing. The Horticultural Society can aid materially in encouraging and fostering this development.@@     
 Avocados on High Pine Land@@   John Morley,@@ Lake Alfred@@   My remarks are described as “Avo¬ cados on High Pine Lands/' but before going into this, I must say, that I am ex¬ periencing this evening a somewhat novel sensation, for although I have been great¬ ly attracted to the avocado for the past five years, my stimulus has been greatly increased after hearing such a good re¬ port from Mr. Stevens, and so much so, that I shall be inclined to plant more and more.  The avocado, so far as I can gather, was first introduced from the West Indies in the year 1739. and from this we may note, it has been on record a long time. In my opinion the fruit, from a nutritious standpoint is unrivaled and may be gath¬ ered when ripe without any treatment or curing; further, the most delicate stomach can digest the avocado fruit, when ani¬ mal fats may upset it. I would further say, that I long for the day when we can have this fruit in plenty. For although I am not a vegetarian, I am thinking that as I love the taste so much, when the day does come that we can have them in abundance, I shall not need much of the bovine, that tells no lies, wanders on the prairie and on mischief bent, lustily tears and eats up our vegetation in yards, gar¬ dens and groves.   The avocado tree in my opinion would make a good shade tree on our way-sides and should be used more than it has been in the past, for it has a singular striking appearance, combined with good spread¬ ing branches. Probably it may not be generally known, that it is said, that marks made with the seed on a white wall will turn as red as blood and cannot be effaced until the wall is whitewashed and even then only with difficulty.  I am not in a position to say that you should follow a definite plan in your planting on the so-called “high pine lands," for although I have spent my whole life in studying and working amongst trees and plants, my experience on the subject before us only covers five years. However, in all our works we must form a base or construction line to work from, particularly so, when you are not growing your trees on a well enriched humus area, for you must realize that the sudden fluctuations of heat and moisture quickly affect the avocado, more particu¬ larly during its early life.  Just as individual tastes differ on vari¬ ous matters, so does the result change ac¬ cording to the treatment you give your trees in the first place. It is well known that good food is requisite for this tree, or         good humus, whereby food can be incor¬ porated. This brings to mind a true story of a gentleman who, with his gardener was showing an interested friend around his garden and pleasure grounds. After they had passed over all the interesting trees, they came to an enclosure in an ob¬ scure corner. The gentleman paused a moment and with a smile of satisfaction and finger pointing to a manure heap said, “There, is my head gardener.”  In my opinion, to obtain returns in the early days from your trees on high sandy pine lands, it is necessary for them to be provided with a stable manure, under and on each side of the plant, though not near¬ er than say three inches to the roots. Should this not be procurable, then use the next best thing, decayed vegetable matter, such as may be termed “muck.” Added to this, do not omit steamed bone, for I have found in experimenting, that where I have opened up the soil, the young roots have literally hugged the small par¬ ticles of bone.  It is of no use “beating about the bush,” as the saying goes, for there are a great many of us in our planting schemes and after attention thereto, who seem to for¬ get the words, “be thorough This brings me to a remark made by a well known lady in the Florence Villa district, who said, “Yes, we see today so many instances where in the past, people planted their five-dollar trees in less than one-dol- lar holes.” The moral being, that had they put more money into the preparation for the plant, better returns would have followed.  We now come to water, which is a   greater necessity than we have hitherto thought and in my opinion all plant life on these high sands needs much more than they receive from the clouds. I like wa¬ ter, even sometimes mixed, but in any case regularly during my waking hours, and we are apt to forget that these trees re¬ quire water regularly just the same. If our neighbors are all following the same method, like one goat follows the other on the mountain trail, we are inclined to follow in like manner and go harrowing and harrowing. So far as it goes, it is al¬ right, and we preserve our trees by so do¬ ing, but to get the best out of them in our early as well as later days, we must watch and give them water before they get too far, for although we stir the ground by harrowing, this necessity of water calls, I think I am right in saying, at some period or other every year that goes by.  Our first trees of 590 Trapps and 10 Pollocks were planted during July, 1917, and are now of various sizes up to 16 feet and even more than that in width. There is one distinct observance I have made, that we on high sand can produce a tree with many more short fruiting branches than is usually found on trees on muck soils; naturally we fail when it comes to producing long vigorous shoots.  The method of planting the first batch will show you an omission of stable ma¬ nure, for each hole was cut out to a depth of 2^2 feet and about 3 feet in diameter. The top soil was used in the bottom and on the sides of the ball of the tree, then a mixture of 2 pounds of steamed bone, I pound of castor pomace and y 2 pound of goat manure was carefully put around the       sides and bottom so as not to be nearer than 4 inches from the roots. I must say that this is dangerous quantity to use if not carefully carried out; however, I per¬ sonally saw to this being dealt with in every case. Careful shading was adopted so that the mid-day sun could not reach them and frequent watering, which is very important, was attended to.  FERTILIZING  This has been given as follows: First year, i pound in one application during September; second year, applied four times, at the rate of 2 T / 2 pounds per tree; third year, 4pounds each time of three applications; fourth year, 6j4 pounds per tree three times during the year, and this year 9 pounds at each application. So far, I have never applied commercial fertilizer later in the year than September.  MULCHING  This has been carefully carried out up to this year on the first batch of trees and I have now decided to abandon this, after the fourth year, on our sandy soil, and follow up by periodic harrowing, as I am of the opinion that the nursing of small roots near the surface after this age is lia¬ ble to court disaster and I would prefer keeping the roots deeper and encourage them nearer the center of the rows. The time may come when the trees will make a general shade over the ground, and I may then, again consider the necessity of a general mulching, for weeds and natal grass should not be such a menace at that period.   With regard to insect pests, our great¬ est trial has been the pyriform scale on some of the trees amongst the Trapp va¬ riety only; however, with three applica¬ tions during December, January and end of May of 1 to 70 and 1 to 80, respec¬ tively, of Oil Emulsion we have kept them down fairly well. During February we have given lime sulphur at the rate of 1 to 60, and again in March, Bordeaux and Black Leaf 40 during the flowering sea¬ son.  Our Trapps produced a few fruits after the second year after planting and the third year they set on an average six fruits to each tree, but all these did not fully develop. Last year we had few blos¬ soms and hence little fruit. This year nearly every tree was laden with blossoms. Unfortunately I may say, owing to the unusual dry period, the setting is not good. In future, we trust now that we have bought some experience that a wa¬ ter scheme or irrigation may assist us to obtain better results. As to the Pollock variety, this shows blossom, but has not brought any fruit as yet.  PROTECTION  So far we have relied on hay piles and wood during the past year, but in future we shall adopt other means, as our trees are getting larger each year.  Under experiment we have over 23 dis¬ tinct kinds and about 40 Guatemalan seed¬ lings, which show distinct characteristics, therefore we have some hopes of seeing something new as time goes on.  As to propagation on general lines, I leave this to the nurseryman, for he has to      go on and I have only experimented in a small way, chiefly on the Mexican stock; however, from experience I might say that as a stock as seen here I shall not fa¬ vor it in future, for it pushes forth into growth much earlier in our locality than   the West Indian or Guatemalan, therefore leaves us open to danger if a cold snap comes along.  In conclusion, we must be thorough in all our work and hope that this nutritive food may stand us in good stead.@@     
 A Hardy Mexican Avocado@@   C. C. Shooter,@@ Earlton@@   A good deal of interest is being taken in the Mexican avocado growing at my place at Earlton, on account of its excep¬ tional hardiness and the good quality of the fruit. It has stood the test of 22 win¬ ters, including 1917, without ever losing any wood and only a few leaves. Orange trees on the same block have been badly hurt and grapefruit trees killed outright. It is a vigorous grower, making an im¬ mense tree 40 to 50 feet high and seems to be practically free from insects and other enemies. It makes a magnificent orna¬ mental, growing much quicker than the magnolia.   So far, it has produced 800 to 900 fruits per season; would probably bear much more with irrigation or on damper soil.  The fruit, although of only medium size, is very rich and fine flavored and was noticeably larger last season as the result of a little fertilizer.  It does not seem to be generally known that the avocado can be used otherwise than as a salad. We have found it excel¬ lent cooked in a variety of ways. Avo¬ cado custard pie is truly delicious.@@   
 The Satsuma Orange@@   H. K. Miller,@@ Monticello@@   Once upon a time, in the not very dis¬ tant past, the center of Florida’s citrus in¬ dustry was many leagues north of its pres¬ ent limits, and there are those present who remember when all the counties of North Florida boasted of the excellence of their oranges. However, the recurrent visita¬ tions of Old Boreas have pushed the cit¬ rus industry down into the peninsula or central and southern part of the State, leaving only here and there an isolated specimen of an orange tree, more persist¬ ent than its one-time fellows, as a mute and lonely witness to the past golden age of North Florida. In the days of which I speak citrus culture was more of a lux¬ ury than a commercial enterprise and it seems to me that the wintery visitations did far less injury in killing the groves, than it did by producing a chronic case of cold feet throughout all North Florida. Had this section of the State persistently striven to produce oranges in spite of ad¬ verse circumstances, I believe it would, today, be contributing annually, thousands of cars of Florida gold to the markets of the North. This would have become pos¬ sible by adopting the Satsuma orange for that section, growing it upon the citrus- trifoliata stock.   The Satsuma was introduced from the Orient and has been grown in Florida for more than forty years, in fact since 1876, having been first tried by Mr. Geo. R. Hall. It belongs to the Mandarin group of orange, so named as indicative of the high esteem in which they are held in the Orient. This variety is especially adapted to the trifoliata stock but appears to be incompatible with other stocks in general use. It is not only inherently hardy, but when grown upon the trifoliata it is de¬ cidedly so, due to the fact that this stock is a deciduous plant and becomes dormant during the winter season. It has been known to withstand a temperature of 14 degrees F. with no injury, not even be¬ coming defoliated. The trees have been killed, however, when full of sap, by much less cold.  It is passing strange that the Satsuma did not immediately come into general use after the disastrous winter of 1894-5. Possibly the reason is because of the pe¬ culiar habit of the Satsuma to be largely influenced by the conditions under which it is grown and consequently the variety thought to be so uncertain as to be un¬ worthy of extensive trial. Had it not been for this peculiarity or had its cultiva¬ tion been better understood, there is little   48       question but that North Florida would have undertaken the growing of the Sat- suma on a commercial scale soon after its introduction into the State. A small acre¬ age was grown with decided success by the Glen St. Mary Nurseries at Glen St. Mary. This planting was made about 1890.  It was about 1900 that the planting of Satsumas assumed a considerable magni¬ tude, hardly so much in Florida as in Ala¬ bama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. A fair degree of successful production of trees planted throughout the Gulf Coast country soon led to a veritable boom in this enterprise. Millions of trees were im¬ ported from Japan. The inexperienced promoter soon occupied the center of at¬ tention and very extensive plantings were made in Texas with little regard to the type of soil or location with reference to frost protection. In that state alone the annual plantings exceeded the million mark. For the most part, this effort was put forward by new settlers who were in¬ experienced or else unaware of the period¬ ic northers which sweep over Texas from time to time. A succession of these bliz¬ zards from 1912 to 1915 practically ex¬ terminated the orange growing industry of that state. Such orchards as escaped the cold in the extreme south of the state were in a large measure unsuccessful on account of non-adaptability to the alkali soil prevailing in that section.  The widespread infection of citrus can¬ ker, which had been introduced from Ja¬ pan on imported trees added to the general demoralization and retarded further ef¬   fort, not alone in Texas but in all sections where the Satsuma was being tried out.  From 1907 to 1915 aside from Texas perhaps the most extensive plantings were made in southern Alabama, chiefly in Mo¬ bile and Baldwin counties. The plantings here as in other sections were for the most part pioneer work, engaged in by new set¬ tlers or those otherwise inexperienced in the cultivation of citrus fruits. As a mat¬ ter of fact, very, very many undertook to grow Satsumas who had had no previous training or experience in any line of horti¬ culture. The significance of this state¬ ment may be more fully appreciated when it is pointed out that the successful hand¬ ling of a Satsuma proposition calls for as much and indeed probably very much more intelligent thought and action than the present highly complex business of growing and marketing of round oranges. Notwithstanding this initial handicap, the development in Alabama reached a consid¬ erable degree of success and was giving promise of a new and wonderful enter¬ prise, when the unforeseen events came very near duplicating the disaster which had only recently befallen the industry in Texas. First the World War so upset calculations of many of the growers that progress was seriously impeded. Then a tropical storm during July swept the coast from some miles east of Pensacola west¬ ward into Louisiana with terrific force, defoliating practically every Satsuma tree in this wide region. The result was that the following fall found all these trees in full sap with tender foliage. As luck, or fate, would have it, a sudden drop of tem¬ perature to 22 degrees F. occurred in No-      vember without any previous cold or other condition to harden the trees for such an emergency, killed thousands of them to the bud and so injured others as to almost dishearten their owners completely. Add to all this the heroic effort to exterminate the citrus canker which had become thor¬ oughly disseminated in this section, is it any wonder that interest in Satsumas was at low ebb? Many orchards were aban¬ doned and comparatively few were given more than nominal care. In the course of two or three years many of the more fa¬ vorably located orchards made rather re¬ markable recovery and at the earnest ap¬ peal of Dr. Winberg, president of the Gulf Coast Horticultural Society, many of the owners undertook to rejuvenate their orchards by taking them in hand for proper care. These have responded to a remarkable degree, so that the ravages of the storm and subsequent cold have been largely overcome.  Among those who never lost faith in the Satsuma is Dr. W. H. Ludewig of Foley. He persisted in caring for his 20- acre orchard regardless of the many dis¬ couraging circumstances and was reward¬ ed by being the first to ship a car of Sat¬ suma oranges from Baldwin county. He followed this initial shipment with six cars for each of the past two seasons.  To Dr. Ludewig’s indefatigable op¬ timism and untiring effort must be large¬ ly credited the present hopeful situation of the Satsuma industry of South Alabama. The two counties, Baldwin and Mobile, shipped 250 cars the past season, and these netted the growers very satisfactory re¬ turns.   A decided revival of interest is now manifest in Alabama and more attention is being given to spraying, cultivating and fertilizing the orchards there. It is esti¬ mated that additional plantings were made in Alabama last winter of more than 200,- 000 trees. This revival of interest is not confined to Alabama, but is also in evi¬ dence in North Florida and states further west.  Having in mind the experiences of the past twenty years, it seems only proper that we should endeavor to profit by them and avoid as far as possible the errors of the past.  That the Satsuma is a most excellent fruit and reaches the market at an oppor¬ tune time for supplying a missing gap, cannot be gainsaid. It is also true that the Satsuma may be and frequently is, when grown under improper conditions, such a poor excuse for an edible fruit as to be worthless. It behooves us then to see to it that we learn how to produce good fruit and above all things never al¬ low inferior fruit to reach the market, else it will become impossible to induce the public to buy. This is especially true of such products as the Satsuma, which can¬ not become staple articles of trade like the apple or the round orange which enjoy a prolonged season of sale.  A well known writer has written, “For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain, the heathen Chinee is peculiar.” Now the Satsuma is a full-blooded “Chinee” and coincides to a nicety with this author’s opinion of its fellow citi¬ zens. You will get the point if you at¬ tempt to grow this variety upon sour or-          ange stock. It will be abnormal in size, coarse textured, mostly rag and otherwise totally unfit. The same condition pre¬ vails when grown too rapidly even on the trifoliata stock. This calls for due care in the selection of soil and climatic envi¬ ronment, and also in the manner of ferti¬ lizing. If any one of these conditions is not right it will be manifested in the qual¬ ity of the fruit. Under the most favor¬ able growing conditions there will always be some inferior fruit that should invari¬ ably be discarded and not allowed to get into the market. The experienced packer can usually tell such fruit at a glance.  In Florida there is an extensive area in which the Satsuma may be grown with success. This extends from Perdido Bay on the west to the Atlantic on the east and as far south as Gainesville. Within this region there are numerous types of soil and other factors, such as elevation, ex¬ posure to undue cold, etc., which would disbar any attempt at the cultivation of citrus fruits, but on the other hand, where the soil is suitable and the location good it would seem that the Satsuma can be grown with about the same degree of safety and assurance of success, as per¬ tains to the growing of round oranges in the present confines of the upper citrus belt of the peninsula. To my mind, North Florida has been overlooking a splendid opportunity for developing the production of the Satsuma on a commercial scale. Here we have advantages of soil, climate, proximity to markets, freedom from storms, in a degree possessed by no other section of our country. Perhaps this sec¬ tion may yet come into its own by taking   advantage of the experience gained in other sections so that the foundation may be laid on more dependable knowledge of the essential requirements.  To the prospective grower of Satsumas I would suggest and even urge a delib¬ erate and careful study of the subject in all its relations before embarking in the enterprise. The question of suitable soil and proper location for immunity from cold, the nearness to shipping facilities, possibilities for irrigation and other fac¬ tors which may have a decided influence on the operations should be given inten¬ sive and profound thought before you be¬ come anchored to a situation which may prove objectionable. By no means secure a location because it is inexpensive as to first cost, as in the end it may prove a costly investment. Rather make a study of the orchards which have proven the most successful and endeavor to duplicate as far as possible in your selection of a site the good features which are prime factors making for success in these or¬ chards.  There is little excuse for making an unwise selection of a location at this stage, since there is an abundance of good soil adapted to the matter under discussion, well elevated with good air drainage to afford protection. The price of suitable land is a consideration which should never cause one to select an undesirable site. At this time there are thousands of acres of ideal locations at prices ranging from $15 to $50 per acre. In many cases the land is cleared and free from stumps. An or¬ ange grove is a life-long enterprise and is worthy of the best land available. “Why      kick against the pricks” by endeavoring to make a market for some cheap cut-over land fit only as earth ballast, when the best can be had at a price less than the cost of clearing the poorer land?  Endeavor to visualize the future and see the orchard in its fruition with all its problems of maintenance and marketing   and resolve to equip yourself with all available knowledge for the successful prosecution of the enterprise. In this way you may contribute to the upbuilding of this wonderful country with interest, with pleasure, with pride, and I sincerely hope and believe, with profit.@@   
 Recent Experiments With Thrips on Citrus@@   J. R. Watson,@@ Gainesville@@   Thrips injure citrus in two ways, (i) their feeding and egg punctures cause con¬ siderable of the fruit to drop. This would be more serious if the citrus tree did not normally bloom so profusely that a large proportion of the fruit must necessarily drop.  (2) Their feeding punctures on the young ovary result in shallow injuries which develop into scars that mar the ap¬ pearance of the fruit and lower its grade. The work during the two years just past has had more to do with the latter type of injury, namely, the scarring of the fruit.  The scars produced by thrips are very characteristic and need not be confused with those produced by other causes, al¬ though, of course, they may be compli¬ cated by the latter. They differ from scab in being sunken rather than raised, but are not as deeply sunken as those resulting from the feeding of grasshoppers and katydids. They differ from melanose and mechanical injury including rubbing against twigs or leaves in that they are smooth and shining rather than rough, as well as in their peculiar irregular shape.  Oranges are much more severely in¬ jured than grapefruit. Thrips are not present in numbers in the trees until the   bloom begins to open. They then fly into the trees, mostly from other blossoms, es¬ pecially weeds. In the flowers they feed mostly on the bases of the petals and sta¬ mens. They are sucking insects but their mouth parts are very short, only a frac¬ tion of a millimeter, less than a hundredth of an inch, and consequently their punc¬ tures are very shallow but numerous and placed close together.  Attacked stamens and petals turn brown in spots and fall prematurely. Eggs are never laid in the petals or stamens but al¬ ways in the receptacle, the enlargement of the stem to which the fruit is attached. They are laid in shallow slits just beneath the epidermis of the plant. They hatch in three or four days and the young at once crawl into the blossom or onto the young fruit. The scarring of the fruit seems to be caused mostly by these young thrips of the second generation. As soon as the petals and stamens drop, the winged adults practically all leave and fly to other blos¬ soms ; but the young which have no wings remain and feed on the young fruit. However, they do often crawl from the receptacle on which they were hatched to neighboring freshly opened blossoms. But even in fresh blooms they collect largely at the base of the ovaries. Their       preference of feeding grounds is some¬ what different from that of the young thrips. They require about two weeks to complete their growth.  CONTROL  The most efficient insecticide, all things considered, is a combination of lime sul¬ phur and tobacco. Soap and tobacco will kill the thrips fully as well, but because of its greater value against rust mites and red spiders, which are often beginning to increase about blossoming time, the lime sulphur is preferable.  Lime sulphur alone is not an efficient insecticide for the Florida flower thrips. I want to emphasize that point, for not a spring passes without some one breaking into print with a recommendation of straight lime sulphur for this thrips. This idea originates, I think, from the publi¬ cations on the California orange thrips. The latter is not only a different species from ours, but belongs to a different genus as well, and is a smaller and more delicate insect.  On the other hand, tobacco alone is not an efficient agent unless used at a con¬ centration which makes it very expensive. As to the amount of tobacco, we have found that in combination with lime sul¬ phur solution at the ordinary rust mite strength, i. e., 1165 or 70, a full pint (13 oz.) of nicotine sulphate is necessary for efficient killing. By increasing the strength of the lime sulphur to 1140 the tobacco can be cut to 10 oz. And this is a cheaper formula as well as a more ef¬ fective one against citrus scab.   As to the best time to spray, the ex¬ perience of the past two years has strengthened our former recommendation to spray into the full bloom, i. e., when the maximum number of blossoms are open. It is, however, better to be a day or two early rather than a day or two late.  Our experience has been that in the hands of most spraying crews better kill¬ ing is secured by the use of a spray gun than with a rod and nozzle. The driving force of the discharge from a spray gun is more likely to force the liquid into the interior of the blossom, behind the column of stamens where thrips are most numer¬ ous.  DUSTING  In co-operation with Mr. W. W. Moth¬ ers some experiments were started this spring to test the practicability of control- ing thrips by the use of dusts consisting of lime impregnated with nicotine sul¬ phate. Three different strengths were tried containing respectively 2.2, 5 and 10% of nicotine sulphate. Wherever this material was driven into the blooms with sufficient force to penetrate behind the column of stamens the thrips were killed. The killing was fully as thorough as with spraying and as high with the 2.2% ma¬ terial as with the 10%. But in blossoms exposed only to the drifting cloud of dust the penetration was not as thorough as could have been desired and a large pro¬ portion of the thrips escaped. It was es¬ timated that between 50% and 60% of the thrips were killed as compared with 85% or 90% in the case of thorough spraying. It is as yet too early to form any reliable conclusions as to the practi-        cability of controlling thrips with dust. But we have demonstrated that the lime- nicotine dust will kill them.  UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL IT PAY TO SPRAY FOR THRIPS?  This is a question that we have kept constantly before us. As with all spray¬ ing, there are several factors involved in the answer to this question. At least five are of prime importance.  (1) 'Abundance of Thrips. —How many thrips per bloom before spraying will pay? We have heretofore set this at about two dozen, and now see no reason to change it; i. e., under average condi¬ tions as to other factors, if spraying for thrips alone is to pay they should average about two dozen per bloom.  (2) The Amount of Bloom. —When the bloom is scanty, spraying for thrips becomes correspondingly more important, as an effort should be made to save as much of the bloom as possible.  (3) The Variety of Citrus. —A small¬ er number of thrips will damage oranges than grapefruit.  (4) Quality of Fruit. —Fruit which is fancy in other respects will repay more care than a lower grade. If one is raising small fruit on white-fly and scale-infested trees, and russeted by mites and melanose, a few thrip marks in addition will be a minor matter.  (5) Possibility of a Combination Spray .—If one is spraying with other in¬ secticides at blooming time it will usually pay to add the nicotine sulphate, where spraying for thrips alone oftentimes   would not pay. For instance, in one grapefruit grove the owner was spraying to control citrus scab. There was an av¬ erage of only ten thrips per bloom. Yet we estimated that the improvement of the appearance of the fruit on a block where nicotine sulphate was added to the lime- sulphur paid twice over for the cost of the insecticide; but it would not have paid for the entire cost of spraying. We have had similar results in groves which were being sprayed with bordeaux oil.  DESTROY WEEDS ABOUT THE GROVE  As a preventative measure against an infestation of thrips, it is important that weeds whose blossoms are breeding- grounds for thrips, should be kept down in and about the citrus grove during win¬ ter. Most growers practice clean culture in their groves during winter. But some low-hammock groves are never cultivated and in some groves on drained land there are often waste places, especially along ditch banks, which grow weeds. Other growers are inclined to allow weeds to grow under the trees where the cultivator does not reach and also in fence corners. One of the most common weeds in such places is the white-blossomed Spanish bayonet, Bidens leucantha (L) Wild. A blossom head of this plant will harbor as many thrips as a citrus blossom and, when allowed to bloom in a citrus grove, is a source of continuous infestation to the citrus. Indeed, experience during 1921 demonstrates that it is useless to spray cit¬ rus groves for thrips where these weeds are allowed to bloom. In one grove ob¬ served, these weeds were present only in       part of it. The difference in the appear- is very important that these weeds be cut, ance of the fruit was striking. One could not only in the grove but about the mar- easily point out by inspecting the fruit gins as well. This should be done by Jan- whether or not it came from the portions uary, so that the thrips will die before the of the grove infested by these weeds. It citrus trees begin to bloom.@@         
 Cover Crops and Humus@@   E. F. DeBusk,@@ Tavares@@   The difference between some of our good citrus soils and a mass of sand lies in the amount of organic matter in the former. The sand is the frame-work; the organic matter is the material that cements the frame together into a structure that functions.  We have what is known as active and inactive organic matter. The latter is usually known as humus, but this paper will treat to some extent organic matter in its various forms, and relations to crop production.  Organic matter in the soil is essential to crop production in general. This is fundamental, and no less true in the pro¬ duction of citrus fruits. It is generally conceded that most of our Florida citrus soils are lacking in this essential soil con¬ stituent. I shall discuss briefly how and to what extent this deficiency of organic matter affects maximum production of citrus fruits, and how this integral con¬ stituent of our citrus soils may be supplied most economically. Technical discussions of the subject will be avoided as far as possible.  Let us consider the correlation of the organic matter in our soil with: (i), its physical condition; (2), the chemical change that takes place; (3), its bacterial flora. In this brief paper the last two   divisions must come under one discussion.  During the drought through which we are just passing, attention has been called very forcefully to the relative water-hold¬ ing capacity of the same type of soil in different groves and under different soil managements. The fact that organic matter increases the water-holding power of our citrus soils has been clearly dem¬ onstrated, and needs only to be stressed at this psychological time. Failure on the part of many of our growers to prepare for these occasional droughts has cost the fruit industry many thousands of dollars in loss of fruit and withered trees. While these droughts come so few and far be¬ tween that they scarcely make an impres¬ sion, still at the same time many of our growers lose fruit and growth every spring that could be saved if more atten¬ tion were given to building up the organic content of the soil. The sand particles of our soils can hold but very little capillary moisture, the kind of moisture that our trees depend upon. The more decaying organic matter that can be added to this frame-work of the soil, the greater the percentage of capillary water over that of the hygroscopic water, and consequently the greater the percentage of the total wa¬ ter content of the soil that can be delivered to the growing crop. Organic matter,      therefore, increases the water-absorbing or receiving capacity of the soil and in turn increases its power to deliver the goods to the growing plant.  We must not lose sight of the fact that the loss of moisture under drought condi¬ tions is not the only loss suffered by a soil deficient in organic matter. A greater loss in many cases comes through abnor¬ mal leaching of essential and expensive plant food, especially nitrates. Our cit¬ rus soils, as a rule, have a very porous sub-soil and permit free downward pas¬ sage of soil water, carrying much plant food in solution. Leaching of nitrates is often the limiting factor in maximum crop production in a grove. This can be over¬ come in a large measure by deepening and building up the organic constituent of the top soil, forming a sponge-like mass to ab¬ sorb more plant food as it goes into solu¬ tion. Deep-rooting cover crops will aid much in building a deeper soil. Attention should be given to this soil building while the trees are young or even before the grove has been set.  Adding organic matter to some of our sandy citrus soils is like tightening the hoops on a dry rain barrel. It is said that a cubic foot of soil high in organic con¬ tent can hold twice as much water as a cubic foot of sand.  In crop production, there is a close and very important relation between the flora of the soil and chemical changes that take place in same. Right here I should like to say, it is my humble opinion that the solution of some of our big problems in citrus fruit production will be solved only through a more extensive knowledge of   the flora of the soil and its relation to higher plant growth. It is interesting to note here that we must depend largely upon the action of bacteria to bring about decay of organic matter and to make chemical changes necessary to plant growth, and that these bacteria as well as other necessary soil organisms derive their source of energy from the organic matter of the soil. A rich bacterial flora, there¬ fore, depends upon an adequate supply of organic matter in the soil. When a citrus soil becomes deficient in organic matter the action of necessary soil organisms is greatly impaired, resulting in poor crops and often diseased trees.  A large percentage of our plant food comes from organic sources and depends upon the action of bacteria to render the plant food therein available to plants. The plant food in all animal and vegetable matter, such as bone, tankage, guano, cot¬ ton-seed meal, tobacco stems, etc., must undergo decay through certain micro-or¬ ganisms before it can be used by the or¬ ange tree. The organic nitrogen must be converted by the action of ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria before it is avail¬ able to the plant. Keep in mind that these bacteria depend upon the organic matter of the soil for their energy. Organic mat¬ ter of the soil also has a beneficial effect upon the inorganic constituents of our fertilizers. Organic acid compounds formed by the decomposition of organic matter change insoluble potassium and phosphorus compounds into soluble form. Carbon dioxide, which comes from de¬ composition of organic matter, increases the solvent power of soil water on phos-             phate, and potash salts. Thus we see that an adequate supply of organic matter im¬ proves the soil as a foothold for plants, and increases both directly and indirectly the available food supply of the crop.  It can be readily seen that soils defi¬ cient in organic matter are not in condi¬ tion to make the best use of commercial fertilizers. Right here is the moth that eats a hole in many a grower’s wallet. Expensive fertilizers are applied and ex¬ pected results are not realized because of poor delivery of the soil due to a lack of organic matter.  Many of our growers are depending upon commercial fertilizers alone to main¬ tain soil productivity. The results will be¬ come more and more disappointing. Or¬ ganic matter must be supplied from other sources, the most practical and most eco¬ nomical of which is through the growing and turning under of cover crops. In many cases animal manure may be used. The soil should be well stocked with or¬ ganic matter while the grove is young or even before it is set, and this stock should never be allowed to run down. This can be done by growing and turning under velvet beans, beggarweed, cowpeas, and several of the grasses. Some of these crops should be mowed a time or two dur¬ ing the season, in time to partially decay before the crop is turned under in Novem¬ ber. Where the root system of old trees will not permit deep plowing, the cover   crop should be cut with a disc so that it can be turned under by plowing shallow. Both cover crops and manure should be well incorporated with the soil.  Velvet beans, and in many cases cow- peas, should be planted in rows and cul¬ tivated a few times to give the best re¬ sults. In sowing beggarweed, prepare the seed bed thoroughly just before the rainy season begins, and while it is yet fresh sow the seed with something like a cyclone seeder, and leave it. Don’t harrow the seed in. Three to ten pounds per acre should give a good stand. As the trees grow larger, shading the ground more, and the soil becomes better, the grass cover crops should, under usual condi¬ tions, be sufficient to keep up the organic content of the soil. This, however, de¬ pends upon the character of the soil and cultural methods followed. Where the trees are close and the ground largely shaded, much less organic matter will ox¬ idize than where trees are wide apart and the soil kept bare through the hot season, and consequently not so much cover crop is needed to replace wasted organic mat¬ ter. Between these two extremes we find innumerable conditions affecting the sup¬ ply of organic matter in the soil. In pro¬ portion as this integral soil constituent is supplied and maintained can the soil make the most adequate use of our sunshine and rain, and of the commercial fertilizers ap¬ plied.@@   
 Refrigeration and Pre-Cooling of Citrus Fruits@@   J. W. Andrews,@@ Pre-cooling Engineer@@  The subject of “Packing and Shipment of Citrus Fruits” is so broad and compli¬ cated that I have chosen to treat upon only one phase of its problems, viz: on the ap¬ plication of refrigeration and pre-cooling.  The use of the physical state of “cool¬ ing” to assist in the keeping of perishables is of ancient origin. Since the develop¬ ment of modern ice making and refriger¬ ating machines, the subject has become of deep interest to those who grow and mar¬ ket perishables in the warmer climates. This development has caused, in recent years, the formation of a system of spe¬ cially designed “refrigerator” cars which are in increasing heavy demand for move¬ ment of the highly perishable commodi¬ ties.  Any discussion of the value of refrig¬ eration for the movement of citrus fruits must necessarily be based upon some pre¬ determined data as to what point on the thermometer scale it is most desirable to reach. Cooling, in the first place, tends to keep fruits and vegetables fresh and to hold back the ripening process. It re¬ duces the rate of, but does not eliminate respiration of all vegetation and, in doing so, tends to keep within the commodity its water content. Aside from this desirable feature we have the equally important one   with Florida Citrus Exchange, Tampa  of retarding decay. Competent scientific investigators seem to have established that blue mold, an ever present fungus disease of our citrus fruits, develops quite slowly below 40 degrees F. while it becomes active at temperatures from 50 degrees upward. Stem end rot, whether due to Phomopsis citri or Diplodia, seems to be comparatively slow in its development at temperatures around 50 degrees and al¬ most dormant at 40 degrees. As these de¬ cays are responsible for most of Florida’s losses in distribution, refrigeration has, within the last few years, assumed a prominent place in our marketing scheme.  The rate of cooling in a refrigerator car depends largely on the arrangement of ice bunkers and the nature of floor, together with the general arrangement of load. In the case of plain box bunker equipment without floor racks the air circulation is often so retarded that cars promptly moved to eastern markets can reach des¬ tination before a desirable “keeping” tem¬ perature is reached. If vertical air col¬ umns are maintained along the sides of car ice chambers and a false, slatted floor is provided, the general average temper¬ ature drop is materially hastened. As a rule, however, a Florida car moving in our fall or spring months is from 3^4 to 5 days on its journey before the temper-           ature average of its load is reduced to 45 degrees.  Within the last few years there has been a decided drift toward the idea of pre¬ cooling in many of the fruit and vegetable centers of our country. Pre-cooling, as we are accustomed to speak of it, means a forced process of refrigeration, this be¬ ing done as soon after the fruit is picked as is consistent with modern packing and handling methods. This is done usually by means of mechanical refrigeration in rooms especially designed and heat insu¬ lated. At present there are six pre-cooling plants in this State and, roughly estimat¬ ing, they represent a capital outlay of over one-half million dollars. Should each one of these plants operate at full capacity they could put out a total of over 50 cars per day. While definite figures are impossi¬ ble at this time, it is safe to say that 2,000 cars of citrus fruits and 500 cars of vege¬ tables will roll pre-cooled from Florida this season.  If the process of pre-cooling is to be¬ come widely distributed over our State it must hold out, for our consideration, some basic economic merit. To date it bids fair to do this, as it is possible to rap¬ idly reduce the temperature of perishables to a point where decay is practically ar¬ rested. It also appears, from records carefully compiled, that under favorable conditions, the pre-cooled method of ship¬ ment can be done with financial gain as compared with the present standard re¬ frigeration method. In moving a pre- cooled shipment it is entirely feasible to properly cool the fruit within 24 hours; load it into a car with the bunkers filled   with ice and then ship it to destination without further icing providing the time in transit does not exceed 11 or 12 days in the winter months and from 8 to 10 days during the fall or spring months.  The process of pre-cooling cannot be considered as a cure-all for our many cit¬ rus ills. It should only be used as an aid in marketing and should never be consid¬ ered as a preserving or pickling process. Let us consider the case of one single or¬ ange: First it becomes injured in the picking process; it then goes to the pack¬ ing house and stands there for a day or two, after which it is dumped into a soak¬ ing tank heavily charged with blue mold spores. From this tank it goes through the packing house routine and finally into a cooler, where the temperature is reduced to a point around 50 degrees. The chances are that this orange will never en¬ ter into consumption. However, if the in¬ jured orange had been put through the house in a reasonable time and had been properly cooled, the odds would have be¬ come reversed and any tendency for the development of decay would have prob¬ ably been arrested enough to allow it to make for its grower a satisfied final cus¬ tomer.  Let us consider for a minute the diffi¬ culties which nature and the industry have devised to worry the engineer who plans on extracting the heat from the modern package of citrus fruits. An orange is over 90% water and water has the highest specific heat of any known substance. Added to this, nature has surrounded the liquid contents with a covering composed of light, pithy material which ranks very      high as an insulator against the transmis¬ sion of heat. For these reasons it takes, under favorable conditions, at least one hour to cool one orange from 85 degrees downward to 40 degrees. In order to fur¬ ther complicate the cooling process, this orange is now wrapped in a layer of pa¬ per, thus adding an extra layer of heat insulation and also creating a dead-air space between the orange and its wrapper. After this the orange is placed in a box with others and the loose paper of the wraps is carefully tucked between the sev¬ eral fruits, making it extremely hard to even force an air circulation through the packed box.  These conditions have so complicated the situation that now, under the most fa¬ vorable circumstances, it will require about 6 hours to cool the several oranges in the box through the 85 to 40 degree range, and to this we must add another hour if the so-called “wad pack” is used. These last figures as to time are given for concentrated cooling effort on a single box and must be multiplied by at least three or four when a large number of boxes are stacked in a typical pre-cooling room. From the foregoing it can be seen that we have come up, step by step, from one hour to approximately one day and, with im¬ proper air pressure and distribution, to¬ gether with other minor details, it is easily possible to consume two days’ time in reaching a desirably low and uniform temperature.  Pre-cooling carries with it many new responsibilities for the individuals or as¬ sociations who choose to adopt it. Under the standard refrigeration method as fur¬   nished by our common carriers it is cus¬ tomary to order an iced car, load it and await results. With pre-cooling, the en¬ tire order is changed. All that can be done to deliver the fruit to market in sound condition must be done before the car doors are sealed. First, the manage¬ ment is entrusted with properly pre-cool¬ ing the fruit to a desired temperature. Again, only such cars as are in good con¬ dition should be used, as cracks at door¬ ways, hatches and similar defects are sure to add elements of danger in transit. The proper amount of ice must be supplied be¬ fore the car leaves for its destination. If any one of these three items is neglected, the chances for sound delivery are less¬ ened and the process can soon become a heavy liability instead of a valuable asset.  The fundamentals of pre-cooling as well as its possibilities have long been de¬ termined. Much work of an investiga¬ tional nature has been done by the United States Department of Agriculture, dating from 1907. Much of this work was done in California during a four-year study of conditions there and later the work was continued in Florida. In this investiga¬ tion it was practically determined that it was not commercially advisable to attempt pre-cooled shipments from California to the far eastern markets unless re-icing was done at least once in transit, this being made necessary by the length of time re¬ quired for the trip. Florida conditions are, as a rule, entirely different in that our principal markets are much nearer as re¬ gards both distance and time. During the last two seasons I am not aware of any pre-cooled cars that have been re-iced in            transit from Florida plants. A careful study of individual car records on approx¬ imately 2,000 shipments warrants the statement that transit re-icing is not neces¬ sary from this State under normal ship¬ ping conditions if fruit is properly cooled and iced before shipment.  In closing, I wish to voice the convic¬ tion that pre-cooling is with us to stay. Its advantages are becoming more and more apparent each season and it will, in the not far distant future, become a truly   important branch of the State’s marketing operations. Of necessity it will be limited to the larger producing centers and larger packing houses, as the overhead charges incident to its adoption preclude its uni¬ versal use. Notwithstanding this added expense, to the house that ships under re¬ frigeration 50,000 boxes or more yearly, it becomes of great interest and, if proper¬ ly handled, it will soon demonstrate its value.@@   
 Spraying for the Control of the Florida  Red Scale@@   W. W. Yothers,@@ Bureau of Entomology,@@ Orlando@@   The adult females of this scale are ex¬ ceedingly resistant to the effects of the oil emulsion insecticides. The usual dilutions of oil emulsion do not produce any mor¬ tality on them at all. The crawling young, recently settled young or first instar and males are readily killed by the usual dilu¬ tion of the oil sprays. The usual recom¬ mendation heretofore for controlling this pest has been two sprayings at an inter¬ val of a month or six weeks with a spray mixture containing i% of oil in the di¬ luted material. The first application was designed to kill all young stages. The in¬ terval of time would then permit the adult females present to finish depositing eggs when they will die, and all the eggs will then have hatched and have developed into young scales. The second application was then intended to kill these young stages. While these recommendations were usually followed by beneficial results they never produced a mortality that could be called entirely satisfactory. A heavy infestation of this scale on the trees grow¬ ing on the laboratory grounds gave us an opportunity to conduct further experi¬ ments for its control.  TESTS WITH I % OIL  One Application .—July 28, 1921; ex¬ amined August 4, 1921. Used 50 gallons   spray (emulsion made from y 2 Corvus,. y 2 Nabob oil). Killed all young stages that had begun to form a covering, but after turning over more than 500 adult females not a single one was observed to have been killed. Normal eggs and crawl¬ ing young were present. A second exam¬ ination of ten leaves made August 15th, or eighteen days after the application, gave 280 living and 25 dead adult females.. Normal eggs and crawling young were present in great abundance.  Two Applications .—July 28 (1%),  August 16 (1 y%). Emulsion July 28th made of J 4 Corvus and Nabob; August 16th all Nabob. Used 50 gallons of mate¬ rial and sprayed the same trees on August 16th as given under 1% application. Ex¬ amined August 24th or eight days after application. Recently settled young had been killed. On ten leaves there were 228 living and 166 dead adult females, or 58% living. Many crawlers were alive and numerous eggs appeared normal. A sec¬ ond examination of 25 leaves made Au¬ gust 30th, or 14 days after application, gave 254 living and 238 dead adult fe¬ males or 51.6% living. A third examina¬ tion of 10 leaves made September 20th gave 151 living and 137 dead adult fe¬ males or 52.4% living. There were not               so many eggs and crawlers as is usually present—perhaps not more than 20% of the females had either eggs or crawlers. Quite a number of first instar young were present. A single tree in the front yard was sprayed June 15th and again July 28th with 1% oil. On August 15th there were 117 living and 43 dead adult females present on 13 leaves or 73% living. Eggs and crawlers were present but all recently settled young had been killed.  Three 'Applications. — Sprayed July 28th, 1%; August 16th, 0/2%, and Sep¬ tember 20th, 1%. Used 50 gallons of material and sprayed same trees on Sep¬ tember 20th as given under one and two application tests. Examined September 29th or nine days after spraying. An ex¬ amination of 25 leaves gave 178 living and 227 dead adult females or 44% liv¬ ing. There were also 67 living females nearly adult which were beneath other scales, 283 crawlers and 156 normal eggs. A final examination was made December 7th, when 29 living adult females were found on 15 leaves. The three applica¬ tions certainly reduced the red scale, but enough were left for a rapid re-infesta¬ tion. The health of the trees improved and no damage was done to the limbs or foliage, but some spotting was done to the fruit.  TESTS WITH 2% OIL  One Application. — Sprayed August 16th; used 50 gallons material. Emulsion made of Nabob. On August 24th or eight days after spraying, an examination of 10 leaves gave 53 living and 199 dead adult females or 21% living. A second examination of 33 leaves made on August   30th, or 14 days after, treatment, gave 82 living and 332 dead adult females, or 19.8%. It is thus seen that there were as many dead eight days after spraying as there were on 14 days. On September 20th sprayed additional trees infested with red scale. On September 29th an exami¬ nation of 25 leaves gave 344 dead and 9 living adult females. Only 3 crawlers and 32 eggs were counted. A final examina¬ tion was made on December 7th, and we were unable to find enough leaves with scale on them to make a count. This sin¬ gle application of 2% produced highly satisfactory results.  Two Applications .—Two per cent— J 4 Corvus, J 4 Nabob. Sprayed August 16th and September 20th. Examined September 29th. On 25 leaves there were 198 dead and 5 living adult females, 6 nearly adult females beneath other scales, 3 crawlers and 12 apparently normal eggs. On December 7th there were no scales present, so no count was made.  TESTS WITH 3 % OIL  On August 16th we sprayed four rows of nursery trees using 3% Nabob oil. The work was most carelessly done. On August 24th an examination of 10 leaves gave 414 living and 344 dead adult fe¬ males or 54% alive. The test with 2% applied when I was present gave 21% alive. Subsequent observations certainly indicated that many were left unharmed by the spray. A second examination made on August 31st gave 476 living and 369 dead adult females, or 56 1-3% liv¬ ing. Owing to the unsatisfactory results obtained spraying August 16th, it was       thought best to repeat the experiment. On September 20th the same trees were sprayed again and an additional row in¬ cluded. On the trees sprayed once Sep¬ tember 20th there were on September 29th, 676 dead and 23 living adult fe¬ males, 19 almost mature females beneath other scales and 117 crawlers and 126 eggs. On December 7th there were 13 living females on 15 leaves. The trees had vastly improved in appearance and few scales could be found.  Two Applications .—Three per cent sprayed August 16th and September 20th. Examined September 29th. On 25 leaves there were 696 dead and 4 living adult fe¬ males, 22 almost mature females under other scales, 19 crawlers and 10 apparent¬ ly normal eggs. On December 7th there were not enough scales present to make a count. The tree had improved in appear¬ ance.  Check .—December 7th. On one leaf there were 25 living adult females. The scale generally was most abundant and had defoliated many of the trees.  All of the tests with 3% of oil were made on sour seedlings about 4 feet in height. The tests with 2% were made on small sour seedlings and both budded and sour seedlings about 6 to 8 feet in height. The tests with 1 % were made on budded trees about 8 feet in height. While great care should be exercised in using strong dilutions of oil emulsion to bearing trees, one application containing 2% of oil is reasonably safe if the fruit is iy 2 or 2 inches in diameter.   conclusion  From the foregoing tests and experi¬ ments the following conclusions may be drawn:  1. A single spraying with a mixture containing 1% of oil is not satisfactory.  2. Two sprayings are not satisfactory if given at an interval of only two weeks.  3. Two may be fairly satisfactory if most thoroughly applied at an interval of about six weeks.  4. Three applications of 1% may be satisfactory to control this pest.  5. One application containing 2% of oil will produce satisfactory results if thoroughly applied.  6 . One application of 3% will also produce satisfactory results, if applied thoroughly.  7. Neither 2% nor 3% will give satis¬ factory results if carelessly applied.  Krome: If Mr. Yothers’ subject is of as much interest to the other members of the society as it is to me, and if the Florida red scale has done to others as it has done in my grove, I am quite sure that some of the members might wish to ask some questions. I am sure he would be glad to give you any information you might wish. Mr. Yothers, does the 3% injure the fruit in any way?  Yothers: I should have brought that out in my paper. It was used on nursery trees, but I used the three applications of 1% on bearing trees that had fruit on them.           -: Do you conduct experiments  during warm weather?  Yothers: The sunlight was very hot along about September 20th, about the hottest weather of last year. No, I guess the hottest was in May, but I remember it was extremely hot.  -: What per cent of oil should  be used in spraying?  Sadler: Use 1 to 63, and in using Fico, 1 to 60, and Ideal paste, the same. They contain 63 to 65% of oil.  Last year we used the paste and it took all the leaves and the fruit. Had very satisfactory results in spraying for white fly; sprayed Dec. 1st, but in every case had some leaves fall and scalding of fruit.  -: How satisfactory is it in us¬ ing hard water?  Sadler: We use Mt. Dora well water and it is 135 feet deep, very hard and called good drinking water.  Krome: You did not do anything to break it?  Sadler: No. I have had a fourth of a tree killed by spray. I think it was due to a little oil on the surface of the last of the tank. I know too much oil will kill everything and that happened while I was not present. We have to have dependable help in spraying trees.  Krome: When I used the water with¬ out breaking I got that same burning that you got.  -: Mr. Chairman, I used to have  the same experience in my groves from free oil in the bottom of the tank. When   a product is put on the market it should be dependable and not allow the grower run a risk like this. I have seen lots of fruit that has been burned and also de¬ stroyed by the spraying.  Yothers: You will get some shadow¬ ing, even when the soluble sulphur is used with the oil. That is the only objection we find to the use of oil in the trees. It does produce some shadowing when the temperature is very hot. That shadowing can be eliminated by a slight mixture of Bordeaux Mixture. I am not prepared to say how little a quantity of Bordeaux will prevent shadowing. I regret to say that is the only objection the oil emulsion has, there will be some shadowing. In Pinel¬ las county, because the emulsion produces that shadowing, they spray in winter time. They stop spraying in summer time and spray about twice in the winter time, and let it go at that.  -: Will not the use of hydrate of  lime prevent that shadowing?  Yothers: I don’t know.  Krome: I have tried the use of hvdrate of lime and it prevented any shadowing. My experience with soluble sulphur has been directly in line with yours. I have had severe shadowing and burning and it is traced directly to the use of soluble sul¬ phur.  Sadler: Can you mix lime sulphur with oil emulsion?  Yothers: That is a rather delicate question to answer. Several people have mixed lime sulphur with oil emulsion. In fact I think if used by the proper grower, is all right. I know one grower in Orange           county that has used that combination for three years. He is a small operator and he looks in every tank before and after, and he never has any trouble and I have used the combination and it seems to be all right when used right. I would say that it is a rather dangerous combination unless you are very careful what you are doing. I rather think it is all right if you   feel confident of your ability to handle the mixture.  -: Have you had any burning  by the use of Bordeaux oil?  Yothers: I think not, not since 1917 have we had any injury. Mr. Krome just advised me that there was some injury done at his place.@@        
 Another Apparently New Entomogenous Fungus from the Hammock@@   E. W. Berger,@@ Entomologist, State Plant Board,@@ Gainesville@@   The subject of this paper as it was orig¬ inally handed to the secretary, read as follows: “Another Apparently New En¬ tomogenous Fungus from the Ham¬ mock.” However, as I plan, in part at least, to give again my discussion on “New Strains of Entomogenous Fungi,” presented before the Citrus Seminar at the University last October, I will now add that subject to the one printed in the program and discuss it first, after making a few brief general statements.  For the benefit of any who are not fa¬ miliar with the subject of diseases that de¬ stroy insects, I should explain that very many insects are destroyed annually by fungus parasites peculiar to them. It is a remarkable fact, furthermore, that the diseases of insects consist mostly of fungi, although there are a few bacterial dis¬ eases known. Useful as well as injurious insects are destroyed (the honey bee among the useful), but the importance of the subject to the citrus grower and hor¬ ticulturist in general, lies in the fact that many injurious insects are greatly reduced and often controlled by their diseases. This is particularly true of white flies and scale insects often found infesting citrus trees. I sometimes doubt whether there   would be such an extensive citrus industry in Florida today if it had not been for the assistance of the fungus parasites of scale insects and later of white flies. Some of you may recall my stating some years ago that, back in the 3o’s, when scale in¬ sects were first discovered in the citrus plantings at Mandarin and later at St. Augustine, these insects nearly killed the trees until probably the White-Headed Scale-Fungus (Ophionectria coccicola)*, if not other fungi also, controlled the scales and the trees began to recover and produce fruit. This happened after the growers had failed to control the scale by artificial means.  I may further explain, that for the past six years the Entomological Department of the State Plant Board has been arti¬ ficially growing the Red Whitefly-Fun- gus and the Yellow Whitefly-Fungus, and more recently several others, in the laboratory and furnishing them to grow¬ ers at 75 cents per culture. A rather com¬ prehensive account of the entomogenous fungi, known at the time the paper was published, can be found in Vol. V, No. 3,  ^Identity of fungus surmised from Fig. 2, Plate II. Insects affecting the Orange, 1885.— Hubbard.       1921, of the Quarterly Bulletin of the State Plant .Board. Reprints of this ac¬ count are available at the Plant Board Exhibit, Hotel Thelma, or they can be ob¬ tained by addressing the State Plant Board, Gainesville, Florida.  At the exhibit just referred to, the wri¬ ter is also showing cultures of the several entomogenous (insect-living) fungi that he has been growing: Two strains of the Red Aschersonia, one each of the Yellow Aschersonia, the Goldiana Fungus, the Orange-colored Fungus, the Cuban Aschersonia, and the Cephalosporium Fungus.  Heretofore we have listed five fungi as known to be parasitic on whiteflies in Florida: namely, Red Aschersonia  (Aschersonia cdeyrodis), Yellow Ascher¬ sonia ( Aschersonia flavo-citrina), Brown Fungus ( Aegerita webberi), White- Fringe Fungus ( Microcera sp.), and Cin¬ namon Fungus ( Verticillium heterocla- dum). On the so-called Armored Scales (hard-shelled scales) there are four: Red¬ headed Scale-Fungus ( Sphaerostilbe coc - cophila)*, Pink Scale-Fungus ( Microcera fugikuroi), White-headed Scale-Fungus (Ophionectria coccicola ), and Black Scale Fungus ( Myriangium duriaei). For the so-called Soft Scales, including the Flor¬ ida Wax Scale, we have three: The Cu¬ ban Aschersonia ( Aschersonia cubensis ), the Turbinate Fungus ( Aschersonia tur- binata), and the Cephalosporium Fungus (Cephalosporium lecanii).   *The name of this fungus, probably also of some others as listed in this paragraph, will very likely be changed in future publications. [Two papers by T. Petch in the Transactions (1920) of the British Mycological Society.]   In a talk presented at the Citrus Sem¬ inar last October (1921) on “New Strains of Entomogenous Fungi,” I spoke of finding and then recently growing arti¬ ficially a new strain of (1) Red Ascher¬ sonia (5805), or Red Whitefly-Fungus, of growing (2) the Goldiana Fungus (Aschersonia goldiana ), (3) the Cuban Aschersonia, and (4) another yellow aschersonia (5804) (since that time iden¬ tified as the Goldiana Fungus). The first and last of these were taken from fungus material found infecting whitefly larvae on holly and bay collected in a hammock near Winter Park by Messrs. F. M. O’Byrne and C. E. Whittington, in No¬ vember, 1919. The Goldiana Fungus was grown from material that had been re¬ ceived from Cuba at the Experiment Sta¬ tion by Dr. O. F. Burger, and the Cuban Aschersonia from material sent to the writer by Mrs. D. P. Smith of New Smyrna, Florida, where it was controlling the Pyriform Scale infesting guava.  As the information given in my talk at the Citrus Seminar has not been pub¬ lished, I will here briefly review what I stated at that time.  I emphasized the finding and growing of a new strain (No. 5805) of Red Aschersonia, or Red White fly-Fungus, collected on holly (Ilex cassine) in the hammock near Winter Park. It was found infecting an unidentified species of whitefly and was recently re-collected by the writer in the same locality and on the same species of holly. I further explained that this strain of the Red Aschersonia fruited (produced spores) so much better than the other strains of Red Aschersonia            previously grown, that it was decided to grow more of it and try it out on the whitefly. On the Common Whitefly it proved to be as virile, and apparently more so, than any Red Aschersonia previously grown. It also has another desirable char¬ acteristic; namely, that it will fruit satis¬ factorily during the hot weather of June and July, which is something that other strains of Red Aschersonia heretofore grown would not do, it always being nec¬ essary to grow the crop of fungus during late winter and early spring and then plac¬ ing it in cold storage until needed for dis¬ tribution during the period of summer rains.  I explained that the Goldiana Fungus (8687) obtained from Cuba was effective¬ ly active on the Cloudy-Winged Whitefly there and that we planned to get it started on the Cloudy-Winged Whitefly in Flor¬ ida.  It is of interest to note, that the appar¬ ently new yellow fungus (5804) obtained from the hammock and reported upon at the Seminar has been identified by Dr. A. T. Speare, of the U. S. D. A., as Ascher¬ sonia goldiana, or the Goldiana Fungus. That it should be the Goldiana Fungus, namely, the same that exists in Cuba, was something of a surprise. Why it has not spread from the hammock to the white- flies infesting citrus and other cultivated plants in Florida has not been explained. Practical tests contemplated with the two strains of Goldiana Fungus, namely, the one from Cuba and the one from the ham¬ mock near Winter Park, during the com¬ ing summer may give us an answer.  This brings me to the fungus that I   wished principally to display today. I am calling it the Orange-colored Fungus (No. 10592) ( Aschersonia basicystis)*. Last November I visited the hammock at Win¬ ter Park for the purpose of getting fresh material of the Goldiana Fungus when I recognized what appeared to be a slightly different fungus than the Goldiana, but growing on the same leaves with it. Upon growing it artificially in pure cultures it soon showed up differently and character¬ istically. During the latter part of last December Mr. C. A. Reese and myself (each independently) collected the same fungus infecting unidentified whitefly larvae on the common holly (Ilex opaca ) in the woods adjoining Newnans Lake, near Gainesville, Florida. At first we supposed that we had the ordinary Red Whitefly-Fungus, but in artificial cul¬ tures it grows and colors up exactly like Aschersonia basicystis. This gives us two locality records for this fungus in Florida. Dr. Speare, who made the identification of the material from Winter Park for me, had previously referred material of this fungus to Professor T. Petch, of Ceylon, for verification.  The interesting part, however, is the existence of this fungus on a native white¬ fly in Florida and the prospects that it offers us of getting it started on white- flies infesting cultivated plants. The col¬ oration of this fungus when grown on ar¬ tificial culture material is, furthermore, a beautiful orange and I certainly desire that all the ladies should see it at the ex-   *Identified for the writer by Dr. A. T. Speare, U. S. D. A., Washington, D. C.       hibit. It doesn’t matter about the “mere men.”  This brings me to two more fungi found on insects, namely, Aschersonia brunnea Petch*, and the Cephalosporium Fungus previously listed.  The Brunnea Fungus is another species that occurs on the material collected at different times since November, 1919, in the hammock at Winter Park. Personal¬ ly, I am almost convinced that brunnea is a super-parasite on the Cuban Ascher¬ sonia and if that should prove correct it is not an insect-destroying fungus. Cul¬ tures of this fungus have not yet been at¬ tempted.   "Identified for the writer by Dr. A. T. Speare, U. S. D. A., Washington, D. C.   The Cephalosporium Fungus noted has been frequently received and collected, es¬ pecially during the past winter, effectively reducing such scales as the Pyriform Scale, Liriodendron Scale, Tessellated Scale, Coccus acuminatus, and (in the Virgin Islands) Coccus magnifcrca (No. 11057, specimens received from C. E. Wilson, of St. Croix). While this fungus was grown artificially at the Experiment Station by Dr. H. S. Fawcett and the writer some years ago, it now appears that it may play a more important role in the control of certain soft scales than was believed in 1910 (Experiment Station Report, 1910, p. lxii).@@            
 Making Florida Home Grounds Attractive   *   Lantern Slide Talk Given Before the Florida Horticultural Society  at Lakeland@@   William A. Cook,@@ Oneco@@   It is now seventy years since the tragic and untimely death of the father and dean of landscape art in America, Andrew Jackson Downing. But the impress which he made by landscape works achieved, in voluminous writings, and, perhaps more than all else by the genuine inspiration of his life and personality, has had a pro¬ found influence on the thought and view¬ point of the American public toward the profession of landscape design.  But as the ripples created by the drop¬ ping of a stone into a clear surface of wa¬ ter become less and less pronounced as their spread increases, so does the influ¬ ence of such men appear less and less marked as it approaches the outskirts of our vast civilization. Florida, with all her manifest advantages, we must confess (if we will be perfectly sincere about it) is just outgrowing that crude, awkward stage of pioneer life perhaps best likened to the half-grown boy just donning long trousers and smoking his first cigar!  Those who have been responsible for the laying out of our towns and for as¬ sociated civic activities have been, in the main, woefully deficient in broad, con¬   structive vision. It what attempts that have been made toward the beautification of grounds, both public and private, there has too often been a lack of intelligent un¬ derstanding of even the basic principles of art and good taste. All too frequently those who would be most confused and “at sea” if required to paint a canvas or compose a piece of music, seem to imagine that no special talent or study is necessary to lay out attractive grounds.  Do not misunderstand me—I do not mean to imply that the amateur gardener cannot achieve a fair measure of success and derive vast pleasure from the study of the art of landscaping, but he must make some study of the problems involved be¬ fore he can create what will in any sense be an intelligently and comprehensively attractive landscape picture!  The slides that I am going to show this evening, have been especially selected to bring out, first some of the basic princi¬ ples I have mentioned, and secondly to show how it is possible to accomplish vastly more than we have done toward putting Florida on a par with California         in the matter of civic pride and home de¬ velopment.  This first picture was not taken in Italy or Spain, but right here in Florida, and serves to illustrate how graphically real the illusion of Mediterranean life can be recreated in our own land. Further than that, for years I have been stressing the great value and desirability for the gen¬ eral adoption of the Mediterranean type of architecture by Florida builders. Not only is it peculiarly well adapted to our life and climate, but it will serve to lend that atmosphere of rare charm and ro¬ mance so strongly coupled with the name but not the reality of Florida!  This next slide serves to make clear the point that while a plant picture may be grotesque in character, yet it can at least be consistently so! And again in this next view, note the delightful harmony of texture in the several kinds of plants mak¬ ing up the group. Remember that in making your selection of plant materials every element of your composition should contribute to the harmonizing and refin¬ ing of the picture as an entity.  While good lawns in Florida are often not easily obtained, they are always most essential to the completed picture, for without them landscape effects lack the finished foreground so necessary to afford proper proportion to all the various struc¬ tures and planting elements. Note in these several slides how the smooth green lawn gives a feeling of dignity and re¬ pose to the view and how the tree shadows softly lace the surface into a charming net-work of sunlight and shade, a most   important consideration in the location of lawn specimens.  So many times we see a property where there has been considerable attention cen¬ tered on the planting about the house and other buildings and as far as lawn speci¬ mens are concerned, yet as one views the scene there seems to be something lacking in clear definition—the eye and mind travel beyond the property and thought is dissipated in the indefinite beyond. The result is unsatisfying, naturally, and the reason, on more mature consideration, is quite obvious—there is an absence of an embracing border planting to enclose the thought-picture as originally conceived in the mind of the designer. This is a fatal error conspicuous in many otherwise fair¬ ly attractive developments. Virtually it is as though one tacked good pictures on the walls instead of hanging them in frames. For the border planting to any grounds is just as valuable—or more so—and like any picture frame, should be of size, pro¬ portion and design to best elaborate the original conception of the picture itself.  But it is the absence of foundation plantings around houses that expresses the crude, uncultured stage of our growth more than any other one factor. From north to south and east to west of the State it is the same story—bare, ugly, unscreened bases of houses that are more often than not stuck on stilts of concrete or brick or even wooden blocks. Some¬ times these are screened, or partly screened, with lattice in more or less good condition—sufficient perhaps to keep Fido from dragging underneath all the old shoes and bones and other rubbish he can            collect in the neighborhood. If they are screened by lattice, some planting is done as a rule, but this is usually pitifully in¬ adequate and reproachfully unsightly, consisting of ragged wild ferns, scraggly geraniums or scrawny Poinsettia stems. The chief advantage derived from an ab¬ sence of lattice or solid planting seems to consist in giving little Johnny practice in proving his marksmanship by throwing sticks or stones at Fido or the neighbors’ chickens when they lodge under the house.  But, lattice or no lattice, plant that house foundation! Make the building ap¬ pear as though it grew on the land, not just set there. If people think that they can’t afford exotics from the nurseries, let them go to the woods and appropriate the wealth of evergreen materials that na¬ ture has been growing there—she’ll be only too glad to give them to make our homes and towns look more homey and livable and worth while!  The value of the vista in the landscape is not properly understood—but an at* tractive one is always appreciated never¬ theless. Here is a drive which has been built in to a ‘‘continuing” vista—that is, as one drives up to the house on this curved drive, the view, while always shift¬ ing, always preserves the elements of a good vista. And at no time is the build¬ ing ever seen in its entirety—always there is something obscured, something left to the imagination and to be anticipated just beyond. This is landscape art in its ut¬ most refinement.  But vistas are often spoiled—note how in this one the long, low, horizontal lines of the building are broken by these tall   spire-like cypress trees planted on each side of the broad entrance—defeating the very genius of the architect of the struc¬ ture. And, again note how the entrance has been obscured by this mass planting, which also in turn blocks the view down the drive from the house.  On the other hand, note how in this sec¬ ond instance the landscape architect has preserved the long horizontal lines in a building of similar proportions, not only in respect to the position of the plants, but their character—note how many of the trees and larger shrubs are horizontal in habit and growth. In this connection, note this garden vista—the way is long and narrow and the straight vista lines of walk and lattice fence and border plant¬ ings all conform and focus on the garden feature at the terminus.  The planning of drives and walks is frequently poorly done—so many ama¬ teurs think that a drive or walk must of necessity be curved and so many times we see short approaches on restricted areas which should be straight made tortuously crooked in mistaken conception of purpose and vain attempt at naturalistic effect. Remember that it is quite as necessary to know when a drive or walk should be di¬ rect as when it may be informally curved. Either type may be inappropriately at fault under varying conditions.  When one mentions “formal garden” most people are dismayed and envision great sunken gardens and terraces and costly ornamentation. As a matter of fact a formal garden may be as simple as the most unpretentious property would justify. It might be a quite tiny hedge-         encompassed area with just a cozy tea house, miniature mirror-pool, a palm or two, perhaps an overhanging shade tree, and borders of annuals along the back¬ ground and edging the walks. Frequently they can be combined with the rose garden so much sought by “ flower-lovers” in the South as well as North.  Or the garden close may be strictly in¬ formal in character, as is this delightful “out-of-doors living room”—I like that expression, “out-of-doors living room”— it so aptly conveys the real purpose of the enclosed garden. And for those of us who are favored in being able to live in Florida where our climate permits an out- of-door life almost every day of the year, no house is truly a home in the fullest ex¬ pression until the owner can pride himself in one!  Primitively the pergola was merely a vine-covered passageway from one point to another, but in our modern carelessness in definition we use the word to include any structure with “open-work” overhead. Such structures serve a variety of pur¬ poses—as a covered way, as a terminal feature to a garden view, especially as strengthening the axial line, as a bound¬ ary treatment in itself, as a means in pic¬ ture-composition to secure repetition of the motif of the dominant architectural scheme, and then in a variety of less im¬ portant ways for rest houses, tea houses, entrance ways with infinite variation. But never, never, never set them out in the open lawn, there to have to stand with detached and meaningless expression, pit¬ ifully alone and about as fitted to the im¬   mediate environment as an ice factory at the north pole!  In the garden picture there is nothing serves quite so well to lend an atmosphere of charm and interest as the pool. This may be large enough for a pond or as tiny almost as “mi’ lady's kerchief,” but always serving as a mirror in which are reflected blue sky, fleecy white clouds, the col¬ umned pergola, towering palm and dimin¬ utive plants that margin the rim. But it can be overdone, and this first picture shows how one amateur “fell down” on the undertaking. Note that the pool is all out of proportion to the area involved, the location poor, the rim too high and the pile of rock in the center surmounted by a sprinkler stand-pipe is all out of keeping with the material and environment. There are other errors of technique such as the location of the sun dial, poor treat¬ ment of planting and so on, but note par¬ ticularly the pool and compare with this next slide. What delightful atmosphere —what refinement of design—what ex¬ quisite composition—what perfect har¬ mony of thought and purpose in concep¬ tion and execution!  Our State has far more lakes within its confines than any other, yet I think no¬ where is the value of water so little appre¬ ciated. Perhaps it is because of this very fact in itself that the neglect arises, but be that as it may, it is none the less disap¬ pointing to those who can vision the tre¬ mendous potential value of our magnifi¬ cent length of coast line and unnumbered lakes to see them so consistently ignored. From the scenic standpoint alone they are our one greatest asset, yet so obsessed are               we with the desire to have groves and the idea that a lake on a property is so much waste area that we are selfishly, blindly, and ignorantly wiping out much that might some day make our State a second “Paradise Regained.” It is the same way with the unintelligent road system that has prevailed in the past, and our general deficiencies in respect to civic effort and enterprise—we have sacrificed many of our best interests through narrow, short¬ sighted policies that are threatening to en¬ gulf many of our greatest potential assets.  I know so many people of delightful taste and most excellent judgment for in¬ terior decoration who commit veriest atrocities out-of-doors. To them a string of ragged, lonely, dejected-looking Poin- settias strung along the house foundation is perfectly all right and to cut up the lawn with a meaningless array of horti¬ cultural “junk” is perfectly legitimate. They can expatiate at length on the value of composition, and line in illustration, of texture and design in fabrics, of composi¬ tion and tone-harmony in music, yet al¬ most any old thing looks all right in the yard or on the lawn!  Now the one particular message I have for you tonight is this—it is our duty as disciples and exponents of those things that are useful and worth while in the daily life of our people, to carry the mes¬   sage of art and cultured good taste in home surroundings abroad throughout the State. And what is useful and worth while? Victor Hugo answered that when he wrote—“The beautiful is as useful as the useful—more so, perhaps!”  This is the viewpoint we must inculcate in the minds and hearts of our people. I recall giving a talk in a certain town which had had considerable advance publicity. One man said when the purpose of the lecture was explained to him: “Well, if that fellow would talk about how to get grits and bacon maybe I’d go up to hear him!”  That is the crude, short-sighted, waste¬ ful, narrow and distressingly provincial frame of mind which must be corrected if we are ever to have a genuine expression of culture in the State. And by culture, do not misunderstand me—I do not mean “high-brow” affectation, but rather that simple, wholesome enjoyment of the truly worth while things of life. One philoso¬ pher aptly put it about like this—“Culture may be measured by one’s capacity to en¬ joy a variety of good things.”  And we might not inappropriately add —not the least amongst these “good things” should be an artistic and sympa¬ thetic appreciation of the gentle art of gardening!@@    
 State Beautification and Conservation@@   Mrs. A. B. Whitman,@@ Orlando@@   In the brief space of ten or twelve min¬ utes it is not possible to go very thorough¬ ly into either division of the subject as¬ signed me. The phase of State Beautifi¬ cation given me to present this evening for the purpose of calling forth a general discussion is “The Possibilities of a State Flower Show from the Standpoint of the State Federation of Women’s Clubs.” The line of Conservation which I have chosen from the divisions of that work in the Florida Federation of Women’s Clubs because of its possible interest for a gath¬ ering of this kind, is that of Highway Beautification, and I shall consider this second topic first.  It is a matter of regret and surprise that among our own home people there is so little realization of the fact that conserva¬ tion of our natural growth means a won¬ derful state-wide beautification, some¬ thing distinctive, novel, luxuriant, and possible with the least outlay of time and funds.  All over the State at the present time plans are under way for building and maintaining a splendid system of hard¬ surfaced highways and along with plans for this work are plans for highway beau¬ tification. Our bond issues provide for engineers but not for landscape architects, and the ornamental work along our high¬   ways depends upon the interest and knowledge of volunteer groups, willing to work and anxious to get results and filled with a great desire to do things at once. You all know that this desire to do some¬ thing usually takes the form of cutting something down in order to plant some¬ thing in its place and you also know that engineering work usually has in its scheme of things in road development the abso¬ lute cuttting down and clearing out of everything growing in the right of way.  Our new roads are planned with a very wide right of way, less than half of which is to be taken up with paving and drainage provision and what I should like to see, and there are many who agree with me, is the natural growth, trees, shrubs and scrub palmettoes left along the outer edge of the highway rights of way. I am not as familiar with the habits of growth of the trees and shrubs of other states, but I do know that in Florida the tendency of growth along the roads is for grass to spread out from the paving, then a fringe of shrubs and at the outer edge the trees common to each particular locality, ar¬ ranged by nature according to the best principles of landscaping.  Our ideas of highway planting are mostly taken from the plans followed in other states, states that have little natural           growth, if any, along their roads. Con¬ ditions in Florida are different. Here we have the most advanced road building tak¬ ing place through primeval forests and we have opportunities that others would pay generously for having. We have a won¬ derful wealth of tree and shrub growth differing in different sections of the State. Why not make use of it?  As we all know, soil conditions vary in almost every locality, five miles of road often passing through as many different kinds of growth. In our gardens and groves and farming we consider this fact, but in the articles on highway planting we find no consideration of it, ambitious plans being set forth calling for regular, uniform planting of trees and shrubs for miles of highway and the result is visual¬ ized as a uniformly luxuriant growth of the same kind of planting.  With very little expense the natural growth which is to be found along most of our roads could be cultivated a little, encouraged, added to by plants and trees common to each particular locality, flow¬ ering shrubs gradually added as preda¬ tory cattle and forest fires allow, and at a moderate expense the grass could be kept in flourishing condition along the paving by two or three mowings a year. Such a plan w r ould give us quick results, would give us a highway border that would be of the greatest interest to our visitors from other states and could be carried out with the minimum expense. It would preserve specimens of trees that will soon be almost extinct unless the policy of for¬ est destruction followed in our State can be changed.   We do not have to wait for large funds and better laws before we can make a be¬ ginning in highway improvement. The funds and the laws will come, but in the meantime let us who live along our high¬ ways make our own places attractive; let us plant vines and flowers along our fences, saw off our fence posts to an even line, tear down disfiguring signs and save what nature has given us and before we know it our highways will be vistas of loveliness. While working to attain an ideal we can idealize the attainable.  The Florida Federation is also working for at least one county park in every coun¬ ty. Such a park should preferably be a spot having something distinctive in the way of natural growth; a beautiful tract of untouched high pine land, a jungle-like portion of hammock, a tract of cypress growth. Unless something of this sort is done, the time is near at hand when our State will be as barren of forests or any¬ thing suggesting forest growth, as the prairie states of the West.  With a conservation of natural growth along our highways and county parks in every county, we could in time have a con¬ tinuous botanical garden.  In considering the matter of a State Flower Show I feel that it should be the culmination of stages of preparation rath¬ er than a starting point for flower culture in the State.  A State show to be the success it should if it is to be a credit to Florida, must have the interest and support of the people as a whole rather than of just a few. In or¬ der to get this interest every county must become a possible exhibitor, for if this is       not the case a State show does not deserve the name.  Personally, I do not believe we are ready for a State show.  So far as I know, the first Flower show in our State taking in a whole county and part of another was held last February in Winter Park. This show was planned and carried out by the Winter Park Wo¬ man’s Club and was a wonderful success. In spite of the fact that sufficient time was not given for the growing of specimen flowers or plants, the display was most beautiful and a surprise even to the home people, who had not realized the wealth of bloom and growth around them.  Co-operation and publicity for this ex¬ hibition was secured through the Orange County Federation of Women’s Clubs, and from the results achieved I should like to see, as a preparation for larger shows, a Flower show in every county for at least three years. In this way a general interest in flower exhibits would be se¬ cured, every county would try to have the best show and with the Florida Federation members giving support and assistance and stimulating the movement, I believe the results would be surprising and grati¬ fying. Flower culture appeals to most women and I feel sure that every club¬ woman would lend her support to this work.  At the end of three years it would be possible for each county to perhaps enter county prize winners in a larger Flower show, thus insuring the most creditable display.  Florida is such a large State that the time consumed in reaching certain local¬   ities makes one State show seem difficult of accomplishment. It could be held only in a place with a large auditorium and the remote localities would never be able to compete with the nearby places, as the time consumed in transit would materially injure the freshness and beauty of many lovely plants that should have a place in the exhibition.  For general interest and best results I would suggest that instead of one State show, four district Flower shows be the goal to work for, a line from north to south and another from east to west de¬ termining the districts. In three years when through county shows there would be a general interest in the movement, there would also be many miles of com¬ pleted highways making the transporta¬ tion of exhibits much less of a problem.  Perhaps some one can work out a suc¬ cessful plan for one show, and I hope sug¬ gestions will be made in the following dis¬ cussion.  I can assure* you that the Florida Feder¬ ation of Women’s Clubs will give every assistance and with their means of getting facts, plans and requests to every part of the State in the shortest possible time they could be a valuable factor in the success of the enterprise.  We have seen a possible goal ahead of us. I hope we shall approach it step by step so that a path of flowers will lead to it from every part of the State.  Hume: I would like to call your atten¬ tion to the flower exhibit in the lobby of the Elks Hotel. I would like also to an¬ nounce two committees: The Auditing        committee, consisting of H. K. Miller, E. W. Berger and R. E. Lenfest, and the Final Resolutions committee, consisting of Campbell, Coult and Yothers. I will ask the secretary and treasurer to have their books in the hands of this committee not later than noon tomorrow. I will ask   Mr. Pool to take charge of this meeting the remainder of the evening.  Poole: I am glad to report that three inches of rain has fallen in Polk county today. Is Mr. Cline present in the audi¬ ence tonight, if so, we will have his ad¬ dress on “Asparagus Plumosa as an Or¬ namental.”@@    
 Asparagus Plumosa as an Ornamental@@   A. E. Cline,@@ Altamonte Springs@@   Asparagus plumosa, commonly though wrongly called Asparagus fern, is one of the commercial products of Florida. As nearly all of it is shipped to Northern flor¬ ists, I doubt if we at home realize its or¬ namental qualities. In the North it is used almost entirely for decorative work and as a background for flowers. There it is either greenhouse grown or comes as cut sprays from Florida. Here it grows out in the open all the year and we can carry the decorative idea of its use into the ornamental, for instead of dealing with cut flowers we can enlarge its use to porch, lawn and yard, both as a back¬ ground for flowers and foliage and for its own beauty as a mass of green. Grown as a pot plant, it does not go to seed but its fine feathery close-grown sprays have a beauty all their own.  Another, and I think a better way of using it is as a screen for porch or win¬ dow. Here given a trellis of wood, wire or even string, it will climb steadily up¬ ward, spreading out as it grows until it forms a dense mass of fine green foliage. In this form it will blossom and the seeds form, which with their coloring from green through purple to black give an add¬ ed beauty to the screen.   It is a plant that is comparatively easy to grow, started from seed, then trans¬ planted to a good bed in ground or pot, given water and fertilizer (especially the latter, as it is a heavy feeder), it will do the rest.  Once firmly rooted in the ground, it is there to stay. I know of plants in a com¬ mercial fernery that are twenty-three years old, and this fernery is still consid¬ ered one of the best in the State.  Under the slight protection of the or¬ dinary eaves of the porch or roof, it is im¬ mune to frost or heat, though I have seen ■ it successfully grown on a trellis in the open yard. For decorative work or bou¬ quets the sprays can be cut from either the pot plant or trellis to the great advantage of both the plant and yourself, a case of “eating your cake and having it too.”  Almost the only enemy is the red spider, well known to citrus growers, and this is easily controlled by spraying with the or¬ dinary lime sulphur solution. Although indigenous to Florida, it has become a true Florida product, and therefore my advice is, try it and live happy ever afterward.@@    
 Soft-Wooded Plants for Florida Gardens@@   F. W. Fletcher,@@ Orlando@@   Soft-wooded, or herbaceous plants, in¬ clude all the annuals and most of the per¬ ennials generally used. Without them we could have no real gardens. I am not go¬ ing to weary you with a long list of botan¬ ical names and dry-as-dust generalities, but will give you a brief talk on this sub¬ ject so full of interest to all garden lovers. First, I will briefly describe a few of the newer or less known plants, and then give a list of such flowers as we have grown or seen growing successfully in Florida gardens.  Among the newer introductions per¬ haps the zinnias deserve first place. You all know this once rather common or plebeian flower, but the newer varieties are in an entirely different class. Picture to yourself a dahlia flower, four inches or more in diameter, with 18-inch stem, in all shades of color except blues, growing on a zinnia plant. This is the dahlia- flowered variety, recently introduced. Seed is only obtainable in mixed colors at present, but we are promised the separate colors in another year. Another new va¬ riety is the cactus-flowered, with blooms closely resembling that of the cactus dah¬ lia. Still another is the picotee, with flowers delicately edged with pink. If I was asked to name the best plant for mid¬   summer bloom I would answer: “Zin¬ nias, and then—more zinnias.”  Another plant, rather old in cultivation, but new to most Florida gardens, is the Watsonia. This, grown from corms. is as easily handled as the gladioli, and is a gem for Florida conditions. The flowers come in white and two shades of pink. Plant bulbs or corms from September to No¬ vember in Central and South Florida and expect bloom from late February to May.  The yellow calla (Elliottiana) is a splendid thing for winter and spring flow¬ ers. Grown from tubers, planted as soon as procurable—usually November. Re- • quires a moist soil and partial shade for best results. As we cannot have the daf¬ fodils in our gardens this calla is an ac¬ ceptable substitute.  All know the gladioli, but are you ac¬ quainted with the new Primulinus hy¬ brids? With more slender, graceful stems, soft pastel colors and beautiful hooded flowers, this new race is, for dec¬ orative purposes, ’way ahead of the older types. I had a bed of about 1,000 plants this season, no two plants with flowers alike, that was the feature of my garden from February to the middle of April. For shipping it is not as useful as the older varieties. Bulbs planted, a few each      month, from October to February, will give you a long period of bloom.  We must not overlook the cannas, which add a tropical touch and a mass of bloom to our grounds for at least eight months of the year. By elimination we have reduced the long list of varieties to the following, which we believe the best: The President, bright scarlet, green foli¬ age; King Humbert, red, purple foliage; Yellow King Humbert, yellow, green fo¬ liage; City of Portland, bright pink, green foliage; Eureka, white, green foliage; Wyoming, extra fine, orange, purple foli¬ age; Uncle Sam, red, green foliage, the best for centers of beds, because of its height.  I give a further list of such herbaceous plants as seem adapted to and happy under Florida conditions. As a list for Florida gardens this is probably incomplete. Each one of you will probably think of some favorite that I have omitted. If so, perhaps you will mention it in the discus¬ sion that I hope will follow this brief talk.  Ageratum, the best variety is the new Fraserii; Alternanthera, Sweet Alyssum, Amaryllis, Antirrhinum or snap-dragon, Baby’s Breath (annual Gypsophilla), Bachelor’s Button (Cenaura cyanus), Balsams, which includes Impatiens; Be¬ gonia, Caladiums, the fancy-leaved vari¬ eties are especially fine; Calendulas, Cal- las (RTchardia), Calliopsis, Candytuft, Cockscomb (Celosia), Chrysanthemums, English Daisies (Beilis), Daisies (mar¬ guerites or chrysanthemum frutescens), Shasta Dasies (leucanthemum), Coleus, Annual Delphinium or Larkspur, Dian- thus (this includes all the so-called pinks),   Dimorphoteca, Eupatorium, Euphorbia, Forget-me-not (Myosotis—these require a moist shady location), Four-O’clock (Mirabilis), Freesias—both white and in colors, Funkia, Gaillardia-annual, Trans- vaael Daisy (Gerbera), Globe Amaranth (Gomphrena), Sunflowers (Helianthus), Straw flower (Helichrysum ), Lantana, Lilliums, several varieties; Lupins, Mari¬ gold (Tagetes), Mourning Bride (Scabi- osa), Pansy, Sweet Peas—the winter¬ flowering varieties are the only ones of value to us; Petunia, Phlox-annual, Pop¬ py, Salpiglogsis, Salvia, Stocks, Tuberose, Verbena, Vinca.  Fletcher: (Paper) If I have missed  any plants I would like for you to call them to my attention.  Mr. Whitman: Did you mention the nasturtium ?  Fletcher: Yes.  Mrs. Whitman: Hibiscus?  Fletcher: Yes.  -: Did you mention sweet peas  and violets?  Fletcher: I think I had that down here.  -: What are the requirements  for growing the larger varieties of chrysanthemum ?  Fletcher: I would say the first requi¬ site would be a glass house. I have tried for several years to grow them and I had nice stems and nice bulbs, but about time they start to open we get a shower and that turns the flowers black.  -: Do you grow any asters ?  Fletcher: No. I understand they do well on the East Coast.         Park: The hemorcallas, an old-fash¬ ioned flower, are all excellent as they will stand the wet weather and the dry weath¬ er. Did you mention that?  Fletcher: That is my own fault and they do beautifully in Florida. They are a first-class plant.  Park: Another good flower is the but¬ tercup.   Fletcher: I have not tried that.  -: How about the geranium ?  Fletcher: I think the northern part of the State will grow them. I have not seen any around this part of the State that looked happy. They do not do well south of Gainesville or Palatka. I think south of there we would have trouble in the mid¬ dle of the summer.    Yards and Lawns   Wm. Gomme, Bartow   The subject assigned to the Committee on Y^ards and Lawns, covers such a large area, that it is impossible to touch on every phase, therefore these remarks will be confined to the suburban yard, which usually is limited in space to one or two lots.  Very often when purchasing a ready- built house or a lot upon which to build, the thought usually comes to the would- be purchaser, “Can I have a pretty front yard?” Sometimes the property has rem¬ nants of a by-gone grove, other times large trees are dotted here and there mak¬ ing other plant life almost impossible. Then again, this same property may be entirely devoid of all vegetation, so mak¬ ing formulative plans for a pretty yard somewhat easier, but not always as at¬ tractive. A few properly placed shade trees are essential and attractive, their shade gives a pleasing and cooling effect which is so desirable in this southern cli¬ mate.  The yard having the remnant of a cit¬ rus grove can be made beautiful as well as profitable. The trees should be well pruned and those overhanging the house, if there be one, should be trimmed to allow plenty of light and air. Very often one finds overshadowing trees on all sides of a residence, which gives the place a   gloomy appearance, shuts out the light, making the interior damp, etc. Trees fronting directly on the house should be removed to another location, or far enough away so that a lawn and a few suitable flowers can be planted. To have a place entirely taken up with one kind of tree or plant, does not make that place at¬ tractive or profitable. One tires of see¬ ing the same old landscape, day in and day out. Few shade trees for the place is de¬ sirable. They soften the hard lines, and produce a cooling and pleasing atmos¬ phere. They shut off unsightly buildings, and generally add considerable intrinsic value to the property. Their one draw¬ back, especially oaks, is that if too large and too numerous, their feeding roots penetrate other portions of the yard, some¬ times making other vegetation impossible. The only solution to this, is to keep them within due bounds, by root and top prun¬ ing, but not to such an extent as to make them unsightly. The yard devoid of veg¬ etation of any kind with a house in the middle, is indeed, in one sense of the word a problem. To insure the best results is to fix in one’s mind a plan of landscaping to the best advantage. Draw a plan of the place, pick out your favorite annuals, shrubs and vines, make a place for every¬ thing according to its habit, study local   86       catalogues, work to your plan and keep it.  The vacant lot with no vegetation ex¬ cept weeds is an easier problem, as one does not have to consider the interference of trees, etc. To obtain the best results, it is desirable to have the lot graded from the street to the center, so giving a gentle slope from the house to the pavement, be¬ ing careful to deposit all sub-soil where the house is going to stand. Depositing sub-soil around the yard where plants or lawns are to be maintained, usually leads to disappointment. Be sure to preserve the top soil for planting as much as possi¬ ble. A yard properly graded and finished off, affords the drainage which is so often so essential.  Place and face the house according to the coolest location, try not to have the rising and setting sun beating on the win¬ dows. After grading, put in the water system, which should enable all parts of the yard to get water. To try to raise a lawn or grow plants without water is al¬ most impossible. Having graded, secured water, and drainage, make the plan of the yard as to the planting of the trees, shrubs, etc. Make the plan conform to the lines of the house. Make each plant account for itself by some meaning. Promiscuous planting here and there, with no plan or purpose, leads to a jumbled mass.  The plan is a picture, the central idea is the residence with a warm green sward in front of it. The trees and bushes are massed into a frame-work to give effect¬ iveness to the picture of home and com¬ fort. This style of planting makes the landscape, even though the area is no   larger than a parlor. Reduced to a single expression, all this means that the greatest artistic value in shrubbery lies in the ef¬ fect of the mass, and not in the individual shrub. A mass has a greater value, be¬ cause it presents a much greater range and variety of forms, color, shades and text¬ ures, because it has sufficient extent or di¬ mensions to add structural character to a place, and because its features are so con¬ tinuous and so well blended that the mind is not distracted by incidental and irrele¬ vant ideas. There can be no rules for landscape gardening any more than there can be for painting or sculpture.  In home grounds the central feature is the house. To scatter trees and bushes over the area, defeats the fundamental purpose of the place. The purpose is to make every part of the grounds, lead up to the home and to accentuate its home¬ likeness. Keep the center of the place open, plant the borders, avoid all discon¬ nected, cheap, patchy and curious effects. It is not enough that the bushes be planted in masses, they must be kept in masses by letting them grow freely in a natural man¬ ner. The use of flowers and bright foli¬ age and striking forms of vegetation is not to be discouraged, but these things are never primary considerations in a good place. The structural elements of a place are designed first, the flanking and bordering masses are then planted, finally the flowers and accessories are put in, just the same way that a house is painted after it is built. Flowers appear to the best advantage when seen against a back ground of foliage and they are then also an integral part of the picture. The flow-      er garden, as such, should be at the rear or side of the place, the same as all other strictly personal appurtenances are; but the flowers and bright leaves may be free¬ ly scattered along the borders and near the foliage masses. What kind of shrubs and flowers should be planted is wholly a secondary and largely personal considera¬ tion. Be sure that the main plantings are made up of hearty and vigorous trees and have lots of them, then get the things liked best. There is endless merit in the choice of species, but the point to empha¬ size is that the arrangements or distribu¬ tion of the plant is far more important.  If one has no area which he can make into a lawn and upon which he can plant green masses, what then may he do? Even then there may be an opportunity for a little neat and artistic planting. Even if one lives on a rented farm, he may bring in a bush and herb from the woods and paint a picture with it. Plant it in the corner by the steps in front of the porch, at the corner of the house, almost anywhere but in the center of the lawn v Make the ground rich, secure a strong root and plant it with care, then wait. The little clump will not only have a beau¬ ty and interest of its own, but will add immensely to the furniture of the yard. About its base one may plant stray plants and these may be followed by pansies, phlox, petunias and other simple assets. Very soon one finds himself deeply inter¬ ested in these random and detached pic¬ tures, and almost before he is aware, he finds that he has rounded off the corners of the house, made snug little arbors of wild grapes, covered the rear fence and   the outhouses with trumpet vine or yel¬ low jasmine, all growing wild in our Florida woods. He soon comes to feel that flowers are most expressive of the best emotions when they are daintily drop¬ ped in here and there against a back ground of foliage. One’s place grows to be a reflection of himself, changing as he changes, and expressing his life and sym¬ pathy to the last. It is this partnership of nature which makes the farmers’ children in after years always think of the old place as “Home, sweet home.”  In planting flower beds around the house it is essential that perfect drainage be afforded, therefore for the best results, have troughs put on the eaves of the house with downward outlets to carry off the water from the roof. Many beautiful flower beds are ruined by the drip from the eaves in heavy rains. In planting the lawn, care should be taken as to the prep¬ aration of the soil. Use well decomposed stable fertilizer well incorporated. The use of muck is not advised, as when incor¬ porated with sand and other soils, it loses its fertility, so making it practically use¬ less. There have been many flower beds and lawns rendered unfit by the use of it. The lawn should be as level as possible be¬ fore planting and when ready, roots of the desired variety, such as Bermuda, St. Au¬ gustine, etc., can be planted in checks 2 inches square, or in drills 12 inches apart, with tufts 6 inches apart. The latter method allows cultivation to keep down the weeds.  In planting flower beds well decom¬ posed stable fertilizer should be freely used, well incorporated and buried period-   8      ically. A list of ornamentals suitable for different plantings can be obtained from some local nursery catalogue.  Before closing, the following sugges¬ tion might be in order. Be careful about obtaining rooted plants from your neigh¬ bor. Many yards have plants that are in¬ fested with root knot, and other diseases. I have seen beautiful yards practically   ruined because some kind friend, appar¬ ently in ignorance, had exchanged or giv¬ en a plant heavily infested with some dis¬ ease or other. The State Board law, re- quries all herbaceous material inspected before its removal. It is for your protec¬ tion not only in the case of root knot, but in other disease, which may be conveyed to your yard by some non-inspected plant.@@   
 A Brief History of the Black Fly in Cuba, Its Distribution and Latest Developments@@   Reginald Hart,@@ Gainesville@@   I have selected as the title of the paper I am about to read you today, “A Brief History of the Black Fly in Cuba—Its Distribution and Latest Developments.” There can be no question that this subject is one of vital importance to all Florida fruit growers, since all control measures have been abandoned in Cuba, and also on account of its proximity. In the Bahamas it has completely wiped out the citrus in¬ dustry. In Cuba it is gradually spreading and will in time doubtless involve the en¬ tire island.  The Black Fly (Aleurocanthus wog- lumi Ashby) was first discovered in Cuba in August of 1915 in a farm near Guan¬ tanamo. Specimens were sent by the owner of the property, Sr. Manuel Bert- ran, to the Agricultural Experiment Sta¬ tion at Santiago de las Vegas and were there determined by the entomologist, Patricio Cardin. In April, 1916, Mr. Cardin and the pathologist of the Experi¬ ment Station, Dr. John R. Johnston, were engaged in making a survey of the citrus groves and plantations of the island for citrus canker. While in Guantanamo they made observations as to black fly condi¬ tions and were able to appreciate the in¬ tensity of the infestation and the neces¬   sity for taking immediate measures to control it. In view of the fact that John¬ ston and Cardin found the black fly only at Guantanamo and considering the eco¬ nomic importance of the insect, since it not only attacks the plants of the genus citrus, but also the coffee, mango, guava, sapota, sapodilla, star apple, pomegranate and many other plants, the Honorable Secretary of Agriculture, Sr. Emilio Nunez, solicited and obtained a credit of $10,000. A Presidential Decree, No. 838, July 3, 1916, created a Commission of Plant Sanitation, with the object that this commission should try to combat the plague of the black fly until it was com¬ pletely extirpated. The commission was also to try to prevent in the future intro¬ ductions of other pests injurious to agri¬ culture and to organize a system of nur¬ sery inspection. Under the direction of the commission, during the summer and fall of 1916, a careful inspection of the vicinity of Guantanamo was made. This inspection included yards, gardens, farms and neighboring towns. In fact, every place where there might be citrus was in¬ spected in order to determine the extent of the infestation.  Since the black fly had been found only 89   *         in Guantanamo and a few of the nearest towns, such as Jamaica, Carrera Larga and Ermita, it was clearly evident that its spread to the coffee plantations in this mountainous region should be prevented. Also it was perfectly obvious that efforts should be made to prevent the spread and propagation of the black fly in the orange districts, of which there are many in Cuba.  DESCRIPTION  The black fly is a bit difficult to de¬ scribe, but we may begin by saying that it is not a fly but a sucking bug, of the family Aleyrodidae. In its adult stage, or the insect completely developed, it looks very much like a small fly, a trifle larger than the well known gnats, and in its form and manner of moving around, like the drain fly of the family Psychodidae, so that the name “Black Fly” is the most de¬ scriptive we can find. The color of the adult insect is slaty gray, more or less blackish or bluish, according to the length of time out of the pupal shell and this is the color of the four little wings which it carries almost vertically over the body. Each of the anterior wings bears two whitish spots on the front border. The color of the body is reddish, the eyes are very prominent, and the antennae of good size with relation to the body. The adult black fly prefers the young and tender shoots of the orange trees where they con¬ gregate to deposit their eggs. These eggs appear as tiny points placed in the form of a spiral, always on the under side of the leaf. I have seen these insects fly in clouds from one tree to another, and with¬ out doubt they may fly and be carried by   the wind for long distances. A period of ten days or two weeks passes before the larvae emerge from the eggs and these then crawl about over the under surface of the leaf seeking a place to begin opera¬ tions. Once settled they thrust their tiny beaks into the leaf and begin to extract the plant juices. In heavily infested dis¬ tricts, the under sides of the leaves of all citrus and other orchard trees will be found to be completely black and but lit¬ tle time elapses before the trees begin to lose their leaves, which curl, wither and finally fall. The fruit itself loses flavor and sweetness. Trees attacked by the black fly and which lose their leaves soon die as though hit by a blast.  The intermediate stage between the lar¬ val and adult stage of the black fly, called the pupal stage, lasts but few weeks. The black fly in this stage is nearly as large as the head of a pin, looks like a glossy black scale and is covered with tiny spines. To these the insect owes its name of “Spiny Citrus White Fly.” The black fly, so- called, is a true white fly, of the same group with which the Florida growers are so familiar, but is the most dangerous and most difficult to control of all the white flies.  The most efficient method of control- ing this pest is by the fumigation of the plant with hydrocyanic acid gas, but this method is very costly and requires a spe¬ cial apparatus, canvas tents, etc., for its use, and is very dangerous to use except by those thoroughly familiar with this method of control. Climatic conditions in Cuba and Florida are not favorable to fumigation. Another method is the use      of oil emulsion sprays. These are efficient if properly made and applied. The object of emulsions is to cover the body of the insect and kill it by asphyxiation. The emulsion should be thoroughly applied with special nozzles in order to reach the under sides of the leaves and so cover the insects entirely. Neither of these meas¬ ures is anything more than a partial con¬ trol measure and both are costly. The spraying must be repeated at frequent in¬ tervals and must be continued.  Much has been said, in Florida, as to the dangers confronting the Florida pro¬ ducer through the presence of the black fly in Cuba, the Bahamas and elsewhere. These dangers are real and the measures to prevent entry of this pest should by all means be continued, and doubled and re¬ doubled. It will be readily understood that if the black fly gains entry into Flor¬ ida another heavy and continuous burden of expense will be imposed upon the grow¬ er, already carrying a heavy production cost.  I am now ready to tell you how the black fly was combated in Cuba. During the year 1917, spraying operations were carried on using whale oil soap almost en¬ tirely. Inspection work in Havana Prov¬ ince during the year showed that the black fly was confined to a five-mile zone with the Botanical Gardens at Havana as a cen¬ ter. About this time the work which had been started at Guantanamo with good prospect of being successful was aban¬ doned and as a result the black fly is now firmly established in Oriente Province. Early in 1918, the State Plant Board of Florida, at the request of the Cuban Gov¬   ernment, detailed temporarily several of its experienced inspectors to assist and ad¬ vise the Cuban Bureau of Plant Sanita¬ tion. A campaign based upon the experi¬ ence gained in citrus canker eradication in Florida was inaugurated. Field inspec¬ tion on a large scale was begun and spray¬ ing operations, together with severe prun¬ ing, were undertaken. A nursery inspec¬ tion system in conjunction with the effort to eradicate black fly was organized. Plenty of money was available and con¬ ditions at that time were most favorable for eradicating the pest. Work was con¬ tinued vigorously for a time and progress was made. This effort was unfortunately only sporadic. The system inaugurated promised to accomplish the result aimed at—eradication—and no doubt would have done so, had it not been for a change in administration in the Department. From then on the work was not followed as suggested by the Plant Board, and now we find the black fly situation in Cuba hopeless so far as eradication is concerned. Illegal movement of nursery stock has caused the spread of the black fly to as many as five or six new centers in differ¬ ent parts of the island. When the work on the black fly was first started a decree was published prohibiting the movement of all plants of the genus citrus, also guavas, mango, coffee, sapodilla, pome¬ granate, star-apple and red mammee, or other host plants of the black fly. Later the black fly was found in many of the patios and yards and gardens of houses in the Vedado, a residential district of Ha- bana, and the decree was made to require the inspection and certification of all           plants to be moved from the infested dis¬ trict. Owing to the small number of in¬ spectors at this time, a strict surveillance over the illegal movement of plants could not be maintained. Prominent individuals moved infested plants from their palatial residences in the Vedado to their no less pretentious country homes. In this way the black fly reached Alquizar, about fifty miles southwest of Habana. Control op¬ erations were always started in the center of infestation and not on the outskirts. Thus, while a fair attempt at spray con¬ trol was being made by the authorities in the heavily infested districts of Habana, by the time they thought they had the sit¬ uation fairly under control it had gotten out of hand and the outlying districts were becoming infested. I am not pretending to follow a strict chronological order but I am picking out the salient features of the black fly campaign as it was conduct¬ ed in Cuba.  Provincial inspectors were appointed to make inspections that came their way and to make periodical reports to the head of¬ fice in Habana. I am going to cite only one instance of the efficiency of these Pro¬ vincial inspectors. Cienfuegos is about the fourth or fifth largest city in the island, located in Santa Clara Province, very important as a seaport on the south¬ ern coast. The inspector for this province was supposed to make an inspection every six months of all the nurseries in the province, especially those around Cien¬ fuegos, of which there were some four or five large and important ones. His re¬ ports were always the same, that is, to the effect that he could never find the black   fly in any of the gardens and nurseries inspected and that he would recommend the garden for certification without the slightest delay, as the gardeners and nur¬ serymen were moving plants every day. Then one day two of the nurserymen wrote in to the Havana office and asked when we were to make the next inspection. They stated that the Provincial inspector had not been around as was his custom every six months and that they wished their certificates. One of them sent a few grapefruit leaves along in his letter and asked what was the bug attacking his cit¬ rus and what he should do to control it. It was the black fly. Charles Ballou, an American attached to the Bureau, was sent down to Cienfuegos to look into the matter and came back with the astound¬ ing report that all of the nurseries were full of the black fly and that plants had been freely offered for sale with the black fly on them. It happened that this Pro¬ vincial inspector was a mulatto chiropo¬ dist and that his appointment as inspector had been made as a political reward. Whether he was removed from office I cannot say, but as election time was draw¬ ing near and his services were needed in the coming campaign he was doubtless allowed to continue drawing his pay, but further inspections were made by inspec¬ tors from the head office.  Another heavy infestation was found in the very geographical center of the island at Macagua in the grove of a Mr. Hodges. This infestation is not far from Ceballos, which is a citrus growing center operated largely by Americans. Most of the fruit grown here goes north by way of Nuevi-      tas to New York and so does not pass through Florida. Another slight infesta¬ tion was found at Antilla on the north coast, east of Nuevitas and La Gloria. We have had no further reports on this infestation. The latest infestation report¬ ed to the Havana office is at Cupey, in Oriente, several miles north of Manzanillo on the south coast. The black fly is also at the Experiment Station at Santiago de las Vegas, about fifteen miles south of Habana. It had evidently been planted there with malicious intent and was not discovered until too late to take measures for complete control. Immediately upon the discovery of this infested center the Chief ordered the cutting down of all the citrus in the vicinity of the center of in¬ festation. In this center were several im¬ mense old seedling mango trees about fif¬ ty feet high and a number of fine varie¬ ties of citrus used in experiments and propagation. The citrus trees were cut down, but the old mango trees were left standing. They are still there, black with the pest.  For all practical purposes we may as well consider Cuba as one hundred per cent infested with the black fly. All spraying, pruning and other control oper¬ ations have been abandoned for several months on account of the lack of funds. An efficient campaign and plenty of funds to draw on in an emergency would have controlled the black fly in Cuba and today we would not be faced by the menace of having the pest in our own groves.  In any discussion of the black fly con¬ sideration must be given to the efforts be¬ ing made to prevent introduction of the   pest into the United States from the in¬ fested countries. The protective measures are both state and federal quarantines. Here in Florida they are administered by inspectors of the State Plant Board sta¬ tioned at the ports of entry. Materials which may be dangerous are inspected and fumigated. The Federal Government considered imposing a quarantine which would have almost amounted to an em¬ bargo on certain Cuban shipments. On the grounds of certain pledges made by the Cuban Government and to avoid seri¬ ous interruption of trade and traffic, the proposed measure was somewhat modi¬ fied. The Cuban authorities have not lived up to the promises made at the hear¬ ing by the Federal Horticultural Board at Washington in December of 1920, when the quarantine question was under con¬ sideration. They agreed to maintain a zone 200 feet on each side of the principal rail¬ road lines throughout Habana Province which was to be free from all black fly host plants. An attempt to do this was immediately made, but where influential property owners refused to allow the Bu¬ reau of Plant Sanitation to cut and prune their trees the host plants were allowed to remain as before. Freight shipments coming through these infested localities are subject to infestation and the black fly has every chance in the world of being brought to Florida if it were not for the efficient work done by the quarantine in¬ spectors of the State Plant Board. Their fumigation work at Florida ports of en¬ try has doubtless destroyed the black fly in all its stages many times and has repaid a hundred times the sums outlaid in the es-             tablishment of fumigation houses and maintenance of quarantine inspection.  We cannot hope that Cuba will be able to control the black fly. Such a thing is absolutely impossible. They had their chance to do a wonderful piece of work and lost it. I do not wish to place any dis¬   credit on the men who were in charge of this control work in Cuba. They had the interest and earnest desire to eradicate the black fly, but they never had the full au¬ thority to go ahead and take the stringent measures which were so needed.@@   
 What the Quarantine Department of the State Plant Board is Doing@@   A. C. Brown,@@ Gainesville@@   At the last few meetings of the Horti¬ cultural Society, you listened to talks on the work of the Quarantine Department of the State Plant Board, and have had the work of the department explained to you. However, as some of you may be from Missouri, we are going to show you tonight, with the aid of lantern slides, just how Florida is exposed to invasion by in¬ sect pests and plant diseases from other states and countries, the establishment of any of which in this State would cause enormous losses to the horticultural and agricultural interests of the State.  Judging from the number of intercep¬ tions of major pests made by inspectors of the State Plant Board since the work was started in 1916, it is safe to assume that had this system of port and mail in¬ spection been in effect several years ago, many of the pests now with us would be still knocking at the door. We do not claim that all of the pests now established would have been prevented entry, but we do claim that their advent into the State would have been delayed for several years. The payment of insurance premiums does not prevent death or fires, but we feel that when the premiums are paid up regularly, we have done as much as we can to pre¬   vent disaster when either occurs. So it is with the Quarantine Department. We hope, but do not claim, that we will pre¬ vent the entry of dreaded pests into the State; we know that some of them would now no doubt be established if it had not been for the untiring work of the men stationed at the ports. The pests men¬ tioned later are all causing huge losses wherever they are established, and most of them have been intercepted at one time or another by our inspectors.  In the New England States the gipsy moth has for years caused great destruc¬ tion to the agricultural and horticultural interests of that section. In 1917, the State of Massachusetts paid out the sum of three hundred thousand dollars for ar¬ senate of lead alone. This sum was not the total appropriation, nor does it repre¬ sent the cost of spraying, inspecting, etc. It merely represents the amount paid out for one item of the work. No attempt was made at eradication, for through the short-sightedness of a Legislature, who decided that because the moth was de¬ creasing through the efforts of eradication there was no use of spending more money to finish the work, the eradication work was dropped many years ago. As a re-       suit, the moth “came back” stronger than before, and when the public was aroused to the real seriousness of the situation, eradication was impossible, and control was the only hope. Consider this item of three hundred thousand dollars for arsen¬ ate of lead to be used for spraying for one year, and then consider the appropriation of three hundred thousand dollars, which was granted to the Plant Board by the 1921 Legislature, only after one of the hardest fights in the memory of its mem¬ bers. This money was to carry on the en¬ tire work of the different branches of the State Plant Board for two years; forty thousand per year for the Quarantine De¬ partment, whose duty it is to keep out the very pests that are costing other states and countries millions of dollars a year.  To return to the gipsy moth: Many people wonder why the Plant Board will not allow blocks of granite, tombstones, birch hoops for orange wraps, fence posts, etc., to come into the State from New England, unless they have been inspected and certified by the Federal Horticultural Board. The reason is this: The female moth lays her eggs on all forest products; she also lays them on slabs of granite, stone, and other quarry products as well as nursery stock. There is a Federal ruling that such material cannot be shipped out of the infested areas until after it has been inspected and passed by an inspector of the Federal Horticultural Board. We have boats arriving daily from this section of the country, and hardly a boat docks with¬ out some such material on board. Every year carload after carload of birch hoops arrive from Maine, and as any of the   hoops may have egg masses of the moth on them, it is necessary to inspect the en¬ tire lot. If any of you can imagine a more pleasant way of spending a hot aft¬ ernoon than inspecting a carload of birch hoops in a close warehouse, I would like to hear of it. Just such an inspection pre¬ vented the possible introduction of this pest in Manatee county. One of our in¬ spectors intercepted an egg mass on some hoops consigned to a crate mill at Braden- town several years ago. As this insect will devour every known useful plant, grass, flower, shrub, vine, garden or field crop in New England, you can imagine the damage resulting through its estab¬ lishment in this State, where there is bound to be a greater number of broods than occurs in the New England States.  In addition to the gipsy moth, there is also established in the New England sec¬ tion the European corn borer, and the Japanese beetle, both pests of recent intro¬ duction. Since the introduction of the corn borer, it has spread into parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, where it promises to become one of the major pests of corn, and will cause enormous losses to the farmers of those sections. Not only is corn attacked, but almost all of the vegetables are hosts of this pest. Many of the flowers are subject to attack. Right here is where we got in bad with many people by prohibiting the entry into Florida from the infested areas of asters, chrysanthemums, gladiolas, dahlia and sunflower plants in addition to corn and its products (except clean, dry, shelled corn), hay, straw, etc., and all succulent plants, all of which are likely to carry in-      festation. Many people will say that we do not grow enough corn in this State to worry about what will happen to the crop if this pest is introduced. Do you realize that the corn crop ranks next to the citrus crop in Florida? In 1920 it was valued at ten and one-half million dollars. What do you think will happen to the great cel¬ ery fields near Sanford and Bradentown if this pest is established? Celery is one of the favorite hosts of the corn borer. It bores directly into the heart of the plant, and has caused great losses to the celery growers in Massachusetts. Another pest of the eastern United States is the Japan¬ ese beetle, which attacks all the nursery and greenhouse plants in the sections in which it is established, making it neces¬ sary to prohibit shipments of nursery stock from Burlington county, New Jer¬ sey, and to regulate shipments from ad¬ joining parts of New Jersey and Penn¬ sylvania.  We do not have to go to the northeast¬ ern part of the United States to find de¬ structive pests. Recently an outbreak of the Mexican bean beetle was discovered in Birmingham, Alabama, where all of the beans in the gardens were destroyed. This beetle is a member of the lady-bird beetle family, and is one of the very few which is injurious to crops. From the small infested area in Alabama, the beetle has spread to six states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Ten¬ nessee and Kentucky. In Thomasville, Georgia, every property was found to be infested. All varieties of beans are se¬ verely attacked, the beetle skeletonizing the leaves. Next to the beans, beggar-   weed is the favorite food of the pest. We all know that beggar-weed is one of the mainstays of the citrus growers, who use it for a cover crop. When this pest is es¬ tablished, for there is no way under the sun to keep it out of the State, the entire cover cropping system of Florida will have to be changed. In addition, cowpeas and velvet beans are hosts of the beetle. This pest was no doubt introduced into the southeastern part of the United States on shipments of alfalfa hay from the Western States, where it has been estab¬ lished for years. Like the boll weevil, the pink boll worm, and several other de¬ structive insects, this one was introduced into the United States from Mexico. Due to the tender foliage of the hosts of this insect, spraying has not been effective as a means of control. An expedition has been sent into Mexico to find parasites, which will in a measure keep the beetle under control.  Further west we have a pair of pests that should be kept out of the State at any cost. They are the Argentine ant and the Japanese camphor scale. This last pest was just recently introduced into the United States. The Argentine ant was introduced into New Orleans about twen¬ ty-five years ago by a ship from the trop¬ ics. It has spread throughout the State, as well as into adjoining states, until now about one-fourth of the orange groves in Louisiana are infested. That is where the shoe pinches: We may get used to find¬ ing the ant in our house, in the sugar, bread, etc. We might also get used to its attacking young children at night, but when it gets in the orange groves, right        away we are going to get mad. In Cali¬ fornia, where the ant is established, great damage is caused by its habit of protect¬ ing soft scales and aphids. Near Los Angeles, the mealy bugs have greatly in¬ creased since the advent of the ant. You will be interested to know that recently the assistant quarantine inspector at Pen¬ sacola intercepted a shipment of lettuce from New Orleans, infested with this pest. The lettuce was, of course, de¬ stroyed.  The camphor scale was smuggled into New Orleans by one of a ship’s crew in 1919 or 20. It became established in one commercial nursery and from there scat¬ tered throughout the town. Sprays do not seem to check the insect, and as a re¬ sult most of the host plants have been cut back. While camphor is the favorite host, there are about one hundred other plants subject to attack. Citrus, pecans and oaks are in this list. If this scale ever obtains a foot-hold in Florida, it may be impossi¬ ble to control it. Particularly is this true, if it becomes established in the huge oaks in the hammocks. The same inspector who made the interception of the Argen¬ tine ant at Pensacola, intercepted a ship¬ ment of plant material from New Orleans to the Reasoner Brothers’ Nursery at Oneco. The material was heavily infested with the camphor scale. This interception stands out as one of the most important in the records of the State Plant Board.  Of particular interest to the citrus growers are the fruit flies, which by some miracle, have not become established in Florida. The papaya fruit fly is the one exception; this fly is at present at work on   the papayas on the lower East coast. The damage is done by the larvae, or maggots, which hatch out from the eggs deposited by the female in the fruit. After emerg¬ ing from the egg, the maggots tunnel throughout the flesh of the fruit, render¬ ing it worthless. Right at our doors is the West Indian Fruit Fly. This pest is established in Cuba, Porto Rico, Central and South America. In Cuba, mangoes are the favorite hosts, although guavas and plums are also attacked. In the Ar¬ gentine Republic peaches are also included in the list of hosts. Citrus is not known to be infested in Cuba, but in South Amer¬ ica the fly takes to the citrus after the more favorite fruits are gone, and causes great losses to the citrus growers. Citrus seems to withstand the attacks of this pest better than the other fruits. It may be explained by the fact that the oil cells in the rind are punctured when the female lays the eggs, and the oil kills some of them. Many may hatch out, but starve to death before they can work their way through the thick rind to the flesh of the fruits. Even though no damage is caused by the maggots, the puncture in the rind leaves an opening for many fungi to be¬ come established and cause great losses to the fruit grower. The Plant Board passed a rule prohibiting the importation of guavas, plums, mangoes and Surinam cherry from Cuba. This immediately raised a storm of protest from the Cuban authorities, business men and fruit grow¬ ers, who carried the fight to the State Department at Washington. Their con¬ tention was that while the mango was a host, the “manga,” known in this State      as the “apple mango/’ was not known to be infested, and it should be permitted en¬ try. In order to know what a “manga” really was, the assistant quarantine inspec¬ tor at Key West sent an apparently un¬ infested manga to the office at Gainesville, where it was put into a jar of preservative to keep as an exhibit. Several days later a larva of a fruit fly was noticed half emerged from the “manga” driven out, no doubt, by the preservative penetrating the tunnels made by it. This, of course, made the Plant Board all the more deter¬ mined that the fruit should be prohibited entry ? no matter by what name it was dis¬ guised. As mangoes are almost staple ar¬ ticles of diet with the Cubans and natives of the West Indies, there is not a day that passes that they are not taken from pas¬ sengers at Key West, Port Tampa and Miami. The interception of mangoes in¬ fested with the fruit fly has been so nu¬ merous that the men on duty are taking it as a matter of course. This does not mean that they are not taking the same pains to intercept such importations; on the other hand, a mango means a fruit fly to them, and it is disposed of with the greatest speed possible. Quite recently another possible manner of this fly be¬ coming established in Florida has been discovered. An enterprising fruit com¬ pany has put on several refrigerator ships to carry cargoes of fruit from the Argen¬ tine, where the fly is causing enormous losses, to New York. Here the fruit is shipped by express to all parts of the Unit¬ ed States. A short time ago the inspectors at Jacksonville intercepted such a ship¬ ment of fresh peaches consigned to a deal¬   er in Florida. There is always the possi¬ bility of the fly becoming established through a similar shipment getting by our men. Cold storage will not kill the larva of the fruit fly; it merely checks devel¬ opment, and when the fruit is removed from the refrigerator, the maggot is all ready to start development. A crate of peaches was en route from Cape Colony, South Africa, to New Zealand for four weeks. Upon arrival at destination, it was found to be heavily infested with lar¬ vae of the fruit fly, all of which were in the best of health.  In certain parts of Mexico, Tampico is one of them, the production of oranges has been abandoned, and the mango crop has been reduced to one-fifth of the nor¬ mal by the attacks of the Mexican Orange Maggot, another of the dreaded fruit fly family. In addition this insect attacks many vegetables, one of which is the to¬ mato. Tampico seems a long way off, but there is not a week that passes without several oil tankers docking at Florida piers. As the crews of these ships are given the best to eat, it is not un frequent that interceptions of fruit from Mexico are found on board the ship.  Last of the fruit flies, but not least by any means, is the Mediterranean fruit fly. If this insect becomes established in Flor¬ ida, we may as well lock up the packing houses and quit trying to raise fruit and vegetables. This pest has caused the peach-growing industry near Barcelona, Spain, to be abandoned; it has checked fruit-growing in South Africa, and in parts of Australia the peach groves have been cut down on account of the attacks   100       of this fly. In Brazil the commercial fruit-growing has been at a standstill for twenty years due to the activities of this insect. You mav form an idea of the de- structiveness of this fruit fly, when you learn that in Honolulu there are seventy- two fruits and vegetables attacked by this pest, and their production is possible only under cover. The banana and pineapple are the only fruits grown on the islands that are not subject to attacks by it. For¬ tunately for Florida, the fly is not estab¬ lished very close to her shores. The Ber¬ muda Islands and Brazil are the nearest points from which infestation is likely to be carried into this State. There is but very little communication between these two places and Florida. Nevertheless, it behooves the people of this State to be on guard every minute against this pest.  At present the pineapple industry of the East Coast is making a determined effort to regain the ground lost during the past few years, and to again bring thousands and thousands of dollars into the State through the sale of pineapples. It has been determined that through proper culti¬ vation and a system of rotation, just as large crops can be made now as were made when the industry was flourishing many years ago. To prevent the ruination of this budding industry, the Plant Board has prohibited the importation of pineap¬ ples, fruit and plants from Jamaica, on account of the danger of introducing the pineapple black weevil, a pest that has caused the destruction in some years of fifty per cent of the crop in that island. The weevil is not known to be present in any other part of the West Indies, but you   may rest assured that just as soon as its presence is known on any others of the group, a quarantine will be immediately slapped on importations of material likely to bring in the insect.  Perhaps the most interesting pest to the growers present here tonight is the black fly, which has caused quite a bit of dam¬ age in Cuba and the Bahama Islands. In the latter group, the damage resulting from the attacks of this pest has almost wiped out the citrus industry on some of the islands, particularly New Providence. All the citrus trees have been cut down on this island in an effort to check the spread of the fly. Unfortunately, in addition to the citrus, there are almost one hundred other hosts attacked including the mango and avocado. In Cuba the black fly has caused as much, if not more, loss than oc¬ casioned in New Providence. Some of the groves have not borne a normal crop of fruit since the fly first became estab¬ lished. The fruit is dry and pithy, with no juice at all. Spraying does not seem to have any effect on this insect. In the Vedado section there is a lemon tree which has been sprayed repeatedly for months, but the leaves and twigs still show heavy infestation. In 1916 the State Plant Board sent two men to Cuba to assist in the eradication of the fly. The work was carried on in true Latin-American style, and while at first eradication seemed pos¬ sible, the work was carried on in such a manner that the infested areas gradually increased, until now there is no hope of eradication, and, with the way the Cubans are letting the work slide, very little ex¬ pectation of control. For this reason the       101   Plant Board has prohibited the entry of plants and fruit with leaves, twigs and other litter in the crates. There is not a month that passes without the inspectors at Port Tampa, Key West and Miami making an interception of infested mate¬ rial, any one of which, if permitted to land in Florida, might mean the establish¬ ment of the black fly within her bound¬ aries. The grave situation at Key West lies in the fact that there are three ferry boats arriving daily from Cuba loaded with freight cars, both full and empty. These cars pass through the heart of the infested area in Cuba, and at times stand on side tracks for days, and are then load¬ ed onto the ferries for shipment to Key West. There is always the possibility of adult flies being in either the empty freight cars, and when the ferries are docked at Key West, flying to the light, and of course, ashore. It has been stated that the Florida quarantine inspection service has every crack in the jug stopped up so tight that nothing can get in, while the whole bottom of the jug, meaning Key West, is wide open. There is only one way to plug this open bottom: A fumiga¬ tion house large enough to fumigate the entire ferry load of freight cars at one time. Such houses are operated by the government on the Mexican border, where there is great danger of the pink boll worm gaining a new foothold in Texas in freight cars from Mexico. These houses give excellent results. Some day, maybe, there will be enough interest taken by the people of Florida to see that such a plant is established at Key West. Quite recently the inspectors at Port Tampa intercepted   a passenger from Cuba with four small avocado trees in his possession. The trees bore a certificate issued by the Cuban in¬ spectors to the effect that they were ap¬ parently free from injurious insect pests and plant diseases. An examination of the trees, however, showed that they were infested with the black fly eggs. Here is the interesting point about this shipment; The trees were to be planted out near Ft. Myers. Can you imagine what would have been the result if this material had not been intercepted, and had been set out as planned right in the edge of the citrus section? There were enough eggs on the leaves of the trees to insure the establish¬ ment of the black fly in that section, with the probable spread north to the entire cit¬ rus growing section. Needless to say, these trees were destroyed, and the owner arrested for violating one of the Plant Board rules.  '‘For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain, the heathen Chinee” is a saint when compared to the insect pest that is trying to gain a foothold in a new coun¬ try. The Mediterranean fruit fly became established in the Bermudas when a ship loaded with infested fruit was washed ashore near St. George during a storm. Quite recently the California quarantine inspectors found two innocent-looking pieces of bamboo in the baggage of a pas¬ senger from Japan. As the quarantine inspectors are inquisitive chaps, they im¬ mediately connected the bamboo with a bug in some manner or form. A plug was discovered in the ends of the bamboo, which when removed, discovered a hollow chamber filled with citrus bud wood. The    102       bud wood was infected with citrus canker. The Mediterranean fruit fly was spread to a new section of Australia by passen¬ gers throwing infested fruit out of the windows of the train. It is a wonder that some pest has not been introduced into the lower East Coast and the Keys by just such a method. For years the Cubans have been coming to the States by the thousands. Many of them are high livers, and charter Pullmans to take them from Key West to New York, bringing large quantities of fruits and other provisions with them to eat en route. The most nat¬ ural thing in the world to do when one has bitten into a fruit and found that it had been claimed first by a lot of fat worms is to throw it away. Such fruit thrown out of a car window is more than likely to fall near a grove where the maggot, after completing its cycle, finds close to hand plenty of its favorite hosts in which the eggs are deposited. An infestation so started could exist in some sections for years before becoming noticed, and by that time the pest would be so firmly es¬ tablished that eradication would be impos¬ sible, and control a mere make-shift.  In addition to these ways of obtaining a foothold, the pests find lots of people ready and eager to help them locate new fields to work in. There is hardly a per¬ son in this audience who has not, at one time or another, violated some rule of the Plant Board prohibiting the movement of plants. Most of the violations have been unintentional. It seems perfectly legal, when one has a very fine plant or tree and wants to give it to a friend, to dig it up and carry it in an automobile or train to   the place where it is to be set out. Others think that the regulations of the Nursery Department are entirely too strict, and should not be enforced. You will be in¬ terested to know that the nursery inspec¬ tion system as worked out by the nursery inspector has attracted the notice of all the inspection and quarantine officials in the country, and several of the states are reorganizing their forces in an effort to get the same results as are secured by the Plant Board. How the Plant Board has to fight against the introduction of pests by short-sighted people who live in the State, the following letter will serve as an illustration. The man who wrote the let¬ ter lives in one of the most highly devel¬ oped sections of the State, and a section in which a great interest is being taken in avocado growing. In addition to this let¬ ter, another one along the same lines was written to a nurseryman in Cuba:  l  -, Florida, Oct. 20, 1917.  To the Leading Fruit Dealer, Brownsville, Texas.  Dear Sir: I want to buy hundreds of thousands of seeds of avocadoes, I will pay $25.00 a 1,000-seed barrel up, F. O. B. on railroad at Brownsville.  Are there any avocado seeds sold in the town across the river? Why can’t you pay small boys 10 cents a 1,000 to slip the seeds over to Texas?  There is a rule to prohibit bringing in the fruit or seed, but it seems to me that small boys could get the seed over in small lots. Why is it not easy also to hide small sacks, say of a peck, in the middle of        103   sacks of some sort of produce and ship those produce to Brownsville from down in Mexico?  Write me what is the chance to get large lots of seed in Mexico.  Yours truly,  I will say that the seed of the avocado is prohibited from Mexico and Central America on account of the presence in that section of the avocado weevil, a pest, which, if introduced into Florida might mean the ruination of the great avocado plantings now being established in this State.  How in the world can we hope to keep uninformed foreigners from bringing in destructive pests, when people in our own State, who know that material is prohib¬ ited, and who know that it is likely to bring in some dangerous insect, try to smuggle plants or seeds in in such a man¬ ner? We are facing a similar situation in North Florida in regard to the Satsuma orange. The interest being taken in this fruit is intense, and the nurseries are swamped with orders for Satsumas, and have to turn down many requests. A few short-sighted people say that they can’t see why they cannot get all the Satsuma trees they want from Georgia and Alabama, when they cannot get them in Florida, and some of them are making efforts to secure Satsuma trees from Georgia and Ala¬ bama. The mere fact that they will more than likely bring in citrus canker with the trees does not worry them a bit. So you see that the only hope of the Plant Board to keep out destructive pests, or to delay   their entry into the State, is by the hearty and complete co-operation of you folks whose living is tied up in the horticultural, agricultural and industrial development of the State.  Mr. Newell: You have seen from Mr. Brown’s lecture some of the difficulties connected with the enormous task of pro¬ tecting Florida against these many ene¬ mies. You also know, those of you who have thought about it, that the State of Florida cannot carry this load alone. We must have the help and backing of Uncle Sam. We must have his moral and legal backing and his financial assistance. We have had the help of the Horticultural Board for several years and perhaps the most important quarantine rule of the Federal Horticultural Board, to us, is “Quarantine No. 37,” which prohibits the wholesale and unlimited importation from foreign countries of trees and plants. This is the quarantine rule that has stop¬ ped the steady influx of pests into this country. An attack on this rule is going to be made at a hearing in Washington on May 15th. Its continued enforcement is going to be opposed by certain brokers and dealers who want to profit on import¬ ed material and care nothing for the fu¬ ture of our industries. Quarantine No. 37 is a protection to every orchard and farm in the State of Florida and if this so¬ ciety wants to insure this protection being continued it should so express itself—per¬ haps in the form of a resolution to the Federal Horticultural Board, before its hearing on the 15th instant.@@       
 Pruning Young Trees@@   H. E. Cornell,@@ Winter Haven@@   This address will be confined to a dis¬ cussion of the pruning of young trees be¬ fore planting and for a period of three or four years after.  Whether you plant just a few trees for home use or a large number for commer¬ cial marketing, you are naturally desirous that they shall be successful. A correct start is most important. Given this, your trees will avoid a set-back at the begin¬ ning, avoid subsequent slow growth and diseases, and instead grow vigorously and quickly reach a productive size.  In considering trees to be planted we will have in mind the ordinary sizes of cit¬ rus trees from the nursery, from one-half inch to one inch in diameter.  The first thing to decide is how the trees shall be cut back for transplanting. It used to be general practice to plant branched trees—that is, trees cut back, leaving the main branches six to ten inch¬ es in length. The new top of the trees was then formed from buds growing from these branches, and every sprout be¬ low on the trunk not allowed to grow at all. This is not the best way to prune for planting. The shoots growing from the branched tree are apt to develop into drooping branches, grow toward the ground and be anything but vigorous.   The sap flow has had to become estab¬ lished throughout the entire length of the trunk to reach this top. Often before this is accomplished, the bark has become somewhat hardened and dried out, and though the tree may live, the growth is weak and reluctant. Later, much french- ing will occur and for years it will be nec¬ essary to keep pruning out hard and with- ertip branches.  Unless trees are extra large in size, over three years of age and calipering three inches or more, the best way to prune back for planting is to cut off the entire top, leaving a stub of a trunk twelve to twen¬ ty-four inches in height. Within these limits, the larger the tree, the longer the stub. For the average one-year-old bud on four-year-old root system which we are considering, calipering three-quarters of an inch, sixteen inches is about right.  The trees should be dug with a liberal root system. This root system has to ab¬ sorb water from the soil to replenish that evaporated from the trunk and keep it from becoming hard and bark-bound un¬ til the tree gets started. It will readily be seen that it is best to have this absorbing, pumping, root area, large, and the exposed trunk subject to drying out relatively small.   104        105   The trees should be set slightly higher than they stood in the ground before re¬ moval. Subsequent cultivation will work the soil up to them somewhat and if set too low might cover the union of bud and stock.  Cut back to a stub, when the tree starts to grow it will put out shoots from all or most of the buds on the trunk. These buds are larger, more fully developed and put out much more vigorous shoots than those on the branches of a branched tree. They are, as it were right on the main line and near the source of supply. The com¬ mon method once was to assiduously rub off as soon as they started, everyone of these tiny branches except a few near the top which were intended to become the permanent head. It was thought that all growth which went into branches not to be left, was wasted. This is a serious mis¬ take. Don’t rub any of them off. Leave them strictly alone to grow at will. These little sprouts all up and down the trunk will not of course all be left as permanent branches, but they serve a very useful pur¬ pose. They are of great use in helping the tree get started. They shade the trunk and prevent the bark from becoming hard or burned by the sun. They act as tiny pumps, transpiring moisture and helping to get the flow of sap freely established.  For the entire growing season keep right on letting the trees strictly alone. Pursue the usual practices of watering, cultivation and fertilization, but do no pruning. Of course if on an occasional tree a sprout from the root-stock below the bud appears, this should be cut off.  After the tree has been growing a year,   it will be found that nature has practically selected the permanent head without any assistance or interference. Most of the little branches which shoved out when the tree first started will have made the one growth and no more. But nature will have selected several as the easiest and most natural sap channels and these branches will have put out several vigor¬ ous upward growths and developed into sturdy thrifty limbs. This is the perma¬ nent head of the tree. Take the shears and prune out the small twigs. The orig¬ inal trunk may have died back or become hard down from the top a few inches. Cut this off down to the topmost thrifty branch. You now have a clean tree, branching strongly upward and growing from the ground instead of lopping, weak growth downward toward it. The tree established in this manner will be free growing and lusty and given good care in other ways, will not be subject to french- ing and withertip.  Having followed this method, your pruning for the second year and every year up to the bearing age, will be ex¬ tremely light. All sprouts which appear below the main branches should be re¬ moved promptly. It is well to keep the center of the tree from becoming congest¬ ed. Keep all sprouts off the main branch¬ es up to a height of from two to three feet. This with the occasional cutting out of a water sprout, a sprout below the bud or a broken branch should constitute all the pruning necessary.  You may wonder why all nurseries do not send out trees cut back to stubs instead of at times shipping branched trees. The     106       nurseryman may know that this is the best method and wish to do so in order that his customer may get best results. Unless he can explain it thoroughly, he is sometimes reluctant to do so for this rea¬ son. The planter, particularly if new in the business, associates in his mind, “trees and branches.” When he gets a shipment of branched trees; planted, and looks down the row it appears to him that he has a grove “right now.” But if he receives trees cut back to stubs, he may look over the planting and wonder what's missing and if a mistake has been made. He may not know that at the end of a year he will have a much finer headed tree, a thriftier, and a better tree for its entire life. So, instruct your nurseryman to prune for planting—sixteen-inch tops.  The conclusions outlined are the result of the observation of not a few or a few hundred, but literally of hundreds of thousands of trees pruned for planting and treated in every conceivable manner. As is often the case, we work from the complex to the simple and you will find that this simple method of pruning young trees before and after planting will pro¬ duce the best results.   -: In my grove, in January, I  rubbed off branches on young trees. Should I have let them grow?  Cornell: Let them grow until the next December and then follow the method I have suggested. On young fruit trees generally cut them to six or eight inches length and that helps the trees get started. I would not remove them.  Hart: That meets my approval thor¬ oughly. I might suggest, in setting the trees that the roots be pruned smoothly, it is well to cut from the underside. That has a tendency to send the roots down.  About fertilizing the ground before the trees are planted, if the tree is planted in the winter, do not fertilize it at time of planting. When spring comes top dress with one-half pound to the tree. If plant¬ ed after February ist, the fertilizer should be put on at time of planting. Where top dressed, put in or mix with the soil.  Lord: The number of branches is an important factor in the foundation of the trees.  Cornell: With the trees as I have de¬ scribed, at the end of growing season, there will not be five branches but mostly four or three branches. The question is if you want to head your trees with three, four or five branches.@@    
 Pruning Bearing Citrus Trees@@   A. M. Tilden,@@ Winter Haven@@   The subject assigned to me is one of absorbing interest and I believe, of far greater importance than the average grower thinks. It is one to which I have devoted a great deal of thought and time and yet I have probably never done a sat¬ isfactory job of pruning.  One would be adventurous indeed to stand up in front of you and attempt to lay down definite rules and regulations in pruning, for there are probably as many different opinions about pruning as there are about the prohibition question. And so, with your permission, I will merely at¬ tempt to outline in a broad way, my own general ideas.  While we always speak of the citrus tree as a tree, it is nevertheless, I think, somewhat of a bush. It should be grown and pruned with that in mind. We are not trying to grow a tree with a tall trunk and large branches that may later be cut into framing timber, but rather we are trying to grow a great number of small branches and twigs that may bear fruit and offer us as large a bearing surface as possible. My ideal tree is one that is headed low, that spreads out instead of going up in the air and that has a surface of bearing wood from the ground all around up to the top; one on which the picker starts work upon his knees and fin¬   ishes on the top of his ladder. A tree shaped and grown in this way presents the maxium bearing surface and certainly, all other things being equal, the number of boxes of fruit is in direct ratio to the amount of bearing surface.  On the inside of the tree, that is infre¬ quently pruned, we find a large accumu¬ lation of dead branches and in addition to that, we find insect life very numerous and the combination of small dead wood and insects generally result in the smoth¬ ering out and killing of all the inside wood of the tree. And so, when we come to prune, we are compelled to remove every¬ thing from the inside of the tree, leaving no fruiting wood but just an empty shell. On such a tree fruit may only occur upon the thin surface of twigs and leaves around the outside.  But, if light and frequent prunings are given and the accumulation of dead wood prevented, then there may be grown a lim¬ ited amount of inside wood which will bear fruit and increase both the bearing surface and capacity of the tree.  These frequent light prunings are, I think, no more expensive than infrequent heavy prunings and they will gradually result in a material increase in the bearing surface of the tree.   107        108       In groves that are closely planted and in which the branches of one tree interlock with the branches of those surrounding it, it is not possible to obtain the kind of shaped tree of which I have spoken. In such groves, the lower branches are smothered out and umbrella-shaped trees result. The bearing surface of these trees must of necessity be only in the tops, but the same kind of pruning will, even in these trees, result in some inside bearing wood.  Then, the accumulation of undesirable water sprouts, and water sprouts are never desirable, should be prevented and will be prevented by frequent prunings. Water sprouts left undestroyed for any great length of time will often destroy the limb from which they spring and I think most growers will agree with me that a tree composed largely of water sprouts is not very desirable. To keep a tree in good and proper condition, requires, I feel con¬ fident, the kind of pruning which never gives the tree a severe shock nor allows the accumulation of undesirable wood and which allows the tree to shape itself nat¬ urally.  As a rule, we all prune when we can and that is generally when the shipping season is over and labor is available. But a light pruning just before the bloom, is a desirable factor in the making of the next crop. The slight shock imparted causes a more general setting of the bloom and gives a tendency to the trees to hold their newly set fruit.  When it becomes necessary to cut off large branches leaving scars of better than an inch in diameter, a trimming of the   edges with a sharp knife and the painting with any good preservative is of impor¬ tance. The cuts will then callus over be¬ fore the exposed wood rots.  In general I would say that trees should be pruned in such a fashion that pruning may never become a pressing necessity.  - : -: I would like to ask what time  is most favorable for pruning?  Tilden: We never have enough people in Florida to do the work and in the har¬ vesting we have to depend on outside la¬ bor. Pruning is done when we can get to it, which is generally in the summer. I rather like fall and winter pruning.  Hart: I would like to know your opin¬ ion in regard to the pruning of old trees. I have a great many letters from people who have old groves and they speak of pruning them and I would like to know what your experiences have been, if any, in regard to cutting the tops out of old trees, and how about cutting off one-third of the top of the tree?  Tilden: I have not had any experience nor have I seen it done.  Skinner: As to that question about cut¬ ting the top of the tree out, I have had experience in that. Wherever that was done the tree is likely to send up water shoots in the center. The sap has to go somewhere. This type of pruning is not advisable unless the tree is dying at the top. Where young trees are cut off at the top that is a mistake.  Thompson: I think the question of dead wood is the most important.  Tilden: I let that go as part of the un¬ desirable wood. It all is undesirable wood.        109   Hart: I was glad that Skinner said what he did as it meets somewhat with my experience. If Mr. Brown is in the room I would like to hear from him as to painting after pruning. That is good and will help. If the wound is covered with something to keep life in the stock, it will heal over.  I have had some experience in the cut¬ ting back of trees that were getting pretty well along in years, 25 years old, and I hardly believe in removing the lower branches in cutting back. I have removed the entire top and not removed the lower branches and those trees have come back and are producing crops of fruit now. You only lose one crop but now an impor¬ tant point in the cutting back is that it should be done by the middle of March, or preferably February. If you wait un¬ til March the sun is rather hot. It is a good plan, where the tree has its bearing capacity reduced. It is a good thing in a grove like ours, to lose a crop for one year and cut it back for 15 feet.  Skinner: You have been over on the   other side where they have reduced it to a science. Tell us about that, Mr. Hume?  Hume: Their methods differ as to those outlined by Mr. Tilden. You never see any wood that has been smothered out. Trees for the most part are kept open in the center. Now, I have never seen such a thing as dieback in the Spanish grove, or any of those relating troubles. The trees look as though almost every twig has been handled. They have groves which are from 100 to 150 years old, which are wonders.  Waite: Mr. President, in regard to cutting back trees. I have cut back trees a good many times and afterwards had to remove those trees. I have always found where the tree was cut back to form a new head, it would send out good shoots through the summer and would make a good tree that later would die. In remov¬ ing that tree I discovered what was the cause. In taking off the top I had forgot¬ ten to root prune and consequently the tree would invariably die and all the fibrous roots would die.   Dieback, Ammoniation, and Frenching   R. E. Lenfest, Winter Park   It is not the purpose of this paper to give any technical discussion of the above tree conditions but to give some observa¬ tions concerning these conditions and some of the factors influencing them. The first of the subjects really covers those following, but each will be taken up sep¬ arately with reference to its relationship to the others.  Described in every-day terms, dieback is a sort of malnutrition or indigestion of the tree. It is a name applied to a condi¬ tion of the tree and is not a very accurate name. It should not be confused with the effect and appearance of withertip. Die¬ back may be divided into two types, acute and chronic. Ammoniation is the effect of the disease as shown by the fruit. Frenching is one serious phase of the dis¬ ease and when this stage is reached it may be said that the trouble has become chronic.  Dieback seems to be brought on by a number of conditions or combination of conditions. Giving the trees an unbal¬ anced feed does its share in causing the trouble. This may be done in several dif¬ ferent ways. Overfeeding trees will give an unbalanced ration and may be done by using too large amounts of fertilizer or too high an analysis of ammonia or both. This is very apt to bring on dieback con¬   dition, especially if most or all the ammo¬ nia is derived from inorganic sources. Some organic sources of ammonia if used in excess will probably produce dieback and ammoniation but generally in a lesser degree and taking longer to do the harm. This is not meant to condemn the use of inorganic sources of ammonia a*s they are very important in the satisfactory grow¬ ing of citrus trees and fruit, but to call attention to the fact they should be used carefully and understanding^, and when thus used the results are quite sure to be good. Another way in which overfeed¬ ing may be done is putting fertilizer too close to the trees and in too narrow a band —fertilizer should be spread each time just a little farther than the roots extend until the roots and fertilized areas meet. It should then be scattered broadcast and evenly. A great many growers do not realize how far out the roots extend. The only safe way to make sure of this is to dig near a number of average sized trees and find the average distance to which the roots extend and whether or not they meet in the middles.  One reason why many growers over¬ feed orange trees is because they have orange, grapefruit and tangerine trees of the same age and have overlooked the fact that orange trees cannot handle as much   110        111   food as grapefruit and tangerine trees of the same age and size. Then some varie¬ ties of oranges may require different methods of feeding.  It may be interesting to mention most of the symptoms and indications of die- back—bark excrescence; gum pockets; stained terminal branches and twigs; staining of the leaf, petiole and midrib; “S”-shaped and droopy terminal growth; deep green color and large coarse leaves; frenched, pointed leaves—these are often fleshy and brittle; bunchy growth—a ten¬ dency toward multiple buds; wood flexi¬ ble—too easily bent or twisted; fruit coarse; fruit scarred with ammoniation markings; fruit too hard and too firm— lacking in resiliency; wood too angular and not well filled out; stubby growth— especially if bunchy and possibly frenched; malformed, crinkled leaves— not caused by wind or mechanical injury; the wood may be dark and hardened.  There are several other conditions that will induce many of the above symptoms of dieback. Poor drainage will bring on a dieback condition. In this connection it might be well to mention the effect of clay or some other impervious layer being close to the surface even though the soil seems to be perfectly drained because it is on high land and often well above the lakes that may be near. The result of this layer being close to the surface is that the trees get all the food that is put on the ground as the only leaching that can take place is laterally and often this is not very rapid. This, when not taken into consid¬ eration, will bring about a condition of overfeeding.   Another condition that often exists in old seedling groves and in some of the old¬ er budded groves is that the trees are set very close together. When this is the case the trees are so crowded that by the time they are mature the actual leaf surface or top of the tree is much smaller than a tree of the same age having room enough to expand and make a growth on the sides of the tree. When this is not taken into ac¬ count the close set trees are often given the same amount of fertilizer a normal shaped tree would get. The result is that the close set trees are often over-fed and the fruit coarse and ammoniated.  Deep plowing and excessive and deep cultivation will tend to cause dieback and especially a frenched condition as will be mentioned later.  Having trees set too deep will cause trouble. The crown roots should be at ground surface as is brought out in anoth¬ er paper on the program.  Ammoniation is the effect of the die¬ back condition of the tree as shown by the fruit. The markings are very character¬ istic yet when not very severe some have trouble distinguishing it from Melanose. A simple comparison of the two may be helpful. The Melanose markings affect the surface and the dark scab-like spots may be lifted up disclosing tissue of fairly normal color underneath. The ammonia¬ tion markings cannot be so easily lifted off and the tissue underneath has a stained and often brownish appearance. Another method of distinguishing them is to cut a small wedge-shaped piece out of the rind through the spots in question and note the color of the underlying tissues. Badly    112       ammoniated fruit in addition to having the characteristic surface markings and splitting will often have a gummy deposit in the segment angles in the center of the fruit.  Frenching is a term applied to a peculiar yellowing of the leaves. It is quite char¬ acteristic in that the leaves remain green along the midrib and lateral veins and be¬ come yellow in the fleshy part between the midrib and veins. Another condition that is often confused with frenching is where the leaves show lack of food or a starved condition. The difference in appearance is that the pattern is exactly opposite. The leaves showing hunger are yellow along the midrib and veins and green in the fleshy part of the leaf. Also the hunger leaves can often be brought back to good color but very little change can be pro¬ duced in frenched leaves. The change in appearance of the tree must come from normal growth being produced. It is es¬ pecially important to notice these differ¬ ences as the frenched trees should not re¬ ceive the same treatment as those showing lack of food. The frenched trees are un¬ healthy while those showing hunger may be healthy yet underfed. Frenching may result from most any of the causes of die- back. Of these it is most often caused by deep plowing and deep cultivation or both —where many of the crown roots and main feeder roots are repeatedly being disturbed, especially if fertilizer of high ammonia content derived entirely from inorganic sources has been used continu¬ ously. The use of lime in various forms on light sandy soil has brought on many serious cases of frenching.   So far no suggestions have been made which might help overcome these condi¬ tions of the trees. In closing an attempt will be made to do this briefly.  If it is a matter of drainage, make ditches deep and large enough to carry off excess water. Where trees are planted on ridges the furrows or ditches between should be as deep as possible and the beds as high and wide as can be made so that the trees will at all times have plenty of good normal roots above the line of water- soaked soil. Trees with crown roots too deep should be raised or have soil removed to proper level by cultural methods.  When non-bearing trees and even young bearing trees are very badly affect¬ ed with dieback showing deep green color, multiple buds, gum pockets, bark excre¬ scence, flexible wood, but with little or no frenching, discontinue fertilizer for one application or even for a whole year if ob¬ servation of color and condition from time to time shows this to be advisable. The use of bluestone will help to hasten recov¬ ery. Keep cultivation shallow and mini¬ mum in amount. When fertilizing use fair amount of potash, low ammonia con¬ tent and at least half of this from slow acting sources.  In handling older dieback trees it is not advisable to discontinue fertilizer for so long a period. Reduce amounts and use low ammonia analysis or make a greater reduction of a higher analysis if this is desired. Have about half the ammonia from slow acting sources. Maintain a good amount of phosphoric acid and also potash. The use of bluestone is also ad¬ visable in amounts varying with the size       113   of the trees. Bone is a very safe source of slow ammonia. Be sure that fertilizer and bluestone are scattered out evenly as far as the roots extend. Broadcast if roots meet in the middles. Remember that fertilizer can be added much easier than it can be taken away or the effect of an over¬ dose counteracted.  When trees are frenched deep plowing or deep cultivation should be discontin¬ ued; in fact, deep plowing or deep culti¬ vation should never be included in grove practice. Any unfavorable condition of drainage or setting should be remedied. The fertilizer should have a low ammonia analysis of which half or more should be from slow acting sources such as bone. Quite liberal applications of good stable manure will be beneficial. Bluestone should also be used. If the frenching is a result of lime injury the recovery of the trees will probably be slow and the use of stable manure will be found to be espe¬ cially helpful. Just what the effect of spreading sulphur around the trees will have has not been definitely settled yet.  In conclusion, it might be said that a great deal of worry, expense, loss of tree growth and fruit might be saved by fa¬ miliarizing growers with the various symptoms of dieback and the methods of handling so that they can check the trouble before much harm is done. ,,  -: Have you ever tried sulphate  of iron in checking the frenching?  Lenfest: At present I do not know the effect of it. That is one thing that I don’t know anything about at all. Lots of dif¬ ferent conditions can cause frenching.   The cause of the trouble should be found if possible and removed. If it is a grove practice, discontinue that practice.  Skinner: From your observation in or¬ ganic ammoniation, is there any difference in the ability of sources to give this die¬ back condition?  Lenfest: I cannot say about the ni¬ trate of potash which has been in use for several years. I have made this statement to a number of growers. I told them to run a race with me to produce dieback and I would take nitrate of soda to bring it on.  Skinner: Have you ever had any ex¬ perience in grapefruit where the leaf turned badly frenched and dropped off? Have you any idea what causes it?  Lenfest: I have seen that condition but I don’t know what it is. It may be something in the fertilizer or Mr. Cline may have some recent information on that.  Cline: We are in somewhat the same fix that you are. We know that borax will produce it.  -: I want to give one instance of  organic ammonia. Some years ago I was feeding cattle. I put them in stalls and saved all the fertilizer and on an old seed¬ ling grove I hauled out 200 one-horse wagon loads. On top of that I put an ap¬ plication of commercial fertilizer. I never found a bit of dieback from it. I did find a very much increased growth of fruit.  -: Can dieback be caused by  hardwood ashes?  Lenfest: I don’t know. It is valuable as a source of potash, but what its further action is, I don’t know.       114       -: I would not use lime in any  other way.  -: If you want to grow good  trees you must know your trees. I re¬ member one time a man told me to use cotton seed meal on my grove and I did. I had to go to work and cut a year’s growth down. It would not work, the tips turned down and I had to go to work and get someone that understood tree growth better than I did and he told me of a good grade of fertilizer to use on them, and I did.  -: How much bluestone do you  recommend for two-year-old trees?  Lenfest: I would say from T /\ \.o pound in two or three different applica¬ tions from three to four weeks apart. I divide it up that way to protect myself. If the trees were my own I would put on to y pound, but I don’t when it is going to rain. I have seen six and seven-year- old trees killed outright by the use of %. to *4 pound. One man I remember put it on during Saturday afternoon and he wanted to go to town that night. He had a can containing ^4 pound and he went up to the tree and threw it on. He told a man of it that night, who told him to go home and take it off. He lost quite a number   of trees. That was caused because he did not put it on right. Those trees, if they had been in a dieback condition, would have stood 2 pounds at least, if put on carefully.  -: Is bluestone ever to be used  for anything else but dieback and french- ing?  Lenfest: I don’t know. It is used for lots of different ailments.  Dade: I have heard of it being used for fertilizer! ! !  Heimberger: I heartily agree with re¬ gard to nitrate of soda. Nitrate of soda had been abused. Where used intelligent¬ ly on frenched trees at J4 pound applica¬ tion it is all right. I never would apply nitrate of soda at the rate of 4 pounds to the tree. If nitrate is used in sane amounts and if used intelligently, it is good.  -: Do you think the bluestone  produces physical action or a chemical ac¬ tion on the tree?  Lenfest: I don’t know. If I could stand up here and answer all the questions absolutely correctly I would not worry about what I was going to do the rest of my life.@@        
 The Co-ordination of Citrus Grove Practices@@   Lindley Heimberger,@@ Lakeland@@   The up-to-the-minute citrus fruit grow¬ er of today in Florida is vastly a different mortal as compared to his forebear of even twenty-five years ago; guess-work has been reduced to an absolute minimum and modern citriculture has been raised to the plane of almost an exact science.  In the building up and in the proper maintenance of a profitable commercial citrus grove we have a number of funda¬ mental factors that must be given very careful consideration, which may be grouped under the following heads : Prob¬ lems of fertilizing, cultivation, spraying and pruning, and it is only by the intelli¬ gent and proper co-ordination of these basal factors that full commercial success can be expected in Florida citriculture.  Using a decimal scale of one hundred points in gauging the relative importance of the above mentioned members in an arch representing the successful growing of citrus fruits in our State, we will have to grant not less than fifty of the one hun¬ dred points total to the fertilising prob¬ lems which is the keystone of this arch and divide the remaining fifty points be¬ tween the other three members, about as follows: Thirty points to the right hand footing member of the arch, cultivation problems; fifteen points to the left hand footing member, spraying problems, and  ii|   the five points still remaining to the fourth fundamental member of this arch, i. e., pruning problems.  FERTILIZING PROBLEMS  The main reason why I give such great stress to fertilizing in the proper care of the grove is the fact which must be con¬ ceded by all experienced growers in our State, that it is a physical and chemical impossibility to make practically any kind of a commercial grove on the average Florida citrus soil without the use of arti¬ ficial plant food in some form, no matter how well and intelligently the grower cul¬ tivates, sprays and prunes his grove.  In fertilizing we must constantly ob¬ serve certain plant physiological princi¬ ples, especially the facts that we must use complete fertilizers showing proper bal¬ ance of essential elements of plant food and that this plant food should be in read¬ ily available and soluble form, this latter applying to the phosphoric acid content as well as to the nitrogen and potash constit¬ uents. Be liberal and generous in the feeding of the trees; time the distributions so that there will not be starved tree con¬ ditions occurring in the distribution inter¬ vals and distribute your fertilizers widely and as far away from the tree as the root system justifies.       116       It is probably true that many of our groves throughout the State are even now in a potash starved condition, even with potash prices down to almost a pre-war state. In fact many of our younger groves, including those just coming into full bearing, have been grown under pot¬ ash famine and starved conditions.  Another point, but few citrus growers really appreciate the fact that nitrogen is the dominating element of plant food and many groves testify to the fact that poorly balanced, low nitrogen fertilizer formulas are being used; remember, though, that excessive nitrogen fertilizing is bad and should never be allowed. Use high grade .fertilizers without filler as thev are al- ways the cheapest and best in the long run. The use of low grade fertilizers as a source of soil humus is a poor and uneco¬ nomical policy. Practice summer legu¬ minous cover-cropping and use well rotted stable manure instead.  <  CULTIVATION PROBLEMS  The drought we have been experienc¬ ing is very unusual in its intensity and has clearly demonstrated the great importance of practicing solid, level and shallow grove cultivation at short intervals during periods of rainfall shortage. This estab¬ lishes and constantly mainstays a perfect dust mulch, completely breaking up the surface soil capillary attraction and hence conserving the much needed soil moisture for the use of the trees.  Here is where the modern tractor dem¬ onstrates its great usefulness in efficiently cultivating unit grove areas in a minimum of time at low initial cost, saving much   time and worry. In the highlands using a special 14-foot tractor acme pulled by a 15-27 tractor we have covered as much as seventy acres in one working day, doing work showing at least double the effi¬ ciency in quality as compared to light mule operated acmes so commonly used in our groves. The day of the tractor has arrived in Florida, though the mule will never be entirely replaced in the care of our groves. Thus does modern horticul¬ ture advance. The importance and prac¬ tical value of summer tree-row cultivation during the summer rainy season months with the practice of leguminous cover- croping during this same period in the middles, cannot be given too much stress as a means of keeping the grove in a healthy growing condition, and maintain¬ ing and increasing the soil humus and the fixation of free atmospheric nitrogen (thereby saving on the future fertilizer bills). Many of us turn our groves loose in the summer months entirely too soon and at too early an age; tree-row cultiva¬ tion, my experience shows, is not only cheaper in the long run but is far more efficient in keeping a grove up during the summer months as compared to the make¬ shift of hoeing, say a couple of times. Remember that it is during the summer rainy season months with its longest days and the maximum of sunshine that our groves are expected to put forth their greatest seasonal effort in growth, and in¬ stead of falling down on our job at this critical time, we should put forth every effort to encourage nature to make the best possible showing during the summer months of ideal growing season.       117   SPRAYING PROBLEMS  It is absolutely false economy and a great waste to pour expensive fertilizer and cultivation into grove parasites whether they be either of animal or veg¬ etable nature (insect, spider, fungus or bacterium). Therefore to get maximum returns on the use of fertilizer, careful cultivation and cover-croping, we must give special care and attention to the spraying and pruning work in the proper handling of our grove. There is no doubt that far greater importance is to be paid in the future to the economical importance of melanose and withertip action in our groves and the control of these two very important diseases and their other named manifestations on the fruit of citrus (an- thracnose, melanose, rusting and stem- end rot), by depending on Bordeaux oil spraying supplemented by pruning out of the dead wood. Bordeaux is always to be considered as the ideal fungicide and far superior to lime-sulphur in any form or strength. Though lime-sulphur gives good control of citrus scab, in every case Bor¬ deaux is far more effective in the com¬ plete control of this fungus parasite; at the same time, however, Bordeaux is equally effective against our many para¬ sitic fungus friends that prey on white fly and scales. Still it is doubtful if a mixed spraying schedule is as effective and prac¬ tical under average seasonal conditions as compared to a complete spraying schedule being adapted including Bordeaux oil, lime-sulphur oil emulsion paste, lime-sul¬ phur and oil emulsion and the use of nico¬ tine sulphate when required.   PRUNING PROBLEMS  Though pruning does not bear the ma¬ jor importance in citriculture as compared to fertilizing, cultivation and spraying, its intelligent practice is indispensible in the care of commercial groves.  I always believe in a low headed tree; it saves steps in the picking ladder, shades the ground well and protects the tree trunk against possible cold. No limbs should actually sweep the ground.  Dead wood should be kept out of the trees at all times as far as possible, though I do not consider that “pin feather prun¬ ing” is necessary if Bordeaux-oil spraying is practiced, it being only on the dead wood that melanose and withertip pro¬ duce spores.  All sucker growth below and above the bud should be kept down.  I believe that it is best to keep down and cut out interior badly shaded twig growth in the heart of the tree, thus elim¬ inating shady harboring places for light objecting citrus insects (scales and white flies) and greatly increasing the efficiency of thoroughly applying sprays in our groves.  Broken and crossed limbs should be re¬ moved where possible and practical. Pruning citrus trees can be practiced at all seasons of the year when it does not greatly interfere with the crop of fruit.  With a new set tree let nature put forth every effort to restore the top and there¬ by eliminate a great shock by letting all growth remain above the bud for the first year, or at most only remove growth very close to the ground above the bud.@@   
 Pecans, an Important Florida Crop@@   C. A. Simpson,@@ Monticello@@   Some thirty to fifty years ago, a great many pecan nuts were planted in yards and small orchards, all over the northern part of Florida. At that time it was thought if you planted a large fine qual¬ ity nut, it would reproduce the same large fine quality pecan. This, however, did not prove to be true, as most of the trees are now bearing a rather small nut, al¬ though some are of fair size, and most of them of fine quality. But the planting of these nuts at this time was the beginning of the pecan industry in Florida. Today many fine majestic shade trees make the home surroundings beautiful, and in some cases one pecan tree more than pays the annual taxes of the home. Some of these seedlings were so promising, that a name was given, and nurserymen secured prop¬ agating wood from them.  The pecan was first propagated in a small way in the early nineties, but not till between 1905 and 1910 was it propagated on a large scale. Since then, except for the years of real depression, the supply of pecan trees has barely kept pace with the demand. This next season it is expect¬ ed there will be at least 300,000 trees ship¬ ped out of Monticello alone.  Since 1906 thousands of acres have been planted in the cotton states of the South, sometimes from one to five thou¬   sand acres being planted by one organiza¬ tion. In our own State there are a good many orchards of 100 to 500 acres, a few of 1,000 acres, and one was planted some few years ago of 4,600 acres.  The orchards that were planted ten and fifteen years ago, and properly taken care of, are now producing for their owners very satisfactory returns. In fact, the re¬ turns have been so satisfactory that the real cotton farmer now realizes he should have planted 10 to 100 acres long ago and is correcting his mistake by planting now for the future.  I know of one farmer in Georgia who rented a farm a few years ago for a cash rent of $900.00. That year happened to be a poor year for farming and low prices for farm products, and he failed to sell his farm crops for enough to pay his rent. It so happened this farm had a frontage on a main highway, and along this roadside and along a short lane leading to the farm house, were planted 65 pecan trees, then eleven years old. The nuts gathered from those 65 trees, which is the eqpivalent of 3 1-5 acres, sold for $1,050.00. This en¬ abled him to pay his $900.00 cash rent and $150.00 over. Farmers in Florida should take this incident to heart and plant all their road frontage to pecan trees, wherever they will do well. Just think   118        119   of the beautiful driveways we would then have, which in itself would cause tourists to drive miles to enjoy, and also think of the large revenue such plantings would bring to the roadside farmers.  In Jefferson county, Florida, there are many fine pecan trees in yards from 25 to 35 years old, that have borne all the way up to 90 pounds to a tree. The pecan is the most beautiful shade tree, that will not only keep you cool in the summer time, but will also keep you warm in the winter time with its richest of foods. About 6,000 acres has been planted in this county, of the better varieties, and these orchards are now of all ages up to 17 years old. The better trees in these or¬ chards have borne as much as 200 pounds of pecans, for which the consumer pays from 60 cents to $1.50 per pound, depend¬ ing on the variety. One grove of ten acres this past season earned for its owner 8 % on a valuation of $3,000.00 per acre, and the nuts were sold at wholesale prices. Last season Jefferson county shipped about 100,000 pounds of cultivated pecans and about 200,000 pounds of seedlings, valued at about $75,000.00 and the indus¬ try is hardly started there.  At present there are 15 to 20 nursery¬ men in Florida propagating pecan trees, who have furnished trees for the planting of at least 30,000 acres in Florida, of the better varieties, and the acreage is being increased very considerably each year. In fact within the past few years there has been a wide awakening to the great possi¬ bilities of the pecan industry. It is very probable that last year our State gathered 500,000 pounds of the cultivated pecan,   and probably 1,500,000 pounds of seed¬ ling nuts. I tried to get definite data on the yield by writing to each county agent, but I did not receive enough replies to make an accurate statement, but believe my estimate is conservative. For the 1920 season the Florida Department of Agriculture made a report showing that there were then in Florida 65,000 bearing pecan trees and 200,000 non-bearing trees and which produced 1,680,000 pounds of pecans valued at $415,000.00. This re¬ port checks up very closely with my esti¬ mate for this year.  The pecan is not limited to the northern counties of the State. While it has not yet been tested on a commercial scale much below Marion county, yet it is quite likely it will be found they will do well, under proper conditions as far south as Polk county. I had a letter just recently from a man in Sarasota, stating he knew of some pecan trees there eight years old that were bearing very satisfactorily. Last summer I saw a few small orchards at St. Petersburg, that were ten to four¬ teen years old, that contained fine pecan trees, and I was told by people there that they bore well. I saw some good trees planted on the streets of St. Petersburg, too. I have seen young plantings in Polk county, and one six-acre orchard at West Palm Beach of four-year-old trees, and all seemed to be doing well. However, until the districts below Marion county have been thoroughly tested, it probably would not be wise to make any extensive plantings in such districts.  For an orchard, the pecan trees in Flor¬ ida should not be planted closer than 50   120       feet each way, or 17 to the acre. The pe¬ can does not have to be gathered within a short period like some perishable fruits. The gathering season extends from the first of October to well in January, al¬ though it is advisable to have them on the market before the holidays. The nuts are thrashed off the trees by means of long bamboo poles and then picked up from the ground, or from canvas spread under the trees. They are then graded according to diameter, and packed in strong tight boxes or barrels.  The pecan is a very valuable food prod¬ uct, being the richest of all nuts. One pound of pecan meats is equivalent, in calories, to 2.3 pounds of smoked ham, 2.3 pounds of flour bread, 2.4 pounds of dried beans, 3.7 pounds of porterhouse steak, 12.3 pounds of Irish potatoes, ioj 4 pounds of apples, 15 pounds of oranges. And the different elements of food in the pecan is in such proportion that it makes a balanced ration.  The pecan tree is one of the longest lived of any orchard tree. It is expected that an orchard well cared for will bear crops for at least 100 years, and possibly 300 to 400 years. This expectation is based on the age of the pecan trees found in the forests, many of them being much over 100 years old and some even 400. Therefore when you plant a pecan orchard you not only plant for yourself and chil¬ dren but several generations.  Under proper conditions and treatment a pecan tree will bear a few nuts the third or fourth year after planting, some excep¬   tional trees bearing as much as 30 pounds the sixth year, but in general you cannot expect a commercial crop before the eighth to tenth year from planting. Other things being equal, the richer the soil, the better the cultivation, and with proper fertiliza¬ tion, the sooner you will get a commercial crop.  In planting pecan trees there are a few things to consider in order to produce a successful orchard: (1) Select your best and well drained land. With us in the northern counties it is necessary to have a good clay sub-soil within ten to fifteen inches, but there are successful orchards on lands without clay sub-soils, where the water table is within a few feet of the sur¬ face of the ground. (2) Select first-class nursery stock from a reliable nurseryman or his agent, and of the proper varieties for your locality. For best results the trees planted should not be less than four feet high. The Moore and Moneymaker are probably the best commercial varieties adapted to Florida conditions, although Curtis, Pabst, Success and Stuart are also good. (3) Give your trees good care and plenty of fertilization.  If you follow these instructions, you will get results. If you buy cheap trees, set them on poor land, and neglect them, you will get no results.  I think the day is coming, and not many years hence, when the pecan will be the best and most valuable cash crop of the cotton states of the South, and of the northern part of Florida.@@   
 Grape Growing in Florida@@   Chas Dearing,@@ U. S. D.A., Washington, D. C. @@  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  I am enjoying the privilege of meeting with you again as a representative of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Two years ago at your Ocala meeting it was my privilege to present to you a report of the Department’s work in relation to Mus¬ cadine grape growing in the Southeast, and to suggest to you the advisability of developing Muscadine grape industry in that part of Florida, north of the main citrus section. I have been pleased to note the manner in which that suggestion is being acted upon and encouraged to make additional suggestions along this line. In the home demonstration work the club girls and women have progressed with their program of planting the best varie¬ ties of Muscadines in their perennial gar¬ dens and making home products. A goodly number of farm vineyards have been started, if I may judge from our correspondence. The commercial nur¬ serymen have co-operated to the extent of propagating vines in quantity to meet the needs of your State and other southeast¬ ern states as well; and at present, at least one company is organized for Muscadine grape growing on an extensive commer¬ cial scale and is engaged in the develop¬ ment of vineyards on an 8,000-acre tract of North Florida land with a view to the     commercial production of Muscadine grape juice, jellies, and other products, standardized by the Department.  In my present paper, I shall, as request¬ ed, devote myself to a consideration of the general grape growing situation in Flor¬ ida. In doing so I shall speak without prejudice but with a view to giving you a clear statement of the Department’s view¬ point. This viewpoint is the result of ob¬ servations and experimental investigations by various specialists extending over a period of many years; back, in fact, to the time when fruit investigations were first inaugurated by the Department. I am not attempting to give you my personal opin¬ ion, but a summary of the conclusions of the best authorities of the past and present day. I know that some of the leading horticulturists of Florida hold similar views. I ask that you bear this in mind if I may seem to present matters too pes¬ simistically or optimistically.  American viticulture is of three types based upon the kind of grape used as the basis of the industry and all of these types are represented in the history of Florida grape growing. On the Pacific coast a great viticultural industry is based on the growing of the European type of grape. In the Central and Northeastern United States we have another type of grape in-   121       122       dustry, based upon the growing of native American “bunch grape” varieties, de¬ rived by breeding and selection from the native grape species of that region. In the Southeastern United States, the Mus¬ cadine grape industry has developed from the selection and breeding of good varie¬ ties from the native Muscadine grapes. We may gain in the study of Florida grape growing by noting briefly the his¬ tory of these three grape growing dis¬ tricts, the Pacific coast district, the Cen¬ tral and Northeastern district, and the Southeastern district.  The European grape is the more highly developed type having been selected and bred since the earliest days of history. It was brought to this country apparently by all the pioneer expeditions. The Spanish Mission fathers carried it into Southern California from Mexico and because of the climatic and soil adaptability of that section the European grape succeeded on the Pacific coast, but it failed utterly when the Pilgrim fathers and other emigrants to the Northwestern States endeavored to establish it in their section, where the cli¬ mate was not congenial. In the grapes of New York by Hedrick you may find the record of these sad failures and the grad¬ ual turning to the native bunch grapes of the region with the resulting development of such varieties as the Concord, Niagara and Catawba from the wild “Fox grapes” which are the basis of Northeastern grape industry.  In the Southeast the early emigrants, as in the Northeast, brought the European grapes to America, and after failing with them they naturally sought to grow the   native grapes developed further North, but these Fox grape varieties, the Con¬ cord, Niagara, etc., though quite success¬ ful in the North, were as foreign to condi¬ tions found in the Southeast, almost, as the European grape; and they have not succeeded (except in the higher elevations such as Western North Carolina, where climatic conditions are much as they are further North.) Then the Southern hor¬ ticulturist began selecting and growing the native Muscadine grapes. This has proven profitable as the growing of the native grapes proved profitable in the North.  Now let us note the grape history of Florida. Today all three types of grapes are represented, and judging by my cor¬ respondence and the statements I note in the horticultural and daily news press of the State, there is some confusion and misunderstanding among the general pub¬ lic.  When the early Spanish settlers came to Florida they brought with them the European grapes and planted these along the eastern coast of the State and on the Florida Keys. Only one representative of this planting has survived the climatic and soil conditions and even this one, known as the Key Grape, is considered somewhat a curiosity. It has been maintained in the plant gardens of horticultural enthusiasts, but it cannot be considered as ever having thrived in Florida. Later as emigrants came to Florida from the North and Cen¬ tral West they introduced the best grapes of those regions and while these grapes did better than the European grapes, they certainly did not thrive and it was the fail-       123   ure of these grape plantings that caused the first investigations of Florida grape growing by the U. S. Department of Ag¬ riculture. The investigator sent into the field then, was none other than Dr. Wm. A. Taylor, now chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry. This was approximately thirty years ago and since that time the Department has kept a continuous eye on the grape situation in Florida. In addi¬ tion to the work of the offices of Fruit Transportation and Storage Investiga¬ tions, Insect and Disease Investigations, etc., it has maintained a grape specialist rather continuously in the field. In order to test the different types of grape grow¬ ing for Florida the Department undertook the establishment of an experimental vine¬ yard at Earldon, Fla., (near Waldo) on the estate of Baron von Lutischaw. Here a large collection of European, native bunch grapes and Muscadines were tested. The results certainly did not warrant the recommendation of either the European or bunch grape type as a reliable basis for extensive commercial industry. The De¬ partment then turned its attention to the development of the Muscadine grape as the basis of profitable grape growing not only for Florida, but for the entire South¬ east. This work of developing the native Muscadine grape began in a vineyard at the Ronnoc grove, New Smyrna, Florida, and has continued steadily for about 18 years. That we are working on the right line we have no doubt. The developing of the native species has in the case of the grape proven advisable and the only means of success in the Northeast, in Missouri, in Texas, in the Southeast, in   Europe and in the tropics. The Depart¬ ment’s efforts have brought results of im¬ portance already.  In Florida today it is generally recog¬ nized, I believe, that the European grape has a place only in the gardens of plant collectors, where vines may be maintained as botanical specimens by giving them spe¬ cial care.  With the so-called bunch grapes, on the other hand, although the records of the State for the past three decades is one of failure due to the vines not being able to thrive under the climatic and other condi¬ tions, there has been a great deal of inter¬ est manifest in the last few years. I feel it my duty, therefore, as the Department’s representative, to sound a word of caution before this society and to point out the probable limitations of bunch grape grow¬ ing in the State.  It is my opinion that under Florida con¬ ditions the making of extensive plantings of the bunch grapes as a class or the too extensive encouragement of small plant¬ ings with a view to securing commercial profits will result in disappointment. On the other hand let me say that if produc¬ tion is kept limited to relatively few indi¬ viduals serving respectively the various cities of the State, these individuals may secure profit from their undertaking. To do so, however, the individual must first know how to grow grapes, he must then enter the business on a basis of renewing or replacing his vineyard approximately every five to six bearing years. During the entire life of the vineyard he must fight to control insect and disease ene¬ mies. If he prunes severely to produce    124       handsome market fruit, the life of the vineyard will be reduced, and if he fails to prune, he will increase the costs of thin¬ ning, harvesting, and other vineyard op¬ erations and the vines will tend to over¬ bear and produce inferior fruit and event¬ ually die out anyway.  The idea has been advanced that certain varieties of the type of the Carman which T. V. Munson of Texas produced and in¬ troduced as being adapted to Texas condi¬ tions might succeed in Florida, but are the climatic and soil conditions of Florida more like Texas than they are like Ohio let us say? No true Floridian would ever admit that! I have also noticed in the State press reference to certain hybrids of promise, but I have not been able to secure authentic information regarding them. A hybrid is an individual resulting from a cross between varieties representing two distinct species. The cross to be authen¬ tic should be secured under isolated condi¬ tions. It will require one year to make the cross, one year to propagate the seedling, three and probably four more years to bring it to fruitfulness. It should then be kept under observation for at least three years (better six if one wishes to be sure of its merit) and it must then be multi¬ plied before it may be sold. To our knowledge no one was doing such work for Florida ten years ago and accordingly no one can present such a variety to the trade today with any positive assurance as to its special adaptability for Florida. There is, however, an excellent chance to produce good grapes eventually by careful breeding and selection with the wild bunch grapes of the State, but the outlook is not   altogether promising as these native grapes do not show so much merit in the wild as do the wild Muscadines. The Muscadines have already proven in the Government’s investigations and that of the Southeastern State Experiment Sta¬ tions to be the more amenable or the more subject to amelioration by breeding and selection. Moreover, the Muscadine type is more productive. It does not re¬ quire spraying to control disease and in¬ sect enemies. It is the more resistant to frost and freezes, and to our damp, rainy summer conditions. It is the distinctive type which does not succeed in the North or West. It produces distinctive fruit products of character. These are com¬ mercial assets of great importance. Cer¬ tainly it seems to be the commercial grape for North Florida.  The bunch grapes and European grapes have from time to time been planted here and there throughout the State, but can any one point out plantings of them today which to any degree approximate in age the arbors of Muscadines at St. Augus¬ tine, which in their productive and vigor¬ ous old age stand as fitting symbols of the ancient city itself? Not only do these ar¬ bors of Muscadines exist at St. Augustine, but you may find them scattered over most of North Florida and here and there small vineyards have existed for years and they have proven profitable. I recall one of them out from Lake City which I vis¬ ited some years ago and found most pro¬ ductive. There was another near Orlando whose owner refused an offer from me of $2.00 per bushel for the crop, to use in the Government’s grape utilization investiga-   )       125   tions. I afterwards learned of him selling his fruit at $4.50 per bushel in peach crates. The vines were over 25 years old and had never been sprayed or systemat¬ ically pruned.  In all, there is abundant evidence of the practical adaptability of the Muscadine type of grape to North Florida conditions while the evidence as to the lack of adapt¬ ability of the bunch grape type is equally authenticated by the past and it would ap¬ pear that it is now time for the horticul¬ turist of Florida to recognize what the past has taught, and center efforts on the production and commercialization of the type that succeeds.  I would not for a minute discourage the maintenance of the European grapes in plant collections or the tender care of such a variety about a Florida home in order that the home might have a few clusters of this most highly developed type of fruit, but such grape growing is not likely to show a profit if practiced on a commer¬ cial scale. The native American bunch grapes, especially those derived from the Southern Aestivales, Linsicumen or Ber- quiniana species, will do better than the European varieties and may be justly planted about the homes to provide fruit for home consumption in advance of the Muscadine grape season, if one desires. Occasionally some individual who has had grape growing experience elsewhere may handle an acre or two with more or less profit from the sale of fruit, but he is likely to be deceived, for under Florida conditions, while the vines may seemingly show high quality fruit and no disease at first, the diseases will rapidly multiply—   even when faithfully combatted with spraying; and the vines will, as they bear successive crops, lose their vitality and sooner or later become unprofitable even under the care of the best viticulturists. The grower without large capital would under such conditions find it necessary to start over again, but with his invested cap¬ ital lost with the failure of his grape vines. Contrast with this another individual who chose the Muscadine grapes as his viti- cultural venture. He will plant only once and if he gives the vines care within rea¬ son, his children will receive the vinevard along with other legacies. So far as past experience shows us, he need not spray for either insect or disease enemies. Since the vines are more productive, he will harvest larger crops. Because the Muscadine grape in its territory is, perhaps the most reliable annual cropper, he may feel rela¬ tively immune to crop failures. (In the 15 years of its existence there has never been a crop failure in the Government’s Muscadine Grape Experiment Vineyard at Willard, N. C. We have had drought, rainy seasons, hail, wind, frost and late freezes, exceptionally cold winters and hot summers, but no crop failure.) I have seen 2*4 tons of fruit per acre picked from a commercial vineyard in North Carolina 77 years old, and a ton of grapes and bale of cotton secured from an acre of 4-year- old vines a mile away in the same season. If the Florida grower of Muscadines neg¬ lects his vineyard he will still be more fa¬ vored than he deserves, while neglect for the “bunch grape” grower in Florida will mean certain loss. As to the market, no one can predict the future, but our experi-         126       ence in introducing Muscadine grape products indicates an abundant and lucra¬ tive market for fresh fruit, unfermented grape juice, jelly and perhaps other prod¬ ucts.  In summary I would advise against general commercial grape growing of any description in South Florida. In North Florida I can recommend the Muscadine grapes as a promising basis of commer¬ cial grape growing. Certain well in¬ formed growers not solely dependent on the investment might find it profitable to grow a limited acreage of bunch grapes, but such grape culture does not seem to possess those attributes of stability to war¬ rant large investment or recommend it as the sole reliance of individuals without surplus capital. All kinds of grapes may be grown in North Florida for home use if one desires and is willing to go to the necessary trouble and expense, but cer¬ tainly the Muscadines will prove the more satisfactory if a choice must be made be¬ tween types. They will produce more fruit, yield more crops, and do it with less effort and cost. Their vines will make the more attractive arbors and their fruit will prove equally satisfying as fresh fruit and adaptable for the production of delicious home jellies, jams, sauces and fruit juices.  It is not my purpose to discourage those who are at present engaged in bunch grape ventures in the State, but to caution against the general undertaking of such ventures without due consideration of the risks involved and the nature of the in¬ vestment.  -: I would like to ask Mr. Dear-  ing what effect does a type of soil have on   a variety of grape and does a variety dif¬ fer under high and low soils ?  Dearing: The type of soil affects the behavior of a variety decidedly. One of the most fundamental principles of suc¬ cessful grape growing is that one should maintain a balance between wood and fruit production. The nature of a soil will affect the grape variety by either in¬ creasing or decreasing the vigor of growth. Low heavy soils will cause more growth on the vine than would be secured by placing the same variety on high sandy land. Other means of regulating this bal¬ ance of wood and fruit production are pruning, training, the use of commercial fertilizer, etc. If a vine is placed on the fan system of training its fruiting arms are vertically placed and this tends to stim¬ ulate wood growth. It is better for weak growing varieties that tend to set an over¬ load of fruit. The horizontal arm system on vertical trellis or on an overhead sys¬ tem is better for the variety that is very vigorous. Such a variety is made more fruitful by placing the fruiting arms in horizontal position. Severe pruning stim¬ ulates wood growth and by heavy appli¬ cation of nitrogenous fertilizer a vine may be thrown into vigorous wood growth at the expense of fruitfulness.  C. A. Curry: I would like to ask what effect the rainy season has on the harvest¬ ing grapes. I understand in California that is their greatest trouble.  Zimmerman: We have not been trou¬ bled with rain at all. Sometimes within one hour we have packed grapes and have not had any bad results.@@     
 Grape Varieties@@   E. L. Lord@@, College of Agriculture,@@ Gainesville@@   The subject of grape varieties for Flor¬ ida conditions is an important one, as the history of American viticulture has been dotted with failures because of the lack of proper appreciation of this vital point. With the single exception of California, it has been impossible to develop a com¬ mercial grape industry in any part of North America, without using the blood of species that are native to the region. Florida is no exception, and in order to establish a flourishing grape industry in this State it will be necessary to use the native grapes freely in breeding. We are fortunate that we have such a wealth of species from which to choose, for Florida has within her boundaries at least eight wild species of grapes, or one-fourth of all grape species native to North Florida. Of these native species, only two have been used to any extent, the Muscadine or ro- tundifolia grape and the aestivalis or sum¬ mer grape.  It is unnecessary for me to discuss at length the Muscadine grape, as Mr. Dear- ing has already pointed out to you its value. While it is the most vigorous and disease resistant of North American grapes, it is also the hardest to ameliorate. Mr. Dearing’s achievement with this grape is without contradiction the most notable work in grape breeding within a  127   generation. Unfortunately no commer¬ cial table grape has yet been produced from this species, and its season when grown for domestic use is comparatively short.  Before I discuss the aestivalis or sum¬ mer grape I should like to recall to you some facts from the history of grape growing in Eastern North America. When the earlier settlers came to North America their first interest was to dupli¬ cate the wine industry, and they had no doubt that it was possible, for were there not wild grapes everywhere? But all of the European grapes planted died of phyl¬ loxera and mildew, and only by planting wildings of the native fox grape or labrus- ca, were they able to grow grapes in the North.  Early in the last century, E. S.~ Rogers, of Salem, Mass., the pioneer grape breeder of North America, hybridized the fox grape with the European grape in or¬ der to obtain the fruit of the wine grape on the disease resistant vine of the native grape. While he produced many hybrids, none of them have become commercially valuable; probably because first genera¬ tion crosses do not appear to blend these characters sufficiently. Commercial vine¬ yards in the North are confined almost entirely to four varieties : Catawba, Con-           128     cord, both wild fox grape seedlings, the Worden and Niagara, both seedlings of Concord.  The first organized attempt at grape breeding in the South was made by T. V. Munson of Denison, Texas. All types of grapes, both pure seedlings and varieties, that he could obtain, were planted out by him in Texas. Most of them succumbed to the trying climate of that region; in fact, Munson found that the Northern va¬ rieties such as Concord and Niagara, had little more disease resistance than the European grape, when planted in the South. However, a variety of the aes¬ tivalis or summer grape is native to that region, and this variety, the post oak grape, was used by Munson as a parent. This species is very vigorous and has a high resistance to disease and to heat. The type form of this grape grows wild throughout North Florida, and another variety, Simpson’s grape, grows through¬ out South Florida. By crossing selected seedlings of this grape with grapes such as the Lindley, the Triumph, the Herbe- mont and others which were high in qual¬ ity, he was able to develop hundreds of grape varieties, which ripened throughout a long season, which are strictly Southern grapes, and by proper selection of varie¬ ties can be grown throughout the Gulf States. In the discussion of the aestivalis hybrids I wish to call to your attention several characteristics of this species that have been transmitted in a greater or less extent to its offspring. First, it is the most adaptable species of grape found in North America, ranging from New York and Michigan to Florida and Texas. In   Florida it grows luxuriantly, the type form in Northern Florida, and the variant described as Simpson’s grape throughout South Florida. Like almost all native grapes, it is intolerant of an excess of lime; where the wine grape can endure soils analyzing 40% lime, the summer grape will chlorose badly when the soil contains 15%. While it makes a good union when used as a stock for other grape varieties, in fact, several varieties of it have been used as stocks in Califor¬ nia, it is quite hard to root from cuttings.  It is highly resistant to Phylloxera, black rot and mildews, although many of its hybrids are more or less susceptible, due to the presence of vinifera or labrusca blood. It is a vigorous grower, reaching 50 feet. It is an upland grape and flour¬ ishes where there is good drainage and abundant humus.  At the present time the Ives grape is being grown to some extent in North Florida as a market table grape. This va¬ riety is a labrusca-aestivalis hybrid, very vigorous and disease resistant, and also very poor in quality. It contains no blood of the European grape, which accounts for its quality. It may be valuable as a breed¬ ing parent for better varieties.  The Carman is a cross made by Munson between the Premier, a selected wild aes¬ tivalis grape, and the Triumph. The Tri¬ umph is a cross between the Concord and Muscat. The Concord is pure labrusca, and the Muscat pure vinifera. The Mus¬ cat is probably one of the greatest com¬ mercial grapes of the vinifera group. The good characters of the Carman come from the blending of the blood of these        \       two great commercial grapes with the vigor of the wild aestivalis.  Another of Munson’s hybrids, the R. W. Munson, is one of the most vigorous and healthy of all grapes in vine and fruit. The fruit is of good quality and stands shipping well. Unfortunately, however, the vine is self-sterile, and will not bear unless pollinated by other varieties bloom¬ ing at the same time.  An especially interesting hybrid con¬ taining aestivalis blood is the Delaware, which is very good in quality, but lacks the resistance to disease that a grape should have. It is probably a natural hy¬ brid between aestivalis and vinifera. It is a very weak grower, and the fruit is small in size, but it is the standard in quality among the native grapes. It was used by Munson in breeding, and several grapes containing Delaware blood are be¬ ing grown in Florida.  One of these, the Brilliant, is a cross between Lindley and Delaware, and con¬ sequently half vinifera, Y aestivalis and Y labrusca. It is a very early grape, and is being grown for home use from Flor¬ ida to New York and Texas. Another, the Headlight, is a cross between Moyer and Brilliant. Moyer is half Delaware, and Headlight is very much like Delaware in fruit, while the vine is quite vigorous and free from disease. It is the earliest good American grape, grows well in Flor¬ ida, and is fine for home use. It ripens in Florida in May, making the grape sea¬ son here a long one, and starting that long succession of home varieties which ends with the Muscadine in late August.  Another variety of Munson’s introduc-   129  tion is the Ellen Scott, sometimes called the Florida Tokay. The late E. P. Pow¬ ell, a horticulturist well known to many of you, and a grape grower of much experi¬ ence, grew this grape for years at Sorren¬ to, Florida. He pronounced this grape the best in quality of any grape, and he was without doubt correct, as those of you who have had an opportunity to sample it know. It is a cross between two aesti- valis-vinifera hybrids, Armlong and Her- bemont.  The Armlong mentioned above was also crossed with Malaga. Several grapes re¬ sulted from this cross, the Armalaga. Ro¬ naldo, and Edna. These are all fine white grapes of excellent quality, with fair dis¬ ease-resistance. It appears to be difficult to obtain a high disease-resistance and still keep high proportions of European blood.  In closing this discussion of varieties, may I suggest that no variety yet pro¬ duced, not even the Thomas, is perfectly adapted to Florida conditions. This is naturally so, as none of them were pro¬ duced here. Without doubt some of the varieties discarded by Munson, or killed by that intemperate climate, would have been perfectly suited to Florida. At least one variety produced by Munson was kill¬ ed by the cold. This variety was called the DeSoto, and was a cross between the Muscadine grape of the Gulf States, and the Everbearing or Bird grape of South Florida. Who can doubt that it would grow throughout Florida?  There are only two ways in which new varieties may be produced, by chance seed¬ lings, and bud variations (happy acci¬ dents), and by purposeful plant breeding    130       projects, either public or private. In times past the growing of large numbers of plants from seeds over large areas by many individuals produced many varie¬ ties from which the best could be selected for perpetuation. The result of educating the grower in the use of vegetative means of propagation has been of great advan¬ tage, but we have lost the opportunity of acquiring many new useful varieties.  It seems to me that the State should,   as soon as possible, undertake the work of breeding and testing new varieties suited to the various climatic sections of the State. Several experiment stations have already undertaken this work, and the re¬ sults have been of great worth to their state. Certainly Florida, with her unique climates, and isolated position, has a great¬ er need than any other state. It cannot and should not be trusted to individual in¬ itiative.@@   
 Can Grapes be Successfully Grown in Florida?@@   H. T. Fisher,@@ Eustis@@   Can grapes be successfully grown in Florida? This question continues to lie across the threshold of the grape industry and is waiting for a convincing affirma¬ tive answer before the industry can enter upon the large development of which the climate, the soil, the seasons, and other natural conditions peculiar to Florida give such abundant assurance and which is be¬ lieved to be already answered by the un¬ failing success of hundreds of growers in different parts of the State, and particu¬ larly in the portion of which Lakeland may be regarded as the center.  It seems not to be generally known that in the past five or six years a new era in grape growing has quietly come to Flori¬ da, and is vindicating its right to live and develop by every test and demonstration that the most exacting specialist might require except, possibly, in the single fac¬ tor of time, but even as to this, the age to which these vineyards may survive and yield their fruit, there should be no hesi¬ tancy because there are many individual instances wherein substantially the same methods of propagation and cultivation that characterize the larger development of grapes today, have been practiced for years, and which are and have been in a highly productive state continuously from the beginning. An example of this kind   is found in my own town of Eustis, where an English gardener named Masters, some twenty years ago, pollenized a wild grape with Concord pollen, and produced a very choice bunch grape. About twelve years ago, Mr. Frank W. Savage, the superin¬ tendent of the Government Station at Eus¬ tis, in crop physiology and breeding in¬ vestigations, grafted a cutting from this vine on a rooted growing cutting of a wild grape, and in about eighteen months thereafter he sold a hundred pounds of choice fruit from this single vine, in the local market. This vine has yielded a full crop every year since and has never been fertilized nor sprayed, nor received any attention except close pruning during the dormant season, and is growing in the up¬ land, yellow sandy soil common about Eustis. Many vines have been grown by neighbors from the Savage vine with like success and fruitage.  The analogy to the genesis of the adapted grape which we are exclusively planting in our vineyards today is obvious because these new grapes also are builded on the sure foundation of one or another of the several species of wild grapes which have grown everywhere in Florida time without mind, and, like the Masters and Savage grape, are hybrids, obtained by pollenizing a domestic bunch grape on a      132       suitable wild grape. This practice is car¬ ried forward to cross pollenization, and to pollenizing one hybrid or another until several crosses have been made, and so on, ad infinitum. Some grafting on this re¬ sistant stock also is practiced, but first and above all other considerations is the presence of the blood of the original or native vine with its inherent resistance to diseases which commonly afflict grapes in practically all climes, at home and abroad, and whereby such diseases are reduced to the minimum, if not entirely avoided. But the time limit for this paper forbids fur¬ ther discussion of this phase of the sub¬ ject, and I may only add that the wild grapes of Florida are known to be immune to Phylloxera, the deadly enemy of Euro¬ pean grapes and also of Northern grapes planted in the South, and that the hybrids we are planting today are commonly im¬ mune to this enemy, so far as we know and believe.  In this connection, I want to quote from an editorial in the Florida Grower, of July 19th, 1919, which speaks with evident knowledge and authority and which brings out my further thought in a very interest¬ ing comparison of the old and the new eras of the grape industry. It says: “So far as the writer knows, there has not been a single failure in acreages of hybrid grapes in this State, and there have been quite a number of acres planted with the most gratifying successes made. Not simply hundreds, but thousands of people of the North, Europe and California have tried out raising grapes in Florida, and without exception have failed, most of them in the first year or two and the re¬   mainder after several years trial. Until hybrid grapes were introduced it could be said without successful contradiction that there had not been developed a single suc¬ cessful vineyard along the entire Gulf coast region of the United States. This is not individual opinion, but is the result of years of accumulation of data by the United States government. Those who are still attempting to upbuild the grape industry all deserve the highest praise, but it would be foolish not to attempt to benefit by the experience of thousands who have lost fortunes in attempting to develop grape growing in Florida, and it would also be foolish not to try to derive benefit from the experience of those who are successfully developing the grape in¬ dustry in Florida. It is not a mere asser¬ tion, but a fact demonstrated thousands of times that only those grapes, whether Cal¬ ifornia, Northern or European, combined with the native wild grape of the Gulf coast region have proven successful against downy mildew, phylloxera and black rot in Florida. These are the three great enemies of grape growing and of these downy mildew is the worst enemy. It is true that this disease has been suc¬ cessfully combatted in the vineyards of California, Europe, and the Northern States but nowhere is it so destructive to vineyards as in the Gulf state region. Only grapes of the hybrid varieties have successfully combatted these diseases in the Gulf coast country. Others have ap¬ parently proven successful for a year or two and sometimes for four or five years, but the fact that there is not a single suc¬ cessful vineyard of California, Northern       133   or European grapes in Florida after more than a half century of efforts on the part of thousands of people who have been suc¬ cessful grape growers elsewhere, is in it¬ self ample demonstration of the verity of the statements herein made. Never was there so much interest as now in grape growing in Florida. The reason is be¬ cause there has been substantial success in the development of this industry in the past several years, due to the planting and proper care of grape vines adapted to Florida soil and climatic conditions. Wild grapes grow in all parts of Florida. Why not others? It has been amply demon¬ strated that only those grapes combined with the native wild grapes will perma¬ nently continue to do well in this State. The scuppernong is no exception, that also being a hybrid grape. Some of the hybrid grapes have been growing successfully in Florida for the past twenty-five years. That is ample demonstration of their stay¬ ing qualities. There is no part of Florida where they will not do well. During the   next grape planting season it is certain that the number of acres of hybrid grapes planted in Florida will be limited only by the supply of the vines, and this will be true for years to come. This year there will be upwards of 15,000 carloads of Cal¬ ifornia grapes sold in the markets of the United States and every California grape will be marketed weeks after the Florida grapes are gone. This gives some idea of the possibilities of the development of grape growing.  “There is much to be learned by the individual grower as to planting, care and marketing of the fruit, but enough prog¬ ress has been made along these lines in the past few years to demonstrate that this new Florida industry is bound to prove a tremendous success, in time rivaling the great grape production industry of Cal¬ ifornia and European countries.”  Finally and as a conclusion I offer this sentiment. Florida, the discovered nat¬ ural home of the grape.@@   
 Citrus Root Stocks@@   W. E. Evans,@@ Leesburg@@   Citrus trees for planting are usually budded on sour orange, rough lemon and other seedling stocks. The problem of selecting the best stock is of great impor¬ tance, for in case an unsuitable stock is used the value of the grove may be perma¬ nently impaired. Sweet orange seedling stocks were formerly used very extensive¬ ly, but as they have been found very sus¬ ceptible to foot-rot they are now seldom used.  The sour orange, a hardy species of citrus, which is frequently found growing wild in Florida forests, is the leading stock in Florida as well as in California and most of the citrus growing regions of the world. It is vigorous and resistant, if not altogether immune, to foot-rot, and the trees produce thin-skinned fruit of fine quality which holds on the branches late in the season. In Florida sour orange seedlings are the favorite seedlings for the hammocks and flatwoods soil as well as the best grade pine land. Most growers prefer sour orange stock wherever soil conditions permit its use.  On light, dry, sandy soils in Southern Florida where sour orange stock lacks thrift, rough lemon stock, a vigorous growing species of citrus related to the common lemon of commerce, is used. Trees on rough lemon stock make a very   vigorous growth and on very light soils are easier to care for and require less fer¬ tilizer than trees on sour orange roots. Rough lemon stocks are tender and not sufficiently hardy for Gulf state sections and colder parts of southern and central Florida. Under favorable conditions trees on rough lemon stock usually are vigorous and productive but it is claimed by many growers that the life of such trees is shorter than on some other stocks.  The fruit produced by trees on rough lemon stock, while often good in dessert quality, is inferior to that grown on sour orange, and it cannot be held on the tree so late in the season. The Parson variety of orange is seldom successfully grown on rough lemon stock.  Grapefruit seedlings have been used as stocks to a limited extent in southern Florida. They are too tender for the cold¬ er sections of the State. This stock is more vigorous in growth than the sour orange, but less vigorous than the rough lemon. It is best adapted to moist soils well supplied with humus, as grapefruit seedlings are less hardy and less resistant to disease than sour orange.  Mr. Frank W. Savage, plant breeder at Government Test Grounds at Eustis, Florida, prefers the grapefruit stock to all others, if soil conditions are at all suit-        135   able. The first prize grapefruit at Tampa Fair for three years was on grapefruit stock.  The trifoliate orange is the hardiest stock for citrus fruits in common use. It is deciduous, shedding its leaves, and has a distinct dormant season in the winter. This dormancy has the effect of checking the winter wood growth of varieties bud¬ ded to it, causing them to be less suscepti¬ ble to low temperatures. For this reason trifoliate orange seedlings are much used as stocks in the colder sections of the Gulf states. They are rarely desirable as stocks in southern and central Florida and have given unsatisfactory results in the Rio Grande Valley section of Texas.  The trifoliate orange stock is best adapted to rich moist soils and is unsuited to light dry soils. It is particularly well adapted to sandy loam soils with a clay sub-soil. On the proper soils it produces thin-skinned fruit of high dessert quality. It has a tendency to dwarf the growth of the tree budded on it. In the lower Mis¬ sissippi delta, Washington Navel oranges are frequently budded on trifoliate orange stock, and while the growth is less vigor¬ ous in that locality, they are more prolific than when budded on sour orange stock.  Ever-bearing lemon and lime seedlings are occasionally used as citrus stock, but are too tender for general planting. Bit¬ ter-sweet and Cleopatra mandarin have also been used on a small scale; the latter has not been used long enough in various locations on the various types of soil to warrant it general use, although indica¬ tions are promising.   SOUR ORANGE VS. ROUGH LEMON  Figures published by the Plant Board show that ending April, 1921, 3,294,558 rough lemon seedlings were planted and only 774,330 sour orange seedlings and 77,004 other seedling stocks, mostly grapefruit.  I believe that any one having Florida’s horticultural interest at heart cannot but feel alarmed at the tremendous planting on rough lemon. It is a fact though that the high pine ridge lands are as a rule de¬ ficient in humus and moisture and rough lemon stock seems capable of overcoming these soil difficulties to a large degree, while the sour orange and grapefruit stocks apparently do not, but I believe there are many groves on rough lemon that would have been more profitable in the end if they had been on sour or grape¬ fruit stock.  There are sections in South Dade coun¬ ty, for instance, where you can see trees actually dying from the drought where propagated on grapefruit and sour orange stock and groves immediately across the road in excellent condition, showing no signs of distress, said to have received the same care, attention, fertilization, etc. The only difference being they are on rough lemon stock.  You will see trees on rough lemon growing in a grove with a number of trees on sour stock and be informed that the trees on rough lemon stock were put in by mistake and the trees on rough lemon have twice the bearing capacity as trees on sour orange and are said to produce three or four times as much fruit, yet the  136       grower will say they expect to lose about 2% of their trees every year after the trees are ten years old on rough lemon and none on sour orange.  The fruit grown on rough lemon is un¬ deniably coarser of skin, has less charac¬ ter and dries out quicker than fruit grown under same condition on sour orange stock. The advocates of rough lemon ad¬ mit this to be the case while trees are young, but claim the trees overcome it in later years, but this isn’t borne out in Lake county, or any other sour orange section, where the tree fails to improve with age.  Comparison of groves in Grand Island section of Lake county budded on sour orange and rough lemon is very striking. Valencia Late oranges on lemon stock during late April were beginning to dry out and were poorly colored, while same age trees in same grove under same cul¬ tural conditions on sour orange were in prime condition.  One reason why so many trees on lemon stock have been sold and planted is be¬ cause the nurseryman wanted the planter to use lemon stock, as the nurseryman can produce the same trees on lemon stock in one-half the time and at one-half the cost of production. It is easier to produce the rough lemon seedlings, it is easier to get a larger per cent of buds to take and it is easier to get them to start off, and easier to get a salable tree than on sour orange or grapefruit.  It is the perfect root stock from the nurseryman’s standpoint. The sour or¬ ange and grapefruit seedling is a slower grower, requires longer time in the seed   bed and nursery row before it can be bud¬ ded, and it is impossible to get a perfect stand of buds, whereas the lemon can be budded at almost any time of growing season by the most novice of budders with almost a perfect stand. The big develop¬ ment companies prefer lemon stock, for they can produce a fine looking grove in a much shorter time. But no one disputes the fact that the lemon is more subject to disease and cold, produces poorer quality fruit, has less color and is shorter lived than the sour.  The high pine ridge lemon men will say that they are too far south to be damaged by the cold, but we must remember that the bulk of lemon stock groves have been put out since we had a disastrous freeze. What would happen if we had a bad freeze?  We have had more frost injury in late years as far south as Fort Myers than we have had in Lake, Orange or Marion counties. Suppose California groves had been on lemon stock, what would have been the result this past winter. Wouldn’t it be better to build more permanent groves, produce better, juicier fruit, in¬ stead of trying to get too quick results.  Mr. H. B. Stevens of DeLand, sums it up—at least from the viewpoint of the sour orange growers—when he says, “The only advantage I can see for the rough lemon is it will grow faster and make a grove to sell quicker to some ten¬ derfoot.”  I have been informed by the manager of the Florida Citrus Sub-Exchange that the Government during April sent a man into the Winter Haven section to investi-        137   gate the cause of so much fruit arriving in soft and dried out condition from Polk county. They were sure we must have had a freeze some time or other. This soft fruit was from a lemon stock section.  The time is coming when fruit grown on sour orange stock will be so stenciled on the box and command a better price, especially on late shipments of Valencias. Careful study of the prices received for fruits from different sections of the State, will show which sections top the market.  Nursery Inspector F. M. O’Byrne sent out a questionnaire on citrus root stock and the following is a summary:  In Coconut Grove section the preference is on lemon root, it bears earlier but is not so long lived and fruit is not so good as sour orange or grapefruit.  Around Fort Myers about half the trees are on sour orange, next preference is grapefruit and rough lemon.  “Lemon can be used on lighter drier types of soil, is a rapid grower, but short lived and subject to foot rot.  “Advantages of sour orange: Good on low heavy soil; stands moist conditions, immune from foot-rot. Grapefruit has same advantages as lemon and similar dis¬ advantages.”  DeLand section is partial to sour, with grapefruit and lemon used only in limited quantities.  In Fort Pierce section about 60% is planted on sour orange, 30% in lemon and 5% on grapefruit. “Use sour when soil is suitable, as fruit is superior on sour.”   “Lemon will grow well on soil too poor to grow sour, but on sour, fruit is better, more resistant to cold and longer lived.”  Dade county: “Use grapefruit on high and sour on low land. Lemon makes a good showing earlier in life, has no tap root and fruit dries out.”  “Grapefruit has fine root system, best of all. Sour orange produces most perma¬ nent grove.”  Around Arcadia almost 50% of groves are on sour. Writer says, “Sour every time.”  From Bartow 75% of trees are on lem¬ on; 20% are on sour and 5% on grape¬ fruit.  The writer says: “Lemon stands dry weather on poor soil better, makes a quick¬ er growth in nursery, responds to ferti¬ lizer, scabs worse, easily affected to foot- rot and gummosis, produces coarse fruit under abnormal conditions.  “Sour orange stock in the end produces better fruit and longer lived tree. The texture of the fruit is considerably better, finer in quality, is practically immune from foot-rot, and does best in heavy soils, but does not produce thrifty trees on high rolling sandy soil. Requires more fertilizer than lemon, inclined to die- back and frenching.  “The advantages of grapefruit are that although the tree is somewhat dwarfed, it produces an excellent, bright, thinner skinned fruit; the first prize grapefruit at Tampa Fair for three years was on grape¬ fruit stock.  “The grapefruit likes a low soil and ap¬ pears to do well where land is under-          138       drained. The chief disadvantage seems to be the smallness of the tree, and in some cases I have noticed that the fruit is small, and does not seem to hold on as well. I have in no case noticed a bad case of foot- rot.”  SUMMARY  Sour orange stock leads the list, if we take into consideration the hardiness of the tree and the quality of the fruit pro¬ duced.  Grapefruit stock comes second, espe¬ cially in some localities.  On high pine ridge soils too deficient in humus to produce trees on the other stocks, the rough lemon must be used.   The lemon is most profitable to grow from the nurseryman’s standpoint, but what will be the result when these 3^2 million lemon stocks are budded and come; into bearing?  Everyone admits they will produce poor¬ er quality fruit. The sour orange and grapefruit seedling stock groves will sure¬ ly be in a better position to get that extra “50 cents” we have been hearing so much about.  Take as a little illustration the display of fruit in the lobby of the hotel. Com¬ pare the Blue Goose Brands on exhibition, all produced on sour stock, with the other fruit, produced on rough lemon—which would get that extra “50 cents?”   Adaptability of Various Stocks Modified from Table of Josiah Varn, of Braden-  town, Fla.

 The Progeny Grove as a Basis for Citrus  Fruit Improvement@@   T. Ralph Robinson,@@ Bureau of Plant Industry,@@ Washington, D. C@@   It is not my intention to review in detail the investigational work which has dem¬ onstrated the feasibility and value of es¬ tablishing actual pedigreed strains of standard citrus varieties. The use of tree- performance records has been fully ex¬ plained in a number of publications easily available, and in talks to this society and elsewhere, Mr. L. B. Scott, of the Depart¬ ment of Agriculture, has explained the workings of the system as successfully carried out in California under the leader¬ ship of Mr. Shamel and Mr. Scott.  I do, however, want to quote a para¬ graph from Mr. A. D. Shamel’s bulletin on “Citrus Fruit Improvement,” to indi¬ cate the basic reasons for undertaking the bud-selection project. He says: “The established and proved citrus varieties are the most valuable possession of the citrus industry. The conservation, standardiza¬ tion and stabilization of these varieties should receive most careful consideration by citrus propagators and growers.  “The deterioration or Tunning out’ of these varieties through unintentional prop¬ agation of undesirable strains is responsi¬ ble for a large proportion of the low yields of inferior fruits in many citrus orchards. The introduction of new varieties to take   the place of those that have become un¬ profitable by reason of the use of careless methods of propagation is usually a mat¬ ter of experiment. The establishment of new varieties requires long periods of time to prove their value to the grower and to introduce them to the markets.”  In the fall of 1920 I spent a few weeks in the citrus sections of California and had the opportunity to inspect with Mr. Shamel some of the young bearing groves propagated from bearing fruiting branch¬ es of selected parent trees, the selection in each case being based on actual records of tree yields covering periods of five years or more.  The uniformity shown in these groves (which we are calling “progeny groves”), together with the early and heavy fruiting habit, was most striking and convincing. Even if there were not present in our cit¬ rus groves any appreciable percentage of unproductive or off-type trees, the raising of the average in quality and quantity would fully justify the work of establish¬ ing these truly pedigreed strains. The word “pedigree” is often abused when used in connection with tree propagation. In animal breeding a pedigree means something quite definite—it is backed by   139    140       authenticated figures of production or breeding, or both—until we insist on the same rigid requirements for a plant pedi¬ gree we are not apt to make much advance toward variety improvement.  The behavior of some of these progeny orchards in California has introduced some new ideas and practices into the methods of bud selection and propagation. It has become apparent that it is not suf¬ ficient that the parent tree from which budwood is secured should be a good pro¬ ducer. It must also be in a state of equi¬ librium, so to speak. That is, not given to producing occasional fruits of an un¬ desirable type. The final proof of this stability in the parent is the behavior of the progeny and a truly stabilized or ped¬ igreed strain cannot be said to have be¬ come established until a progeny from a single selected tree has come into bearing and the fruit has proven uniformly good and true to type. Progeny groves of this sort then become a most valuable source of budwood, but any sporting tendency appearing in a progeny-planting, from a single parent, renders all the trees in that progeny undesirable for further use in propagation. To illustrate: Some years ago Mr. Shamel started a small progeny orchard from a selected lemon tree in Cal¬ ifornia to test out what could be expected from certain types of budwood. The se¬ lected parent tree was a good producer, but had one small branch which produced elongated ridged fruits—quite worthless from a commercial viewpoint. Ten trees were top-worked, using budwood from this sporting branch, and one hundred similar trees were top-worked at the same   time, using budwood from the portion of the tree producing fruit true to type. Last year these top-worked trees came into fruiting. As was to have been expected, the ten trees from the sporting branch produced fruit of much the same charac¬ ter as the parent branch, generally unde¬ sirable. The one hundred trees from nor¬ mal budwood also produced on a consider¬ able number of branches fruits in varying degrees resembling the ridged elongated fruit on the sporting branch of the parent tree. In other words, the tendency to variability was “in the blood,” and it was not sufficient in choosing budwood to avoid the branch showing the off-type fruit. The whole tree in such cases must be discarded as a source of propagating material. This demonstration, together with similar cases coming under observa¬ tion, has led to the idea of establishing progeny groves where parentage lines can be tested out before they are accepted for wide use in propagation.  The keeping of tree performance rec¬ ords is going to prove just as important in the progeny groves as in the original groves from which the parent trees are selected. Naturally, all possible care should be taken in selecting parent trees free from pronounced variability, a point that has been given special attention in recent selections. When it comes to cut¬ ting budwood in commercial quantities, however, it is not always feasible or eco¬ nomical to give the minute inspection nec¬ essary to each parent tree, and it is here that the progeny grove of proven uni¬ formity of type promises to greatly sim¬ plify the whole problem of bud selection.        141   The principle involved in the progeny- grove applies not only to citrus varieties but undoubtedly to all bud-propagated plants—a fact that is being gradually real¬ ized.  A recent publication issued by the Cana¬ dian Society of Technical Agriculture (Sci. Agri. Dec. 1921 p. 120) contains an account of an experiment in bud hered¬ ity with the Wealthy apple. The progenies from high and low yielding parent trees grown side by side have given high and low yields corresponding to their parents. Records were kept on these progenies con¬ sisting of seventeen grafted trees covering nine years of production, the progeny from the heaviest yielding parent tree having given 62% more crop on the aver¬ age than the progeny from the poorest yielding tree. To check against any pos¬ sible differences due to the vigor of indi¬ vidual stocks, scions from the best and poorest yielding apple trees were top- grafted on large bearing trees, each such tree carrying both high and low yielding scions. Here again the total crops for a five-year period corresponded to the yield of the respective parent trees, the differ¬ ence in production being even more pro¬ nounced than when propagated on sepa¬ rate stocks.  Such results as these all lead to the con¬ clusion that there do exist inherent differ¬ ences in bud strains that can be isolated and perpetuated by the selection of and propagation from superior individuals. There is no doubt in my mind that differ¬ ences of commercial or economic impor¬ tance often exist when they are not dis¬ cernible without the aid of carefully kept   tree records—a point that has been the subject of much speculation and some ar¬ gument among Florida growers for a number of years. Recently I have had the opportunity to go over the actual tree picking records from several Florida groves of good average production, and where the trees appear at a casual inspec¬ tion to be quite uniformly vigorous and productive.  It is no uncommon thing in computing the individual tree yields to find certain individuals that have produced over a six or seven-year period two to four times the average amount of fruit yielded by other trees in the same grove. While the number of actual “drones” or non-produc¬ ers is very small, yet such trees have been found to exist; furthermore, there are nu¬ merous low-yielding trees that fall consid¬ erably below the general average—trees that to all appearances have every advan¬ tage that their neighbors enjoy. Such trees come dangerously near the point of being maintained at a loss—especially in periods of low prices. While the elimina¬ tion of these low producers is important, for the future of fruit production the dis¬ covery of the unusually prolific trees for propagation is even more important and justifies the work necessary to locate them, even though no drones or unprofit¬ able trees be found in the course of the investigation. We are familiar with the efficiency methods that have revolution¬ ized modern factory method and practice —it is an accepted fact that competition has forced the adoption of such methods —and the man or plant that fails to fall in line is soon hopelessly involved. Is it    142       too much to say that we are approaching the same point in horticulture, where the profit will go to that man and only to that man who produces a high acre yield of high quality fruit without increasing his expense for production and overhead in a disproportionate amount ?  Now the question becomes a pertinent one—What is being done at the present time to bring about modern efficiency in citrus propagation? The demonstrations carried on in California during the last decade were so convincing to the citrus growers of that state that in May, 1917, the Fruit Growers’ Exchange established a Bud Supply Company as a branch of their Growers’ Supply Company. This company furnishes at cost to all nursery¬ men and growers buds of all the standard commercial citrus varieties secured from superior parent trees. The use of such selected buds has become well night uni¬ versal so that the young citrus groves of the near future are going to be true prog¬ eny groves, capable of having their lineage traced back to certain superior parents.  The deciduous nurserymen of Califor¬ nia have made a beginning along this line, starting a system of record keeping in se¬ lected groves under Mr. L. B. Scott’s di¬ rection during the year of 1920.  In Alabama the Satsuma nurserymen, co-operating with the State Board of Hor¬ ticulture and the Bureau of Plant Indus¬ try, are already securing practically all their budwood from selected trees, the yield of which is being recorded from year to year, some of these trees already hav¬ ing a three-year performance record back of them. This system is destined to mean   much to the Satsuma industry of the Gulf states, being inaugurated at a time when the industry is still in its infancy. It can¬ not fail to give this industry an almost unique position in the horticultural field, which will doubtless be reflected in the market returns for a long time to come.  In Florida the opportunity was offered during the last year to undertake sys¬ tematic bud selection work by the acquir¬ ing of a Branch Experiment Station in the heart of the great citrus region sur¬ rounding Lake Alfred. The Florida Ex¬ periment Station in co-operation with the Bureau of Plant Industry has undertaken as one of the first and leading projects on this new station to establish a progeny grove such as we have previously dis¬ cussed. The first step in carrying out this project is naturally the selection of supe¬ rior parent trees from which to start prog¬ enies. Fortunately, several co-operators of the Bureau of Plant Industry in bud selection work located in the immediate vicinity of the Lake Alfred Branch Sta¬ tion have been keeping tree records, cov¬ ering six or more years. By an examina¬ tion of these carefully kept records and by close inspection of the trees themselves when fruit was hanging and mature, it has been possible to secure what promises to be a superior lot of budwood represent¬ ing the principal standard varieties. In the case of such varieties as the Pineapple and Parson Brown of Florida origin, it has been thought advisable to also secure budwood from the old groves where these varieties were first propagated, at Citra and Lake Weir respectively. In such cases where actual record of the tree yields       143   are lacking, the trees selected have been marked and the record of yield from each will be secured during the five or six years that the progeny buds are being fruited out—a sort of “ex-post facto” perform¬ ance record. In all cases, however, the selected trees have shown evidence of be¬ ing at least above the average in vigor, production and quality of fruit. The or¬ ange varieties which will be represented by progenies at the Lake Alfred Station are those selected as standard by a com¬ mittee of representative Florida growers at the Citrus Seminar in 1916. The re¬ cord of this committee was unanimously adopted by the growers attending that Seminar. These varieties in order of their season of maturity are—Parson Brown, Homosassa, Pineapple, Valencia and Lue Gim Gong.  In addition, of course, a number of grapefruit progenies will be included, es¬ pecial attention being given to the Marsh Seedless, owing to the importance this va¬ riety has assumed in recent new plantings.  With the orange varieties of leading commercial importance such as the Pine¬ apple and Valencia varieties, at least ten selected parent trees will be represented by a progeny of twelve budded trees each. These progenies will be carefully studied and compared as they come into fruiting   to select from them one or more strains of pre-eminent vigor and fruit quality for further propagation.  The plan contemplates expanding the progeny planting as the demand for bud- wood may warrant by propagation on a larger scale from those progenies that give evidence of being superior in produc¬ tion and quality of fruit. The Florida Agricultural Experiment Station will have exclusive control of the disposition of the budwood produced, which, however, it is expected will be offered to growers and nurserymen on a non-profit basis, as a public service proposition. No budwood, however, will be available until the prog¬ enies have been brought into fruiting suf¬ ficiently to prove out their inherent value for further dissemination.  The carrying out of the whole plan is of course contingent on the interest and support given to the station by the grow¬ ers and those in a position to see that land and facilities are made available as needed..  If real bud selection appeals to you in¬ dividually or as a society as a project that marks an advance in the efficiency of the citrus industry in Florida you have an op¬ portunity to help your own interests by seeing that your Branch Experiment Sta¬ tion is given adequate support.@@       
 Citrus Varieties@@   F. M. O’Byrne @@ State Nursery Inspector,@@ Gainesville@@   At the joint meeting of the American Pomological Society and the Florida State Horticultural Society, held in Ocala Feb¬ ruary 20, 1889, four of the largest citrus exhibitors had on display from thirty to fifty varieties of oranges alone. From this high water mark the pendulum swung in the other direction until 1915, when the number of varieties of round oranges planted commercially was practically re¬ duced to four, the Parson Brown, Homo- sassa, Pineapple and Valencia. But two varieties of kid glove orange were exten¬ sively planted, the Dancy tangerine and the King, while probably ninety per cent of the grapefruit plantings consisted of Marsh seedless and Duncan.  The pendulum is now swinging back again. We have on the market or in pros¬ pect in the near future the following four¬ teen varieties of oranges and one new variety of grapefruit.  THE TEMPLE ORANGE  The tree from which the Temple orange has been propagated stands in the grove of L. A. Hakes at Winter Park. The fruit, foliage and habit of growth all lend color to the theory that it is a cross be¬ tween a kid glove and a round orange. The average size is about 150. The color,   when fully matured, is deep orange red. The rind is thin, smooth and satiny. Its season is from the middle of January to the first of April, though some fruit has been held on the tree till May without det¬ riment, as members attending the Orlando meeting will recall. The parent tree is said to be very prolific and the reproduc¬ tions have been distinguished by their tendency to early bearing. As to its abil¬ ity to withstand extremes of drought and cold, I have no information, though have heard it said that the parent trees went through the 1917 freeze exceptionally well. The American Pomological Society last year awarded the Wilder medal to the Temple orange.  The advantages claimed for the Temple are its splendid color, smooth satiny rind, easy peeling quality and splendid flavor. It will sell the first time, it is claimed, on its appearance and afterward primarily on its flavor. A pretty Temple is as far ahead of the average California orange in appearance as the average California or¬ ange is ahead of the average Florida or¬ ange. Coming in at the end of the tan¬ gerine season, the Temple can be sold either as a tangerine or a round orange.  The oldest reproduction of which I have personal knowledge is at Winter Park on sour orange stock and is nine years old.   144        145   It produces fruit indistinguishable from the parent tree. A reproduction of seven years on rough lemon at Winter Haven is bearing good crops, but as yet the fruit on this tree has not equaled in appearance that produced on the parent.  As I have observed it, this tree’s fruit is quite susceptible to blemishes, such as wind scarring, rust mite and scab. Pos¬ sibly this is peculiar to fruit on young trees. Just at present, you hear consider¬ able criticism about the fruit on young Temples drying out. It must be remem¬ bered that most trees of this varietv are  mf  on rough lemon and that the early crops on rough lemon stock always are rough, coarse and have a tendency to be insipid and to dry out early. It is too soon yet to tell, I believe, whether the Temple will re¬ produce satisfactorily on rough lemon or not. The name “Temple” is copyrighted and trees are sold only under contract, pre¬ venting its propagation for sale by any one other than the introducers or their permitees.  THE GOLDEN RING ORANGE  The four original Golden Ring orange trees were found in a grove at Eloise by Mr. L. P. Kirkland. Its origin is obscure. It gets its name from a characteristic ring about the blossom end.  The fruit which I have seen runs small in size, about 225’s, though it is said that when properly fertilized and cared for the fruit will run larger. The rind is medium in thickness and inclined to be brittle. It is a deep orange red and a little coarse or pebbly. It starts to color in October and is fully ripened and colored by November   10th. Nothing is known as to its hardi¬ ness. A number of trees have been top- worked with this variety on both sour or¬ ange and rough lemon and all are said to have reproduced fruit of the same quality as the four parent trees. I have not seen any of these reproductions. As the parent trees were on rough lemon and on high sandy soil, the chances of its reproducing satisfactorily on rough lemon should be very good.  The advantages claimed for it are its early date of maturity, its deep color and good flavor. It, also, is expected to sell the first time on its appearance and after that largely on its flavor. The name “Golden Ring” is copyrighted and trees are sold only under contract.  THE AVON EVERBEAR  The Avon Everbear orange originated at Avon Park. Its history is unknown. It is a real everbearing orange which ripens the main portion of the crop, I am told, in the summer.  The fruit averages from 150’s to 250’s. Its shape is a little longer than the Valen¬ cia. The rind in thickness, color and texture is about the same as a very smooth Valencia. Its season is the year around, with probably the main crop in summer.  So far as I know, we have no data on its hardiness or its ability to reproduce properly. The parent tree is said to be very productive and had a good crop of fruit of all sizes when I saw it.  The advantage claimed for it is that it will keep money coming in the year around. The main crop of fruit is said to carry well into July without drying out,      146       and another picking, so they say, may be made in October before other Florida fruit starts to move. From the looks of the tree I should judge that other pick¬ ings, besides these two, would have to be made. The name is copyrighted and the trees are to be sold under contract.  ELOPINE  The original Elopine tree is a seedling which stands in a grove at Bartow and is being tested out by a nurseryman at Eagle Lake who plans to copyright the name and sell the trees under contract if it repro¬ duces properly.  The fruit of the parent tree, averages 176 or less to the box and is perfectly round. The rind is medium in thickness and texture. It is said to be a much deep¬ er orange color than the usual Florida or¬ ange. It is a mid-season fruit and the fla¬ vor is said to be splendid. Those ac¬ quainted with the fruit are loud in its praises. Little can be learned of this va¬ riety except that it is being propagated and watched by the nurseryman men¬ tioned.  MOONSHINE  The Moonshine orange originated at Parrish, Florida. It is a late orange, to be marketed from May to July and is said to have a splendid flavor with very few seeds to none at all. It is under investiga¬ tion and reproduction by a large nursery.  long’s everbearing  Long’s Everbearing orange is not new, as it originated at Lake Helen some thirty years ago. The recent interest in ever¬   bearing oranges has again brought this variety to the front. It is a true everbear¬ ing orange which has never won a very large place for itself in the Florida grow¬ ers’ esteem.  There are also several other everbearing oranges being planted locally in various sections, one in Ft. Myers, one at Eden and probably others of which I know nothing.  CLUSTER ORANGE  The Cluster orange originated at Se- bring. It looks as if it might be a cross between an orange and a grapefruit. It is a mid-season fruit and grows in a clus¬ ter. (Specimens may be seen in the fruit exhibit at the Thelma Hotel.) It is being watched and propagated and may be placed on the market some day.  ward’s early  This is an early orange reported to be superior to the Parson Brown in appear¬ ance, early coloring and flavor. I know nothing of it personally and have been unable to secure more information. It originated at Orlando.  A nurseryman at Avon Park has two new varieties which he plans to soon put on the market, I am told.  One is an early orange averaging about 176 in size, which ripens and colors by the first of October. There are peculiar ridges or creases running toward the stem end. The flesh is quite yellow and the flavor good for an early orange. There are not many seeds. The skin is medium in thickness and a little coarse in texture. I       147   do not know the name which will be given this new fruit.  The other variety is a mid-season seed¬ less orange which looks much like a large seedling. It will probably average about 126 to 150 in size and is of very fair quality, though it cannot equal the pine¬ apple in flavor or color or texture.  THANKSGIVING ORANGE  The Thanksgiving orange originated at Mt. Dora from the seed of the “Clemen¬ tine,” a member of the tangerine family which the Federal Government imported from Algeria in Africa.  The fruit averages a little smaller than a tangerine and the rind is not quite as deep a red but is very thin. The tree is said to be a little hardier as regards cold and drought than the round orange. It is said to be prolific and the fruit is reported, by disinterested parties, to be delicious.  The Thanksgiving orange is ripe and perfectly colored by November 1st and will hang on, it is claimed, till February. It is in perfect shape for the Thanksgiving market; hence the name.  It is being propagated at present, but I do not know if the name is to be copy¬ righted. None are as yet on the market.  Another kid glove orange will be ready for the market in a few years. A name has not yet been decided upon. When one is selected it is to be copyrighted and the trees will be sold under contract.  It is a seedling grown from a fruit sent over from China in 1892 to a nurseryman at Interlachen. The fruit would pack about 85 to 90 to the strap. The rind is a deep rich yellow, somewhat thicker than   that of the Dancy tangerine and is puffy like the Oneco tangerine. The meat is quite juicy, with little rag and has a splen¬ did flavor. It is a mid-season fruit which will hang to the first of February. It has not been tested in various sections of the State or on different stocks. Some tests are now being made.  GRAPEFRUIT  A new late grapefruit is now under ob¬ servation and is being propagated with a view to placing it in the market as a new variety, should its performance justify. It was tentatively called the “Dorothy Summer Seedless,” but this name will probably be replaced by a shorter one.  It is a seedling grapefruit which was started in a tub in Indiana and brought to Winter Haven a number of years ago. The fruit is practically seedless and will hang on quite late and is said to be supe¬ rior to the Marsh.  1  CONCLUSION  In years past, L. B. Scott, pomologist for the United States Department of Ag¬ riculture, has presented to the Horticultur¬ al Society the advantages of the smallest possible number of varieties to cover the season, and has shown clearly the handi¬ cap under which Florida, with many va¬ rieties of oranges, labored when compet¬ ing with California, which has but two. As a result, a committee of growers at the 1915 Citrus Seminar recommended that commercial plantings of round oranges be restricted to Parson Brown, Homosassa, Pineapple and Valencia with the under-    148       standing that Lue Gim Gong would be marketed as a late Valencia. How far we have departed from this recommenda¬ tion my review of impending varieties in¬ dicates.  Under what circumstances should a new variety be brought out? Clearly, only when it fills a vacancy in our sequence or is distinctly superior to a fruit already es¬ tablished in our schedule. The citrus fruits produced by Florida growers can be divided roughly into three classes; namely, standard fruits, including round oranges and grapefruit; fancy fruits, in¬ cluding kid glove oranges; and novelties, such as tangeloes, tangeloloes, limequats, etc.  Before a round orange, for example, is brought out it should be shown that it fills a distinct niche either by coming on the market between Valencias and Parson Browns or by being admittedly superior to one of the fruits now in the schedule, replacing it entirely. The same reasoning applies to the introduction of new fancy fruits. The Temple’s place in the sched¬ ule, as I see it, is as a fancy fruit to follow the tangerine, filling the vacancy between the tangerine and the king. It, of course, has the advantage that it can be handled and eaten as a round orange, but its par¬ ticular niche is in the fancy fruit column.  Moreover, a fruit should be recom¬ mended for general planting only when it will make good on all soils and on all stocks. For example, the ruby blood or¬ ange is splendid on sour orange stock in the northern part of the citrus belt, but it is a failure in the sand hill sections on rough lemon. Some oranges are splendid   in certain localities, but prove failures anywhere else, as for example, Drake’s Star, which does splendidly in the vicin¬ ity of Yalaha.  Like the old Dutchman, I believe in only telling stories that have moral teach¬ ings. The moral of my story is this: “We have too many varieties coming on the market now.” We must never, of course, take the position that our varieties are perfect and that no new varieties can be introduced. We must always leave the door ajar so that a really good variety can get in. I propose, therefore, a permanent committee of the Horticultural Societv on “Citrus Varieties,” to be composed of five prominent growers who have no interest in a nursery, one each from northern pen¬ insular Florida, the Indian river section, Dade county, the Ridge section, and Southwest Florida; this committee to in¬ form itself concerning the value of a pro¬ posed new variety by each member watch¬ ing its performance in his particular sec¬ tion. The growers of the State should then do their part toward standardization by planting only such varieties as have been recommended for general planting by this committee.  Sadler: I commenced 35 years ago to get information on the best oranges grown in Florida, and I got information from the American Agriculture report and when I got through I had two groves of 20 acres of this kind and when they came to bear I found the cluster orange was the best bearing. When I came to test them, I might say they were like two drops of vinegar in a quart of water. I was thank-       149 s   ful that I got rid of them. Another thing I might mention is my experience with the blood orange. He said they would not do well on lemon stock. My groves are budded on lemon stock and I find only once in a while that I make a mistake. My groves bear when healthy. Next thing in regard to Mrs. Moorhead, she is working to allow us to sell more fruit. When a witness is called he is pledged to tell nothing but the truth. In this case I want to suggest that you men tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You all know the sentiment expressed years ago. The best way to eat an orange is to drink the juice; it is the nicest and cleanest way and you do not squirt it in your eyes. Let me tell you, this fall I did not want to eat oranges with a spoon so I commenced to drink my glass of or¬ ange juice. I can realize how some men were without their glass of beer for break¬ fast. I have gotten so I don’t want to eat breakfast without my glass of orange juice. I want everybody here and in the State of Florida to say that the only way to eat an orange is to drink the juice. I am telling the whole truth. That is also the best way to eat a grapefruit. You do not get the bitter. You can also eat two, or possibly three, grapefruit instead of a half of a one. In five years we will have many grapefruit and we have got to teach that the only way to eat an orange or grapefruit is to drink the juice.  Skinner: Any further questions ?  King: I notice those who spoke of the citrus root stock mentioned lemon, rough lemon, sour orange and grapefruit and I   wish to ask if they have had any experi¬ ence with the bitter-sweet.  -: It is used to a very limited  extent. It is quite promising.  -: There are some groves on  Merritt’s Island that have bitter-sweet stock.  -: Do they do well on pine  lands ?  -: I don’t think they have been  tried out there.  Skinner: I have a grove at Sutherland in which 500 trees are inarched. Some are inarched with sour stock and others with lemon. The lemon stock is absolute¬ ly no good and sour oranges are all right.  Gill, of Maitland: Can you tell how~ long after the little seedling is planted that you can inarch ?  Skinner: Immediately.  McKay: I wish to state an experience of mine in inarching. I did not find it very successful. In the first place the trees have a very poor foundation to rest on. I could never get them to support the tree, but maybe I did not do it right.  Skinner: I don’t think you should bend it. Of course if you have a bend it will try to sprout a bud every time. The rough lemon has no tap root. Should that statement be allowed to go unchallenged?  Waite: In the last four or five years I have transplanted old trees on low ham¬ mock land and wherever I found one with¬ out a tap root it was rough lemon. The grapefruit had much tap root.  -: I have planted orange trees  ever since I was three knees high, bud-             150       ded all kinds of them and on all kinds of stock and made all sorts of experiments, and I have experimented with the sour orange a great deal. I have found that the sour orange succeeds well on low ham¬ mock but I have found that nothing com¬ pares with the rough lemon on high sandy lands. I can show any man trees budded on rough lemon stock 25 or 30 years old today, that are as fine as any in the State of Florida on the highest hills and they bear good crops that look perfectly healthy and they have never been irrigated. I think the rough lemon is far preferable and will state right here I am making ex¬ periments with a new stock. It originated in South Florida and is very promising because of its hardiness and its growth. It stays dormant all winter. I am banking on it as much as any I have made and I have made eight or ten and they have all been a faliure.  Skinner: I have a grove of ten acres on lemon root from which I have taken off in one season 16,000 boxes. I think it is wonderful if the sour orange can match it.  Bouis: I have been most deeply inter¬ ested in a search for a root stock that would meet the ideals of these stocks. In consultation with a number of very well informed and expressed gentlemen, I have had my attention drawn to the Cleopatria stock. I would like to ask Mr. Evans, who referred to it in his remarks, if he can give more detailed information and what experience he has had with that root stock. I would like to get some information.  O’Byrne: Very little so far is known of the Cleopatria as a root stock and I be¬   lieve as in the case of varieties that the matter of root stock should be thoroughly tested in all sections of the State before any general recommendations are made. However, we have present Mr. E. N. Rea- soner, who can probably tell us something about that.  Mr. Reasoner: Bouis and I have gone over that matter and we found that the Cleopatria stocks which I had budded a good many years ago with Oneco, Man¬ darin, Homosassa orange and grapefruit, and located on high very well drained land, were the best trees in this ten-acre grove. The Cleopatria turned out to be the best stock and it is the finest I know. Some of the people have some of our stock on Cleopatria and don’t know it. I would like to know of any one that has any trees on Cleopatria stock and how they are doing. They are very resistant stock to cold and drought. Cleopatria growing under the same conditions as rough lemon and sour orange is better in these days of drought. They bear more fruit, the quality is finest in the world, ab¬ solutely the best. They hold juice to the end of the season. I don’t know whether you know it or not, but I think my brother was the first man to use rough lemon stock in Florida. I think after the rough lemon has been used that we ought to see whether there is any better. I just want to see what is to be done about it.  Bouis: I am interested in both rough lemon and sour orange for stock. They are both good in their places. I would not have either one in the other’s place. I find, however, that there are limitations in both of these root stocks. Mr. Reason-       151   er is the first man to have such a stock. I want right here to pay tribute to the un¬ commercial spirit which he has shown in these matters. He seems to disregard all thought of business when he can discuss anything of general benefit to the inter¬ est of the grower. The fruit that was grown on the Cleopatria stock was in bet¬ ter condition, more full of juice and finer than that grown on sour stock. The trees were about the same size. No nursery has been using that as a root stock. In the County Fair at St. Augustine I found a half box of Cleopatria without the ex¬ hibitor’s name and no one knew about it   or where it came from. I tried to pur¬ chase the box and I found the man incor¬ ruptible. I hung around there for three days and tried to get that box and failed. On the last day he weakened. Some one had purchased the entire exhibit and this gentleman did not appear and finally I paid for this box. I have planted my Cleopatria in three counties, DeSoto, Polk and Lake, but it will be a year or two or three before that stock can ever be budded and I am particularly desirous and I think it is a matter of general interest if we could find what that has been used for and identify it.@@     
 The Citrus Experiment Station at Lake Alfred@@   Wilmon Newell,@@ Director, Florida Agricultural Experiment Station,@@  Gainesville@@   Inasmuch as a brief history of the in¬ ception and establishment of the Branch Experiment Station for Citrus Investiga¬ tions was presented before this society at its meeting at Miami last year, it would seem that a report at this time should be little more than a report of progress—or lack of it—as the case may be. Perhaps the fact that this meeting is being held in the county where the station is located and that you will all have the opportunity to visit and inspect the station tomorrow, gives the subject more interest than would otherwise be the case.  Before we proceed with a report on the station for the past twelve months, I would beg your indulgence while we re¬ view very briefly its history. Establish¬ ment of the Citrus Station was authorized by Act of the 1917 session of the Legis¬ lature and was conditioned upon interests in Polk county donating lands, money, etc., to the value of not less than $10,- 000.00. Subscriptions aggregating this amount were secured by the summer of 1919, by a committee consisting of Messrs. S. F. Poole, J. A. Snively, J. H. Ross, H. W. Snell, L. L. Davis, A. M. Tilden, C H. Thompson and W. L. Drew. In July, 1919, the site for the station was decided upon by the Board of Control.   The 84 acres of land occupied by the station was donated by the Florida Fruit- lands Company, and the Board of Control refunded to the Fruitlands Company the actual cost of 14^2 acres of citrus then on the property.  At the Miami meeting we reported that the total donations had amounted to $13,- 782.15. They have not been added to since that time.  As the donated fund constituted the sole resources of the station, all mainte¬ nance and operating expenses to June 30, 1921, had to be defrayed from this source. As a matter of record, we would like to report here how the total sum of $13,- 782.15 was expended:  Reimbursement of Fla. Fruit- lands Co., for cost of 14%  acres of citrus on property_$5,900.00  Care and supervision of proper¬   ty, to June 30, 1921-4,183.81  Superintendent’s cottage*-3,153.00  Tool and fertilizer shed- 351.74  Fencing _ 79.25  Nursery stock and seeds_ 17.09  Water supply*_ 15.50   ^Balance of cost defrayed out of appropria¬ tion for main Station at Gainesville, for year beginning July 1, 1921.   152           I       Traveling expenses_ 61.55  Miscellaneous _ 18.00  Postage _ 2.21   Total _$13,782.15   During the past year a house has been constructed for the superintendent at a total cost of $3,739.23, and a well has been drilled, a water tank erected and a small pumping outfit installed, at a cost of $761.81. The cleared land has been improved in condition and 773 additional trees planted out in connection with the experiments hereinafter mentioned.  A substantial quarantine cage 30x48 feet, 10 feet high, has been constructed on the property by the State Plant Board. In this cage will be planted citrus trees which it is found advisable to bring in from outside the State and here they will be grown for at least one year while being kept under observation to determine their freedom from diseases and insects.  No specific appropriation for the sup¬ port of the Citrus Station was made by the last Legislature, but the appropriation bill specified that the Citrus Experiment Station should be taken care of out of the appropriation made for the main station at Gainesville. Out of the latter appropria¬ tion the Board of Control set aside $5,- 690.00 for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1921, and this constitutes the total re¬ sources of the Citrus Station at present, with the exception of $364.65 (gross) re¬ ceived this year from the sale of fruit.  EXPERIMENTS  We are doing as much experimental work at the Citrus Station as the amount   153  of cleared land and the available funds will permit.  Dr. R. W. Ruprecht, physiological chemist of the Gainesville Station, is car¬ rying on a study of the physiological causes of dieback, using the young 10-acre grove for his field experiments. In the bearing grove he is also carrying on fer¬ tilizer experiments to determine the rela¬ tive effects of high and low percentages of potash; also a comparison between am¬ monia derived from nitrate of lime and ammonia derived from nitrate of soda. Other fertilizer experiments, involving the use of phosphoric acid, are being carried on in commercial groves near at hand.  A modest experiment in comparing rough lemon, sour orange and grapefruit stocks has also been started. In this ex¬ periment nine varieties of grapefruit and three varieties of orange, each on rough lemon, sour orange and grapefruit stocks, have been planted. The effect of the stock on these varieties, under these particular soil conditions, will be noted and the varie¬ ties in this planting will also be useful as a source of material for instructional and experimental purposes. This experiment is not as comprehensive as it should be and we should perhaps explain that it would probably not have been started at all were it not for the fact that we had most of these trees at Gainesville, where they had been used in scab-control experiments un¬ der nursery conditions, and we did not wish to waste them.  PROGENY ORCHARD  What is considered by far the most im¬ portant line of experimental work under-            154       taken is that of making bud selection studies and establishing a bud supply or¬ chard of the best strains of standard Flor¬ ida varieties.  A co-operative agreement was entered into on October 26, 1921, between the Bu¬ reau of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, and the Experiment Sta¬ tion, whereby the bureau is to furnish stocks and buds from selected bearing trees in Florida and supervise the work of propagation, record-keeping, etc., while the Experiment Station is to furnish the land, fertilizer and cultivation. Five hun¬ dred rough lemon stocks have been plant¬ ed in grove formation and these will be budded shortly with buds from the best typed and producing trees of Parson Brown, Homosassa, Pineapple, Valencia and Lue Gim Gong varieties. In fact, Mr. T. Ralph Robinson of the bureau has spent a large part of his time during the past crop season in locating the best trees of these varieties in Florida and in secur¬ ing the budwood from them. We will, therefore, have under observation approx¬ imately fifty progenies of ten trees each: that is, ten trees propagated from each of fifty of the best trees that can be found in the State. In addition to securing data on the behavior of these trees we hope to make this the beginning of what will eventually be a progeny bud-supply or¬ chard, an orchard from which we can sup¬ ply to growers for top-working and to nurserymen for commercial propagation   budwood of the best strains of the stand¬ ard varieties.  Probably no line of experimental work is so promising of financial returns to the citrus industry of Florida. Increased acre-production, a better and more uni¬ form type of fruit of each standard va¬ riety and a general standardization of the Florida citrus product are all benefits which may be expected to follow the steady prosecution of this work upon a sufficiently ample scale.  Our co-operative agreement with the Bureau of Plant Industry also calls for the establishment of a demonstration orchard of different strains selected from commer¬ cial citrus—to show the results obtained by proper bud selection—and plantings devoted to the testing of new citrus va¬ rieties and hybrids, as well as a collection of wild citrus plants and relatives of cit¬ rus as material for study and experimen¬ tation. However, these plantings cannot be made until we clear more land and this we cannot do until we secure an appropri¬ ation for this station.  The citrus industry of Florida has been builded, for the most part, upon the trials, mistakes and losses of individual growers. The fact that it has succeeded is but am¬ ple evidence that with the benefit and guidance of scientific data upon its most essential problems it will become a far greater and far more profitable industry than it is today.@@   
 Citrus Fruits in the Home@@   Caroline Moorhead,@@ Florida Citrus Exchange,@@ Tampa@@   Since the subject before us is so broad, covering years of research and experi¬ mental work on the part of many scien¬ tists, I shall only attempt to add a few thoughts as reminders of the many prac¬ tical uses of citrus fruits as food, bever¬ ages and confections, as well as their al¬ ready acknowledged value in medical science.  In the capacity of my services, it has been my privilege to carry the story of Florida fruit into the domestic science de¬ partments of many of our best schools, colleges, women’s clubs and various or¬ ganizations, and in some of the most noted cooking schools of the New Eng¬ land and Northern states.  It has been most gratifying in each in¬ stance to note the interest and enthusiasm shown in regard to a further knowledge of the uses of Florida fruit.  The housewife of today, if she be a suc¬ cessful manager in the art of home-mak¬ ing, must not only be a student in domestic science and its relation to the family diet, but she must be a practitioner, as well.  The real home-maker, especially if she be a mother, realizes that she not only cre¬ ates the home, but through her efforts in selection, preparation and careful plan¬ ning of well-balanced meals of nutritive   value, she is directing the body-building for better citizenship.  A wise mother will place at the very top of her order sheet those fruits and vegetables which are so important in the daily diet. She will also train her children from early infancy to acquire a taste for citrus fruits, because of their health-giv¬ ing qualities.  Dr. Roger H. Dennet, of New York, says bottle babies who have not received orange juice cannot compare very favor¬ ably in color, volume of flesh, body devel¬ opment, strength, and often in avoirdu¬ pois, with those babies who have received orange juice at six weeks or two months of age.  Strained orange juice is especially val¬ uable to the child under one year of age, whose diet consists of pasteurized milk, says Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, of Washing¬ ton, D. C.  The following figures from the Bureau of Vital Statistics, State Board of Health, under head of Infant Mortality Due to Disease Caused by Error in Feeding in United States, is as follows:  In 1911 death rate of infants up to five years of age, was 77.5 per thousand; in 1919, death rate was reduced to 44.2, showing gradual but decided decrease due   155        156       to educational advancement both in medi¬ cal and domestic science.  From a popular Florida booklet we read, “The high food and energy value of citrus fruits has been conclusively demon¬ strated by investigation of the United States Department of Agriculture, in bul¬ letins No. 28, office of Experiment Sta¬ tion, The Chemical Composition of Amer¬ ican Food Materials, and Farmers’ Bul¬ letin No. 142, The Principles of Nutrition and Nutritive Value of Food.” The re¬ sult of these investigations are given in detail, “It is clear from the findings which are summarized in these bulletins, that or¬ anges have a higher food value than beef juice, buttermilk, oatmeal gruel, or oys¬ ters, and that citrus fruits far exceed in units of food and energy value to the pound a number of commonly used vege¬ tables.”  At the time this little treatise appeared, that king of Florida fruits, the grapefruit, had not been so thoroughly studied, hence it was not included in the above chart.  Being a strong advocate of the grape¬ fruit, with firm faith in its wonderful pos¬ sibilities, I have left no stone unturned in my efforts to secure proof of its worthi¬ ness.  The food and energy value of grapefruit is considered to be 5 per cent. It averages 45 calories for every hundred gram  weight. Half of a small grapefruit would  /  give 35 calories. A medium size grape¬ fruit (one-half) would give 75 calories. These figures are taken from Lock and from Dr. White, of Boston, Mass., and are considered trustworthy.  When we consider that the average   weight of a small grapefruit is 15J 4 ounces and a medium size grapefruit av¬ erages 22 .y 2 ounces, making a difference of 7 odd units of food and energy value, there is a reason for preferring the larger grapefruit.  Since the system of arranging diet is based on such products as contain the proper units of energy and food value, known as calories, the above information is of special interest.  Recent experience has proven beyond the slightest doubt the anxiety on the part of the consumer for greater information in regard to citrus fruits and their vari¬ ous uses.  For an example of interest shown, one simple formula of Florida punch, created at the South Florida Fair during time of a citrus display, has been copied from black¬ boards in more than a hundred schools and colleges, being taken down in note books of at least twenty-five thousand girls and women.  This formula is composed of grapefruit and orange juice, no sugar or water. The grapefruit juice serving as base and thirst-quenching qualities, while the or¬ ange furnishes the sugar.  A prominent woman of the state of Maine, who spends her winters in Florida, expressed regret that she had not known while in Florida some of the very simple things worth knowing in regard to grape¬ fruit.  One highly important fact to remember in connection with grapefruit is that the use of salt brings out the refreshing sweet¬ ness of the fruit, while the sugar has a tendency to bring out the bitter flavor.       157   Sugar is, of course, by no means, objec¬ tionable, and those who prefer the bitter taste of grapefruit should use it, but those who have not tried it with salt have a treat in store.  A thought worth while to the home¬ maker is that with the peel of oranges and grapefruit a variety of decorative con¬ tainers may be made, which add to the at¬ tractiveness of the table.  True, the decorative touch does not come under the head of necessities, from the standpoint of food value, nor is it measured by units of calories or included in the much discussed list of vitamines, but the art of table decoration goes hand in hand with thoughtfully planned meals, having a value all of its own.  Best results are obtained when meals are prepared with consideration for the mental as well as the physical taste.  It is the birthright of womanhood that she be encouraged in the artistic side of home-making.  Just wherein citrus fruits may be con¬ sidered of material interest in the home is not only borne out in some of the former medical uses of these fruit juices for in¬ fants and children, but has been thorough¬ ly demonstrated as a health-giving food and beverage for adults as well.  An interesting feature in regard to the adult is the fact that men and women who have been advised against the use of grapefruit because of its acids not seem¬ ing to agree with them, have in many cases found that with the use of salt in place of sugar, they now enjoy their grapefruit and have no bad effects.  Statistics obtained from a recent Cali¬   fornia booklet tell us that of 107 physi¬ cians who were asked what fruit they would recommend for children, ninety- three of that number answered, oranges.  Oranges and grapefruit are easily di¬ gested, their salts and acids forming a natural mild laxative, also preventing chil¬ dren’s disorders due to sterile or deficient food, and being a necessary element to growth.  Recognizing the fact that America’s youth is the nation’s greatest wealth, is it not well that we pay more attention to its proper nourishment ? And on whom does the mantle of responsibility fall more heavily in this great work than on mother¬ hood.  Until recent years the matter of correct diet was a subject little thought of, or left for the physicians and nurses to discuss. Now, through the various channels of do¬ mestic science, it is a study within the reach of all who wish to avail themselves of the opportunity, and rightfully belongs in every home.  The various uses and preparations of Florida citrus fruits are recognized as a valuable unit in domestic science prob¬ lems wherever introduced.  A broader knowledge and more general use of citrus fruits would mean more uni¬ versal health, and health as the crowning jewel of life demands it.  Aside from the health-giving qualities, which add to their value of course, there are other ways in which to use citrus fruits. An unlimited array of dishes may be prepared of them.  The Ohio State Journal of Columbus, Ohio, on making an interesting compari-        158       son, states, “that two Florida oranges will fill an ordinary tumbler full of juice, while it takes from four to seven oranges of another state to accomplish the same feat.”  An item worthy of keeping uppermost in our minds is that Florida’s greatest as¬ set, aside from climate, is its citrus indus¬ try.  The various citrus by-products are pro¬ ducers of wealth, if properly handled. Its jellies and marmalades of the higher grade, are comparatively unknown in many states.  Candy made of our citrus fruits is con¬ sidered of the very best wherever known.  The tons of citrus fruits allowed to waste annually would mean a wonderful source of revenue to the State of Florida, if cared for.  In many of our stores, especially those • of the rural district of Florida, is the very popular cold drink department, where men, women and children deposit dimes that count into many thousands of dollars during a season.   And what do they get in return ? Very seldom a thirst-quenching beverage, but something quite sweet and highly colored, the best feature being possibly its coolness. Now the makers of these various concoc¬ tions are not to be blamed, for cool drinks are demanded by the general public, and someone must supply that demand. But why not agitate the establishing of a cit¬ rus juice extractor along with the drink department, and give to the public nature’s best and most refreshing beverage, which not only is refreshing but contains thera¬ peutic value.  Crystallized citrus fruits cannot be sur¬ passed for fruit cake; it is much less ex¬ pensive and far better flavor than the cit¬ ron that is shipped into our State, and very much sought for.  Every man and woman who plants a tree or shrub for the beautification and value of our State is a Florida booster, and those who add to the citrus groves are stockholders in Florida’s acres of gold.@@   
 Fruit and Vegetable Conservation in the Home@@   Estelle Bozeman,@@ Tallahassee@@   Work with women in conservation of fruits and vegetables in the home is di¬ vided into three parts, namely: the prob¬ lems, method and goal. Since in this meeting interest is primarily in the goal, it is necessary here to but briefly state the problems. They are:  1. Conservation to prevent waste.  2. Conservation to adequately supply the home table with Florida foods at a minimum cost. In considering this sec¬ ond problem the needs of the family are determined and the food value of the con¬ served fruits and vegetables taught. Each family of five is urged to conserve at least one quart of fruit and one quart of vegetables for each day. Proportional re¬ duction based on the amount of fresh fruit and vegetables provided is advised.  3. Conservation through the manufac¬ ture of new products from Florida fruits and vegetables.  4. The increase of the income of wom¬ en and girls by making a standard product. The methods used for conservation of the fruits and vegetables are canning, brin¬ ing, drying, pickling and crystallization.  Where individuals are interested in de¬ veloping a commercial proposition, they are taught to standardize their products. To encourage the development of this pro¬ ject, women and girls were asked to send to the State and South Florida Fairs two   samples of each of the products which they wished to put on the market. There were fiftv-nine entries made, which show- ed fourteen varieties of products. These products were judged by buyers for ho¬ tels and delicatessen shops. Thirty-three products shown were given A No. 1 score. The criticisms of the products that did not come to standard were forwarded by us to the producer. To aid them in perfecting their products, individual help is being given these women. As a result of the exhibit made at the South Florida Fair products were shipped into fifteen states. A letter followed each shipment asking for comments. The following re¬ plies are typical:  “Fargo, N. D., Feb. 24, 1922. “Dear Madam :  “The guava jelly reached us in fine shape, and we think it unsurpassed in tex¬ ture and quality. We shall want more when this is gone.  “Yours respectfully,  “Mrs. C. B. Waldron.”  “Baltimore, Md., Feb. 25, 1922. “Dear Madam:  “I am in receipt of your letter of Feb¬ ruary 21st in reference to an order of the whole crystallized grapefruit peel filled with French fondant. The same was re¬ ceived on February 16th in perfect condi¬ tion. It was the daintiest and most attrac-   159           160       tive piece of confection I have ever seen and was also delicious to the taste. There will be no doubt of your customers being pleased with your new project.  “Thank you so much for the suggestion as to cuttitng. I had been taking out the fondant with a spoon but enough was left to see the great difference between that and cutting. In the language of the pres¬ ent day, T am crazy about it.’  “You are engaged in a very interesting line of work in which I wish you every possible success.  “Yours truly,  “Maude Turner.”  A number of duplicate orders have been received. This is the best possible proof of the satisfaction given.  Fourteen women have enrolled as mem¬ bers of our Home Industry Project. Markets are located for the products and the producer then deals directly with the consumer. Thus far difficulty has not been in locating the market, but in supply¬ ing the demand. One of the leading ho¬ tels of the State has placed a standing or¬ der with us for products. The manager offers top prices for all products. He says they are superior to any other products he is able to get.  One young woman in a remote section is producing products that wherever shown are calling forth favorable com¬ ments, and bringing to her orders for her output. With more experience and a little financial backing she should in time be able to rival with her products the famous Pin Money Pickles. One of the women has already outgrown the family kitchen and has moved into a small building with   modern equipment such as steam-jacketed kettles, thermometers, hydrometers, etc. She has recently been offered the manage- mnt of a factory. Another woman has temporarily converted her basement into a special products kitchen. Several work¬ ing women are making products during their spare time, the sale of which supple¬ ments their other earnings. A small ex¬ hibit of these products is on display in the lobby of the Thelma Hotel. They show the quality, containers and labels.  Some work has been done in a number of counties in the making of muscadine products. The demand for the fresh fruit is so great that there is but small chance to develop this project as yet. The commercial possibilities in this fruit will be fully discussed by Chas. Dearing, Bu¬ reau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C.  Another Florida product that may be used in developing a home industry is the manufacture of confections in which the pecan is used. This report covers briefly the work that is being done in the field.  Investigational work is being carried on in the research laboratory of the Flor¬ ida State College for Women, which it is hoped will solve some of the present prob¬ lems that we meet or suggest other uses for the Florida fruits and nuts. Experi¬ mental work is being carried on in the canning of grapefruit heart. Researches in the nutritive value of avocadoes and of pecans are being made.  Though a small beginning, our goal is to have standardized products with the Florida labels in all homes, on dining cars, in delicatessen and gift shops in this State.@@   
 The Present Status of Fruit  Manufacture   Products@@   Seth S. Walker,@@ Exchange Supply Co.,@@ Tampa@@   Practically every visitor coming into Florida for the first time is astonished and horrified at the vast amount of fruit going to waste—fruit that drops from the trees and rots; fruit that is culled out at the packing houses and hauled to the dump because for one reason or another it is not considered suitable to ship. It is perfectly obvious that this fruit represents a dead loss and that some means of con¬ verting it into an asset is extremely de¬ sirable. It may not be so obvious, but is equally true, that a large portion of the fruit now shipped should in reality never be put upon the market as fresh fruit if there were some other way to dispose of it. This third and fourth grade fruit is often of the best flavor but because of poor keeping qualities, off-size, or poor outward appearance it meets with small success on the market and continually op¬ erates to lower the prices for the better grades. Moreover, it would seem that new citrus plantings are coming into bear¬ ing at a faster rate than the market can be expanded to take care of this increased production.  Evidently there is a very real need for a fruit products industry—an industry that will convert the non-shipable fruit   into marketable products, valuable for their own sake and doubly valuable be¬ cause of the increased price obtained for high-grade fruits.  I have taken the trouble to do a little figuring on the amount of grapefruit and oranges available for manufacturing pur¬ poses, basing my figures on conservative estimates made by men who are in a po¬ sition to know what they are talking about. The results are illuminating.  There have already been shipped from the State this season over eleven million boxes of fruit and the total for the entire season will approximate twelve millions of boxes. Fully ten per cent—often more— of the fruit actually raised never reaches the market but goes to the dump pile. In other words, at the end of the present sea¬ son, something like one and one-third mil¬ lion boxes will have gone to waste.  On the other hand it is estimated that twenty-five per cent of the fruit shipped will be classed as third and fourth grades —fruit that in seasons of normal prices gluts the markets, often failing to pay transportation charges and always oper¬ ating to demoralize the market for high grade fruit. Twenty-five per cent of this season’s shipments will amount to three             I   162  million boxes of fruit which really ought to be kept at home. Adding to this the one and one-third millions of the dump pile we have available for fruit product manufacture four and one-third million boxes, or 172,000 tons of fruit.  The question naturally arises: To what extent is this available fruit being utilized for the manufacture of products? I have undertaken to collect data on this subject by sending out a questionnaire to all of those, who, so far as I knew, were supposed to be operating on a commercial scale. The information thus obtained was very fragmentary and unsatisfactory, but I will attempt to summarize it for you.  Twenty questionnaires were sent out and only ten replies received. Of these ten, two reported that they were still in the experimental stage and not yet producing anything.  One firm reports that it is finding a larger demand than it can supply for bot¬ tled orange juice, natural concentration. Two other concerns signify their intention of bottling orange juice in the near future.  One company is producing concentrated orange, grapefruit and lime juices for the first time this season. They report a ready sale for their product and estimate that they will use about fifteen carloads of fruit this season. One other company is planning to produce concentrated juice.  Grapefruit juice is being produced by two different concerns, using a total of about twenty carloads of fruit. Another company expects to enter this field.  One company reports the manufacture this season of 10,000 cases of canned grapefruit, utilizing 20,000 field boxes,   or about 70 carloads of fruit. At least one other company expects to begin can¬ ning next season.  One firm reports a production of 30,- 000 pounds of orange and grapefruit jam.  Two companies report crystallized grapefruit peel produced to the amount of 5,200 pounds. I am sure that there is a large amount of this commodity produced by various small scale workers, which is not covered by this report.  Orange marmalade and grapefruit marmalade are manufactured by one fac¬ tory at the rate of one carload per week, requiring 150 boxes of fruit. One other correspondent reported production of marmalades but failed to state quantities. Doubtless there are others.  One concern expects to manufacture orange oil and citric acid at some future date.  As already stated, the above report is by no means complete since some of those known to be engaged in fruit product work failed to report, and doubtless some were overlooked in sending out the ques¬ tionnaire. However, it does show plainly that we have scarcely scratched the sur¬ face yet. We estimated that 172,000 tons of fruit were available this season for manufacture into products and our survey of the situation shows that considerably less than 2,000 tons are actually being used for this purpose.  Of course we all understand the reasons for this situation—the difficulties both in manufacturing and marketing which are encountered by those who enter this field. I would not wish to give the impression that, because there are 172,000 tons avail-       163   able, we are criminally negligent in not using them. In fact it is far better that this fruit be not used at all than that it be made into products which are inferior and unmarketable. Such products bring nothing but loss and disappointment to their maker, disgust to the consumer and general discredit and injury to the entire fruit products industry. Quality must precede quantity, and I have assembled the quantity figures given in this paper merely to show what a large opportunity awaits the manufacturer of quality prod¬ ucts.  In this connection I cannot do better than to read one of the letters received from a well known and successful manu¬ facturer in reply to my questionnaire. He says:  “Replying to your letters of April 12th and 15th, will say that I shall be glad to co-operate with you in any way that will tend to improve the status of fruit prod¬ ucts manufacture in Florida. However, if you will pardon me for differing with you, I do not think your questionnaire is along the right lines. Your questions re¬ late entirely to quantity, and quantity of the quality that is made at present is al¬ ready excessive. What the State should interest itself in is quality, and the quan¬ tity would take care of itself. What Florida should do, is to restrain in some manner the low-grade stuff that is shipped out of the State. On a recent trip that I made to Tampa, Tarpon Springs, Clear¬ water, etc., there were three busted con¬ cerns represented on the shelves of the majority of stores that I visited. These concerns busted not for lack of quantity,   but for lack of quality. The merchants of this State are very kindly disposed to¬ wards those making efforts in this line. They buy once, but they do not ever have to buy any more. This is the present status of the fruit products manufacture in Florida in a nutshell.”  My paper would not be complete with¬ out venturing a few remarks and guesses regarding future development.  Practically all of those answering my questionnaire displayed a most cheerful at¬ titude toward the future. They are mak¬ ing plans to increase their output of the products already established and many expect to introduce new products. Of these new products the most interesting and outstanding one is canned grapefruit. Never in the history of Florida fruit products has anything aroused such a widespread interest and promised so much as a real quantity outlet for our off-grade fruit. For the benefit of those not al¬ ready acquainted with this product, I will say that the grapefruit is peeled, the seeds and bitter membranes removed, and the “meats” thus obtained are packed in tin cans, like peaches, tomatoes and other such products.  Two plants have been producing canned grapefruit in Porto Rico for about two years with marked success. One factory has been operated in Florida during the present season. Many experiments are being carried on by different workers at the present time and it seems safe to pre¬ dict that canned grapefruit will soon be a staple article of commerce along with the sliced pineapple and many other delicious things that come in tin cans.       164       But in discussing this subject I cannot refrain from repeating what was said above about quality vs. quantity. Canned grapefruit offers dazzling allurements, but it will be an easy matter to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. It is greatly to be feared that many, in their haste to get in on the ground floor of this new oppor¬ tunity, will throw caution to the winds and flood the market with an inferior product, greatly retarding the growth of the new industry. It is not the least bit   safe to make assumptions or draw hasty conclusions regarding any of these citrus fruit products and no one is justified in entering this field without first making careful experiments and tests, including ageing tests, so that he knows what he is doing.  In conclusion, I would give it as my humble opinion that the Florida fruit prod¬ ucts industry is today on a better footing, with more hope for the future, than at any time in the past.@@   
 Standardization of Nursery Inspection@@   F. M. O’Byrne,@@ Gainesville@@   In 1915, Florida inaugurated a new idea in nursery inspection methods. It was based on the fact that no inspector in the world can tell infallibly whether or not a plant is absolutely free from pests. Florida’s new departure consisted in re¬ quiring the nurserymen to file with the nursery inspector a complete record of their shipments so that the State would have this record instantly at hand should an outbreak of some serious pest occur in some nursery. Recognizing the great ad¬ vantage of this system, Mississippi and South Carolina adopted the Florida sys¬ tem in toto.  It soon became apparent that there was need of standardization of nursery in¬ spection methods among the various states. Heretofore each state has had its own set of requirements, differing in many unimportant details. This has re¬ sulted in the utmost confusion. It re¬ quires a whole book of tiresome, tedious instructions to make these requirements clear to transportation agents and nur¬ serymen. So many and confusing have been the rules that nurserymen have not complied and transportation officials have been unable to co-operate properly. Neither could figure out what the require¬ ments in another state were.  Obviously if we are to receive the full benefit of nursery inspection in the vari¬ ous states, we must standardize our re¬   quirements so far as possible so that the transportation agents can co-operate. Florida, therefore, broached the matter at a meeting of southern horticultural in¬ spectors and the plan was well received, the speaker being appointed chairman of a committee to suggest ways and means. This committee reported at Atlanta last February. Besides the chief inspectors of most Southern States, there were in at¬ tendance a number of prominent Southern nurserymen and the president of the Georgia peach growers organization. Great progress was made and the Florida plan was accepted by all in principle, but certain details could not possibly be agreed upon at that time.  It was therefore proposed that we ad¬ journ, to meet again in some central loca¬ tion the last of May or the first of June, with the understanding that the four great parties at interest, the inspectors, the growers, the nurserymen and the trans¬ portation authorities, all be represented at this meeting.  We would ask, if it be the will of the society, that a motion be passed endorsing the movement for standardization, ap¬ proving the Florida system of nursery in¬ spection, and authorizing the president to attend the forthcoming meeting, as the representative of this, the largest and best growers’ organization in the South.@@           
 Correlation Between Sun Spots and  Florida Freezes@@   J. R. Watson,@@ Gainesville@@   A year or so ago the writer ran across the chart of sun spot maxima which we have before us. This is copied from Els- worth Huntington’s famous book on “Cli¬ mate and Civilization.” The correlation between certain dates on this map and cer¬ tain Florida freezes at once caught the reader’s eye. The result was that we looked up the records of Florida freezes, chiefly in the address of Geo. R. Fair¬ banks at the meeting of this society in Jacksonville in 1895, an d reported in Bulletin No. 34 of the Florida Agricultur¬ al Experiment Station for the early freezes, and have plotted these freezes on this chart.  In talking over this subject with Mr. W. W. Yothers this spring the reader dis¬ covered that Mr. Yothers had worked and read along these same lines. The result is this paper, which owes much of its data to suggestions from Mr. Yothers.  It has long been recognized that sun spots, which are disturbances in the sun’s atmosphere, similar in many respects to the areas of low pressure of cyclones in our own atmosphere, have an effect on the climate of the earth in that they increase the storminess of the surface; that is,   they increase the frequency and intensity of our cyclonic storms and as we well know, it is the areas of high pressure fol¬ lowing these cyclonic storms which cause our Florida freezes. An area of low pres¬ sure traveling across the country from west to east usually brings rain and is fol¬ lowed by an area of high pressure and cold weather which, during winter time, usually enters North America from Brit¬ ish Columbia or Washington, dips down to the southeast and then frequently turns to the northeast and passes off into the At¬ lantic, bringing with it cold weather and, if sufficiently intense, a freeze.  It has also long been recognized that sun spot maxima increase the unevenness of the distribution of the heat of the earth’s surface. For instance, it is a well known fact that the west coast of any con¬ tinent is warmer than the corresponding east coast in the same latitude by many degrees. We can compare, for instance, California with the Carolinas. During sun spot maxima this difference in temper¬ ature between the two coasts is increased. This explains why it very seldom hap¬ pens that we have a freeze the same year that California has one. The same cause which makes California particularly liable        167   to freeze makes Florida less liable and vice versa.  Let us emphasize the fact pointed out by Prof. Brooks that winters with the maximum number of sun spots are not only somewhat colder in average temper¬ atures but are frequently winters with un¬ even temperature, with great extremes of heat and cold, warm periods alternating with cold periods. It is this kind of a winter of course, that does the damage, not so much the degree of cold as the al¬ ternating of cold periods with warm periods. Temperatures during such win¬ ters are more variable. We might call them variable winters.  Sun spots have a tendency to occur in cycles from 9 to 13 years with an average of 11 years. Furthermore, there is a greater cycle from 80 to 100 years. There are many periods of sun spot areas which have not brought freezes in Florida. Some of the very highest sun spot max¬ ima have not brought freezes. On the other hand, with one or two exceptions, all the freezes we have had have occurred during such periods of maximum sun spots, and with only one or two excep¬ tions the period of low sun spot activity have been periods without severe freezes in Florida. There is apparently a strong correlation between freezes and sun spot maxima. It would seem that the correla¬ tion is altogether too close to be due to accident. There must be a relation of cause and effect between the two, or per¬ haps both freezes and sun spots are due to the same common cause.  It is not our purpose to predict freezes for Florida but rather to indicate the   periods of danger which are recurring on an average of about every n years, or perhaps to put it better, to call attention to the fact that there are periods of six or seven years’ duration occurring every 11 years on an average which would seem to be pretty safe. Although this would seem more or less speculative, it would seem that the correlation is close enough to be of some value to Florida growers, as fore-warned should be fore¬ armed, to some extent, particularly as sun spots can be observed throughout the year and it would be possible to give warning as to these dangerous periods. For in¬ stance, the Weather Bureau has pointed out that the unusual weather which dom¬ inated the winter of 1917 began early in August; that is to say, the winter type of cyclones and anti-cyclones began to enter the country from the northwest as early as the first week in August, which is months earlier than usual.  Perhaps the only conclusion we are justified in drawing from this is that there are certain periods which can rough¬ ly be predicted during which one may feel reasonably safe from freezes in Florida. We are now in such a period, and there are periods during which the reverse is true, and the grower should perhaps take particular pains to apply the usual precau¬ tions against cold weather during these periods. The next period of maximum sun spot activity would be expected to cul¬ minate about 1929, 11 years after 1918, the last maximum.  Brooks has shown that during these periods of maximum sun spots that the Gulf Stream is warmer than usual but        168       the Gulf of Mexico is colder. This has a tendency to draw the areas of high pres¬ sure farther south, so we may say that during areas of high maximum sun spots there are three forces working for cold snaps in Florida. (i) The average tem¬ perature in winter is actually lower than normal. (2) The variability of range in temperature between the highs and lows is greater than in normal years. (3) There is a tendency to draw these cold areas farther south than during normal periods. We are well aware that the cor¬ relation here is not close enough to war¬ rant any hard and fast prediction. It would seem, however, it is close enough to indicate what might be called strong possibilities. Leastwise, it was thought that the matter was of such importance to the citrus industry of Florida that the facts as they appear should be brought to the attention of this body of growers.  The earliest freeze recorded (1766) oc¬ curred during a period of low.sun spot   activity. A temperature of 20 degrees was reported near Jacksonville, but this was, of course, not an official record. We are told that citrus trees at St. Augustine were in fruit two years later, so it could not have been a very severe freeze.  Of the six most severe freezes recorded for Florida (a temperature of 18 or low¬ er) all occurred during periods of high sun spot activity. If we call 20 degrees or lower a severe freeze there have been eight, seven in periods of maximum sun spots. If we adopt 25 degrees or lower as the standard freeze, there have been fourteen, ten during periods of sun spot maxima and four during periods of low sun spot activity.  On the accompanying chart the sun spot ac¬ tivity is indicated by the solid line. On this line are indicated in dots the freezes, p,nd opposite them the lowest temperature. In most cases the temperatures are those of Jacksonville but a few ^marked “G” are of Gainesville and one of Tampa.  The dotted line on the chart indicates what we may expect in sun spot activity during the next few years.@@

COMMITTEE ON INSTITUTIONS@@   Resolved : That the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural Society in session at Lakeland, Florida, May 4, 1922, appreciating the immense value of the results already ob¬ tained through the aid of the United States Department of Agriculture spec¬ ialists engaged in investigating methods for citrus fruit improvement by selec¬ tion and breeding, the control of insect pests and diseases, together with prob¬ lems related to storage and decay in trans¬ it, all of which work has for its end a greater profit to the grower and a reas¬ onable cost to the consumer, do urgently   request that the budget for the U. S. De¬ partment of Agriculture provide for a more adequate support through increased appropriations, to make effective 'these lines of work; and that a special commit¬ tee of three be appointed by the President of this Society to take steps with the proper authorities to secure such increas¬ ed appropriations for the investigations concerned as are warranted by the great importance of the industry and the dem¬ onstrated value of the work.  Passed.@@      
NURSERY INSPECTION@@   Resolved : That the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural Society approves of the prac¬ tices of the Florida State Plant Board, as carried out in its nursery inspection work in Florida.  That it approves of the movement started by that Board to secure the estab¬ lishment of standardized methods in nur¬   sery inspection practices in the Southern states.  And that the President of this Society shall be authorized to attend the coming meeting called to consider standardization of these practices, as its representative.  Passed.@@   
AMENDMENT TO CONSTITUTION@@   (Amending Article 2)  Whereas, The fee of one dollar for an- Horticultural Society does not provide nual membership in the Florida State sufficient funds to pay for the publication   of the Proceedings of the annual meet¬ ing: and take care of the other activities of the Society,  Therefore, Be It Resolved , That Ar¬ ticle 2 of the Constitution be changed to read as follows:  “Article 2.

STATE FLOWER SHOW@@   Whereas, Florida is the Land of Flow¬ ers;  Whereas, There is growing interest in the propagation of flowers and foliage plants, and an interest in the beautifica¬ tion of the home gardens and of the high¬ ways ;  And Whereas, Numerous successful lo¬ cal flower shows have been held at points in the State;  Therefore, In order to unify the ef¬ forts for the beautification of the gar¬ dens and highways of the State, and to foster an interest in the growing of flow¬ er and foliage plants for this purpose,  Be It Resolved : That the President of this Society appoint a committee of three members to meet with similar committees from the Florida Federation Women’s   Clubs, and the Florida State Florists As¬ sociation, to discuss the feasibility of and decide concerning the holding of a State Flower Show; that in case it is decided to hold such a show, this committee shall act for the Society under the direction of the Executive Committee of the Society; and that the Executive Committee shall give this committee full co-operation in carrying out the Society’s part in the co¬ operation with the other organizations.  Be It Further Resolved , That the Sec-  A • 7  retary of this Society shall address a let¬ ter to the President of each of the organ¬ izations mentioned above, requesting their co-operation and the appointment of com¬ mittees to meet with the committee from the Florida State Horticultural Society.

Final Resolutions@@   Whereas, There will be a hearing in Washington, D. C., on May 15, 1922, be¬ fore the Federal Horticultural Board, at the request of persons and agencies who oppose the continued enforcement of Quarantine No. 37, and who desire that this Quarantine be repealed, and  Whereas, The repeal or modification of this quarantine would be inimical to the horticultural interests of Florida and the entire nation, therefore  Be It Resolved, By the Florida State Horticultural Society in its Thirty-Fifth Annual Session, at Lakeland, Florida, held May 4, 1922, that it is strongly opposed to the repeal or any modification of Quarantine No. 37 which will in any way interfere with its present effective¬ ness.  Be It Further Resolved, That the Pres¬ ident, or an alternate named by him, be instructed to attend this hearing as a rep¬ resentative of this Society.  Resolved, That the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural Society extend their apprecia¬ tion to the members of the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce for handling the local arrangements of the meeting and furnishing a convention hall and motor¬ cade, also a banquet to the Citrus Canker Inspectors and for their courtesies to the members of the Sorosis Club for decorat¬ ing convention hall with flowers each   day; to Mrs. George Peterkin of Lake¬ land, Florida, for her untiring efforts in the success of this meeting; to all of the citizens of Lakeland for their hospitality / and support; to the Lake Wales Cham¬ ber of Commerce for the invitation to the fish fry following the adjournment of the Convention; to the newspapers in Lakeland and also throughout the State, for their co-operation in keeping the ac¬ tivities of the Florida State Horticultur¬ al Society before the public; to the speak¬ ers for their assistance rendered in mak¬ ing the programme interesting and in¬ structive; to the officers for their time and effort in arranging the programme and carrying on the work of the Society.  Whereas, So long as free range for live stock is permitted in Florida the horticul¬ tural and agricultural development of the State will be greatly handicapped, and the beautification of our highways and lawns with shrubbery and flowers cannot be ac¬ complished, therefore,  Be It Resolved, by the members of the Florida State Horticltural Society in the Thirty-Fifth convention at Lakeland, on May 4, 1922, that we urge all who are in sympathy with the development of the State’s resources to work for enactment of a law that will permit the people in any county to vote for a stock law which will require live stock owners to keep all of  175   V,          176       their cattle, hogs and other domestic an¬ imals confined in pastures or enclosures, and make the live stock owners liable for damages to persons or property of others within that county, and be it further  Resolved , That candidates for the leg¬ islature be requested to state their position on this subject before the primaries in or¬ der that all the voters may know what to expect at the next session of the legisla¬ ture of those who are elected.  Whereas , The available supply of tim-  9  ber in the United States is being cut about four times as rapidly as new timber crops are being grown, and the marketing of fruits and vegetables grown in Florida is dependent upon an adequate supply of crate material for future years, while the development of the State's resources will require large quantities of lumber for res¬   idences and other building purposes, and Whereas , Nature in Florida is being greatly handicapped in providing for the future requirements through the frequent burning of the woods and denuded areas by the open range cattlemen to get a lit¬ tle green grass for their stock resulting in destruction of untold quantities of mer¬ chantable timber and prevention of nat¬ ural reforestation of cut over lands, there¬ fore be it  Resolved , That the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural Society, in its Thirty-Fifth An¬ nual Convention at Lakeland on May 4, 1922, recommend the enactment of a law creating a State forestry commission au¬ thorized to inaugurate a reforestation pro¬ gram and charged with enforcement of laws to prevent setting out of fires on any property other than that of the owner.

Report of Committee on Necrology@@   W. L. Floyd, Chairman@@ CHARLES KENNEDY McQUARRIE   One of the outstanding figures in Flor¬ ida agriculture during the past 20 or more years, has been Charles Kennedy Mc- Quarrie. This genial Scotchman has traveled the length and breadth of the State many times, giving advice, counsel, and encouragement to the inexperienced, unsuccessful seeker after better methods in agricultural and horticultural lines, and keeping closely in touch with well in¬ formed and successful growers, that he might encourage others to do as they were doing.  He was born in Glasgow, Scotland, Oc¬ tober 12, 1851, and died in harness as State Agent of Farmers’ Co-operative Demonstration Work at Gainesville, No¬ vember 16, 1921, thus rounding out an active life of more than three score and ten years.  He was a direct descendant of the Mc- Quarries of Ulva’s Isle, Scotland. He re¬ ceived his early educational training under a “Dominie,” and later completed his edu¬ cation in Glasgow, where he attended a technical college. In his early manhood he was a cloth manufacturer in his native country, but suffering financial losses due to a bank failure, he came to America.  He settled near DeFuniak Springs in   Walton county in 1888, and there for 25 years was a “real dirt farmer.” It was there in 1893 raised the first velvet beans for feed and for turning under as a soil improver that we have any account of in Florida. He found these beans grow¬ ing as ornamental vines on the front porch of Dr. Felton, a retired Methodist minister, and with that quickness to see agricultural possibilities in new plants and energy in trying them out so character¬ istic of him, he demonstrated the value of this plant now so important in Florida.  He practiced diversified farming and proved what so many are slow to learn, that this is far wiser and safer than the one crop method. He carried on various fertilizer experiments on his farm and learned much about the value of fertilizer on Florida soils and desirable mixtures for different crops.  He maintained a good home orchard, was the first to grow Elberta peaches in North Florida for shipment to Northern markets, and his keen eye was the first to detect the presence of San Jose scale on Florida fruit trees.  He was appointed assistant superintend¬ ent of farmers’ institute work in 1909, which position took him before farmers’   17T        178       meetings and organizations in various parts of the State, where from experience as well as knowledge and observation he told Florida farmers how to improve their methods and attain greater success. In the years 1913 and 1914 he was County Demonstration Agent in Escambia coun¬ ty, where methods he had successfully practiced in the nearby county of Walton aided him in giving the most helpful prac¬ tical assistance. He was elected in 1914  ALFRED JOHN  Alfred John Holworthy was born Feb¬ ruary 22, 1867, on board a vessel in the English Channel. His early life was spent in England, but when quite a young man he came to the United States, and after some business experience he entered the ministry of the Episcopal church. He served various charges in the West, his last being that of rector of the Church at Corpus Christi, Texas.  Mr. Holworthy threw his whole strength of body and mind in what he undertook, and so earnestly did he devote himself to the work of his holy office, that he suffered a nervous collapse, which made it necessary for him to retire from the ministry. While seeking to recuperate he came to Florida. He was first con¬ nected with the Brooksville Hammock Land Company at Brooksville. In the fall of 1911 he moved to Lakeland and be¬ came business manager of the Lakeland Evening Telegraph. After serving for over a year in this capacity he was selected as secretary of the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce, and he labored for nearly 10   as State Agent, Farmers’ Co-operative Demonstration Work in charge of county agents, which position he held at the time of his death.  We shall all sadly miss his genial coun¬ tenance, cordial greeting and his rugged Scotch characteristics, but feel that the work he has done will live on in the re¬ newed effort and increased success of those who follow the principles he so ably set forth.  HOLWORTHY  years in this capacity most efficiently and successfully for the upbuilding of Lake¬ land and the surrounding country. The crowning, achievement of his career of public value for the city and country, was in connection with the building of Polk county’s magnificent roads. In the cam¬ paign for bond issue his voice was heard in every precinct. He furnished the facts and figures, which enabled other able ad¬ vocates to present this great proposition to the people in such a way as to bring about its acceptance.  The high tension under which this and other work was done, his conscientious adherence to the following out of the minutest details, brought on again a nerv¬ ous breakdown, which necessitated the re¬ linquishment of his work as secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. One of the last undertakings, which he aided in put¬ ting through for Lakeland, was in secur¬ ing the location of Southern College there. It was done just before he resigned his position and went to the mountains of       179   North Carolina hoping to rebuild his shat¬ tered system.  Mr. Holworthy was a man of versatile ability, which had he chosen to exercise in the commercial or industrial world, would undoubtedly have brought him material success. He was much loved in Lakeland   and his work was recognized throughout the State, so that when he rose to speak in any gathering he was listened to with at¬ tention and respect. He died February 28, 1922, and was buried in Corpus Chris- ti, Texas.   D. T. McCARTY   By the death of D. T. McCarty on April 14, 1922, Florida lost one of its ablest horticulturists and most reliable and substantial citizens, and St. Lucie county and Ft. Pierce have lost one of whom they were justly proud.  Daniel Thomas McCarty was born in Vinton, Iowa, March 31, 1880, the son of C. T. McCarty, who was the third president of the Florida State Horticul¬ tural Society. He was therefore 42 years old at the time of his death. In 1898 he graduated from the Til ford Academy at Vinton, Iowa, and moved immediately to Ft. Pierce, Florida, where he spent the remainder of his life.  On October 25, 1905, he was married to Miss Frances Lardner Moore, at Char¬ lotte, N. C., and to this union six children were born: Anna Lardner, an infant, Daniel Thomas, Jr., Brian Kenelm, John Moore, and Evelyn Wallace. He is sur¬ vived by all of the children, except the in¬ fant, who preceded him.  Mr. McCarty was one of the largest independent fruit growers in Florida.   His magnificent grove west of Ft. Pierce is the result of his labor and planning and is one of the finest citrus groves in the world. For nearly two years he has been president of the Ft. Pierce Bank and Trust Company, having served as a direc¬ tor since 1907. For a number of years he has also been a director of the East Coast Lumber and Supply Company and of the Dade Lumber Company of West Palm Beach. He was a progressive cit¬ izen, a careful and successful business man, devoted to his home and business, city and county and unceasingly strived to make all of his business enterprises uni¬ formly successful. One of his striking characteristics was his determination to stick by his friends. Always loyal to his own, he drew close to him friends and ad¬ mirers by the hundreds. His devotion to his family and church was often noted, and his very generous nature never per¬ mitted him to refuse an appeal for aid.  His untimely death leaves a host to mourn his departure and to sympathize with the stricken family.          180       HARVIE EARN*  Harvie Earnhardt Heitman was born at Lexington, North Carolina, December 17, 1872, where he lived until about 16 years of age. He was educated in the private schools of his native town.  Mr. Heitman came to Florida in 1888, and was employed by his great-uncle, M. A. Parker, who conducted a general store with a small bank in connection in Fort Myers. He soon became manager of the business and by close application, business sagacity and an appreciation of Florida’s possibilities he became one of the most successful business men in South Florida.  He purchased the land, cleared and planted the Flowerree Groves of 600 acres in 1900, which was at that time the largest citrus grove in the State. He managed this for 21 years, and owned and managed several other citrus groves. He was re¬ garded as one of the best informed men  louis :  Louis D. Jones was born near Vinton, Ohio, in the year 1864. He took up rail¬ roading in his early life, advanced rapidly and became chief dispatcher of the Big Four in Ohio. In this capacity he came to Sanford, Florida, in the year 1901. Look¬ ing abroad he saw a great future for cit¬ rus growing, invested in citrus property, and after becoming a grower learned from experience some of the difficulties in mar¬ keting the fruit. He became a dominat¬ ing figure in organizing the Florida Cit¬ rus Exchange, and for a few years he was manager of the Orange County Sub-Ex¬ change. His marked ability here caused him to be selected as general manager of   ^RDT HEITMAN  on citrus culture and marketing in the State.  He led a most active life, seemed to be almost untiring in his efforts and was in¬ terested in a surprisingly large number of business enterprises. As merchant, bank¬ er, builder, real estate owner and devel¬ oper, fruit grower and promoter of enter¬ prises for the upbuilding of his town, county and State, few men have accom¬ plished more for the material advance¬ ment of Florida. He was a real source of information and inspiration to tourists and other visitors to his locality. He in¬ terested capitalists in investments and spent liberally of his own funds for civic and general improvement.  He died at Fort Myers April 17, 1922. His marked success in a life of less than 50 years is an evidence of what may be accomplished in this “Land of Flowers.”  . JONES  the Florida Citrus Exchange, which posi¬ tion he held from 1913 to 1916.  Returning to his grove at Winter Ha¬ ven after retiring from the management of the Exchange, he made his influence felt in all that made for the development and advancement of his community. He lived to spend and be spent for the good of others.  He was a man of enthusiasm, which was revealed through all his activities, railroading, lodge, club and citrus indus¬ try. This element never waned, but rather enhanced with 2ge. He died at Winter Garden, March 14, 1922.   JAMES A. HARRIS   James A. Harris has been called the father of the orange industry in Florida. He was born at Yalaha, on Lake Harris, May 5, 1847. He became interested in early life in citrus growing, and was a leader in the development of the famous Harris and Bishop grove on Orange Lake, one of the most successful and best known citrus groves of the early days in Florida.   He is generally credited with having in¬ troduced Florida grapefruit into North¬ ern markets.  He was a prominent factor in the up¬ building of Ocala. He was for many years the proprietor of the Ocala House and the Montezuma Hotel.  He died at Crystal River, December 30, 1921, at the ripe age of 74 years.   GEORGE EARLE MOORE   Dr. George Earle Moore was born in Jefferson county, Wisconsin, May 18th, i860. Died in Ironwood, Michigan, March 3d, 1922. He graduated from Rush Medical College, Chicago, in Febru¬ ary, 1883. For a great many years he lived in Oconomowoe, Wis. He became interested in contagious diseases and de¬ siring a larger field for his work moved to the iron mining region of Northern Michigan, settling in Ironwood in 1900. He was soon made County Contagious Physician, holding that office almost to the time of his death. He carried the county through several severe epidemics of smallpox, without the loss of a life. When he died he had the wonderful record of never having lost a case of smallpox, pneumonia or scarlet fever.  He was of a genial nature, a loyal friend and a great lover of children.  About twelve years ago, he became greatly interested in Florida, believing it to be the coming State of the Union. He   purchased a small tract of land west of Delray, in Palm Beach county. Had it cleared and used for a truck garden. When the soil became sweetened, he plant¬ ed several acres to citrus fruits which jus¬ tified his faith in the soil. He took great delight in treating his friends to fruit from this small grove, and had planned to retire from the practice of medicine this fall, and make his home on this land. Had the plans for his house all drawn and was looking forward with pleasure to the time when he could spend his leisure among the orange trees and flowers.  Death came very suddenly of heart fail¬ ure after an illness of only three days.  During the war he served on the Draft Board, which with his regular work over¬ taxed his strength.  He was laid to rest in the Riverside Cemetery, Ironwood, where the little children, whom he loved, keep fresh flow¬ ers on his grave.182  ANDREW H. YOUNT   Andrew H. Yount was born in Lafay¬ ette, Ind., Septmeber 17, 1852. He grad¬ uated from Depauw University, where he studied law, and was admitted to the bar and practiced his profession until 1884, when he went to Chicago.  He became connected with the Chicago Daily News in 1884, as political editor, and for four years city editor.  In 1906 he was appointed secretary to the president of the County Board, which position he retained until ill health com¬ pelled him to come to Florida.  He purchased a tract of land near Fort Lauderdale and set out a grove four years   ago. Here he lived until the time of his death, June 27, 1921.  He was a member of the Press Club of Chicago, Caxton Club, Chamber of Com¬ merce and a very enthusiastic member and supporter of the Florida State Horti¬ cultural Society.  He is survived by his widow, who is carrying on the work of the grove, and one daughter, Mrs. L. L. Latorn, of At¬ lanta, Ga.  He was a collector of first editions, and left a library of rare books, the value of which can hardly be estimated.     New York Botanical Garden Librar      85 00269 0848
