@@Brief History of Florida Entomology@@   E. W. Berger, Ph.D.@@ Entomologist Florida Experiment Station.@@   Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  The history of any subject, or phase of human activity, is always of much interest to me. I feel that unless I know something about the men that have come and gone and the work that they did, that I am really ignorant of my subject. As it is said that they ask in Philadelphia, so I like to ask about a man, who was his grandfather? And I like to ask who were my grandfath¬ ers, entomologically speaking.  before 1850.  To what extent Entomology in Flor¬ ida was made a serious subject for in¬ vestigators during the first half of the last century, and earlier, I am unable to state, having had no time to search for the information. Traveling natural¬ ists very likely made occasional visits, collected a lot -of insects, plants, and what not, and then retreated; later on, perhaps, they made a written report to some society or wrote a book.  In Browne’s “Trees of America,”* published in or about 1846, reference is made to the first occurrence of the long scale at Mandarin, Florida, in 1838. The introduction of this scale was probably made in 1835 on trees   brought from China, bought in New York. These were set out in the Rob¬ inson grove. In 1840 the scale was in¬ troduced at St. Augustine.  In 1855 (Patent Office Report for 1855) Townend Glover (Entomologist at Washington) reports, the long scale as having become widely disseminated to both cultivated and wild citrus stock. Grove after grove was ruined, the trees being killed back each year and died or barely remained alive. Eater, some relief came and the trees began to recover. It would appear from this that some of the natural enemies, insect and fungus, had been introduced and were the means of giving relief. All other remedies had failed, including even whiskey and aloes. It is of pass¬ ing interest to note that St. Augustine was shipping $100,000 worth of or¬ anges annually as far back as 1835.  AFTER 1850; U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRI¬ CULTURE.  Occasionally, a reference to insects in Florida is found in Glover’s reports (Patent Office Reports and Reports of Commissioner of Agriculture) during the fifties and sixties until the end of the seventies.   ’•‘Copy wanted for Experiment Station Library.          During the seventies we find Pack¬ ard and Comstock naming the common scales of citrus and other trees.  It should be explained that active work in entomology in Florida appears to be mainly contemporaneous with the development of the Bureau of En¬ tomology, U. S. Department of Agri¬ culture, Washington, D. C. Thus, as just noted, we find Comstock, who suc¬ ceeded Glover as Entomologist in Washington, describing a large num¬ ber of Florida scales at the latter end of the seventies.  During the eighties, when C. V. Riley became Entomologist of the Bu¬ reau of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture, we find at least two agents of this bureau at work in Flor¬ ida. H. G. Hubbard appears to have labored mainly in and near Crescent City, while Joseph Voyle was stationed at Gainesville. A large part of Hub¬ bard’s work was crystallized in his book on “Insects of the Orange,” 1885, while Voyle wrote on the scale insects of the orange, Bulletin No. 1, 1883, Division of Entomology, U. S. Depart¬ ment of Agriculture.  There is one Entomologist who ap¬ pears to outrank all the others, and that is William H. Ashmead. He and his brother, under the name of Ash¬ mead Brothers, operated a book house and printing establishment in Jackson¬ ville during the latter seventies and eighties. Two papers, a daily and a weekly, were published. The weekly, known as “The Florida Dispatch,” was an agricultural paper of which the sci¬ entific department was edited by Wil¬ liam H. Ashmead. That the rust of   r-jr  oranges is caused by the rust-mite is one of his discoveries, made in 1879. 1885 he gave a brief description, in “The Florida Dispatch,” of the white- fly, and named it Aleyrodes citri, al¬ though in scientific circles he is not credited with this. His book on “Or¬ ange Insects,” 1880, is one of the first to be written on that subject. In 1888, Ashmead became Entomologist of the Florida State Agricultural College at Lake City. Later (1889) he was called to the Bureau of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washing¬ ton, D. C., and in 1897 was made As¬ sistant Curator of Insects in the U. S. National Museum. His death occurred October 17th, 1908.  Following Ashmead at the Agricul¬ tural College and Experiment Station was J. C. Neal, then Prof. P. H. Rolfs, with A. L. Quaintance as an associate; later comes H. A. Gossard, E. H. Sel- lards, and the writer. It will hardly be necessary to refer to the work accom¬ plished by these Experiment Station workers in Entomology, since most of them have appeared before this society and their papers are published in the Transactions.  Of all the Entomological workers enumerated, Mr. Quaintance appears to be the only truly Florida product, and has been called out of the State to do duty with the Bureau of Entomol¬ ogy at Washington.  During the early nineties, and con¬ temporaneously with about the first decade of the Experiment Station, there were several workers from the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Depart¬ ment of Agriculture, in the State.       While these were not entomologists, nevertheless the work of Dr. H. J. Webber pertained in a large part to the control of the whitefly. This was be¬ fore the great freeze of 1894-5. Be¬ sides valuable experiments on spraying for the whitefly he discovered two of its principal fungus enemies, namely, the red (Aschersonia aleyrodes ) and the brown (Aegerita webberii), and recommended spreading them by means of small trees planted close to grove trees.  In July, 1906, the Bureau of Ento¬ mology, U. S. Department of Agricul¬ ture, established the “Whitefly Lab¬ oratory” at Orlando, Fla. This was in response to a call for help from the Florida citrus growers. At first, un¬ der the direction of Dr. A. W. Morrill, the work has since been carried on by Dr. E. A. Back and Mr. W. W. Yoth- crs, the latter of whom is still with us and will speak to you today.  In this connection, I must not omit reference to the visit of Mr. Woglum to India, the native home of the white¬ winged species of the citrus whitefly (A. citri .) Mr. Woglum left this coun¬ try last July and is visiting India and adjacent countries in search of insect and fungus parasites of this insect. Since Mr. Woglum is still abroad and Lis final report has not been submitted, nothing definite can be stated except that he has found a ladybird feeding on the whitefly and has sent specimens of the well known brown fungus of this pest from India.  While this paper has been mainly an enumeration of the workers in Ento¬ mology, a short resume on the whitefly   will be introduced here. This pest (A. citri ) was observed and studied in the Orangeries at Washington about 1878. It existed at Gainesville, Fla., about the same time. It appeared at Panasofkee in 1876. Alachua and Ma¬ rion counties were perhaps the first to have the whitefly.  The cloudy-winged species (A. nubi- fera) was also a pest in Mississippi, North Carolina and Louisiana as early as 1889 and 1890, respectively, and is be¬ lieved by some to have been introduced into Louisiana in 1885 on trees brought to the New Orleans Exposition. The cloudy-winged species also existed in Florida before 1895 at Crescent City. It is therefore practically certain that there have been at least two separate introductions of the whitefly. This con¬ clusion is based upon the fact that both species occurred separately at such wide distances as Louisiana, Missis¬ sippi and North Carolina on the one hand, and Florida on the other. Then, also, the cloudy-winged species has never been reported from the Orange¬ ries at Washington. Besides the possi¬ bility of the white-winged species hav¬ ing been sent out from the Orangeries at Washington, it is also probable that separate introductions were made on trees received directly into Florida from the East.  RESUME.  What is the benefit to the grower of this array of Entomological talent, perhaps sometimes not talent, covering about fifty years ? The answer: There is at present a mass of literature, including       the publications of this Society, those of the Experiment Station, and the Bu¬ reau of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture, in which something of value for the control of perhaps every insect pest known to exist in Florida can be found. Not all the recommen¬ dations will be found highly practical; were they so, that would be equivalent to stating that Entomologists were perfect. But this literature gives us the ground passed over, and if it point¬ ed out the useless methods only, it would still be of value.  I wish to further emphasize two or three pieces of work that were accom¬ plished in Florida. One is the discov¬ ery of the kerosene-soap emulsion by H. G. Hubbard, back in the eighties. This made available for general use one of the best insecticides known. It is still with us, although it has been displaced for certain purposes by the lime-sulphur solution and by emulsions of heavier and cheaper oils. I believe it is safe to affirm, however, that kero¬ sene emulsion was the starting point, and gave the impetus to the compound¬ ing of the many emulsions and miscible oils, home-made and proprietary, that are now in use. Some of these are of great value and mark definite progress in insect control; but it was the discov¬ ery of kerosene emulsion that started the evolution.  Another very valuable phase of in¬ sect control, not first started in Flor¬ ida, but most successful here, is that of the fungus diseases to which insects are subject. It was Prof. Rolfs who first discovered the efficacy of the red¬ headed scale fungus on San Jose scale.   It was Dr. H. J. Webber who found the red and brown fungi destroying the whitefly. That the fungus diseases of scale insects (red-headed, white- headed and black fungus) are keeping the citrus and peach growers of the State from being put out of business by the scales is an undisputed fact. The same thing is true for the fungi and other diseases of the whiteflies of cit¬ rus. But for these fungus assistants, fruit-growing could be carried on only at great expense of spraying. Such was the experience in the thirties be¬ fore these fungus assistants had ap¬ peared or become greatly disseminated. That the fungus assistants which de¬ stroy the whitefly save the Florida growers $1,000,000 annually is prob¬ ably a very conservative estimate. And all with little or no effort on the part of the grower, who by a little effort could frequently greatly increase their efficacy.  But what kind of history are we making at present? It should not be overlooked that the growers help make the history as well as the entomolo¬ gists. Let us first refer to the spore¬ spraying method of spreading and in¬ troducing the fungus diseases of white¬ fly larvae perfected by the Experiment Station during the past few years. During the summer of 1908, Mr. Frank Stirling, of DeLand, sprayed between 8.000 and 9,000 citrus trees in DeLand and vicinity with spores of these fungi. During 1909 he and assistants treated about 127,500 trees, and during 1910 between 750,000 and 800,000 trees. It appears that the fungus diseases of the whitefly must be spreading some-       where. This year Mr. Stirling is again operating about DeLand, while Mr. E. B. Stevens, a former partner of Mr. Stirling, has taken up this work at Lakeland and vicinity. Mr. F. P. Hen¬ derson, of Gainesville, Fla., has also done extensive spraying with fungus spores, and besides is headquarters for supplying the scale fungi.  The recent recommendations of the Experiment Station to spray with in¬ secticides for the whitefly in October and November, or in April or May, after the adult whiteflies have quit swarming and the eggs have hatched, has been almost literally followed by several growers with very satisfactory re¬ sults.  The writer considers this recommen¬ dation, which is the outcome of nearly four years of observation and experi¬ ment, perhaps the most useful result, next to the spore-spraying method of spreading the fungi, accomplished.  But all Entomological history is not so glittering. Four letters were re¬ cently addressed to as many growers in a locality where, the whitefly and scale insects were almost literally eat¬ ing up the trees. The purpose of these letters was to encourage these growers to give the method of spraying for the young whitefly larvae a fair trial. I offered to give them the advantage of my experience per letter and person¬ ally. I have so far heard only from one man, and that after I wrote him a sec¬ ond letter. He then stated that I was too late; that his brother had already gone into partnership with him.  Another bit of history which I re¬ cently discussed with a fellow Ento¬   mologist comes to mind. During the early part of the last decade, H. A. Gossard, then entomologist for the Ex¬ periment Station, conducted fumiga¬ tion experiments upon the whitefly. He was so unfortunate as to cause the dropping of some leaves during the progress of some of the experiments. Today it would appear that about the only recollection of Gossard in that lo¬ cality pertains to the fact that the trees dropped some of their leaves. Considering that the fumigation car¬ ried on was largely experimental, it could only be expected that some leaves would be dropped.  During the past five years fumiga¬ tion for the whitefly has again been worked over. This time under the im¬ mediate direction of the Bureau of En¬ tomology at Washington, with the lab¬ oratory stationed at Orlando. This time the prospects for its successful adoption appear better. At least four localities have adopted it as their prin¬ cipal method of whitefly control. Will the method be lost to the State again, as it was in 1903? I am informed that only two of these localities have trained local men to do this work, and that the men in charge at the other two locali¬ ties were from without the State, and will probably not return. The conse¬ quence will be that these localities will have to learn over again the next time they wish to fumigate. And what will they do when the Whitefly Laboratory at Orlando has been discontinued? I cannot too strongly emphasize here the importance of training local men to understand the application of insecti¬ cidal and plant disease control methods.       I shall end with another thought along this same line. It has occurred to me that there should be a short course in the control of citrus pests and diseases given at the University. It might read as follows:  “A Twelve Weeks’ Course on the Control of Citrus Insect Pests and Diseases.” It should include:  1. A study of insect pests.  2. A study of plant diseases.  3. Control of insects by means of their natural enemies, fungi and in¬ sects.  4. Methods and practical experi¬ ence in the application of insecticides, including fumigation and fungicides.  5. The chemistry and mixing of spray¬ ing solutions.  6. The study of a plant’s life.  Other subjects might be suggested as the course is worked out. Such a course should be open to all who chose to attend. It should be more or less comparable to the short course in agriculture given at the University during the past two years. Each county should see to it that it had at least one representative at this course each year. Better still, each locality, or center of citrus culture, or center for the growing of other crops subject to the attack of insects and diseases, should arrange to have several men, preferably young men, to attend the course. After a few years, the result would be that each locality would have men with sufficient technical knowl¬ edge to be able to supervise the con¬ trol of insect pests and diseases intelli¬ gently. Such is the desideratum, tech¬   nical supervision, not the shotgun method. It is quite out of the question that every grower should post himself sufficiently along such technical lines, hence there should be the practical specialist. Just as there are courses in animal husbandry, poultry raising, dairying, general agriculture, etc., in many of our colleges and universities, why should the University of Florida not give a course in citrus culture and other special crops, especially in what pertains to the control of insect pests and diseases? In the above outline I have several times indicated where the course might be broadened to cover the control of insects and diseases of other crops besides citrus. The period of time that the course should occupy would determine the desirability of broadening its scope or limiting it.  DISCUSSION.  Mr. Skinner: That last suggestion Mr. Berger makes about a short course in in¬ sect control at the University is one of the best suggestions I ever heard in this society. No matter how intelligent a man may be, he will find it hard to get any line on these insects, and know them when he sees them, and how to go to work to control them. I would send a man, or two men, there, if I could not go myself. I consider it a very valuable suggestion, and I hope the society will see fit to take some action.  Mr. Yothers: I talked this over with Dr. Berger when he mentioned it at Gainesville, and told him the greatest hin¬ drance to our work is the fact that no-       body seems to take hold and meet us half way in the work we are conducting. He mentioned in his paper that the process of fumigation is but little understood in this State. There should be a good many men in Florida who understand fumiga¬ tion, whether it is generally adopted by the State or not. Last winter I had two calls for men to take charge of fumigating work. I knew of only one man to whom I could give an unhesitating recommendation. I hesi¬ tated to give him a recommendation for the reason that he came down from Mas¬ sachusetts to stay two or three months and then go back, but the person was so insistent that I gave the young man a recommendation and he took charge of the work. As soon as it was done he went back to Massachusetts. I doubt if he will come to Florida again.  Two or three days ago, two people wanted me to recommend a man to take charge of the spraying of several large groves. I did not know of anybody to recommend. If a short course was given at the University, I think we would have plenty of material from which to select men to take charge of this kind of work.  Mr. Connor: I know that what Prof. Yothers has just remarked in connection with fumigation is absolutely true. There are various places in Florida where fumi¬ gation outfits have been supplied for use in the groves, and the reason why fumi¬ gation is not applied is because a compe¬ tent man cannot be found to handle the outfit. Use of fumigation is rather an important proposition, from the growers' standpoint. Unless properly applied, great injury may result to the trees, and little damage may result to the insects.   Personally, I know of but one grove that has been successfully treated for white- fly in the State of Florida, and that hap¬ pens to be a little grove of my own, and that has been treated by spraying with insecticide at the proper time. Only two treatments in two years, following up with fumigation at the season when the whitefly is more easily affected by fumi¬ gation, and more thoroughly eradicated than at any other time. The second year, treating with the application of hydro¬ cyanic acid gas. I do not believe an en¬ tomologist would find a whitefly in half a day’s search. I followed it up with just as thorough a treatment last winter. The results have been most gratifying, not only from the insecticide, but from the use of fumigation as well. The fer¬ tilizer expense has been cut down to less than half, and that is the only grove in the neighborhood that has held its full crop of fruit, and that is due, of course, to the eradication of the insects. I would like as many people as possible to see that grove, so that they could realize that all the talk about not being able to handle the whitefly is but “poppy-cock”—if the application is made in the proper way. The whitefly is actually po more impor¬ tant than any other insect. Whitefly is not half as bad as you think it is, if you take hold right and get in touch with the people who know how to fight it. Fumi¬ gation, in connection with a good insecti¬ cide, applied at the proper season, is the best method I know of.  Mr. Thompson: In regard to the sug¬ gestion of taking a special course at the University, I think it is a wise one. We have a Protective League at Florence Villa that decided last winter to fumigate.        We got everything all ready, but could not find a single man to put in charge. Finally a man was put in charge, and I judge it was the man from Massachu¬ setts Mr. Yothers spoke of—I don’t know. He went up and took a week or ten days’ instructions, and came to our place and took charge of the work. There was a loss of time right there, and that was against our interest and much in favor of the insects. We had a very early spring, and before we had done the fumi¬ gating we had intended to do, the new growth had come out, the trees were in bloom, and we will have to take it up an¬ other year.  Mr. Yothers: I am more or less fa¬ miliar with that work at Florence Villa, and certainly do not blame the man who took charge of it, because he rushed the thing as much as possible, but you cannot fumigate when the wind blows, and, if you remember, the wind blew a good deal at that time. I think the young man did very well, because when he left the State of Florida, he went back to his home to have an operation. He carried on the work with those people when he was not physically able.  I think the great trouble down there was lack of supplies that could not be had early in the season. I cautioned them that the work should be started by the first of September, but there seemed to be trou¬ ble about getting supplies, and, as you say, there was no man to take charge of the work.  Mr. Thompson: I am not complaining about the young man who came down. He took hold of the work and pushed it with energy, and we were all pleased with what he did. We had no fault to find     with the man, but I was calling attention to the fact that we could not find a single man to take charge of the work at the moment when we wanted him.  Dr. Richardson: It seems to me that we are reaching a very important stage in our University work, judging from the opinions expressed by the gentleman who read the paper. This is a utilitarian age. This is an age in which men are not study¬ ing abstract sciences for mere amusement and edification, but along the lines that will give practical and beneficial results, and it seems Dr. Berger has hit the nail on the head when he suggests that the University give a course along the lines that will be of benefit to the grower.  I want to say in the presence of this society, that all the horticultural people all over the State will stand back of Dr. Berger when any work of that kind is undertaken. It is well to have these gentlemen to take charge of what in Ger¬ many they call germs, in France they call paris-sites, and in Ireland they call mi(ke)crobes—hunt them up, find them, and then destroy them. To us who are interested in the work, we must be taught how to destroy them. We have proved that we know how to find these pests; now give us a course in the destruction of them, the elimination of them. That is what we are ready to stand up for and support you in every way we can. Give us a corps of trained men so that when we need one for our insect-infested groves, fumigated or inspected, we can telegraph for one and have him sent on the next train, with paraphernalia all ready to begin work. When we need a lawyer, we can get one, and when we need a physician, we can get one; why       should we not have a grove-doctor when we need one?  Mr. 'Connor: In taking up the work of whitefly control, all of the various methods Dr. Berger has suggested will, of course, prove invaluable to the grow¬ ers. When I stated a while ago that I had been successful in treating whitefly by fumigation and insecticide, I did not mean to neglect fungus. The impor¬ tance of trained men to take hold of white fly control (mind you, I say con¬ trol, for it can be eradicated from every district) the value of these trained men would be that they would be well posted, not only in fumigation and spraying with insecticide, but as well in distributing and properly applying fungus on the trees, that it might take hold and work in the proper season. We have seasons in which all of the different methods may be em¬ ployed, and I am happy to say when one cannot be employed, the other can be. For instance, in the summer season, when the trees are growing rapidly, we would not dare to fumigate because the injury would be too great, but always during the summer season we have the rainy weather —which is valuable to the growth of the fungus.  Earlier in the season, we have the growing condition of the tree, during which period the fungus would not be val¬ uable, for it would not develop in the dry season. Therefore, we necessarily resort to insecticide. In the dormant season there can be nothing better employed than fumigation. Therefore, it would be well for the Experiment Station to take up this work directly with young men whose integrity might not be questioned by the growers in the different districts of or¬   ange producing Florida, and let them thoroughly understand these different methods in order that they may be ap¬ plied for the benefit of the growers’ needs of the district.  Therefore, I, as a grower, heartily en¬ dorse Dr. Berger’s suggestion, and I sin¬ cerely trust that every member of this or¬ ganization will support him in his sug¬ gestion that will work out such great ben¬ efit.  Prof. Flume: I think the general sen¬ timent of the society is that something should be done in this connection. I be¬ lieve it would be quite in order to draft a set of resolutions to be forwarded to the president of the University, asking that this line of work be taken up, and I would like to see some concrete action taken along that line.  Prof. Rolfs : In that same connection, if such committee be appointed, let us embody in it a pledge that a certain num¬ ber of men will take the course. To cre¬ ate such a course would be of consider¬ able expense to the University. If that course were offered, and onlv two or three students were to take it, the expense would be too heavy.  On the other hand, if the citrus grow¬ ers would pledge that a certain number of men, such as twenty or twenty-five, could be induced to go there, then there would be some definite assurances. You under¬ stand, if we can get the man to take an interest in the work, that work is certain to be done. If we can take interest enough in the proposition to send a class up there for the course, then the resolu¬ tion to have the work done is almost un¬ necessary.       Take the matter of the Citrus Seminar. When even so small a number as twelve signified their determination to attend the Seminar, the work was incurred. Should there have been only two or three to go up there to do that work, we would hardly have been justified in spending the time that cost us probably $2,000 or $3,000.  If we see to it that the men are forth¬ coming, the course will be prepared, I am sure. We will have no difficulty about the matter of instruction being given, it we can get the class of fifteen, twenty-five or thirty young men to take the course.  Mr. -: How long do you  suppose it would take, in time, to cover this course?  Dr. Berger: In the paper I suggested twelve weeks. It seems that it might be inaugurated to cover a period of that much time. Of course, a year or two of experience would serve to show what can be done in that time, and what the further requirements would be.  Mr. Connor: It seems to me that the matter of furnishing material for the Ex¬ periment Station to work with is practi¬ cally up to this Association. I am sure that from my immediate neighborhood I can safely pledge one student—possibly two. I do not think there is a vicinity or neighborhood represented here today that could not go as far as I would in making that pledge, and inasmuch as the propo¬ sition means so much to the grower, they would have to make it their duty to fur¬ nish one bright, intelligent young man from their midst, and choose him care¬ fully, that they might have an intelligent man to put in charge of the most impor¬   tant work they have to do in their groves, to control insect pests.  From the vicinity of Orlando, another two or three people could be furnished to that call. From Winter Haven I am sure there will be others from there. From Arcadia, Manatee section, all those places will send at least one representative  I recommend that the members of this Society take the matter up at once and pick out their men and give the assur¬ ances to the University that will justify their inaugurating such a course.  Mr. Driscoll: The gentleman who has just spoken, mentioned Arcadia. Now I want to speak to this Society about our Association at Arcadia. It was organized by the citrus growers for the express pur¬ pose of fighting the whitefly pest. They have a young man who has charge of the fumigating outfit. The county commis¬ sioners have appropriated an amount, and this fund is helped out by the citrus grow¬ ers themselves. This young man was taken under the careful supervision of Dr. Cline, who was very much interested in citrus fruit culture, and instructed how to fumigate. He, in turn, instructed sev¬ eral other young men of the neighboiv hood, and there is now quite a corps of these trained men. The county has be¬ come so interested, and has seen such good results from it, that the county com¬ missioners at their annual meeting, con¬ tributed liberally towards the support of the movement, and I feel satisfied, if the gentlemen from the various counties in which the citrus fruit industry predomi¬ nates, will use their influence and ask the county commissioners for a contribution to assist them in educating a young man at the University, they will have no        trouble in getting the money to pay for the expense of the course. It won’t cost much money; they will spend it anyway in trying to make good roads, or for something else, and used in the way sug¬ gested, it will be well spent.  I heartily approve of Dr. Berger’s sug¬ gestion, and would like to offer a motion that a committee be appointed to draft this resolution along the lines discussed, and submit it to the Association to he   adopted, and presented to the President of the University. Mr. President, please consider my last sentence as a motion.  Motion seconded and carried.  Committee appointed by the president, Messrs. Skinner, Connor and Driscoll.  Prof. Hume. I would suggest that in drafting such resolution, you get in touch with Prof. Rolfs. The resolutions will be called for later on.@@   
Stem-End Rot and Gummosis   TWO FUNGOUS DISEASES OF CITRUS.@@   H. S. Fawcett.@@   Mr. President a Ladies and Gentlemen :  In addition to the many unfavorable conditions to which the fruit grower is liable, such as frost or scorching heat, floods or drought, or hurricanes, there are the ever-present insect and fungous enemies, new and destructive kinds of which are liable to get into his orchard at any moment without his notice.  It is with two fungous enemies of cit¬ rus trees, that have been known and stud¬ ied during the past one or two years, that this paper proposes to deal. The two diseases associated with these two fungi, are Stem-End Rot and Gummosis. Stem- End Rot is a comparatively new disease. Gummosis has been known for many years, but the fungus associated with it has only recently been studied. To the practical orchardist, the minute details in regard to these fungi are of little interest. He is interested in them just in so far as a knowledge of the habits of growth and life history of the organisms enables him to intelligently control them. At the same time, he may realize the importance of careful and painstaking research bv the Plant Pathologist into the minutest details of the organisms causing them, be¬ cause of the fact that this knowledge   . • • 5  *  often enables him to combat a disease at once, which has baffled him for a life time. It is so with these diseases of the orange. A knowledge of their cause is suggesting effective means of controlling them.  WHAT ARE FUNGI? !  /  It is scarcely necessary to say that the fungi are plant growths of very low order and include such names as moulds, mil¬ dews, smuts, rusts, toadstools, mush¬ rooms, puff balls, etc. The different kinds of fungi, as is so well known, are exceedingly variable in size, from those i-iooo of an inch, to those a foot or more in greatest diameter, and in form they vary from those comparable in size to a hen’s egg, to those that could be likened in form to a cabbage palmetto, an oak tree, a towering red wood tree, or an In¬ dian mound. The two fungi which have to do with Stem-End Rot and Gummosis of citrus trees are both so small that they can rarely be seen on the trees even with the hand lens, and only the effects of their work appear. When growing in large quantities, however, they appear like dif¬ ferently colored moulds, which are seen         under a compound microscope to be com¬ posed of innumerable interwoven fungus threads. These fungi keep them¬ selves alive from generation to genera¬ tion and spread from place to place by means of seed-like bodies called spores.  •m  CONTROL OF FUNGOUS ENEMIES.  <  l  Spraying is usually the first thing that is thought of in connection with a fung¬ ous disease. Spraying has been the great remedy in the past, and is still an effi¬ cient means of relief for many kinds of diseases of plants.  While we may never be able to get en¬ tirely away from the use of the spray pump and fungicides, I believe that for orange trees at least in the future, the pruning knife, the saw and axe and the burning brush heap, and the planting of resistant varieties, are going to be a far greater factor than the spray pump, in the control of fungous diseases. It is not the purpose of this paper to discourage spray¬ ing for orange diseases in its right place and at the right time. Spraying for cer¬ tain insect and fungous diseases will no doubt always have to be resorted to for temporary relief, as the doctor uses med¬ icine. A doctor will insist on your living and taking care of yourself in such a way that you will not need his services, and yet at the same time, he will prescribe medicine to break up some ailment which you have let go along until it is serious. It seems that the situation is sometimes somewhat analogous to this in an orange grove. I believe, however, that the ideal we should work toward is to do away as much as possible with the necessity for spraying, as the doctor would advise you   to so live as to do away with his medi¬ cines.  It is the desire here to emphasize strongly the need for “the pound of pre¬ vention,' ’ grove sanitation, and care in keeping our trees resistant to an attack of the enemy, of propagating only good healthy nursery stock, and seeking for re¬ sistant varieties, and budding our trees to these; and sometime in the future, if pos¬ sible, to throw away our spray pumps on the scrap heap, so far as fungus diseases are concerned. The danger that comes with spraying for fungi in orange trees, is that in many cases while you are kill¬ ing one enemy, you may at the same time be killing half a dozen fungus friends. Therefore, one must know what he is do¬ ing. In using the pruning knife, the saw and the axe, we are not so apt to be kill¬ ing so many of our friends. It is neces¬ sary not only to study each disease in it¬ self, but to study it in relation to other diseases that may be present, and in re¬ lation to other factors, such as insects, weather, fertilization, etc. What may be of utmost value under one set of condi¬ tions may be all wrong under another dif¬ ferent set.  STEM-END ROT OF CITRUS FRUITS.  The fungous enemy causing stem-end rot is a comparatively new one. The oval spore of this fungus, about 1-4000 of an inch long gives rise to a filament that enters at the stem end of the fruit while it is still hanging to the tree, or after it has been picked. If it enters while on the tree the fruit drops and the fungus by means of innumerable branching and in¬ terwoven microscopic threads, causes it to    CITRUS   PEACH   CITRUS                           V       pass through the stages of decay, from slight softening at the stem end, to brown mushiness and finally to a hard, dark- brown or black mummy. The spurs from which the fruit has dropped, die back from 3 to 12 inches or more and often show drops of gum near the border be¬ tween the dead and live wood of these twigs. Spores of the fungus have been found in great numbers on these dead branches and on the mummified fruits, and pure cultures have been obtained from the interior of these twigs as well as from the interior of softened fruit.  A year ago I gave you my first report on this disease and gave out the informa¬ tion that had been obtained up to that time. The information then at hand was that stem-end rot was a serious decay of sound fruit as well as injured fruit; that this decay developed often on sound or¬ anges in transit; that it was caused by a fungus growth which usually entered at the stem end; that it might be transmitt¬ ed from diseased oranges to healthy ones by contact or by soaking them in water; that it might be transmitted also by means of pure cultures of the fungus placed on the fruit, or placed in water in which the fruit was soaked; that the fungus could infect the fruit through a stem left on an orange at least 3 inches long; that fruits could be infected by placing them in water with soil from under infected trees; that it took from one to three weeks after infection, for symptoms of the decay to appear.  During the past year additional infor¬   mation and facts in regard to the disease have been obtained by observation and spraying experiments in various orange groves in the state, and by experiment and study in the laboratory. I will noF give you the tiresome details of these, but speak of the facts brought out.  First of all there is one correction to make. 1 said last year that the fungus was a species of Achlya belonging to the water moulds. Further study has shown that it is not a water mould, but probably some higher form.  INOCULATION EXPERIMENTS.  In my paper last year I showed some charts containing the tabulated results of the work to that time. In order to def¬ initely establish these results and find out further in regard to the fungus, some ad¬ ditional experiments were carried out last November and December. We wished to find out (1) the influence that injury to the rind would have on making the fruit subject to stem-end rot decay. For this purpose the rinds of some oranges were slightly cut near the stem end like a bad clipper cut, while others were left uninjured and comparison sets were made, placing on these both fungus fila¬ ments and the fungus spores. A com¬ parison was also made as between the effect of stem end rot fungus, and the known citrus disease fungi, when placed on the surface of the fruit. Both sound and clipper-cut fruit were used as before. The results are shown in Table I.       Table I.   STEM-END ROT INFECTION ON ORANGES.   Experiment No.  1. Fungus filaments put on stem end.  2.

For this purpose 5 wooden boxes contain¬ ing soil were prepared as follows: (a) Soil from under an infected tree, (b) soil from Experiment Station grounds in which no citrus trees had been growing,   same source sterilized and treated by mixing in cultures of stem-end rot fungus. Sound fruits were then placed stems clown in the soil, and it was kept moist. (See Table II.)  The results of these experiments show that this fungus unlike the blue mold can enter without injury, but is favored by in¬ jury; that the time for decay, from the   Table II.

Other new facts brought out by our study since last year are these: That the fungus lives and produces spores in the dead twigs and in and on the decayed fruit, that it is more widely distributed than it was first thought to be.  We also tried out some spraying ex¬ periments beginning in October in five different parts of the state. In the first plot Bordeaux mixture was used; in the second ammoniacal copper carbonate; in the third self-boiled lime sulphur and in the fourth the commercial lime sulphur. The reports of shipping experiments have just come in, and it seems that the spraying had very little effect upon the amount of stem end decay on fruit held at Washington for as long as three weeks. The checks were nearly as good as any of the others. This shows that spraying with fungicide for stem end rot decay is no good whatsoever, espec¬ ially if begun as late as October. The checks were 21% after three weeks at Washington, Bordeaux was 32% (11% more), ammoniacal copper carbonate was 21%, just the same as the check; self- boiled lime sulphur, 23% ; commercial lime sulphur, 17%, somewhat less, but not greatly less than the check.  These shipping tests Were made by H. J. Ramsey of the Bureau of Plant In¬ dustry.  CONTROL.  The results of this study and experi¬ ments with this fungus indicate rather definite lines of control. Since the spores of the fungus are abundant upon the kill¬   ed twigs and mummified fruit upon the ground, the importance of a thorough pruning out of these dead branches and a thorough cleaning up and burning of diseased fruit that have dropped the prev¬ ious year is suggested as a means towards preventing new infection of the next crop.  The result of the inoculation experi¬ ments last year suggested the probability of fruit becoming infected when being washed, and the advisability of trying ex¬ periments in treating the wash water and also in spraying the oranges with a fungi¬ cide just as they came out of the tank. In cooperation with Mr. Ramsey of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, we carried on some experiments in this line at two different packing houses. It may be said as a general statement that these experiments did not indicate that any new infection took place in the short time that the fruit was in the wash water. Our experiments at least, did not show any consistent difference in amount of stem end decay between the treated and the untreated fruits. Some of the chemi¬ cals we used appeared to increase the amount of blue mould decay due prob¬ ably to injury to the rind.  GUMMOSIS.  A second fungus enemy has been found guilty only during the last ten months in connection with the gumming of both or¬ ange and peach trees. The gumming of orange and peach trees in various forms has been known for a good many years. There are several diseases in which gum¬ ming occurs, but the word “gummosis” in Florida has been applied to the particu¬ lar disease of citrus trees in which the first stages are characterized by copious       flow of gum from breaks in the bark on the trunk or large limbs some distance from the ground, and in the later stages hy a shagginess of the bark. Only recent¬ ly has it been known that there was any fungus in connection with this trouble .and it has been attributed to various caus¬ es, such as cold, the wrong kind of fertil¬ izers, borers and the like. And while one or more of these factors may weaken or injure the tree so that the fungus may more easily enter, it now seems probable that this organism is one of the agents in causing one form of disease known as gummosis.  DESCRIPTION.  The disease first makes itself apparent on citrus trees by the oozing out of a thm watery gum, which sometimes runs down the bark in lines, forming what is known as “tears.” Later the gum thickens and collects in large quantities at the cracked places in the bark. As the disease pro¬ gresses, the bark cracks still more and assumes a shaggy ulcerated appearance over patches three inches to a foot or more in length. The diseased patches may extend entirely around the limb or may be confined to one side of the branch. The gum seems to exude most during the growing period in the spring and sum¬ mer, and sometimes entirely ceases in the fall and winter. In cases where the gum¬ mosis is not too severe, new bark is formed under the old and the surface becomes marked by ridges, warts and res¬ inous-looking deposits and at the edge of the diseased area are large bits of bark which have been pushed up and are hang¬ ing by one edge. When the disease is of some age, it may easily be mistaken for the true scaly bark.   A species of fungus belonging to the genus Diplodia '(Diplodia natolensis ) has been found under the bark of diseased patches on citrus trees and the same fun¬ gus has been found in connection with diseased limbs on gumming peach trees. It was first obtained from the interior of gumming peach branches by E. W. Berger of the experiment station in July of last year and was afterwards isolated by him from gumming peach branches from five different coun¬ ties in the state. The two most widely separated localities were West Tampa and Pensacola.  In September of the same year, what appeared to be the same fungus was ob¬ tained from the gumming orange limbs and afterwards obtained from six differ¬ ent counties of the state. Both peach and orange trees in the greenhouse were in¬ oculated by taking bits of this fungus which had been grown in the laboratory and inserting it under the bark. In each case, the bark of healthy trees was cut in exactly the same way. These peach and orange trees in which the fungus had been inserted under the bark gummed copiously, very much in the same manner as they do when infected in the orchard; while those which had been cut in the same way but no fungus inserted, healed up without gumming in any case. This seems to show that this particular fungus may be one of the agents at least in in¬ ducing the gum and it is probable that in many cases some slight injury allows the fungus to get in. This is not thought to be true in all cases, as the following will indicate:  Some inoculations were made by plac¬ ing the fungus on the surface of the bark        4 7   of peach trees without cutting or injuring it in any way. Where the bark was young and green, gumming took place, while in cases where the bark was thicker and harder, no gumming was seen.  Another interesting discovery was made while working with this fungus. It was found as stated before, that this fun¬ gus could also cause stem end decay of   being inserted into the bark of healthy orange and peach trees will cause copious gumming; and that the same fungus when placed on oranges is able to cause a form of decay resembling stem-end rot..  CONTROL.  The line of treatment for gummosis at once suggested by this discovery is to    Table III.  GUMMOSIS FUNGUS INFECTION  ON ORANGES.

As the decay from the gummosis fungus pro¬ ceeds, however, the fruit becomes light in weight, with black streaks and is not so soft and mushy as in the other decay. Table III. shows the results of experi¬ ments with the gummosis fungus.  These results seem to show that sound oranges are not so readily attacked by the Diplodia fungus as by the true stem-end rot fungus, but that injured oranges are just as readily attacked and more quickly destroyed. I do not think this fungus could enter a sound orange while still on the tree.  The facts brought out in relation to gummosis are that there is a species of fungus connected with it; that this fun¬ gus can be grown on pure culture and on   get rid of the organism in the infected tissue. If the disease has progressed until a good portion of the bark around a tree is involved, it might as well be cut out and burned. If it is not far advanced r the tree or limb affected can probably be saved by the following treatment. The finding of this fungus growing in the dis¬ eased places would indicate that the severe cutting away of all diseased tissue should be employed in order to get rid entirely of this fungus. Some growers- have been using with apparent success the method of cutting away quite severely, and where there are decayed places cut¬ ting these out further with a sharp knife or chisel. These cut surfaces are then dis¬ infected, and the whole surface covered with a kind of grafting wax. A very good wax for this purpose, which has been used with good success by Mr. Hart                 of Hawks Park for cut surfaces, is made as follows: 6 ounces alcohol, i pound rosin, 2 ounces tallow, 1 ounce spirits of turpentine. Mix the tallow and rosin and heat together. Take off and cool and turn alcohol in slowly. Last put in the turpentine.  In conclusion it may be said that pre¬ vention rather than cure is what we should strive for in the future, and even after the disease is present, the pruning knife and the saw are of first importance and the once “cure all” method of spray¬ ing should be used with care. For or¬ ange trees at least, it seems to me that spraying with fungicides in our present state of information should not be de¬ pended upon and should be looked on rather as a temporary means of relief in some severe cases of disease. In the treatment of these troubles, it is neces¬ sary, as has been stated before, to know all the different agents both fungous and insect that are working in an orange tree ; and to adopt the method that will be best fitted when one considers the ef¬ fect of this treatment on all of them taken together.   Prof. Hume: In connection with this report we have two other speakers, but I believe it would be a good idea to have at least part of the discussion now.  I might say in this discussion that Prof. Fawcett is a very modest man. He has worked out and put before you today, a problem which has puzzled the best in¬ vestigators in this country, both in the peach growing districts and in California, and it has come off just as plain as the   rule of two and two are four. But I think you ought to know the study and observation and investigation which has made his talk possible.  Mr. Gillette: Prof. Fawcett stated to us that he thought in the early stages of this disease (gummosis), it might be controlled. I would like to ask him by what method or what means it can be controlled, and what he has found most successful.  Prof. Fawcett: I have had very little experience myself in treating it the way I would treat it since this recent discov¬ ery. The method as employed was to take off the loose bark and paint with Car- bolineum. The results were not as sat¬ isfactory as we wished; although it seem¬ ed to help it, it did not cure the trouble. Mr. Stevens of DeLand, has cured a number of cases by cutting back, in the early stages, into the live wood both ways from the point of infection and, in some cases, putting grafting wax over it.  Mr. Gillette: What was the disinfec¬ tant used?  Prof. Fawcett: I think he used Car- bolineum. But some caution must be used in using Carbolineum, because if you get it too strong, it might do much harm. I advocate a more mild disinfect¬ ant, such as Bordeaux, or a paste of lime and sulphur. Of course, you can weaken Carbolineum with soap and water.  Mr. Gillette: The Professor’s experi¬ ence coincides with mine, exactly. I pre¬ sume I have had more experience with gummosis than almost anyone here, for the reason that I had charge of a large grove in Cuba. You never have seen gummosis in Florida that compares with that they have in Cuba. In a grove of       probably 150,000 trees in Cuba, I pre¬ sume 60 or 70 per cent of them have been attacked with gummosis. At the time I saw it, it resembled foot rot, al¬ though in the wrong place. I thought it was foot rot. The trees were infected just a little above the ground. I soon found that I knew nothing about it. They thought that my coming from Florida, of course I would know just how to cure it, but I had to confess that it was some¬ thing new to me. In one of the groves they had a good deal of trouble with lemon trees largely on account of this trouble with gummosis. Several experts visited Cuba, and some of them claimed that the trouble was with the roots. I did not believe that.  When the disease started, we cut it back just as the Professor says, into the clean wood. We scraped it, and treated it with Carbolineum, but soon found that it burned the trees. We weakened it, and found it worked better. Some of the trees, however, died, and we concluded to burn them. We had the trees cut off, and new shoots came up, and some of the finest trees grew from those old roots.  The disease never started on those trees until about the second or third year; that seems to be the time when the disease be¬ gins to develop. At first, I thought it was brought about by something the trees had taken up from the soil.  In the first grove of one hundred acres, I never saw trees grow more beautifully than they did for two years. Then, after a wet season, the disease broke out all through the grove. Out of 8,000 trees, about 7,000 were affected. It seems as though the extreme moisture had made soluble in the soil something which the   tree had taken up to excess. The tree was just like a person whose blood is bad and boils had broken out. We began treating them just as the Professor sfated, by cutting out, cleaning away and using- several insecticides. Some trees were healed up in a short time, and some of them seemed to entirely recover. But we soon found out that if the knife used in scraping the trees was not absolutely clean, it would inoculate another tree, so we had to put the blade into the fire and burn it after treating every diseased tree, to keep from carrying the disease all through the grove.  I was on the Isle of Pines about three weeks ago. I went into one of the larg¬ est groves on the Island. It is a hand¬ some grove, but all through it I noticed vacant spots, and in walking through I noticed trees with great sores on the side, some of them healed and some of them bleeding badly from the disease. It seems to me that unless they do some¬ thing very soon, they are going to lose a very valuable piece of property. As I stated before, the disease is much more prevalent there, and works much more rapidly.  This disease seems to be more prevalent in the hammocks and in the lower lands, like those on the Manatee River. They seem to have considerable trouble there. I know several people in that section who are troubled with it, and they are going to lose their groves if drastic measures are not taken.  In nursery work, we very frequently begin budding, say in July or August. This is something we ought not to do. Very frequently you will find a whole lot of those trees will gum, in a manner very       similar to gummosis, although I do not think it is the same thing. I was once very much alarmed, for the reason that gummosis seemed to have gotten my nur¬ sery, but it soon healed over and there was no harm done.  Prof. Rolfs: I know there is no one here who can appreciate the amount of. work Prof. Fawcett had to do to come to this scientific conclusion. However, there is no one here who undervalues the con¬ clusion he has come to. He has proved it is due to a specific agent he has dis¬ covered. I think Prof. Fawcett is on good, solid ground to getting a practical and profitable remedy which heretofore we could not have gotten without great expenditures of money, and then only in an approximate way. The knowledge of this disease has been carried to this point; now he is ready to go ahead with the practical side of it and find out what is the best remedy.  I merely wished to call attention to this, Mr. Chairman, that the talk consumed only a few minutes, while it took nearly twelve months to give him the knowl¬ edge to make that talk. In a few minutes he told you what he had discovered about gummosis of the peach, but he did not tell you that it has baffled the scientists from California to New York and south to Florida, and this is the first time it has been definitely proven what the agent is.  Dr. Richardson: A line of thought has been suggested to me by a remark dropped by Mr. Gillette. You remember that he said that it was something like a man with impure blood that broke out in boils.. Having practiced medicine for thirty years, and having treated people for boils, I want to say that we know,   now, that impure blood is not the cause of boils. We know that boils are caused by microbes that come from without.  It occurs to me that this is true in everv  ar  one of these diseases we have been dis¬ cussing, of citrus and other fruit trees. They have not come up from the soil. The disease has come into the tree from other sources; in Mr. Gillette’s experi¬ ence, the inoculated knife. The old-time surgeon used to introduce more diseases than he cured by the use of his infected hands and unclean instruments.  A short time ago, I was advised by self-proclaimed experts to treat my trees with remedies applied to the soil. I know better, now. If you stop to think a mo¬ ment, you will know that these things do not go that way. The best of all germi¬ cides, the most potent, and the cheapest,, is God’s sunlight. Sunlight destroys more germs than anything else. Next comes water. Water, and then the best known germicide is pure, dry earth. These three are the strongest combination of germ-killers known.  One of the first things a grower should do, is to protect his trees by means of proper cultivation of the soil. Keep it clean. Keep the soil stirred up so that the other two agents may get at it. Let the sun and the water and the dry earth come to the relief of the diseased tree,, and they will do more than anything else I know of. The sanitarian today is a suc¬ cessful practitioner, and the sanitary grower is the most successful in treating the diseases we have been discussing. Pre¬ vention is better than cure, any time. Keep the germs away from your fruit and it will carry to market without rot¬ ting. If you can keep away from your        5i   pruning shears and budding knife, the germs that are teeming in millions, you will have cleaner and better stock. Don’t look in the wrong place. Keep things clean, keep your soil stirred, and give Na¬ ture a chance to do better work.  Mr. Gillette: These discussions are al¬ ways productive of results. We have found out something about boils. It has always been a question, it seems to me, since the dark ages, where is the best place to have boils. We have found out that we can pick the place, and all we have to do is to light on the right spot and make them come there.  Now, there is no question but that san¬ itation, applied by a physician, is a won¬ derful cure for diseases that flesh is heir to, but I am not so sure about it when ap¬ plied to an orange tree. This question of orange growing is one which stumps us all. The Doctor has advised us to open up the soil and let in the air and water and sunshine. On the other hand, go in¬ to the dense hammocks where the orange trees grow naturally and you will find no sunshine, and it seems to me the trees are in a more perfect condition than where they are cultivated.  I have found in every neighborhood, at least one man who insists on clean cul¬ tivation. He grows oranges, too, and fine ones. His next door neighbor be¬ lieves in cover crops and keeps the ground well protected from the sun, and he grows oranges, just as fine as the clean cultivation man. Another man goes still further and believes in letting the weeds have entire possession of his grove, and he succeeds, too. How these different methods all succeed stumps us, but they do.   Mr. Connor: In Professor Fawcett’s paper he has a statement in relation to pruning the trees for stem-end rot. It seems to me this is a matter of rather grave importance to the growers who have stem-end rot in their groves, to know at what time the trees should be pruned with good results. Now, pruning out the dead wood when the tree is full of fruit would not be a good thing for the tree. I would like to have the Pro¬ fessor state, for the information of all of us, what he thinks to be the best time of the year to prune for stem end rot. I am looking for all the help I can get from people who know more about it than I do.  Prof. Fawcett: The wither-tip fungus is in almost every grove in the state. Prof. Rolfs’ experiments some years ago, showed very plainly that there were two periods of the year when pruning can be most safely carried on. Those two times are in the dormant season in December and January and again in July, when the first growth of wood has somewhat hard¬ ened; and so I would say that for stem- end rot, also, we should, if possible, choose; those periods so that we will not have a possibility of withertip infection. If you prune for wither-tip when the new growth is putting out vigorously, you are liable to have some trouble with infection in this new growth.  I would say right here that December and January for some of you who hold your fruit on the trees, would be a bad time. July would be a better time.  Professor Rolfs can probably tell us more about it than anybody here.  Prof. Rolfs: While I was carrying on the work on wither-tip, we found that   5 2        January was the most effective and advan¬ tageous time. Next to that, July. When we pruned in the early part of the year, and after the tender growth had hard¬ ened, it frequently occurred that it did more harm than good. Pruning was car¬ ried on successively through the entire twelve months to establish the fact as to when we should prune for wither-tip, and the effect on the trees was much better when they were pruned in January and July than at any other time. Just why that should occur, we did not attempt to answer, as we were after results at that time, not after the theoretical informa¬ tion.  As to whether we shall prune at the same time for stem-end rot will depend upon further investigations that Prof. Fawcett is making of the life history of this fungus. If infection of the fruit takes place at a different time of the year than when these prunings occur, it may be necessary to prune a little earlier or a little later, according as to what the further line of investigation may develop.  I think we are particularly fortunate in having Prof. Fawcett report these things   to us year after year, to keep us in close touch and observation. You will see from the information you get on stem-end rot and on this gummosis, that Professor Fawcett has given us all he has in his shop, and we will have to be satisfied with that. During this coming year, he will accumulate some information and give it to us then if we want it, and I think we all want it.  Mr. Thompson: Professor Fawcett spoke of sterilizing the soil under the tree for stem-end rot. How is it done?  Prof. Fawcett: That was a small amount of soil for the experiment, and it was done by heating it up to 350 degrees. Of course, that was a small amount of soil and this method would be imprac¬ ticable for general use.  Mr. Gillette: Have you discovered stem-end rot in green oranges.  Prof. Fawcett: Yes, it occurs when the oranges or grapefruit are just begin¬ ning to color and once in a while, before then. But it takes a different form. It discolors it when the oranges are green, but when the oranges are mature, it in¬ fects with scarcely a discoloration at first.   Recent Results of Spraying Experiments for the Control of the Whitefly on Citrus   W. W. Yothens, Bureau of Entomology, Orlando.   Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  It is not my intention to recommend spraying as a panacea for the control of the whitefly, nor to recommend it in preference to other methods of con¬ trol. It is my belief that the grower should decide which method or combi¬ nation of methods is best adapted to his circumstances. I wish only to present the results obtained recently as a study, and I hope the information may be helpful to those who intend to spray and to those who have already adopted spraying as a method of control.  According to my ideas, an insecti¬ cide, to be valuable for the control of the whitefly, should be of such a na¬ ture that it can be used strong enough to kill the larvae and pupae without in¬ jury to the trees. There are many in¬ secticides which will kill the insects but which do so much damage to the tree that they cannot be used. Again, there are insecticides which harm the trees and do not kill the insects, and then there are those which neither harm the tree nor the insect. It also increases the value of the insecticide if it will loosen the sooty mold. It is my opin¬ ion, however, that the whitefly should   be so kept under control that there will be little or no sooty mold. This is an ideal condition, and the fact remains that many groves have sooty mold which should be loosened.  Then I believe also an insecticide should have stable qualities. By this I mean it should remain on the tree a considerable length of time without do¬ ing any injury. It has been a problem to get an insecticide with all the quali¬ ties which it should have and adapt it to this climate. The rains during the summer prohibit the use of many good insecticides which may be valuable in a dry, arid climate. The reverse may also be true, an insecticide adapted for rainy weather may remain too long on the trees if it is used in a country where it seldom rains.  I should also state that insecticides adapted primarily for deciduous trees may or may not be valuable for orange trees. In several instances the most popular and valuable insecticides for the San Jose Scale have proven inju¬ rious to orange trees, even when used at a strength which would not kill the larvae and pupae of the whitefly.  Last fall we began compounding an        insecticide which would answer all these purposes. We compounded twenty-one formulae and proceeded very cautiously to test them. It is our custom to make the test at first on a single branch and note the injurious effect if any, and also determine the percentage of killed insects. This may eliminate a great many of the formulae. Then we would spray one-half of a tree with the varying strengths of those formulae not eliminated by the first test and again note the injury, if any, and determine the percentage of insects killed. After this we sprayed about twenty trees each with the more prom¬ ising and simple formulae.  In the "Florida Grower,” under date March 31 and April 28, appeared an ar¬ ticle by the writer and Mr. S. S. Cross- man, from which I will quote:  "These four formulae are selected from twenty-one, as being the easiest to make, and most effective in result. We do not claim entire originality for formulae I and II, but so far as we know. III and IV are original with us. So far as we know, no formulae for making an emulsion of heavy paraffine oil for use in spraying orange trees has been given heretofore.  formula 1.  Caustic potash whale oil soap, i l / 2 gals. Crude oil (not distillate oil)  24 degrees Baume. 3 gals.  Water to emulsify about.... i l / 2 gals.  This will make about 200 gallons of spray material containing 1 y 2 per cent, of oil. Cost about 63 cents.   FORMULA II.  Caustic potash whale oil soap. .2 gals. Distillate oil (gas oil) 30 degrees   Baume.4 gals.  Water to emulsify about.2 gals.   This will make 200 gallons of spray material counting 2 per cent, of oil. Cost about 84 cents.  FORMULA III.  Caustic potash whale oil soap. .2 gals.

Caustic potash whale oil soap. .2 gals. Paraffine oil (Junior Red En¬ gine oil), 25 degrees Baume. .3 gals. Water.1 gal.  This will make 200 gallons of spray material, containing \y 2 per cent of oil. Cost about $1.05.  PREPARATION.  The only precaution to be taken in the proper preparation is that the oil should be added to the soap gradually, while this is being stirred. It does not work so well to add the soap to the oil or to add the oil to the soap too sud¬ denly. This operation should require about a minute, when the water may            be added. A perfect emulsion should follow this procedure. To determine this, put a little of the mixture in a glass of water. If free oil is floating on the surface the mixture is not perfect, and the stirring should be continued, or more soap or water should be added. We have never had any trouble in more than one hundred times we have made these according to the above proced¬ ure.  It is our custom to pour the soap and oil into the 200-gallon spray tank and start the agitator which thoroughly mixes the oil and soap in about a min¬ ute. We then fill the tank, leaving the agitator running until this work is com¬ pleted. This usually requires ten min¬ utes, i. e., about ten minutes to make the spray material and to load.  These formulae can be made up with one-half the quantity of soap given above by using a pump to produce an aerated condition of the mixture, which is an emulsion. If this is done they may be stored in a tank, but thorough stir¬ ring is necessary before using, as the oil settles to the bottom in the course of a few days. The power sprayer may be used for this purpose, spraying the mixture out through the nozzles into   the tank. As to whether they should be made this way or according to the preceding, the grower must decide for himself. Although this method has not been extensively used by us, our ex¬ periments showed no injury to the twenty trees sprayed with these aer¬ ated emulsions. We believe the risk is some greater, however, than when the formulate are used. The fact that the expense is much less should make this method appeal to the growers.”  Since the above was written we use the same proportions of soap in III and IV as in I and II, or half as much soap by measure as oil. This gives equal satisfaction, as when more soap is used and it is considerably cheaper.  The results of the spraying experi¬ ments with these formulae are given. These were conducted in a small grove having a heavy infestation of the white- fly and the sooty mold was thick on the leaves. The material was applied with a power sprayer at 175 pounds pressure and the water was pumped from an open well by means of a rotary pump. The work was done January 16, and the examinations made January 30, 1911. The following is a summary of the results:   FORMULA.  Per Cent, of Oil.  Dilution  Approx  No. of Trees Sprayed.

The low mortality where the rosin oil was added to the distillate was due no doubt to the imperfect spraying. No injury was done to a single tree, even when two per cent, of oil was used. They also show that one and a half per cent of either petro¬ leum oil or the paraffine oils and two per cent, of distillate oil is sufficient. In the load where one-sixth of one per cent, of rosin oil was added, more leaves fell than from adjoining trees sprayed with the same material with the rosin oil left out. We do not think rosin oil should be added to the emul¬ sion. If it is added, it should be a very small amount; not more than a pint to the quantity of emulsion required for 200 gallons of spray material. Formu¬ lae I and II did not loosen the sooty mold to any great extent, and neither did they have the stable qualities that were possessed by the paraffine oils.   The paraffine oils loosened the sooty mold perfectly. It would appear that these emulsions, particularly the par¬ affine oil emulsions, answer all the re¬ quirements of a good insecticide for the control of the whitefly.  In order to test these emulsions and several other insecticides on the young stages of the whitefly larvae we sprayed a small grove March 30 and 31. The insects were mostly in the second larval or instar stage, and so far as I could determine all the eggs had hatched. The sooty mold was abundant. The materials were applied as during the winter, with a power sprayer at 175 pounds pressure. The examinations were made April 18, and the leaves selected for this purpose were those which were in such a posi¬ tion as to have been most liable to have been hit by the spray.  The following is a summary of the results:   RESULTS OF SPRAYING EXPERIMENTS ON THE YOUNG STAGES OF THE WHITEFLY.   INSECTICIDE OR FORMULA.   I Petroleum Fuel Oil, 240 Baume.

The low mortality obtained by the petroleum fuel oil was due, I think to the imper¬ fect spraying. I had two inexperienced men and we started our work with that insecticide. It may be that since they were new at the work they did not do it so effectively as later when the other materials • were applied. The results with commercial lime sulphur are grat¬ ifying. The two brands were of the same specific gravity. It would appear that this efficient insecticide for San Jose Scale can be recommended for spraying when the fly is in the young stages. In our other experiments on the pupae we have not been able to get satisfactory results.  It is very interesting to me to find that kerosene emulsion, made after the Hubbard formulae and used at 1-30 or 2 per cent, of oil, killed only 71 per cent, of the insects. It had been my idea that since 4 to 5 per cent, had been found by Mr. Hubbard to kill the pur¬ ple scale, that 2 per cent, would surely be strong enough to kill the young stages of the whitefly. I believe that the temperature at the time the mate¬ rial is applied to the tree is important when kerosene emulsion is used. I have examined Mr. Hubbard’s records and find that all his results were ob¬ tained in winter, when the temperature was perhaps not sufficiently great to cause the kerosene to evaporate before the insects were killed, while the above   experiments were carried on in March, when it was quite warm. Of course, if it had been used twice as strong, better results would have been obtained, but it seems to me 2 per cent, should have produced a greater killing than was obtained.  It will be noticed that Formula IV used at 1-100, or one-half of 1 per cent, of oil, killed 84 per cent. This was used as a check on the same strength to which nicotine sulphate at the rate of 1-320 was added. The material when the nicotine was added killed 97 per cent. The nicotine was very vola¬ tile and applied at some inconvenience. It caused us to cough and was so strong that it affected our eyes. Ap¬ parently this is a promising field for future work. As yet I have never ex¬ perimented with the new tobacco pro¬ duct, “black leaf 40.” I understand it is many times stronger or concentrated than the nicotine sulphate, and is non¬ volatile, which perhaps would not only eliminate the inconvenience of apply¬ ing it, but which would make it remain longer on the tree than the nicotine sulphate.  The petroleum fuel oil and the dis¬ tillate oil emulsions do not seem to have any immediate effect upon the loosening of the sooty mold. The par¬ affine oil emulsions loosened the sooty mold perfectly.  In order to determine if any injury followed the application of any of these insecticides, I watched the grove care¬ fully for some days. I decided that no apparent injury had been done even to       the latest growth. A few of the old leaves had fallen, but I do not think that is a serious objection. About two weeks after the spraying had been done I visited this grove and I thought that all those trees which were sprayed with the oils—both with the formulae and proprietary articles—had leaves of a slightly lighter shade of green than those sprayed with lime sulphur and kerosene emulsion, and also those sprayed with i per cent of IV had leaves of a lighter shade of green than those where one-half of i per cent, had been used. I was unable to see any difference in the effect on the leaves where distillate, a light oil, had been applied, and where the heavy paraffine oil, Junior Red Engine oil, had been used. This was very discouraging. I thought at the time that the application of any oil to the tree might so interfere with the functions of the leaves as to make it necessary to abandon our recommendations. I called the atten¬ tion of several growers, and they did not seem to think the difference in color was anything serious. About a month after the spraying I visited the grove and am glad to say that this difference has almost entirely disap¬ peared. At present I do not know whether continued application of any of these oils, that is, several times dur¬ ing the same year, will be injurious. I would advise considerable caution, however, in this matter.  No doubt it will be of interest to the orange growers to learn of the spray¬ ing of a large grove with one of these   paraffine oils. This grove was sprayed with Formula IV, 1-50 or 1 per cent, of oil. The insects were in the young stages—mostly second instar or larval stage. The grove consisted of 2,600 large seedlings and 1,600 three-year- old budded trees, and these were sprayed with two machines in 16 days, from April 3 to April 20. It was a good day’s work for one machine to spray 115 large seedlings, but 600 or 700 of the small budded trees could be sprayed in a day with one machine. The insec¬ ticide cost, including freight, $135.00. The total cost was $409.00, or 9 7-10 cents per tree. It took about the same amount of spray material for 75 bud¬ ded trees as it did for 16 of the seed¬ lings. If this is taken into considera¬ tion the price per tree would be about 13 1-2 cents. The trees required 32,250 gallons, averaging 8.4 gallons per tree. The seedlings averaged about 13 gal¬ lons each. At the present time the sooty mold is pretty well loosened up, and after one or two good rains I think the grove will be entirely free. I made a hasty examination to determine the percentage of insects killed and found it to be approximately 95 per cent. It is the intention to spray this grove again after the third brood of flies dis¬ appears.  This brings up the subject of how often to spray. Of course, it is gener¬ ally understood that the killing of 95 or 96 per cent, of the fly once during the year does not mean so much, after all. Especially is this true if done early in the spring or summer. They come       back in a very short time. The groves which we sprayed will, I think, be black with sooty mold in October or Novem¬ ber if nothing more is done to them to kill out the fly. It is the third brood of flies which cause most of the blacken¬ ing and damage. Consequently, if noth¬ ing further is done to these groves the only value we have had from the year’s work is to find out that we can clean up the grove in the spring of the year. I hope to show that one more spraying of these groves during the latter part of the year will keep them practically free from whitefly. Our experiments last summer showed that if a grove is sprayed in April it remains very nearly free of whitefly until along about the middle of August or first of September, or until after the third brood; conse¬ quently, I believe that if these groves are given the second spraying as early as possible after the third brood they will remain clean throughout the year.  I would also state at this time that our experiments show that phenol should be left out of proprietary arti¬ cles. It does not increase the value of an insecticide in the least. When an insecticide containing 69 per cent, of phenol was used at the rate of 1-75, it killed only 28 per cent, of the larvae and pupae of the whitefly. “Messrs. C. T. McClintock, E. M. Houghton and H. C. Hamilton” published a paper in the proceedings of the Seventh Inter¬ national Zoological Congress, in which occurs the following statement: “To be specific, the insecticide properties appear to be neutralized by the pres¬   ence of carbolic acid or any member of the phenols series; and the value is lowered to that of the particular phe¬ nols which may be present, although they constitute less than 10 per cent, of the whole. An oil containing 8 per cent of phenols and whose greatest in¬ secticidal value is five times that of carbolic acid may have that value in¬ creased to one hundred and twenty-five by the removal of the phenols.”  Our experiments also show that rosin oil, sulphuric acid, and what I would call, for want of better knowl¬ edge, free caustic, should be left out of those proprietary articles intended to be used on orange trees.  DISCUSSION.  Mr.-: What effect have these  solutions on the fungus ?  Mr. Mothers: These formulae have only been introduced recently, and I have never made an examination fol¬ lowing the treatment. I do not know whether they will do any damage to the fungus or not. I expect they will kill the fungus out, in so far as they kill out the fly.  I have had good results in spraying with these solutions, but I am not ad¬ vocating that everybody shall buy a spraying machine, and spray their groves. They must decide those things for themselves. The only object I had in entering upon this insecticide work was to get a cheap insecticide, so that if a man wanted to spray he could do so without excessive cost, and also to    6o        give a formula so that the government will have something to recommend, the composition of which might be made public. I do not say that good results cannot be had with proprietary insecti¬ cides; some of our best results have been obtained with these proprietary articles. Heretofore these proprietary insecticides have been recommended to be used at too great a strength. I cer¬ tainly would not apply them in the summer time any stronger than i per cent., the same as I have these formu¬ lae mentioned—one per cent, of their oil contents. In the winter time I ■would apply them about the same as I have these formulae—about i 1-4 or 1 1-2 per cent.  Mr. Thompson: It has been stated that after a grove has been fumigated that it will be free from fly for possibly two years, although there may be groves around it infected. Is that true?  Mr. Yothers: Experiments show that unless a grove is almost com¬ pletely isolated, it does not remain free from fly very long. I do not think a statement like that can be substan¬ tiated. The fumigation cleans the grove of nearly all the insects, including scale insects, and it leaves the tree in the very best of condition. Apparently it puts on an extra growth, but the fly increases so rapidly, that when the third brood appears, in August, espe¬ cially where it comes from neighboring groves, the fumigated grove has been badly re-infested in August or Septem¬ ber. Where there is a very bad infes¬ tation of the fly, the killing out of 95 per cent, at one treatment does not   seem to be very satisfactory. It is the third brood, which appears in August, which blacks up the trees, and the time elapsing from winter until August gives the fly ample opportunity to re¬ produce.  There was one grove fumigated by the Tangerine Citrus Association which was completely isolated. There were, at the time of fumigation, about thirty or forty live pupae per leaf. Last October there was one pupae to an av¬ erage of four leaves. Since then I have not made an examination, but, judging from what I know about multiplication of the insects, I am inclined to believe that this crop will also be free from fly. In this grove there was 99 4-10 killed.  Mr. Skinner: I had an experience of that kind with fumigation. I fumigated the grove, and it seemed to be pretty clean, but my neighbor had a grove across the fence that was also infested with fly, and the result of it was that the flies left his grove and came over on my trees.  Mr. Yothers: This may be one great advantage in spraying. It does not cost so much as fumigation, and it can be done in August, September or Octo¬ ber.  There is another thing which I very nearly forgot. At the present time I do not know if these emulsions of par¬ affine oil can be sprayed on the fruit a short time before it is going to be mar¬ keted. They stick pretty well and I do not know whether they can be washed off or not, and consequently I feel if the spraying is done as early as pos-       sible, there will be no risk from that source. I hope to spray some grove this fall, late, and determine this point. Some grower may do that himself.  Mr. Temple: I would like to ask Mr. Yothers, and also Dr. Berger, if he is here, as to the latest opinion as to what percentage, or in what multi¬ plication each brood of whitefly in¬ creases over the parent brood; that is to say, originally we were informed that each brood of the whitefly was multiplied in the next brood by two hundred. In other words, the female laid two hundred eggs. That was aft¬ erwards cut down until the latest they were figuring on was a multiplication of twenty-five to one in each brood, and that there was at least four well- defined broods, and two scattering broods, with an average of about five to one. What is the multiplication, and what power have you raised it to?  Mr. Yothers: So far as I know, we note only three well-defined broods in Orlando. Of course there are adults all the time that are laying eggs inter¬ mittently. This year there will be adults from the first of June until prob¬ ably the first of September. I think we have it about right when we say each female lays from 150 to 200 eggs, but nearly all of these die before ma¬ turity. I should say about twenty-five reach maturity.  Because the fly does increase so enormously is the reason why I stated it does not mean very much to kill 95 or 96 per cent, where there is a bad infestation. Consequently, I predict all these groves we have sprayed, if   nothing more is done, in September or October will be just as black as though they had not been sprayed. This is rather a sweeping statement. They may not be so bad, but I feel that they will. Consequently, if anybody expects to spray I do not see how they could get along without two sprayings, es¬ pecially if one is done in winter or early spring. They might get along with one spraying done late in the summer.  Mr. Temple: Your Orlando figures show about twenty-five raised to the third power. That is a good many from one fly.  It seems to me the most excellent agent for the extermination of the whitefly is some spraying material that will remain effective for three or four months on the leaves and during that time will be working towards the ex¬ termination of the fly. The great trou¬ ble with fumigation is that unless you kill 100 per cent, of the fly, you might just as well let it alone, because, with twenty-five raised to the third power, if you kill 99.9 per cent, with fumiga¬ tion, with that one-tenth left alive, and multiplied to that extent, you are go¬ ing to be worse off in the fall than you were in the spring.  One of my groves was fumigated in February, and it was the smuttiest grove I had in the fall. While we were supposed to have killed ninety-nine and a fraction, that little fraction, owing to its rapid multiplication, gave us more fly in the fall than we had in Feb¬ ruary.  Mr. Yothers: I do not think, Mr. Temple, that you can ascribe the entire       re-infestation of the grove in question from the fly left alive after the fumiga¬ tion. My figures will show that the grove would not have been black if flies from the neighboring grove had not entered, but the figures do show that all the trees which bordered your other grove became heavily infested with the first brood. In fact, they were more heavily infested with the last brood than the other trees. I can prove that a great many flies came from your other grove.  I would like to bring out again the fact of the great difficulty in finding an oil or spray which would have perma¬ nent qualities and yet not injure the trees, and I think we have solved that in this paraffine oil emulsion. I feel confident now, if they are used in the proper way; that is, not twice or three times as strong as they are recom¬ mended, but erring, if anything, on the weaker side, that you people will not have any trouble. This grove which was sprayed last January, where these Nos. Ill and IV were used, show evidences yet of the oil, and apparently has not suffered any damage.  Mr. Thompson: The reason I brought up the question as regards the fumigation, is because it has been stated down our way that the influence of the fumigation would remain with us for two years and the trees would not be infested. I could not believe it.  Mr. Yothers: The only data I have to substantiate this is the grove I men¬ tioned as being completely isolated.   Mr.-: It seems to me a fumi¬  gation every third winter will keep a grove in very good shape.  Mr. Yothers: If the fly is very scarce, it does much more good to fumigate or spray than it does where the fly is abundant, because, some way or other, I cannot explain why, fumiga¬ tion kills only about 99 per cent. Doubtless there is some reason which we are unable to explain. It does not make any difference whether there are 600 insects on a leaf, or only two or three, there always seems to be some escape. I remember in one instance I counted 600 insects which had been killed on one leaf, and right in the cen¬ ter of the leaf was one live fly. I can¬ not explain why that insect was not killed.  Dr. Berger: I wish to make a few more remarks on the whitefly. The gentleman is still with us and, of course, is a very live subject, as some of you are experi¬ encing. I have done a little figuring, and shall also make a few remarks about the treatment of the mites.  The whitefly, without any treatment, would probably cut the orange crop in half, or nearly so. We will assume for the sake of calculation that it does cut it in half. Suppose we assume the basis of our crop to be six million boxes per year. If the whitefly cuts this in half, we will have a crop of three million boxes.  We find that the fungus diseases in¬ crease the crop one million boxes per year, which, at a dollar a box, is $1,000,000 saved. The fungi probably save us a mil¬ lion dollars per year. This leaves two million boxes a year to work for by        spreading fungus and spraying. We will assume they are worth $2,000,000. You see the proposition; there is apparently still a loss to the state of $2,000,000. Can we save it? By diligent spreading of the fungus we can probably save somewhat more than one-third of it and, of course, as the fungus becomes spread to the sec¬ tions where there is no fungus, it means a saving of perhaps a third to those sec¬ tions.  We have found that by judicious spray¬ ing, or fumigation, the whitefly can be all but eradicated. Fumigation will kill 999 out of every 1000. Thorough spraying might be made to do nearly the same.  Suppose the cost of spraying per tree to control the whitefly costs 5 cents per box. To save yourself two million boxes, then, would cost $100,000.00. Suppose it costs 10 cents a box. Is it worth $200,- 000 to save $2,000,000.00?  Just a few words on the mites:  I have been receiving letters and specimens from the western and southern parts of the state, which indi¬ cate that there is going to be, or is, an epidemic of one of the mites, namely the six-spotted mite. The remedy is sul¬ phur in some form. The best remedy, the one most generally used, is the soda- sulphur solution—most of you know it— using it at the rate of about a gallon to fifty gallons of water.  This six-spotted mite is a serious prop¬ osition. Some of the letters state that the leaves are shedding by the bushel. That is serious; something should be done at once.  I have not heard so much complaint, or, perhaps, no special complaint about the purple mite. I have seen some groves,   however, where the purple mite is very abundant, but the injury is not so severe as that caused by the red spider. I have not heard of the rust mite, but it will no doubt be moving on to the fruit and let¬ ting us know that it is still with us.  If you have to spray for red spider or purple mites, you may put the soda-sul¬ phur solution into almost any solution you have to apply for whitefly or scale. You may mix it with Whale Oil Soap, Mr. Yothers’ Formula 4, Target Brand, and Schnarr’s Insecticide. You cannot mix the sulphur-lime solution with these. Lime in solution, is incompatible with al¬ most anything that has soap in it.  Mr. Thompson: Last year I said something about using a flour paste and sulphur without using any caustic soda, and I have had good results for two or three years. But last year, in order to make a short cut, I mixed up my solution with soda in the latter part of the year, and the result has been that I had more scale since that spraying was done than I had for the last five years. I never had it before; I do not spray for the scale; I let the fungi take care of that. Now, do you think the soda killed the fungus that destroyed the scale?  Dr. Berger: We occasionally get re¬ ports of that kind. On the other hand, other growers find soda-sulphur, even the lime-sulphur solution does not interfere with the natural agencies. Possibly you sprayed when the fungi were in the most susceptible condition, and the fact that the soda-sulphur solution is a strong in¬ secticide may account for your experi¬ ence.  Mr. Blackman: The question of scale brought to the orange growers of the So-       ciety a great many troubles and tribula¬ tions. I have had some experience along this line, and the only remedy I use for scale is a Washing Powder; the kind that tells you how to clean. I have used it for the last four or five years, and I think I am safe in saying that if you go in my grove and find a scale there I will give you a dollar apiece for each one you find in there. The question that has come to   me so often by people who are growing orange trees is, “How shall I get rid of the scale?” My answer is, “Use Fair- bank’s Washing Powder and spray about four times a year, and you will have no scale in your grove, and your grove will be just what you want.” I have five or six groves of which I have charge, and the people who own those groves have been perfectly satisfied.   Preparing Citrus Fruits for Market  William Chase Temple.   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen :  “Preparing Citrus Fruits for Market” reminds one very much of the famous old English recipe “How to Cook Hare,” which begins: “First catch your hare.” Preparing citrus fruit for market comes very much under this category; you must begin by getting your fruit, as to properly prepare citrus fruit for consumption be¬ gins with the planting of the seed that produces the tree which produces the fruit you wish to market, and while this paper will deal mainly with the handling of the ripened fruit from the tree to the cars which will take it to market, nevertheless, just as important as any of the steps de¬ tailed here are those preliminary steps in raising healthy stock, selection of proper varieties, caring for the young trees, and producing finally fruit that is fit in every way.  When the Florida Citrus Exchange was organized the incorporators realized that in order to make the Florida orange come into its own there was something more necessary than even the splendid selling and distributing agency just form¬ ed. „ I had spent the three previous years in California, and had watched with close attention and great interest, not only the splendid marketing methods followed by the California growers, but also their manner of properly preparing fruit for market.  I first observed the orange business in Florida in the seventies, and remember   well the time when Florida oranges were simply pulled from the trees, thrown into second-hand flour barrels, unwrapped, the barrel headed up, and shipped to market by local freight, requiring from twelve to fifteen days for delivery. When I visit¬ ed the California houses and saw what was being done there in the matter of careful picking, sorting and hauling fruit to the packing houses on wagons with springs it was a revelation to me. The result of my studies and observations was that I decided that if Florida wished to compete with California for the citrus fruit market, then Florida must prepare her fruit for the market as well as Cali¬ fornia did.  Returning to Florida I endeavored to get the growers to realize the necessity of carefully culling, handling, and honest¬ ly packing their fruit. Most of them were perfectly indifferent in this matter that seemed so essential. After vainly endeavoring to enlist the sympathy and financial support of other growers in the matter, I finally decided that if the Flori¬ da growers were ever to be taught to put their fruit into market properly they must have it demonstrated to them with their own fruit that the careful methods would pay in hard dollars. The citing of what California had done in getting higher prices for their inferior fruit; the show of the returns made the northwest apple growers, which enabled them to obtain four times as much money per bushel for        their apples as was received for the best apples grown in New York State, due entirely to* the careful culling, handling, grading and packing of their apples had no effect on the Florida grower of citrus fruits, who said that he was not shipping apples.  I then determined to endeavor to dem¬ onstrate to our growers that the only reason Florida oranges were selling for less money than California’s, when every one knew that Florida raised the better fruit was because the Florida oranges were improperly prepared for the market.  We then began planning for the best equipped packing house in the world by sending to California for the man who held the record in that State for sound delivery of fruit in the market, and had him come to Florida and lay out and equip in accordance with the most modern and up-to-date California methods, the Winter Park packing house. This man, Mr. R. S. Thompson, of Highland, Cali¬ fornia, held the record of having deliver¬ ed all the fruit from his packing house at destination for three solid years, with an average decay of less than one-quarter of one per cent.  When the house was finally finished and running Mr. Thompson insisted that the method of picking and handling the fruit in the groves must be equal, at least, to the very best California practice.  A picking crew should consist of twenty-one men; sixteen pickers, four in¬ spectors and a foreman. All the pickers and inspectors were obliged to wear white gloves while at work. The pickers were carefully instructed at the beginning that while the oranges were to be clipped close to the fruit, so that no long stems would   be left, they were not to cut them close enough to injure the orange in the clip¬ ping, and all stems must be cut square across and never pointed. No picker was allowed to empty the oranges from his picking basket into the field crates. The picking baskets were of rattan wicker¬ work, lined with white canvas, which lining did not quite reach to the bottom of the basket. This prevents any possi¬ bility of bruising the oranges by coming in contact with the basket and the rattan is puncture-proof from the thorns on the orange trees. As soon as a picker fills his basket he carries it to the nearest field box and stands it along side of the field box. For each gang of four pickers there was an inspector whose duty it was to take the oranges from the picking basket, one by one, and examine each carefully before placing it in the field crate. The inspectors were furnished with books of blank forms which had spaces for entering the date of the pick¬ ing, the name of the grove in which the fruit was picked, the name of the owner of the grove, the name of the picker, a blank line for the clipper cut oranges found in the picker’s basket, another line for long stems found on oranges, and r finally, the signature of the inspector. Every orange that the inspector would find in the picker’s basket that was faulty in any respect, he would either cull in the grove, or if it had a long stem he would reclip it and enter on the ticket the total number of such imperfections found. When he had filled the field crate he would detach this ticket from his book and place it in the crate, in which it would go to the packing house. The field fore¬ man would of course keep a general over-    No.   i—General View of Willcardo Fruit   the Packing- Company.   Room.                No. 2—First Culling Table.

Willcardo Fruit Company.                        sight over his inspectors and pickers, and would watch closely to see that they were handling the fruit in accordance with the rules. In addition to this there was a general chief inspector, not attached to any gang or picking crew, whose business it was to go from grove to grove, appear¬ ing at the most unexpected and some¬ times inopportune times, to check up the work of the gangs. This chief inspector would go to three or four field crates that were ready for hauling and examine the oranges one by one to see if any mistake had been made by the inspector whose ticket was in the box. The box thus in¬ spected and tagged was then loaded on wagons, every one of which was equip¬ ped with springs, the load covered with tarpaulins to protect the fruit from weather, and hauled to the packing house.  As soon as possible after the boxes were received at the packing house each box was emptied on a grading table, along which the oranges would roll. In¬ spectors were placed at this grading table, and they examined every orange as it went by them, while the checking clerk would hold in his hand the ticket which came from the box of oranges which was passing the inspectors. If one of these inspectors found an orange that was clip¬ per cut, creased, long or sharp stem, punctured, or in any way defective, he would call out whatever the defect was, and the checking clerk would promptly mark in its proper place on the ticket the defect so announced. As soon as the box of fruit had rolled by, the ticket accom¬ panying it would be put on file, which went to the office and was duly entered on the record, showing either for or against the inspector and picker hand¬ ling it.   After the inspection the oranges rolled to the soaking tank, into which they were emptied. The fruit all floats on the sur¬ face of crystal-clear water, brought up from one hundred and sixty feet below the rock. This soaking tank serves two purposes—first, it prepares the oranges perfectly for the washing machines; secondly, it enables the tank inspector to cull out any light fruit, the rule being that any orange which shows to exceed one-eighth of its diameter above the water should be culled from the tank, while floating to the washing machines. It may be remarked in passing that this would be a very dangerous test for Cali¬ fornia fruit, as it would cause the culling of by far the most of the stuff they ship, while with the Florida fruit less than one per cent is culled for this cause, and much of the Florida fruit does not float at all, but sinks.  When the fruit reaches the end of the soaking tank it is taken from the tank and fed automatically to the washing ma¬ chines, where the oranges are gently scrubbed with soft fibre brushes, while dozens of tiny sprays of clear cold water play on the oranges during the entire pro¬ cess of washing. These washing ma¬ chines are each capable of washing five cars of fruit a day.  From the washing machine the fruit is automatically deposited on a carrier belt, which delivers it to the drying machine. Experience has demonstrated that in this house oranges can be perfectly dried in four minutes, in ordinary weather. When the humidity is very high on the outside, say from 95 to 100 per cent, the fruit is a little longer dry¬ ing. It has been demonstrated, however,       that on foggy, rainy days the fruit is per¬ fectly dry within seven minutes after it enters the drier.  After leaving the drier the fruit is au¬ tomatically delivered to the grading belts. These are wide white canvas belts which carry the fruit slowly by the men who grade the fruit in accordance with the house practice.  The matter of the number and kind of grades that you will use is an important one, and one which should be given ser¬ ious consideration by the State as a whole. In California they used to grade Extra Fancy, Fancy, Extra Choice, Choice and Standard—five grades. At the present time most of the progressive growers there grade Extra Fancy, Fancy, Choice and Standard; while a great many are grading Fancy, Choice and Standard only, combining the old Extra Fancy into the merely Fancy grade, and the Extra Choice and Choice into the Choice, the Standard remaining as it always was in each case, merely a shipping Cull.  The Winter Park house started out by abandoning altogether a true shipping cull grade, and ran three brands, the Angel, Bull-Dog and Camel, the Angel being the equivalent of Fancy, the Bull- Dog the equivalent of Choice and the Camel the equivalent of Standard.  The National Orange Company of California, one of the most progressive producers in the State, have cut their grades down to two, their first grade be¬ ing “Orchard Run, which they so brand¬ ed, and the second grade being “Stand¬ ard, ” which they so branded. In this way they only have two grades, and in run¬ ning their fruit over the grading belts on their first selection they take out only the   rank culls, which go to the cull heap, as usual. Their second selection is to take out everything that is not really first class, and ship it as a Standard, leaving all the rest of their product to go under the “Orchard Run” or “Run of the Grove,” as we call it in Florida, meaning just what it says—everything regardless of color or texture.  At the Winter Park house we tried this method in the present season. We have only shipped a few boxes of the Angel brand (just sufficient to keep our trade-mark alive), for two reasons—in the first place, so that we might make this experiment, and, in the second place, be¬ cause there were not to exceed ioo boxes in the whole Winter Park crop this year high enough in class to ship under the Angel grade; so we took our regular Bull Dog grade and ran into it all the oranges that really graded above that grade, making of the Bull Dog a “Run of the Grove” grade for the year.  On the other hand, oranges that would naturally run into the Bull Dog grade under a shade of doubt we # dropped into our Camel brand, thereby bringing that grade up a little ; and the result has been somewhat astonishing, in that there has seldom been a difference of more than 20 cents a box between the Bull Dog and Camel grades, and, in many instances, the Camel grade has sold for more money than the Bull Dog grade.  I am of the opinion that if a house wants to ship everything that is really shipable—and by that I mean, every or¬ ange that you are reasonably certain will carry sound to destination—you should run four grades, and this is based on my experience in trying it both ways.          The first grade to be an orange that is thin-skinned, heavy, full of juice, perfect¬ ly matured, and an orange that you can be absolutely proud of—in reality an Extra Fancy.  Your second grade to be exactly the same kind of an orange, except that the skin may be imperfect in color, but in all other respects to be equal to your first grade  The third grade shall be perfectly sound, sweety juicy, but the skin may be rough or thick, scarred, or the orange ill¬ shaped and blemished to almost any ex¬ tent, either in color or texture.  Your fourth grade to be an orange whose only redeeming feature is that it will carry sound to destination.  Another thing, I am convinced that it is a mistake to put these grades under different brands—it is far better to use the same brand all the way through, and designate your different grades by dif¬ ferent colors—for instance, in the Winter Park house we have abandoned the use of the Angel, Bull Dog and Camel brands, using the “Three Feathers’’ trade mark for all of our grades. Our first grade is known as the “Blue Feathers,” the second grade as the “Red Feathers,” the third grade as the “Green Feathers,” and the fourth grade as the “Black Feath¬ ers.”  The trade mark and lettering is exactly the same in the brand on all of these grades, and the printed wrap is the same on all of them, but the printing on the heads of the boxes is of a color corres¬ ponding to the grade of fruit inside, and the trade almost immediately learns to distinguish and remember this difference, and buys accordingly.   If the orange growers all over Flor¬ ida would establish this classification by color in grades (and many of them are already doing it, as it was not original with us) it would help a great deal in the general markets by enabling the buyers to distinguish immediately by the color just what grade he was buying.  But, to return to our packing-house work—  Each grader is taught to look for two kinds of fruit only, one being the particu¬ lar grade which he is selecting, and the other a cull. Every one in the house, from the receiving room to the packer, is taught to look for culls. There is painted very prominently a sign, “Every Doubt¬ ful Orange is a Cull.”  Directly in front of the graders, and beyond the grading belt is the “grade belt,” corresponding to the grade for that section of the belt, while another belt leads outside the building on which are placed the culls. The number of graders will vary with the speed at which the fruit is running through the house. In general practice it requires about two graders for each car of fruit being packed per day. If a grader is grading for, say the “Red Feathers” brand, his eyes are steadily fixed on the fruit approaching him, and when he sees an orange that fits his grade he removes it from the grading belt, with a white gloved hand, and places it on the belt leading to the sizing machine, at which that grade is being- packed. He pays no attention to any other grades, such as the “Blue Feath¬ ers,” or “Green Feathers,” or any other but is looking only for his grade and for culls. If he sees a cull he picks it from the grading belt and puts it on the cull       belt. The same process is repeated fifteen or twenty feet further, where the “Blue Feathers'’ grade are being selected. These separate grade belts, as before stated, each leads directly to a sizing machine handling its particular grade. At the head of each of these machines there stands another inspector, under whose eyes and through whose whitegloved hands every piece of fruit leading to that sizing machine must pass. It is the duty of this foreman of the sizing machine to reject any fruit that may come to him that is improperly graded, and to also look carefully for culls or defective fruit.  After the fruit passes through this in¬ spection it runs through the sizing- machine, by which it is delivered to its proper bin. From these bins it is packed into boxes corresponding with its grade, and is then nailed up and loaded into the cars, every car being most carefully and thoroughly stripped in the California fashion.  It will thus be seen that any cull orange that leaves the Winter Park packing house, except as such, has fooled a small army of people. For instance, it must have escaped the picker, who was looking for it, the picking inspector, who was looking for it, the inspector at the soak¬ ing tank, the grader at the main grading belt, the sizing foreman, and the packers. Seven times each piece of fruit packed under the Winter Park brands has been carefully scrutinized to find if there was anything wrong about it, and in each of these seven operations the person examin¬ ing it is under positive instructions that “Every Doubtful Orange is a Cull.”  All are interested, of course, in the cost of operating in this way. We find that   it costs us about three cents a box more to pick oranges in the way that we pick them, and we find that the paper such as we wish to use costs about two cents a box more than the ordinary, and our boxes themselves, which are furnished by the Overstreet Crate Company under the trade name “Willcardo Type Box,” costs us about two cents a box more than the ordinary box This box has no sharp corners, or rough edges that can mar the fruit, even the heads at the top, and the middle section at the top are planed off to a rounded edge, and the sides of the box are all rounded—but we find it pays.  A packing house can be built and equipped as the present Winter Park house is for about $20,000, having a ca¬ pacity of four cars of fruit a day—this includes everything complete.  As to the cost per box, this depends mainly on how much fruit you are pack¬ ing, for instance, based for a whole year at the Winter Park house, shows that aside from the cost of boxes and the paper, it costs from the time the oranges are driven up in wagons and delivered to the hc>use until the loaded car leaves the house, 12^2 cents per box, plus $175 a week. Now, this would mean with the shipment of only 1,000 boxes a week, $125, plus $175, or $300, which means 30 cents a box, exclusive of paper and boxes. On the other hand, if we ship 6,000 a week it only means $750, plus $175, or $925, which means 15*^ cents per box, plus the cost of boxes and paper —so that on a basis of 6,000 boxes a week the total cost of receiving, trucking, washing, drying, packing, putting insert cards in the boxes, nailing up, tallying, loading, stripping, foreman, bookkeeping,        7i   etc., would amount to 15 y 2 cents per box to put up a grade and pack that has dem¬ onstrated by the markets of this year will sell for 40 to 50 cents a box above the market for similar fruit, at all times.  Now, the supreme test of any propo¬ sition like this is, does it pay? The markets carry their own answer to this question. When the Winter Park Asso¬ ciation began shipping its fruit in Dec¬ ember, 1909, under its standard Associ¬ ation brands of “Angel,” “Bull-Dog” and “Camel,” it received no preference in price. By the middle of January these three brands were leading the markets by from 40 to 60 cents a box, for fruit of their class.  I am pleased to state that the result of the operation of this “Model” packing house during the season of 1909-10, dem¬ onstrated to a sufficient number of the progressive growers in the State of Flor¬ ida that the only way to prepare citrus fruits for market was the Right Way, and to-day the nine associations compris¬ ing the Orange County Citrus Exchange have, with only one exception, remodeled their packing houses, have put in wash¬ ing machines, drying machinery, grading belts, and have gone so far towards per¬ fecting their handling of the fruit that the Orange County packs will average at least 50 per cent better than the preced¬ ing season.  The Tampa Citrus Growers’ Associa¬ tion have also built a model packing house, with a capacity of four cars of fruit a day, that is designed and operated in a way to produce the equal in every respect of the Winter Park pack; and the house is in charge of Mr. Bert Morrill, who is the manager of the Tampa Asso¬   ciation, and was, previous to his coming here, superintendent of the famous “Ele¬ phant” house in California, with whose product you are probably all familiar, as they were the first people to ever put the little sticker, with the picture of an ele¬ phant on every orange they packed in their house.  In addition to these examples, there are between forty and fifty other packing houses in the State that have added im¬ proved machinery ^ following as closely in the steps of the Winter Park practice as their available means will allow, and we are pleased to note the dawning of a brighter and better day for the prepara¬ tion of the entire Florida citrus crop for the market; and when the time comes that our entire crop is as well handled as the California crops have been, the trade at large will be surprised to learn that the Florida orange, notwithstanding its thin, fine-grained skin and very high percent¬ age of juice, will carry as well and as far as, and keep better than any orange rais¬ ed in the world.  Moreover, a series of experiments made in more than sixty different cities in the United States this present season, in comparing the juice contents of the Florida orange with the California navel —the experiment consisting of taking a California naval, of the 150 size, and the ordinary Florida orange of the 150 size, carefully squeezing and straining the juice from each into glasses of similar size and shape—have demonstrated that the average juice contents of the Florida orange this year (with probably the poor¬ est Florida oranges, and certainly the best California oranges, that have been shipped in many years) is 42 per cent in       excess of that of the California navel, and as the juice furnishes the only food con¬ tent of the orange, further comment on this point is unnecessary.  In a letter received from the manager of the Florida Citrus Exchange in New York city he enclosed a newspaper clip¬ ping reading as follows:  “The real battle in the rival apple worlds of the East and West is the battle between Taste and Looks/’  And in his letter of enclosure remarks:  “This tells in a measure the difference between navels and Floridas.”  On a recent trip through the principal fruit markets in the East I asked many dealers that had been handling large quantities of the Winter Park brands at high prices, why they paid prices so much higher for those brands than they did for other brands under which really finer fruit was sold, and the invariable an¬ swer was “Because it keeps.”  I fear that many growers fail to realize the importance in the mind of the retailer of this particular thing, that “it keeps,” and that the Florida orange will keep when properly handled we have demon¬ strated this year.  As you all know who are shippers of citrus fruits, for some reason the decay this year has been exceptionally high, both from California and from Florida—re¬ port after report comes from the great markets of decay both in Californias and Floridas ranging from 7 to 10 per cent, and at times as high as 30 to 40 per cent in car after car (some cars having shown as high as 75 per cent decay), and until two years ago California fruit was sound delivered if it showed not to ex¬ ceed 3 per cent decay on arrival, while   Florida fruit was allowed 7 per cent de¬ cay to constitute sound delivery—but, al¬ though this year has been an exceptional one for high decay, the Winter Park house, up to the writing of this article, has shipped, delivered, sold and collected for 34,755 boxes of fruit (oranges, grapefruit and tangerines), with an aver¬ age decay of a shade less than 1-7 of 1 per cent—only five cars out of the 109 shipped showing any trace of decay whatever, and in each case where this de¬ cay was shown we have been able to trace it directly to the conditions causing it, which were unnecessary and should have been obviated.  DISCUSSION.  Mr. Temple: I suppose every Associa¬ tion has just as much trouble as we do in the matter of culls. Now, this Black Feather brand is an innovation we have put in, in which we reverse the motto of the house. It used to be “Every doubt¬ ful orange is a cull,”'and now it is “Every doubtful orange is a Black Feather.” All we can say is that we sincerely hope that the Black Feather will shoot our house records so full of holes that the growers will let us alone on the cull proposition.  Prof. Hume. Mr. Temple’s work as exemplified in his own district is a splen¬ did example of what one man can do in his own community.  The subject has been broached that it would be a good thing to designate some¬ thing in the way of standard brands, or a standard system of grading, which might be known as the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural system of grading. This idea was suggested to my mind several months        ago by Mr. Temple, and believing it was a good idea, I wrote to several prominent packers asking them to be prepared to discuss the question. I do not know that you care to take any action in this matter, but I believe it would be an excellent time just now to take the discussion up. I would like to know, Mr. Skinner, whether you are ready to take up that discussion.  Mr. Skinner: I expected to come in on the tail end of it. I got your letter, all right.  Prof. Hume: Mr. Hart, can’t you start it off?  Mr. Hart: I have not had time to make any preparation for taking up this subject, but I have had some years of ex¬ perience along those lines, and if I can offer any suggestions that may be valu¬ able, I will be pleased to do so.  In starting, I want to say that grading has far more to do with prices in the mar¬ ket than the ordinary shippers imagine. You can take inferior fruit, and grade it properly, and get prices that will surprise you. Take russets, for instance. While I have not shipped a russet this year that had rust from the rust mite (I have not seen one in my crop), I have shipped rus¬ sets this year from different causes; that is, from mellanose. I am peculiarly troubled with that disease.  Now, I could have put those all into one grade and they would have brought the price that the worst of them would have brought alone, perhaps. I divided these into two grades; one grade of rus¬ sets were fine to look at, solid and good to eat, and they brought good prices— prices that surprised me, really, consider¬ ing the quality of the fruit. I put the rest of these russets into another grade, and think I got as much for them as I   would for the whole if they had not been divided.  Take the brights. You divide out those that are without blemish—not the abso¬ lutely perfect fruit, because you cannot on a commercial scale grade absolutely a per¬ fect grade, but those that, when you hold them off at a distance, or among other or¬ anges, look perfect, without dark, unsight¬ ly blemishes on them. For such fruit as that, you can get almost any price, if yoit put it in the right line; that is, the mil¬ lionaire trade, the people who appreciate a good fruit, and the millionaire trade is a good trade.  The man who pays for them seldom buys them himself, but he instructs his butler to “buy the best.” They will not say anything about prices, and for that reason it is good trade. I make that fancy grade. Then I make another grade that is not so beautiful, but is not badly blemished, a grade that looks good and has no black, deep marks, nothing that makes it look rough and cheap; that is my Number One grade. The rest are the Number Two, except the culls, which I do not ship at all only as culls to near-by markets.  Mr. Temple, in his paper, advocated giving the different grades a different brand, and I am inclined to believe that is a good idea. I shall not adopt the idea, however. For over thirty years I have been shipping fancies, No. i and No. 2, brights, and my fruit is known in the markets where it goes, so I do not think it would pay me to change my method now. I think I would have a brand for each different grade, and perhaps some different color so that they could be recog¬ nized at a distance.  The teaching of your help to grade       fruit, is one of the greatest problems we have to deal with. Most of us have to hire a good deal of help every year, and they have to be taught to grade; that is another reason why you cannot grade closer than what I have advocated; to do it you would have to have your men with you year after year. You would have to give them training more than one season.  Different pickings may vary a good deal, even in the same grove. If the fruit is running generally rough your men will make a pretty rough fancy grade, while if you have beautiful, smooth pineapple or¬ anges, the tendency is to make your sec¬ ond grade a little too low. It is exceed¬ ingly hard to train men to take any class of fruit and grade it exactly and not make your fancies too rough and your second grade too low.  Mr. Thompson: I have here some fruit that is packed and graded as we handle it at Florence Villa. I want to apologize for the looks of the fruit. I had it shipped to myself and wrote a letter asking the Express Company to hold it for me. I had to go out this afternoon and hunt it up. It had been delivered to a family in the city and they had partially used it. It made me late at the meeting, as I did not have the fruit here as I ex¬ pected.  Last year, I was, fortunately or un¬ fortunately, manager of the Florence Villa Citrus Association. It was a hard proposition, and a difficult problem, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are many pleasant things about it. This problem of grading is something that I hardly know how to take hold of. We had many meetings of our directors and several changes were made before we set¬ tled on our present grade.   We divide the fruit into three grades. Our Florence grade is the best grade we put out. We do not call it fancy, we call it bright. All oranges coming up to these requirements: “All smooth, heavy, good¬ shaped fruit, discoloration allowed not larger than a quarter of a dollar.”  Our last grade, or third grade, is the Cat brand. This is the fruit “not more than three-fourths russet fruit, and all merchantable fruit, including odd shapes, small defects, etc.”  The Gondola, or the middle grade, is all fruit between the Florence and the Cat, so there you have the description of the three grades we carry.  I think that, as a rule, our fruit has brought as good prices in the market as any fruit sold by the Exchange. At the close of this season, we had shipped over 90,000 boxes, and we have divided it all into three grades.  It is exceedingly difficult, as has been said by Mr. Hart and by others, to get the help trained to grade the fruit. Very frequently, right in the middle of the sea¬ son when we were shipping heavily and rushed to our greatest capacity, some of the best graders would leave, or be taken sick, and new help would have to come in. It has not been possible to get graders trained to do this work as we want it, so of course there are more or less defects in the grading, but in a very short time we will have a number of graders who will know what we want and they will be prepared to do it.  This last year, not knowing the amount of fruit we had, we ran short and wanted to get rid of some old wraps we had, so we disregarded the question of wraps, but another year we are going to use the same wraps on all our grades. We will desig-       nate them on the boxes as the different grades. We will make them so that the dealer may know the Florence from the brand on the box, and the Gondola and the Cat. The wrappers will all be the same.  We have striven to get the very best paper we could buy, and another year we expect to have a much better grade than we have this year. We will have it all printed, and no fruit will be sent out of the Association without a printed wrap on it.  Mr. Skinner: I thought somebody would cover the ground well, and I think Mr. Thompson has done it.  Mr. Hart’s remark that it is hard to get your men not to get their high grade oranges too high, or the next grade too low, is a difficulty we are all up against. It seems to me that Mr. Thompson here, for the ordinary run of Florida fruit, has about fixed it.  Now, this orange here has a slight blemish; it is not as big as a quarter of a dollar; it does not hurt the fruit in the least.  I started the season with one pack a grade better than this. No fruit went into that pack that had anything on it like that at all; then we had a grade where they were all like this orange. But the dealers complained that they wanted to have the two grades together because they sold better, so we threw out the other grade; we didn’t have enough of them, anyway.  I think the three grades might do. In Florida, however, we have the russet and the bright proposition, which they do not have in California. You cover that with your grades pretty well. This grading proposition has to be threshed out. I   like Mr. Thompson’s samples here very much, and the methods he has explained.  Mr. Hart: The point is, whether we can adopt a standard by which all fruit in Florida can be graded; something that every grower, every manager of an asso¬ ciation and the Citrus Exchange can all agree upon. It seems to me if we can do that, it is very desirable, indeed. To do that requires considerable hard work. There are quite a number of points that should be considered.  I notice these russets in Mr. Thomp¬ son’s box. At Florence Villa they grade brights and russets in regular order; the russets, I understand are your third grade and you make two grades of russets.  In sections where most of the fruit is bright, as it is on the East Coast, we must have three grades of brights there and I think two grades of russets.  It seems to me that the only way we can arrive at anything that would ap¬ proach perfection, or give satisfaction, throughout the state will be to appoint a committee to handle this matter, to con¬ sider it and make recommendations to this Society. Perhaps we would not have time to do it at this meeting.  Mr. Skinner: That is certainly true, and the grading that would fit this fruit, would not fit your fruit at all.  Mr. Hart: On the East Coast, we have so few russets we never think of putting them with the brights. All along the Coast, we make a separate grade.  A light blemish like the one on this or- * ange,would not cut it out of the second grade, in my case. A dark blemish like that, if it loked like a dark scar, would put the orange into the last grade, but if the scar of that kind was light, it would go in the second grade. Applied in my       case, you could not say, “a blemish the size of a dime, or a quarter.”  Suppose an orange is punctured and the skin around the punctured place, dies. The orange ripens up, but it has a good-sized scar. As the orange enlarges, the scar may become quite large and still not put it in the lowest grade; it may be an excel¬ lent No. i orange. That is the grade I would put it in, but .the Florence Villa people would probably put it in their low¬ est grade. That is one of the problems; just what will constitute defects which will put oranges in the different grades, and the number and kind of blemishes that will constitute the grades,  I do not see how it will be possible to decide it at this meeting, but I think it would be a good plan to get it into the hands of a committee and let them work on it and see what is brought forth.  Mr. Thompson: Any orange that has a defect on it that is greater than the re¬ quirements of our Cat brand, we put in the culls. We have plenty of culls, and I do not know of anything that has pleased me more than the recent news from Tam¬ pa that the management down there had made arrangements for the best solution of our cull crop in Mr. Duncan’s arrange¬ ment.  Mr. Tabor: I move that a committee be appointed by the chair, to take up this proposition and give us their recommend¬ ations at our meeting a year from now. I coincide with Mr. Hart, and I guess many other members, in the opinion that this is something that requires very care¬ ful committee work, and a lot of it. I think we can spend half a day here and not arrive at a solution.  Right now, Mr. Chairman, before such   a thing is suggested, I waive my right of being appointed on that committee.  Motion seconded and carried.  Mr. Hume: I will appoint on that com¬ mittee; Mr. Skinner, Mr. Felt, Mr. Hart,. Mr. Burton and Mr. Thompson, five members. I believe that ought to cover the ground pretty well. I know it is not an advantage to have too large a com¬ mittee, but I think it is a question which should be discussed pretty thoroughly so* as to cover all of the interests involved.  I don’t know whether you realize how hard it is to get a committee to come right up at the end of the year, but I believe in this committee we have a good working one, and I believe that a year hence they will have this thing in good shape for us.  Mr. Thompson: Someone, I believe it was Mr. Williams, said to keep fruit picked ahead of the packers and allow it a chance to shrink. A short time ago we had an evening spent with Mr. Ramsey, the Government expert, and he said the experiments proved that the sooner we can get our fruit through the washer and into the boxes, the better it is for us.  Mr. Williams: Don’t you think you ought to keep it two or three days until it limbers up a little?  Mr. Hart: Mr. Ramsey, in his re¬ marks at New Smyrna, said something that surprised me greatly. It was brought up by the question as to whether keeping fruit for two or three days before ship¬ ping was best or not. I said that it had been my custom to hold my fruit until it had lost its rigidity; that I thought I could pack it closer and more safely in that way.  Mr. Ramsey said in the shipments of fruit to Washington this year in their ex-       periments they had shipped some imme¬ diately and had a number of each lot held for one or two or three or four days and then shipped, and that the fruit that was sent immediately arrived in as good shape —I do not know that he said in better shape—and the boxes were as full as those that had been held. That point is what surprised me; that fruit packed while it is rigid, when it will not stand pressure at all, hardly, should arrive in the market in as good condition and as full as that which has been held until it has shrunk.  In my practice in the past, I have held my fruit until it softens up, and I shall do so in the future, unless my ideas change very materially. But according to these experiments, my practice of holding the fruit does not seem necessary to get fruit into the market in good shape or to pack the box full.  I give you this because some of you may not have heard it—not because I am going to adopt it.  Mr. Thompson: I wish to say that it is the practice of our Association to put the fruit out just as soon as we possibly   can. It may be held two or three days, in some cases, but the delay is because we cannot get to it. The house may be crowded with fruit, and there may be a good many boxes stand for two or three days, but just as soon as we get to it, every member’s fruit is taken up in the order in which it comes in and run through the machinery. We do not let it stand, if we can help it.  Mr. Temple: The government found that the fruit which was picked, packed and shipped at once, not only went through as full, but was in better con¬ dition after several days, than fruit that was held in the house several days be¬ fore shipping.  The tests conclusively prove the de¬ cay was much less when you get the fruit into the cars at the quickest possible mo¬ ment after you get it from the trees.  Mr. Hubbard: There is another point in regard to shipping fruit as soon as you can; that is, the fruit wrapped and pack¬ ed as soon as can be conveniently done, is fresher, both in appearance and flavor when it arrives in the market.   The Florida Citrus Exchange   R. P. Burton.   Mr. President J Ladies and Gentlemen :  I was requested by the president of your Association, or Society, to write a paper, and after some consideration I wrote a paper. But after it was writ¬ ten, I was very much in the position of a cracker friend of mine who came into the bank with her husband to sign a paper. She could not read nor write, but that wasn't much against her, be¬ cause she was a fine character. She couldn’t see very well without her glasses, and it so happened that she had left them at home. When she was requested to sign the note, she said: “I left my specs at home. Won’t you sign for me?” They signed it, and she made her cross mark. I was just tell¬ ing Mr. Temple that I supposed my paper would not do me much good, as I would have to plead that I left my spectacles at home.  Since I came here and listened to some of the addresses and looked over the crowd, I decided that I would not attempt to read that paper at all, but would talk about what they have me down on the program to talk about— The Florida Citrus Exchange. I be¬ lieve, in the invitation I had, I was to write a paper on any subject I chose, and inasmuch as the paper I wrote   was not altogether about the Exchange we will leave it out.  I have listened with a great deal of interest to all that has been said by those who have read papers, and I have been impressed with the fact that the Florida Horticultural Society is en¬ deavoring earnestly to further the best interests, not only of its own members, but all those who are engaged in citrus culture, as well as other horticultural pursuits. The parallel between the Florida Citrus Exchange and the Flor¬ ida Horticultural Society strikes me very forcibly. The Society is endeav¬ oring to improve the methods of cul¬ ture, to intelligently cope with the dis¬ eases the trees are subject to, and to increase the output of the fruit as well as to improve its quality. The Florida Citrus Exchange is endeavoring, after the work is done by this Society, as well as by those growers who have not been reached by the work of the So¬ ciety, to put that fruit on the market in such a way as to compensate the growers for the efforts they have put forth to produce fruit that is of the best.  I was also struck by the remarks of Mr. Berger with another similarity. He refers to the gentleman who wrote to        him and told him that his brother had already gone into partnership with him, evidently fearing that Mr. Berger wanted to join forces with him. As a matter of fact, a large percentage of growers in Florida, and a great many who are in the Exchange, have not yet freed themselves from the idea that the Florida Citrus Exchange is an institu¬ tion entirely foreign to them. They have an idea that the Florida Citrus Exchange was organized by a few phi¬ lanthropists or capitalists who are seek¬ ing their own interests, but whether philanthropists or capitalists, they are a good thing to shy off from. It is astonishing how many really intelli¬ gent people entertain that view. It is not uncommon to receive requests from people asking us to come and look over their groves and put a price on their crops. We also get letters from people asking us to come over and look at their fruit, and if they cannot sell their crop to someone else, maybe they will come into the Exchange. They can’t seem to comprehend that the Ex¬ change is founded to serve the interests of the grower.  The growers in Florida, a great, great majority of them, haven’t the slightest conception of the proposition confront¬ ing them today. How many growers in Florida know that Louisiana next season will ship a half-million boxes of oranges? They don’t know that Louis¬ iana froze when we did, and that she has grown just as fast as we have. They don’t know that Porto Rico is producing large quantities of oranges   and grapefruit and putting them all through New York. They don’t know that some of our friends who are inter¬ ested in the nursery business in Flor¬ ida have been encouraging Texans to plant their prairies in oranges, but they have. I read an amusing paragraph last season, after one of the cold snaps out there. One man was writing about his experiences with firepots, and said he had raised the temperature in one of his orchards up to twenty-one degrees. Now, if we had anything like that, we would think we were entirely done for. Out there, they are growing Satsumas that never freeze (?). That is the only place in this country where we can’t sell oranges unless we sell them Satsumas, and let me say, that is all due to enterprising nurserymen. They have advertised that the Satsumas are the finest oranges grown on earth. From what those people out there be¬ lieve, they are not sure whether Peary took any of them up to the North Pole or not, but if he did take any Satsumas- up there to set out, they are willing to wager those trees are living yet. They say, “We want nothing in this country but Satsumas.” Just see the trees they have put out! In Louisiana and all through that section of the country into Texas points, you cannot get in there unless you go at a sacrifice price. You are shut out of that territory. You are practically shut out of New York ex¬ cept with the best stock you can grow. If you haven’t the finest kind of stock you want to stay out of New York be-   So        cause that is a Porto Rican market un¬ til late in the season.  There is another point I want to bring out. What are we going to do with all the fruit we are growing? You are encouraging the constant planting of citrus groves in Florida. Nursery¬ men are encouraging people to plant in every point and country they can reach, and they can reach practically all of them. Cuba is putting out large quantities of grapefruit. I believe their oranges have not proved to be a suc¬ cess so far as this market is concerned. Now, if we have increased crops, we have to have an increased market. Where are you going to find it, and how are you going to find it?  Now, you will all agree with me when I say there is no other such won¬ derful country under the sun as these United States. We could treble the three million boxes we sold this year and not satisfy the demand, if the oranges were properly put on the market. California shipped this year the largest crop of fruit she ever produced—48,000 cars, 20,000,000 boxes of citrus fruits—and she has secured uniformly good prices on practically all of it.  Some of our friends say it is a ques¬ tion of supply and demand. Well, now, is it? Go back, say, twenty-five years. How much demand was there then for Quaker Oats, or Corn Flakes, or any other cereal? How much of these ce¬ reals are consumed today? These ce¬ reals were produced before there was a demand, and after the demand was created, can you imagine the enormous   production? Now—you have the sup¬ ply; if you support us properly, we will create the demand. Without organiza¬ tion, how are you going to do it? My friend, you will never do it, except through co-operation and organiza¬ tion, as is the Florida Citrus Exchange.  Some of our far-sighted growers in Florida, less than two years ago, after a great deal of hard work, pulled to¬ gether and organized the Florida Cit¬ rus Exchange for that very purpose. What has the Exchange accomplished since then? You will find many grow¬ ers who will tell you it has accom¬ plished only dissatisfaction.  I don’t suppose we get much credit for it, but, do you know, that about the first thing the Florida Citrus Exchange did was to put into the real estate busi¬ ness an enthusiasm that has enabled the real estate men to sell more in the last twelve months than they did in five years before?  Although the Exchange this year has handled less than 25 per cent, of the output of this State, there is hardly a man who will not say that it has given a stability to the citrus industry that it never had before.  There may be some here who do not understand the formation of the Flor¬ ida Citrus Exchange; doubtless there are many in the Exchange who do not understand it. When the Florida Cit¬ rus Exchange was formed, it was mod¬ eled after the California Exchange, but it was formed in a totally different way. The California Exchange came by evolution. A few growers got to-           gether because they had been turning  their fruit over to commission men who  %  did not give them enough out of it to pay for the production of it. After they organized, they found they had no means of marketing their fruit except through the same people from whom they had been trying to escape. Then they formed a selling organization. They would get together and name prices, say, for the week following. The price named would be known all over the State among the growers. As soon as the growers who belonged to the or¬ ganization knew it, their competitors had it. The result was, that whenever the organization had sold at a price f. o. b., the people who were in compe¬ tition, the people controlling their own private line cars, would immediately put in their own cars, cut the price ioc or more, and force the organization to come down to their prices. Where the organization had no hold in the mar¬ kets the price held up, and the next season the people in competition would go to the growers and say: “It is fool¬ ish to keep up your organization. You are losing money by it. There is the record we made last yeason; your or¬ ganization did not get you as much money as your competitors were get¬ ting. In many instances we handled your fruit, anyway, so you had better drop this organization foolishness and come back to where you belong.” Oh, they drank the cup to the bitterest dregs before they ever saw daylight. They got less money per box for five million boxes than they got this year   for twenty million. It was difficult, in many instances, for them to pay their packing charges, and in many, many instances their groves fell into the hands of the men who packed and shipped their fruit for them.  I would say, as I have on many occa¬ sions, that although the statement is made time and again that the condi¬ tions in Florida and in California are totally different, while, as a matter of fact, the proposition you have to handle is the same as they had to handle. You are growing oranges and grapefruit— for what purpose? Primarily, to sup¬ port your families. Isn’t that true? There may be a few around this State who are growing oranges and grape¬ fruit for fun. But the most of you—- the great majority of you—are grow¬ ing them entirely for your financial health.  After watching the game in Califor¬ nia for the past fifteen years, I want to tell you that the road you are travel¬ ing does not deviate one iota from the road they had to travel. But the suc¬ cess you have achieved in the last two years is more than they achieved in ten years. They had to blaze the trail. They were lost in the wilderness, not knowing how to find their way out into the open, and they had to make a path. You are traveling the road they blazer!. They made it possible for you to begin where you did. Their travel is at its end. Your travel is beginning. The path is there, already well defined, wit all unnecessary errors taken out. In¬ stead of beginning from the ground up,       as California did, you have begun at the top.  One thing you must get out of your heads, and that is that the Exchange in Tampa is the whole thing. You, the sub-Exchanges, the local Associations, are the whole thing. It is your product we are selling. You could, after a fashion, sell your product without our assistance; we could not sell without your product.  When I was talking organization over this State, there was one thing that I tried to impress upon the people who wanted to form organizations, and that was to put people in charge of their Association who were loyal . Also, to put in men who were worth something—not somebody's cousin, or brother, or relative who could not make a living in any other way, and for whom was welcomed this position as Exchange manager as a good place to get rid of him. Don’t you know that if a man is worth anything, he al¬ ready has a job? A lot of the mana¬ gers who were put in charge, you would not trust with a dollar of your money, and yet you trust him with this live business proposition, and when he does not make a success of it, you blame the Florida Citrus Exchange. Your manager must be a salesman, a good, all-round man, who knows a busi¬ ness proposition when he sees it, and knows how to handle it. He must ac¬ quaint himself thoroughly with the or¬ ganization of the Association he is working with. It is the duty of every Association manager with his Board   of Directors, to keep in just as close touch with the market conditions as it is my business in Tampa. Every day, just as the day closes, we mail to every sub-Exchange manager a bulletin giv¬ ing the telegrams received from our district salesmen, and the telegrams that we have sent to them. This bulle¬ tin reflects the market conditions all over the country. Ought it to be diffi¬ cult for a sub-Exchange manager to go over these telegrams and arrive at an intelligent conclusion as to what the market is? Ought there to be an ex¬ cuse to say that the head office at Tampa did not keep him advised? A man with so little business ability, or so neglectful, should not wait to be in¬ vited to resign. If you want success, you should put him out right now. His Board of Directors should make it so warm for him that he will not have time to stop where he is.  Every sub-Exchange receives a copy of the telegrams about his shipments of fruit, and if he has done his duty, he can tell you exactly about every car of fruit in which his Association is inter¬ ested. He has his card before him, and every telegram is entered on that card —or should be—and if he will only make the exertion to read his bulletins and his telegrams, and take a little ac¬ tive interest in the work he is paid for, there is no grower who can say he has not been kept advised of the condition of the market, because he has. We have sent out circular after circular from our office, and published it in the “Grower,” and advised these people of                          FLORIDA >STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   S3   what their position is and what they should do.  As a matter of fact, the sales man¬ ager of the Florida Citrus Exchange, the California Fruit Exchange, or any other organization that works on the same principle, ought not to be called on to advise any sub-Exchange as to anything about his own fruit. It is his business to know, and if he does not know, he is not doing what he is paid to do. My business is to keep tab on the markets on the other end of the line; keep tab on my salesmen; to have them advise me through telegraph. The conditions change every day. I have to keep in touch with it every day—every hour of the day. I must read every telegram hot off the wire and form my conclusion and convey that intelligence to the sub-Exchange manager in the country. The next morning he gets it out of the bulletins. If it is his car about which a salesman is wiring, and wants instructions, he ought to have sense and experience enough to say right off the reel what he wants done with that car, and he will never succeed until he does have sense enough. We forecast the mar¬ ket. We have been very much in the position of the weather man. He fore¬ casts the weather as he sees it just at that time; so do we. However, we can tell more what the average grower of Florida is going to do than the weather man can tell what the wind is going to do.  Last fall we started out with the proposition that the green fruit be held   in Florida. Now, have you ever heard anything like this: “Yes, sir; it ought to be stopped. They ought to pass a law up there in Tallahassee to stop it. It certainly hurts the sale of our fruit more than anything else. It certainly ought to be made a penitentiary of¬ fense; but, as long as the other fel¬ low wants my fruit green, and will pay for it, I am going to let him have it.’' Ever heard that? We have. How long is the “other fellow” going to want it? He gets one car; then he never wants another. I wish every orange grower could read the telegrams coming into my office during September, October, November and December. They all told the same story: “It is no use to put your oranges here. Nobody wants them. They are green, sour, unpala¬ table. The buyers are taking Califor- nias and not going back to Floridas”— and they never did. Who is responsi¬ ble? We told you exactly what would happen. We proclaimed it all over this, country. ?  The general manager of the Florida Citrus Exchange engaged in a cam¬ paign which made many of the grow¬ ers smart. But for this publicity cam¬ paign, we never would have raised the price from $1.50 f. o. b. to $1.70 f. o. b. —which we did in November and De¬ cember.  This green orange proposition is a more serious proposition than the av¬ erage man thinks it is. An event that occurred this week gave me much sat¬ isfaction. One of my neighbors was requested to sign a petition to his legis-        lator to support the green fruit bill. He said: “This is a mighty good thing, and ought to pass, but some of us have to ship a little green fruit sometimes.” He made the statement some time ago that he had to ship his green fruit; that was the only fruit that made any money for him. I have him spotted. Now, it is the duty of every Associa¬ tion manager in this State to watch every man who moves any green fruit out of this State from his district. It is the duty of every, man, as it involves the law of self-preservation. When¬ ever he knows that a car of fruit is green, he should report it to the Flor¬ ida Citrus Exchange, and you may be sure that car will be reported to the Pure Food Department at Washing¬ ton. It will get right behind that car, and let me tell you right now, when it once gets started after a thing, it is mighty hard to get it to let go. If you are getting out of the Exchange be¬ cause you want to ship green fruit—go ahead. You know when we camp on your trail, we will stay on it.  I have been credibly informed that certain growers last year drew out of the Exchange and signed up their fruit with an agency on the proposition that the agency would move their fruit when it was green. The agency did ship it when it was green, and killed the demand for Florida oranges in every market where a car of it was distributed.  Who was the criminal? The grower or the man who shipped it? So far as I can see, one is just as guilty as the other.   When you go into an organization, your work is cut out for you. You not only have to manage your own busi¬ ness, but you have to see that the other fellow manages his. You are growing your fruit on the same basis; you have to pay the same labor, the same fertil¬ izer bills, the same taxes, and take all the chances of the weather. We have to pull together to see that when our product is made, we get our money out of it.  While we are on the subject of what the Exchange has done, I notice sev¬ eral nurserymen present. I do not know how much credit they give the Ex¬ change for it, but the fact is that the Exchange has stimulated the citrus in¬ dustry of Florida and given a general feeling of stability, not only to the peo¬ ple here, but to the people who are coming in. Our nurserymen have been so encouraged that they have raised the price of nursery trees from 6oc to $1.50 and $2.00. I submit to these gentlemen: Has the Exchange, from your standpoint, been a success or a failure ? I Want to buy some trees next fall, and if you are going to raise the price still higher, I want to know it.  Another thing the Exchange has done. You can travel this country over from Maine to Texas, and until the Exchange came into existence you heard the same story everywhere: there was not a dealer who had any confidence in Florida oranges. They had experience with fruit that was shipped green and was not fit to eat, or with fruit that was ripe, and it de¬ cayed so fast they could not get back              their money. Now, the man with whom we deal is the jobber. You cannot sell in the interior towns in carloads, and nobody but a jobber can buy a carload. He has to have time to distribute it to the retailer. It was a common saying that Florida oranges would not keep. My friends, the Florida Citrus Ex¬ change has demonstrated within two years that the Florida orange will keep even better than the Californias. There is an Association packing house at Florence Villa that will have put out close to 100,000 boxes, and I do not believe their decay will amount to one- tenth of one per cent. It is no more trouble to sell a car of Florence Villa fruit today, than the best fruit out of California. We have been selling Val¬ encias, in Texas, at $3.00 delivered, and the dealer and consumer were sat¬ isfied, and wanted more. It is all folly to talk about the Florida oranges not keeping.  I had occasion to make a talk to the growers at Winter Haven. They have had some dissatisfaction in their As¬ sociation. Just a mile and a half from there is Florence Villa, and I do not think you will find a man in Florence Villa who is dissatisfied with the Ex¬ change. Will you, Mr. Thompson?  Mr. Thompson: No, sir; not one.  The Association at Florence Villa is a success, because they went at the proposition in a business way; put in¬ telligent men in charge. Their machin¬ ery is of the finest type, and they grow their fruit after the best methods. They do not hesitate to pay the top price for   the best goods, and they know when they are getting what they pay for. The other packing house—a mile and a half from there—is being run on an economical basis. They are not quite willing to make such a large outlay all at one time. As a consequence, while the Florence Villa fruit is going into market perfectly sound, the other packing house fruit is going in 20 to 30 per cent, decayed. There is the con¬ trast—fruit grown side by side under the same conditions.  I asked Mr. Ramsey to investigate the cause of their decay. He came back and said: “There is trouble enough. In the first place, they disregard every rule for the handling of fruit. Their washing machine has no dryer. The fruit is run through that machine and dropped in a box. That box is set in a corner and another box is filled and set beside it, and so on. It sits there three or four days to dry.” Any man of ordinary information ought to know that it has been demonstrated by the Department from Washington that that is an ideal condition to pro¬ duce blue mold. With moisture an ' heat, blue mold spores will be pro- ' duced by the million. Besides this un¬ forgivable sin of stacking their wet fruit away in corners for several days, Mr. Ramsey reported clipper cuts, long stems and other mechanical injuries. Then, they had the nerve to complain because the returns were not what they thought they should be, and they blamed the Exchange. You can’t blame them for being disappointed     I        86  about the returns; but here is the point: The two Associations are a mile and a half apart; the one is a success, the other a failure. The one has its fruit gathered carefully, looking out for clipper cuts, long stems, and bruis¬ ing; the other does not. The one has perper equipment in its house; the other has not. The one was far¬ sighted and level-headed enough to see that by spending a dollar today, they would reap ten tomorrow; the other was afraid to spend the dollar, because they might not get it back. As a result, the one has made a good profit on its crop, established a name for its fruit that will be worth thousands of dollars in the future, and have a repu¬ tation for putting out an honest pro¬ duct. The other is—well, we will say it is dissatisfied.  Florida fruit is all right. The trou¬ ble is with the people who handle it. I want to tell you right now, that unless there is some such thing as stem-end rot, such as Mr. Fawcett is responsible for, unless there is some such inherent trouble, I would not feel any more hes¬ itancy about tackling the sale of it than I would the best California produce, if it has been handled right, and unless you do handle it right, you need not ex¬ pect the Florida Citrus Exchange, or any other organization, to get the money for your fruit.  Now I am going to drift over into the northwest a little. At the begin¬ ning of last season, it was generally understood that we had a short crop of   fruit. It was quite as short as we thought it would be. We strenuously urged our people not to rush their fruit in. Most of them did not rush it, but the outsiders did rush in their fruit. Before the 15th of December, you could not put any oranges into Indiana or Ohio or the Northwest at over $1.30 f. o. b. As a matter of fact, it soon reached the point where you could not sell a car at all in that territory. The Californias were earlier than usual, and ours, thirty days later. Now, when California got her stuff out for Thanks¬ giving, she quit until it was time to put in the Christmas supply. After she had supplied the holiday trade, she quit. Then she put out an advertising cam¬ paign all over this country. The Cali¬ fornia Fruit Growers’ Exchange has spent $100,000 this season advertising the California oranges. By systematic and persistent advertising all over this country and Canada, California has succeeded in marketing the biggest crop she ever grew at profitable prices. Suppose she hadn’t advertised? Where would she have been?  What are we going to do? Are we going to sit down and let California take all that country up there? Are we going to let her hold it? If you are not, how are you going to stop it? Are you going to pat the Exchange on the back and say, “Oh, it’s a good thing; a bully good thing—but I guess I will have to sell my fruit green on the trees ?”  Do you know how the Exchange is supported? The general impression is          that there are ten or a dozen rich men who are putting up the money to run the Exchange. Let me tell you right now that the Exchange has no way of raising money except through the fruit which we handle. The amount of money that we get depends upon the volume of fruit that is handled by the Exchange. It depends upon the num¬ ber who come in and co-operate with us, whether we succeed or fail.  I don’t know how many people here are not in the Exchange, and I don’t care. That is your business; but I want to tell you this: If you think you can pull another organization together you are at perfect liberty to do it; there is the field, try it. When the effort has been made that has been made to pull together an organization such as the Florida Citrus Exchange, which handled only 25 per cent, of the fruit of this State this season, how far do you think you will get it? Think that over; it is a pertinent question. You will never even so much as get into the vestibule which leads into the building. “It is only the smart men who are not in the Exchange; the fellows who can do so much better are outside of the Exchange. It is only the weaklings who are in the Association; fellows who cannot take care of themselves, but need a guardian.” Did you ever hear that? I have heard it, and let me tell you, the fellows who made the statement had far greater need for guardians.  One of the valuable assets of the Florida Citrus Exchange is the confi¬   dence of the trade which has been in¬ spired all over the country. The Ex¬ change has demonstrated that it can¬ not only put up oranges so that they will keep, but that it is equipped to distribute the oranges it can handle in an intelligent way, and protect the man who buys from it, by distribution. If I were to undertake to tell you all about the phases of this subject I would be here until tomorrow night.  There are two or three points I am going to touch on, though, on this “in¬ dependent” question. You know the first thing the other fellow does when he starts out in opposition to the Ex¬ change is to pat you on the back and tell you how “independent” you are; free-born, white and twenty-one, and don’t give a hang. “You don’t need no guardian.” No, surely, you don’t. Plenty able to take care of yourself. It sounds mighty good. You know the independent man in this State. If he is independent, he is in the Florida Cit¬ rus Exchange, and nowhere else. If he is out of it, you may rest assured that he is dependent.  Let me tell you about one “independ¬ ent.” He was in the organization, but he could not stay because he did not like the secretary. So he went into the secretary’s store and picked a row with him, got licked, and then he decided to spite the secretary by getting out of the organization. Along towards fall he came around and felt pretty lone¬ some, and the nearer the shipping sea¬ son came, the more miserable he was.  I felt really sorry for Mr. Temple. This     *        88  man used to take up about two hours of Mr. Temple’s time every day talking about his troubles. Finally we told him we would take him under a special contract. He got up a car of oranges and grapefruit and we sold it at $2.75 for the grapefruit and $2.00 f. o. b. for the oranges, and he kicked because he thought he ought to have $3.00 and $2.25. Then the green fruit got on the market, and we could see the market sliding down the toboggan. He was in a terrible stew. He said he had to get his fruit off. We suggested his holding it. He was afraid of a freeze, and thought he had rather take the chances on the market than on a freeze. He moved three cars and he got, I think, 30c on the tree for it. He never came back to see us. He was independent. He signed a new contract with an inde¬ pendent . . We are going to bring suit against him for violation of his con¬ tract, and we will see how independent he is. His car of grapefruit shipped by the independent froze at Pueblo. Then he comes in again and says: “Here is an account sale, a car of oranges shipped such and such date; $315.00, less ioc a box brokerage; that is all there is on it. Now, I don’t know whether that fellow (the other inde¬ pendent) is stealing my money or not. All I know is just what he says on that paper. When the Exchange sold my fruit I did know where it was sold and what it was sold for.”  The funny part of it is, the man says the fruit belongs to his wife. If we sue him for violation of contract, we   will get him, and if he brings out that the fruit belongs to his wife, he will be sued for disposing of something that did not belong to him. I feel sorry for that “independent.”  Another man, right by the side of him—his neighbor—came into my of¬ fice, and said: “So-and-so signed with So-and-so, and violated his contract, and the president of the Association owns the packing house, and he has made a contract to put up that fruit, and if we want to get our fruit off, we can’t. I told them I was going to kick.” He went on to say: “I am a loyal Exchange man. I know if the Exchange does not succeed, that my twenty years of hard work is lost; but I must get a dollar a box on the tree for my fruit.” I told him we could not promise that, but would promise the market. This man came in about a month later, and stuck his head in the door. He said: “I got a dollar on the tree and $300.00 over.” There wasn’t a man in the Association who did not double the independent’s price on the tree.  I don’t know what the independent is going to do; he is an awfully inde¬ pendent fellow.  The keynote of this whole proposi¬ tion is proper grading, packing and handling, so far as the Florida end of it is concerned. Dr. Inman used to say we are all in the kindergarten. As I stated at Gainesville, I think the great majority of us have not got in the kin¬ dergarten yet. When we see the door^               we shy away from it, not realizing - that  within is our salvation.  Many growers go into the Exchange with the idea that now *hey are going to get a chance for a little “rake-off,” This fellow is in every community. Has not his neighbor taken three per cent out of all he (this grower) and his neighbors have shipped? Now, he thinks, here is a chance for him to get a little graft. When he finds there is no chance for his “getting something for himself,” he gets sore at the Ex¬ change. He didn’t go into it with the idea of honest co-operation bringing ultimate success for all; he was looking out for a little easy money. Oh, there are some pippins in the Exchange and some out of it. When I go around and see some of the Exchange men, I am really ashamed to say that I am marketing oranges for these people. When I am brought to realize the true spirit under which they are working, I sometimes feel that it is a hopeless proposition.  But always there are bright spots, somewhere. You will find success where you least expect it. You will find men who are loyal, men who aie clear-headed and true-hearted, men whom it is a pleasure to show the road that they may travel onward to suc¬ cess. They are not all college-bred men, by a good deal. Many of them never got beyond the three R’s, but they are loyal, and unless you have loyal growers in your organization, and loyal men as your sub-Exchange and Association managers, you are go¬   ing to fail, and you had better find out at the earliest possible date who are not loyal, and replace them with those who are. The success of your organ¬ ization depends on putting the right man in the right place.  Then again, don’t hang off by your¬ self and imagine that the Florida Cit¬ rus Exchange, located at Tampa, is all-powerful and can lift you out of every difficulty. The Exchange has nothing to do with your local organiza¬ tion. You must organize and pay your part for the support of the Florida Citrus Exchange. Forget that the Florida Citrus Exchange came to you and helped you to organize. They gave you a helping hand and have done ev¬ erything to assist you that they pos¬ sibly can, but you must work out your own salvation. When you find that you have not the right kind of a man¬ ager to make your organization a suc¬ cess, forget that he is your neighbor and your friend, or your cousin, or your own son; you must look the proposition squarely in the face, and if there is a man fitted to take the place, put him in —if he is a loyal man.  I have seen some of the most hope¬ ful symptoms of late. There has been more or less discussion among Asso¬ ciations and sub-Exchanges and grow¬ ers, which indicates that the people are beginning to wake up to the fact that they are factors in this movement; that they themselves are concerned in it. They are beginning to realize that the Exchange is merely the selling agent for their fruit and has nothing to do        with the producing of it, nothing to do with the management of the Associa¬ tions, but merely to look after the sale of their product, and with the machin¬ ery for doing it. That is all the Ex¬ change is, and that brings it right back to the grower. The grower IS the Association. It is hard for some of the people to understand that. It is the hardest matter in the world for them to understand that Mr. Temple and Mr. Burton are not the whole thing. They are two little cogs in the wheel, and if they were to snap off, they would be replaced tomorrow, and the machinery go forward just as smoothly. But, my friends, if the growers drop out, they are the wheels that make the machin¬ ery go, and if they drop out and are not replaced, the machinery stops right there.  There has been a great deal said in the State about auction. In the last two years I have had a good deal to say about auction myself, and I will tell you why I have had it to say: Be¬ cause the natural way to sell fruit is at auction. Wherever there is a market large enough for an auction, there should be one—where a man who can buy five or ten or a hundred boxes of fruit can go and buy it at public sale.  At an auction, where there are any-  «  where from two to ten times the num¬ ber of bidders that there are people in this room, some Italian, some Ger¬ mans, some French, Russian, and dif¬ ferent nationalities, there is bound to be spirited bidding, and there is where you get the best price for your fruit.   These fruit dealers are quick to appre¬ ciate points of vantage to themselves, and prefer buying at auction because they see what is going on, and that each one has an equal show, provided the auction is an open one and on the square. There have been a few stock arguments used by the pot-hunters for years about auctions. One of the first that I ever heard is as fresh and active today as in days of yore, which is, that buyers get together in the auction room and combine to pay only a low price; when, as a matter of fact, there are gathered together in an auction room many buyers whose daily busi¬ ness it is to attend the auction and buy supplies for therselves, their employ¬ ers, or on brokerage for out-of-town dealers. The spirit of rivalry is keen; there is no time for combinations, nor is there any inclination. Each buyer is trying to buy what he wants and to prevent his competitor from buying cheaper than he. Many bloodless bat¬ tles are fought on the floor of the auc¬ tion room, when the competitors have forced each other to pay more than either expected to pay. It’s the spirit of rivalry. In every open auction room there are representatives from many nationalities, each feeling more or less hostile toward others—a motley crew. They are wholesalers, retailers, ped¬ dlers and brokers, each trying to earn his daily bread. They are bidding prices up all the time, while at private sale the tendency is downward. The buyer has the advantage at private sale. It is practically impossible to sell             FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   9i   a car of fruit in any of the large cities for as much at private sale as it will bring at auction. For this reason, prac¬ tically all California fruits are sold at auction, where there is an auction. We have the spectacle in Florida of oper¬ ators inveighing against auction and holding the Exchange up to execration, because it has the honesty to use auc¬ tion in auction points, while these oper¬ ators use the same auctions persist¬ ently, but under cover, having their wares sold by commission concerns, or brokers, at auction. I know of in¬ stances where this has been done, where the auction charges were de¬ ducted from the gross sales, the seller receiving ioc per box for his services, and the net returns sent to the Florida agency who sold it under contract for the grower for ioc per box brokerage which it takes out; the grower having the understanding that ioc per box covered all charges which he was ex¬ pected to pay, and so far as he knew, was all that he did pay. But he was an “independent.” How glorious that word sounds! and yet, only he who is in the Exchange is independent. There is the joke; the outsider has been made to think that flying around loose like a piece of chaff, disconnected, tossed by the winds of adversity, he is independ¬ ent. So he is, poor devil, just as inde¬ pendent as that chaff; just as valuable to himself and his neighbors. He has not yet learned that independent effort on his part is to succeed only in co¬ operation with his fellow growers in systematizing the production, prepara¬ tion, and marketing of his crops.   I want to hear less rot in future about this auction proposition. Do you suppose that a man is coming down here and look your fruit over and give you as much as you could get if you had a selling power behind you? Do you suppose any concern in the mar¬ kets can send a man here and pay his expenses and take all the chances of a fluctuating market unless he gets a substantial margin of profit? He can’t do it. He is making a good profit that should be yours.  Now, about the tree sale. Sales on the trees are made to speculators, and must be at less than prevailing prices at time of sale. It is these sales that force prices down in the markets. They are usually made to local brokers whose continuance depends upon the cheapness with which they can supply the dealer who would otherwise buy from the Exchange. Now, that is the thing that tears your market all to pieces. The tree sale is one of the most disastrous things in Flordia.  Someone said to me last night that they had never known as many oranges to be shipped as late in the season. Do you know who has suggested this to the growers in this State, and who have held their fruit for the market? The Florida Citrus Exchange and its mem¬ bers, and no other. When the Florida Citrus Exchange advised holding the fruit, there was a good deal of dissatis¬ faction with some growers. Everyone else in the Stae was rushing their fruit out. What was the condition in Phil¬ adelphia? On a recent visit Mr. Skelly said the market was more than       glutted. Every dealer in the town had his store loaded from cellar to garret, but the fruit kept piling in and piling in, and the dealers lost more heavily than did the growers here. The rec¬ ords will show that by our Association holding their fruit on the trees, they gave the market a chance to clear up. Do you suppose a man loaded with your green stuff is going to give what the good fruit is worth? By the middle of January we should have had a good market at profitable prices, but as it   was, it was the middle of March before we got a market. We shipped fifty per cent, more oranges in March than we did in December, but we realized more money than any of the gentlemen who were in such a hurry to get their fruit in. Of course, if there had been a freeze, that would have been the end of it.  The president admonishes me that I have encroached upon your time, and I thank you for your attention.        Horticultural Wanderings In Oriental Fields   By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson.   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen :  I regret, probably more than any of you, that I am not able to show you some of the pictures I was privileged to take of the marvelous things I saw in horti¬ cultural and other lines on my recent tour around the world. There is a gentleman present here who made the trip on the same boat that I did, and just a moment ago he said that unless we had some such evidence as pictures, actually taken, it was doubtful whether or not our statements could be believed. If I should make any statement seemingly startling or incred¬ ible, you may call on him to verify it.  The subject of my talk, or lecture, is somewhat misleading in the program. It hardly could be dignified by being called an address, because it has not been care¬ fully prepared. Up to an hour ago, I had thought I should give you a talk from pictures, but we have failed after every effort to get any instrument to throw them on the screen. I have some notes of lectures delivered on shipboard, and other memoranda from which I can re¬ fresh my mind as I go along, and may be able, perhaps, to give you a little diver¬ sion and entertainment; at any rate, I hope I may not bore you.  My tour around the world was a rather hurried one, and yet owing to its perfect arrangement and management, was so   planned that we had ample time and op¬ portunity to see a great deal more than people ordinarily do who take three or four times as much time as we did in making the trip.  Before starting in on the oriental fields, I want to say just two or three words with regard to some occidental observa¬ tions from a horticultural standpoint. Our trip was made westward, and the first stop was in California, in the Riverside citrus neighborhood, a very short time after the freeze they had a year ago last January. In order that you may get some idea of the severe temperatures they had out there, I will give you a statement that I got from the Weather Bureau in Los Angeles. It appears from the offi¬ cial report that in Southern California, in 1909 and 1910, it was below freezing nine days in December, and ten days in Jan¬ uary; at San Bernardino, four days in December, four days in January; at Red¬ lands, five days in December and six days in January. At the office of the Fruit Exchange in San Bernardino, they told me that growers had reported much low¬ er temperatures than any recorded by the Weather Bureau. In some instances, 26, and even as low as 20 degrees were reported. If we had any such cold as that, in Florida, we would think we were going to the bow-wows right away. The result of that cold in the orange groves         about Riverside may be understood, per¬ haps, by looking at the picture taken on the spot, which I will pass around. This shows you the ground covered with or¬ anges. It looks very much like they were little pebbles, but they are oranges. You can scarcely see the ground for the or¬ anges. Instead of being discouraged, they were getting ready for the next crop. It is wonderful what an amount of pluck the people out in California* have. It was a lesson to me to see how much of adversity they ignored and what* they had in the way of optimism and back¬ bone.  We sailed from San Francisco on the 5th of February. Our first stop was eight days later in Honolulu, in the Haw¬ aiian Islands. When we got into the har¬ bor, in the morning before it was fairly light, someone knocked vigorously at my door and a familiar voice said, “Get up, Doctor, I want to see you.” It turned out to be a Tampa boy who is connected with the United States army engineering de¬ partment out there. He was very anx¬ ious to see me. It is a long way from Tampa, Florida, to Honolulu, and he had been there three years, so he was mighty glad to see someone from home.  It wasn’t long before, in the course of the conversation, he said, confidentially, “Say, Doctor, these folks here think they have some good pineapples, but I have told them if they wanted a really good pineapple, they had to go to South Flor¬ ida to get it. I want you to bear me out in that statement, if you never do any¬ thing else for me.”  As a matter of fact, I will say, as a horticulturist and as an amateur in judg¬ ing fruits, I never in my life tasted as de¬   licious pineapples as the pineapples raised in the Hawaiian Islands. They fairly melt in your mouth. I was glad, indeed, that I did not have to back up my friend’s statement and lie like a gentleman as to the pineapples. I admired his loyalty, but let us not forget that the Hawaiian Is¬ lands belong to the United States and arc a part of our country, so it is all right for us to be justly proud of their products.  It is a remarkable fact that the soil and climate of the Hawaiian Islands will produce anything that will grow any¬ where. The climate is incomparable, and the only thing that is necessary to do is to plant what you want to raise. Un¬ fortunately, they have not always been wise, in the matter of planting. The ma¬ nia along agricultural lines is the pro¬ ducing of sugar, and it is not hard to understand this one-sided policy when you realize the amount of sugar they can get from an acre on the islands. They raise fine mangoes and quite a gO€?d deal of rice is raised by the Japanese and Chi¬ nese, but everything is neglected because of the sugar monopoly. Some of the most beautiful flowers I ever saw in my life were in Honolulu. The hedges around the home lots are simply gorgeous beyond description. One of the most beautiful is called Joseph’s Coat—I do not remember the botanical name for it, but it was beautiful. Oranges and other fruits are raised only to a limited extent, as in Cuba; they seem to have only a few oranges in the back yard for home :on- sumption. Strawberries and small fruits are grown to quite a large extent.  Speaking about anything and every¬ thing growing there; they are afflicted with a pest that has caused them more          FLORIDA ;STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   trouble than anything that has ever hap¬ pened to the Island—efforts to keep out mosquitoes and snakes not excepted. It appears that some years ago, somebody brought some lantana and started it there, and in a little while it spread until now it has taken the whole country. Our trouble with the water hyacinth is nothing compared with the lantana over there. They think lately, that they have dis¬ covered some natural enemy that will help them out, and it is to be hoped that they have.  We will now leave Hawaii and pass on to Japan; another twelve days’ sail across another section of the Pacific Ocean. Think of the magnitude of the Pacific Ocean; eight days to Honolulu and twelve days from there to Japan! One morning we heard the anchor go down and realized that we were in Yok¬ ohama. It was not quite daylight, and I did not propose to be caught napping as in Honolulu, so got up early and went on deck. The vessel had swung around un¬ til the stern was toward land, and f be¬ held one of the most beautiful mountain peaks in the world; that is, perhaps the most beautiful after Mount Kanier and some others in America. The star Venus hung very low over the mountain, and the moon was still above the horizon. The snow-capped mountain was glittering in the morning sun, which had not yet risen where we were. It was forty miles off, but seemed much nearer. I was utterly lost in wonder and admiration of this remarkable constellation of Venus, Fuj¬ iyama and the moon. Suddenly a very soft voice behind me said, “Did you ever see anything so beautiful in your life?” I turned around and was confronted by   95  a most charming widow who was travel¬ ing with us. I looked directly at her a moment, and said, “I certainly never did.” Then her face took on a more roseate hue than the rising sun was giving to the east¬ ern horizon. We were in the land of the “Rising Sun.”  Japan is the most marvelous country on the face of the earth. The Japanese are the most wonderful and progressive na¬ tion in the world. Next to the United States, I would say, comes Japan and then Germany. They are fully informed and up-to-date in everything in the way of science, in statecraft, in education, in mil¬ itary matters, in commerce, in horticul¬ ture and, in fact, in everything that is advanced and that seems to them good and valuable. They are not trammelled or bound up in superstition or prejudice; they are not controlled by precedent or tradition, and simply appropriate to them¬ selves everything that they find good and useful.  Out at the Imperial Experiment Sta¬ tion at Akishi, after I had been shown around and had seen some very wonder¬ ful things in the way of apples, pears, peaches, citrus fruits, etc., all growing in plots side by side, the manager of the sta¬ tion said : “One thing we are very proud of is from your country. It is the Ben- davis apple.” I couldn’t think to save my life what it was until it suddenly dawned upon me that he meant the Ben Davis apple.  In Japan, every fruit, every flower, every vegetable that grows in our coun¬ try, in all their varieties, can be produced, and they have even improved a great many things that we still cling to.       One of their most remarkable products, that possibly some of you who have been in Tampa may have seen growing in my garden, is a radish,which they call the Sakai raj ama. It grows to be as much as two feet long and possibly six inches in diameter and weighs as much, sometimes, as forty pounds. It is as tender and of good flavor as any radish I ever ate. The Japanese eat it as taken from the ground. Besides, they dry it, pickle it in salt, cook it in various ways, and, next to rice, it is one of their mainstays. Tea is raised in large quantities and seems very profitable, as is also the silk-worm mulberry.  They are unable to produce sufficient rice for their own requirements. Japan is not by any means able to sustain her¬ self on her own products, and has to im¬ port enormous quantities of all kinds of things. She imports the iron for her great battle-ships, but she has the men. They have but a limited area of territory that can be used for agricultural and hor¬ ticultural purposes, and are economical of it beyond conception, almost. They do not use horses or any other animals to any extent for cultivation of the soil, be¬ cause they take up too much room, and require too much food for sustenance. They have very few roads; there is not much necessity for roads because they go on foot in narrow paths, thus economiz¬ ing ground.  Their fruit trees are planted close to¬ gether and are kept very small. They dwarf their trees methodically. No tree is permitted to grow so high but that a little Jap can reach up without a ladder and pick fruit from it. By planting so close together, they get, perhaps, quite a?   much harvest to the acre as we do. They raise very good oranges, and better grape¬ fruit than is grown in California. I don’t know from where they get their stock— perhaps Mr. Tabor or Mr. Connor or Mr. Gillette can tell you.  They are annoyed by all kinds of dis¬ eases, pests, and all sorts of insects. I never saw so many horrible things in the way of insects. I never dreamed or im¬ agined there could be such awful things as I saw there in the museum at the Im¬ perial Experiment Station. They are just beginning to spray and are using a great deal of Bordeaux, and think they have succeeded in getting in it something very satisfactory for insects. Their most com¬ mon method, however, in dealing with in¬ sects, is to catch them and kill them by hand. They have plenty of time for this. The wages of a good workman is from ten to fifteen cents a day. The women work side by side with the men. The women get ten cents, and the men fifteen cents a day. The women do some kinds of work better than the men, as they are more quick and nimble, but it is the same old story—they don’t get the same wages.  To give you an idea of their care and patience in the management of their fruit¬ growing business, let me instance that in the raising of peaches; when the peach has passed out of bloom and the fruit is set, every little peach is enclosed in a strong paper sack, which is securely tied around the twig. The sack is large enough to accommodate the peach until it is fully grown. Every peach is raised in a paper sack, and that is the only way they seem to be able, owing to enemies, to raise peaches. Of course, the peaches are some¬ what lacking in color, as the sun cannot      FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.  completely penetrate the translucent pa¬ per, and you miss the peachy ruddiness of our sun-ripened peaches. Still, they are very good.  The dwarfing process of fruit trees consists in pinching and clipping off the tender shoots, only permitting enough new wood to form and remain for the next crop, and they have reduced the dwarfing problem to a most remarkable success. I saw dwarf pines and dwarf oaks that were said to be two or three hundred years old, growing in flower pots on a table. One of the gentlemen in one of the public gardens at Yokohama ex¬ plained to me that the way they did the dwarfing of ornamentals was to starve the trees. They are planted in just suffi¬ cient soil for them to germinate, and then the rootlets are covered with pebbles and no more sustenance in the way of soil given them. They are fed only with water, but must have this daily. In this way, the pine and other trees do not get taller than two or three feet in hundreds of years.  We hear so much about the bloom of their cherry trees. We were a little early for the cheery bloom, although we saw some of it, but we were there in the midst of the plum-blooming season. The cherry and plum trees are used for orna¬ mental purposes alone. By a system of selection, they have brought about a kind of evolution in these trees so that they produce bloom rather than fruit. The fruit is of no value; it is small and insig¬ nificant.  Some of the most remarkable things in the way of bamboo growth that it is pos¬ sible to imagine, is found in Japan. The bamboo is to the Japanese the most useful   and valuable plant they have. It is not used as an ornament, except incidentally. Out of it they build houses and bridges and boats and everything that is useful and necessary, almost, for their comfort and happiness.  One of the most wonderful things we saw in Japan is the cryptomeria. It be¬ longs to the same family, I was told, as the giant trees of California. At the temples at Nikko are found the most magnificent specimens, some of them run¬ ning up two or three times as high as tall pine trees such as we have in our country 7 . They line many of the narrow avenues on both sides, and some of these avenues are three and four miles long, with only width enough for a rickshaw to pass between.  I asked a guide why the trees were so much more numerous around Nikko than any other place, and he told me that dur¬ ing the reign of one of their shoguns, who had his residence at that place, he exacted from the nobility that once a year they should come on a pilgrimage to his palace and bring gifts to him. There was one noble who was a great warrior, but who was very poor, and unable to bring gifts of silver and gold. “He no have much gold; he no have much silver; so every year he bring cryptomeria to plant. Other warriors laugh at his plants. Now, gold and silver all gone; cryptomeria still here. Joke on them.”  I must hasten on ; or we shall not get very far in our wanderings. I saw be¬ sides these things horticultural that I have told you about, a number of polit¬ ical, social, manufacturing and commer¬ cial things that are of great interest, but we will not have time to talk about them.       Our next stop after leaving Japan was at Hongkong, China. This is an Eng¬ lish possession in the latitude, or a little further south, as I remember, than Key West. We spent quite a little time here making an excursion some hundred miles up the Pearl river, to Canton, that won¬ derful city which has had a population of two million people, it is claimed, ever since before the Christian era. They claim considerably more than two million people now. I do not believe anybody has any kind of an accurate idea of how many people there really are in the city, but there are a great plenty. They say that half a million live in boats on the water. I think from what I saw there are more.  Mr. Fairchild, of the Bureau of Plant Industry, commissioned me to look out for him, as well as I could with my lim¬ ited time, as to the best method of prop¬ agating the Leitchee, a tropical fruit found in China. Probably its most com¬ mon habitat is along the Pearl river, from Hongkong to Canton. They are, to look at from the steamer, in rich, dark green foliage, very much like orange trees—I thought they were. I do not wonder Mr. Fairchild is anxious to find some method of propagating the Leitchee. It is about the size of a very large chestnut, burr and all, the outer covering resembling an un¬ opened chestnut burr very much, only it is the color of a strawberry, and the prickly-looking spines are soft. Some large strawberries have recently been in¬ troduced into China where they were for¬ merly unknown, and some of the Chinese take them for Leitchees. I saw a young fellow walking along from one boat to another in the boat community at Canton with a large tray, and thinking to have   some fun with him, I asked, “Leitchee ?” He said with a very disgusted air: “No, no; tawbelly.”  When you peel the outer covering from the leitchee it discloses several pearly- white, creamy segments that are delicious beyond description. It equals peaches and cream; it beats guavas; it beats al¬ most anything I know of in the way of fruits. Mr. Fairchild desires to find some method of propagating it other than through the seed, which is unsatisfactory. Prof. Groff, at Christian College, Canton, who co-operated with me, told me to say to Mr. Fairchild that if he wanted to raise the leitchee, he would probably have to do it like the Chinese do. The Chinese method is to put a ball of clay tied on in canvas around a limb of the tree, then partly girdling the limb. In a short time roots are shot out into the ball of clay and the limb is cut off and set out in the ground. This is the only way they seem to think that the tree can be successfully propagated. Mr. Fairchild tells me since my return that he has succeeded in get¬ ting some kind of a stock upon which he hopes to succeed in raising the leitchee. I think it would grow in South Florida. It is worth a tremendous lot of work to get it here, and I hope he may be able to introduce it.  The orange may possibly have origi¬ nated in China. I don’t think any of us know just where it did originate, but it has been known from time out of mind in China, and it was the only place where I found round oranges that were sweet and good to the taste of a Floridian.  In all those tropical, oriental countries, they raise what they call the “loose¬ skinned” orange, and have many varieties       FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.  of it, but the grapefruit is unknown; at least we saw none of it after leaving Ja¬ pan. They have shaddock, larger and coarser than any we have. You not only have to get the outer skin off of it, but you have to take the skin off each segment as well. They are worth the trouble, how¬ ever, and you are repaid in eating them. The juice cells are as large as peas, per¬ haps, and very pleasant to the taste.  In addition to oranges, leitchees, shad¬ dock, etc., they have quite a number of different kinds of very good nuts. One is an acorn that is as good, or better, than our wild chestnut. It is not as large as our cultivated chestnut, but it is very toothsome. I have a few seeds, and I see some nurserymen present to whom I shall give them.  I might mention in passing the botan¬ ical garden at Hongkong. Hongkong is a city built right on the side of a moun¬ tain island rising precipitously out of the water. It seems to be simply a rock that goes up sharply to what is known as the peak, a distance of two thousand feet, with very little room for anything. How¬ ever, they have terraced it and changed its surface entirely from the natural aspect. It is a city of some 400,000 or 500,000 inhabitants, and is said to be the largest shipping point in the world, after Liver¬ pool and New York. Its botanical gar¬ den is planted upon the side of that moun¬ tain, overlooking the harbor. The gar¬ den is under English management and is well stocked up with fruits and ornamen¬ tals. Owing to the steep mountain side on which it is located, its terraced land¬ scaping is wonderful and beautiful, espe¬ cially at night. To our admiring view the mountain rose abruptly out of the har¬   bor, the electric lights were glittering and reflected back from the mirror-like water. It was simply a most gorgeous and mag¬ nificent sight.  From Hongkong we sailed to Manila. Again we were at home, and Old Glory waved its inspiring folds over our heads, and we were with friends. The Philip¬ pines are in a most chaotic condition. The Americans are having unbelievable and indescribable difficulties to contend with, but they are doing wonders. There is a Florida man, with his wife, in charge of the little sub-Experiment Station a few miles below Manila. He is doing good work and fair results are promising. There are some specimens of the tanger¬ ine and some of grapefruit, and in spite of adverse climate and unfavorable condi¬ tions generally, I think they may succeed in producing some good results along cit¬ rus lines. One man was experimenting with corn, and told me he had the most wonderful thing in the way of Guam corn, and gave me an ear or two to bring home, but the weevils got at it, and when I reached Florida there was nothing left but dust and chaff. j  The most delicious fruit we found in the Philippines was the mango. Talk about the mango we grow down on the southern end of the Florida peninsula! They are good; they are fine; but in com¬ parison they are like my Honolulu friend’s pineapples. Our mangoes do not compare with the mangoes in the Philip¬ pines. When you take a spoon and eat one, then eat another, and then another, and still want more, one can form some kind of an idea about how delightful they are.   100        Our next trip was to Borneo. The most important thing there was the wild man, and the head-hunter. You can scarcely believe that Borneo, the second largest island in the world, with a population running into the millions, and which has been in contact with civilization for hun ¬ dreds of years, has so many people still in a savage state. A few of these wild people and head-hunters were brought in under a Britsh guard for us to see what they were like. Those fellows do not take scalps like our Indians; they cut off the whole head, and the one who has the most heads stuck on poles in his front yard is the most prominent citizen.  It is a most wonderfully rich country, from a horticultural standpoint. I vis¬ ited the market at Labuan. I don’t know whether any of you were ever in the Key West market as conducted some years since. It reminded me very much of that. The same kinds of vegetables, the same kind of fish, the same of fruits—everv- thing about the same. The coast also looks very much like the western coast of South Florida from Marco down; man¬ grove thickets, etc. It gets quite moun¬ tainous out in the interior, however.  From Labuan our next run was across and south of the equator, some four hun¬ dred miles, to Batavia, in Java. There we came in touch with a new civilization to us—the Dutch. The Dutch are in charge, and they do things. They have made out of the Island of Java a perfect paradise. They used to raise much good coffee there, but unfortunately some kind .of blight has attacked the shrub and they do not produce nearly so much of it now. It would be a fine thing for some of you scientific gentlemen to go over there and   find what will help them out. However, I don’t think we can spare any of you yet awhile.  The most remarkable fruit we saw in Java was the mangosteen. The mango- steen is in size about like a tangerine, and similar in shape, a little bit flattened in the stem and blossom diameter, with a shell or covering loose like the tangerine, but instead of being yellow, it is the color of an egg plant. This outer covering is brittle like a walnut shell. After taking off the shell or covering, there is revealed as in the leitchee, a delicious pearly-white fruit with several segments, and I think if your eyes were closed you could at first hardly tell the difference of taste between the mangosteen and the leitchee. It can¬ not be transported or shipped any dis¬ tance. They manage to bring it in from the interior to the cities, but have never succeeded in getting any to Europe. We were told there is a standing offer of ten thousand guilders to anyone who would take a box of mangosteens to Queen Wil- helmina in Holland, but no one has ever been able to earn it.  They also have another fruit here, known as the longan, and I am told it is on this stock that Mr. Fairchild hopes to bud the leitchee. Two other fruits that are fine are the doekoe and the rambotan, the latter of which, like the longan, belong to the same family as the leitchee.  While I am speaking on the subject of fruits in Java, I am reminded that the orange in this and all those tropical coun¬ tries, ripens and becomes sweet and dries up unless picked, as our oranges do here ; but it never turns yellow. It may have a tinge of yellow, about as the peach has a tinge of red. It seemed strange to have            IOI   oranges served to us that were green, < nd yet sweet and ripe.  They raise very few oranges other than the loose-skinned kind. After leaving Java, until we got away up into India, we saw no round oranges.  Their world-famous botanical garden is at a place called Buitenzorg, which is some forty or fifty miles in the interior, and here is also the governor’s residence. It is worth a trip to Java just to see that botanical garden at Buitenzorg. In palms, ferns, exotics and ornamentals it is per¬ haps the richest of any garden in the world.  From Java our next run was to Singa¬ pore. Singapore is another one of those British possessions that has grown up in the Orient, and it also has one of the finest botanical gardens—especially fine in landscape effects. Singapore is at the southern end of the Malay peninsula and is north of the equator about a hun¬ dred miles. Vegetable life of all kinds is abundant and tropical, as is also animal life. It was nothing unusual to see whole colonies of wild monkeys leaping around in the parks and forests. Gambir, ginger, pepper and tapioca are grown in abund¬ ance. The climate is hot and unchange¬ able, but not oppressive.  The climate of the oriental tropics, speaking generally, is not at all uncom¬ fortable. During the months of May and June we cruised all around in the South China Sea, the Java Sea, the Malay Straits, the Bay of Bengal, and the In¬ dian Ocean, crossing the Equator twice, and in all that time the thermometer in mv stateroom never was above 86 or below 80 degrees. On shore, particular¬ ly in Central India, it was hot, going up   to 106 and 107 in the shade, but at sea the trade winds, called monsoons, are re¬ freshing and make it always pleasant.  From Singapore we visited Jahore and saw some wonderful specimens of palms; also King oranges. From there our next run was to Rangoon, in Burma, up a branch of the Irrawaddy river, “on the road to Mandelay.” We spent quite a time there enjoying the beauties of the Shwedagon Temple which, with other things in the way of buildings and art, occupied our time. Cotton, indigo and the mango flourish here.  Our next run was across the Bay of Bengal to Calcutta, India. Oh, India! India! Who can describe it? It is a dream and a nightmare; a delight and a horror! It is indescribable. It would require the language of the most eloquent man that ever lived to tell its glories and its terrors.  We had an opportunity of visiting the large botanical garden here and seeing the large banyan tree, which is said to be one thousand feet in circumference and the largest in the world. It must cover three or four acres. We also saw the most wonderful lot of royal palms it is possible to conceive of. The palms of Cuba are insignificant compared with the royal palms in this garden at Calcutta.  From Calcutta we sailed forth into the Indian ocean to the south, and one morn¬ ing, early, the bugle broke out with a strain of the missionary hymn. Upon rushing out to see what the racket was about, we saw in all its glory the place “where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile.” I think the good old bishop who wrote the words to that hymn must have been a little soured on humanity,   102        because man is not so vile there, after all, as he is in some other places we visited.  Ceylon is a lovely island. Cocoanuts grow there in the greatest profusion. When the natives need a little money, they go out and gather a few cocoanuts and sell them to the ships that come along. They don’t need much for clothes, judging by what they wear, and there is a profusion of things to eat growing all around them; consequently they don’t have to gather many cocoanuts.  I told you that the most wonderful, the most interesting, the most beautiful bo¬ tanical garden was, perhaps, at Buiten- zorg, Java. I also told you the one at Singapore was but little behind it. The botanical garden near Kandy, Ceylon, is certainly one of the most magnificent things from a horticultural standpoint, that it is possible to imagine. There is no known tropical plant, fruit or shrub, ornamental, useful, commercial or in any other way valuable, but that you can find it in that botanical garden at Kandy. It is a wonder. It is some fifty miles from the sea, at an altitude of about two thou¬ sand feet. It has particularly strong feat¬ ures in the way of useful plants. You find all varieties of the rubber tree in Ceylon. There are more varieties of rubber trees than there are citrus trees. It is, next to tea, the great product of Ceylon now. Florida, in its palmy days of the orange boom before the freeze, when everyone was crazy about oranges, was a sane country compared with these oriental countries I have talked to you about. They are just now, absolutely wild and crazy upon the subject of production of a single commodity. They are cutting down cocoanut groves that have support¬   ed them for generations; they are dig¬ ging up their plantations of coffee, tea and everything else, to produce an article for us to use on our automobiles. They are planting rubber, rubber, rubber. It is wonderful, too, how much money they are making.  The rubber trees seem to require very little care, and are tapped something as our pine trees are for turpentine, only they cut a spiral groove around them up as high as they can reach, and don’t box.  Nutmegs, cinnamon, cloves, cocoa, etc., all are found flourishing in Ceylon.  Some of the most remarkable things in animal life are to be found here. Cey¬ lon is one of the places where you find wild elephants. One of the most won¬ derful things we saw was a flying fox. You can scarcely imagine a great, big creature like a fox flying around in the air, but in the botanical gardens there are flying foxes that fly long distances.  One peculiar fruit seen here is the can¬ non-ball fruit. It looks like a cannon ball had been shot into the trunk of the tree. Then there is the jack-fruit. Look¬ ing at it from a distance, it appears very much like a tree with watermelons grow¬ ing out of the trunk and from the limbs, only the skin is somewhat different from a watermelon, but in shape and size they are very much like one. It belongs to the breadfruit family. I don’t like it.  Our next run was back to the main¬ land of India, at Bombay. In the large Bombay market you find anything in all creation you may chance to want in the way of vegetables, fruit or animals. Lions, monkeys, tigers—almost all the things you ever read about. We had a rule, in these Oriental countries, if they           103   asked a price for anything, to offer them half as much. I saw a big, splendid, snarling tiger in a rude cage of poles just brought in out of the jungle, and asked the man how much he would take for him. He said, “Three thousand rupees.” I said, “I will give you fifteen hundred.” My wife caught hold of my arm and pulled me away, saying, “You goose, come away from here, quick. Don’t you know he will take it? What on earth would you do with a tiger?” He was a beauty.  They don’t kill any animals over there, because their religion forbids it. The country is simply teeming with animal life. They are overrun with snakes and vermin. We were told that they some¬ times put a screen over their mouths when they go to sleep, for fear a fly or other insect might get in and they would close their mouths and kill it.  We saw jackals, wolves, snakes, every¬ thing you can think of, almost, from the car windows of our train.  So far as the agricultural and horti¬ cultural life is concerned in India, they are away back. I don’t think they have made much progress since the birth of the human race. Those people are said to be our ancestors. Adam and Eve lived over there, probably, and the people have not changed much from Adam’s time to this in gardening matters. They have, with few exceptions, no improved apples, man¬ goes, or anything else, as a rule, up to date. They work the ground with a forked stick, tramp the grain out with oxen, women hold it up in sieves and let the grain fall and the chaff blow away. Yet those fellows bull the markets of the world with their grain. They compete largely with us. We saw whole train   loads of wheat produced in this primitive, laborious way, going to market. The whole country is dotted with the Royal Poinciana, which they call the flame-tree, growing wild.  Our next run was westward across the Indian ocean into the Red sea. We went through this, sailing past Mount Sinai, of Holy Writ, up to Suez. Then we stopped in Egypt where we made a short stay.  There is not much of interest, horticul- turally speaking, after leaving India, un¬ til you get to Egypt, and by looking at the Journal of this Society for 1906, you will find a description of my horticultu¬ ral observations in that land as well as the Mediterranean countries generally.  Finally, I wish to say that in all my observations, I have not seen a single product, either grain, fruit or vegetables, that can be put in the same class as to excellence with what we raise at home. Their cotton is inferior their wheat is inferior, their vegetables, aside from a few in Japan, are small and lacking in toothsomeness. Their fruits are small and not charged with the juiciness or flavor of our home-grown and European fruits. Their melons are unfit to eat. It is true, indeed, that in some of the equa¬ torial countries there are excellent fruits that are not grown in the United States. I refer especially to the mangosteen, doe- koe, rambotan, etc., but even these, I am satisfied, can be raised in improved char¬ acter in the Philippines, Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Canal Zone. As an illus¬ tration of what I mean by this, I will state that in India, the home of the mango, there is no mango generally grown that can compare in size, flavor and general    104        lusciousness with the mangoes produced in the Philippines, Florida and Hawaii. The same is true of everything else.  In conclusion, let me say that my friends in St. Louis, where I lived and practiced medicine for more than thirty years, have asked me why I live in Tampa. I tell them I live in Tampa be¬ cause I like it. I don’t have to live there for health or business. I have never seen a place yet, in all my ramblings, that is half so dear or sweet or rich to me in all that makes life enjoyable, as South Flcrida and dear old Tampa.  DISCUSSION.  Mr. Hart: The banyan is made up of quite a number of trunks, is it not? How much of it is in the main trunk?  Dr. Richardson: I don’t know that you can say that the Calcutta banyan has a main trunk. The trunks vary greatly in size; some of them being no larger than my arm, and others twice as large as my body. The trunks send out a limb, and it drops down a branch to the earth, and takes root; some of the trunks grow large and some seem to remain small.  Mr. Hart: But there is no large trunk, like the trunk of the tulip tree in Mexico ?  Dr. Richardson: There is one great central trunk that is quite large, but some of the other trunks seem as large.  Mr.-: How large does the lo-  quat tree grow in Japan, and how is the fruit?   Dr. Richardson: I should say seven or eight inches in diameter. As to fruit, we were not there during the fruit sea¬ son, so I cannot say how it compares with ours.  There is one other thing that occurs to me. The guava, too, grows to an enor¬ mous size in the tropics. It grows to be as large as our orange trees. I did not see any guavas in Japan.  By the way, it rains and snows in Ja¬ pan, but they have rice straw mats which protect the fruit. It is remarkable that they can raise citrus fruits in Japan. We were there in March, and it snowed that month several times while we were there. We saw many mats thrown over the or¬ ange trees to protect them. They can’t afford fire in Japan. They warm them¬ selves over a little, tiny charcoal brazier on cold days. We would find them squat¬ ting over an insignificant fire, with bare legs, and in their funny little blue clothes. Charcoal is the main thing they seem to have in the way of fuel in Japan, in their houses.  Mr. Reasoner: I would like to state that we are now growing leitchee. We have two very fine varieties, but they have not borne as yet. Some years ago we had a grafted tree on longan stock, but the top died out, leaving only the inferior longan. The longan has fruited, but is worthless, axcept as a stock on which to bud the leitchee. The Department of Ag¬ riculture has used this as a stock for some time for the leitchee, and we do not know yet of anything to take its place.@@       
Loss of Fertilizer Constituents in Drainage Water@@   A. W. Blair, Chairman@@ Committee on Fertilizers.@@   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen :  The plot experiment, to test the effect of various fertilizers and fertilizing ma¬ terials on different crops, has been very generally adopted in Experiment Station work, both in this country and abroad. The value of the results obtained in this way is beyond our computation; and, on account of the knowledge already gained, this plan will continue to be followed with even greater success in the future. However, efficient as the plan is, it still fails to give us all the data that we should have.  We measure the amounts of fertilizers applied, determine accurately the weight and character of the crop produced, deter¬ mine the amount of fertilizing materials removed by a given crop, and learn some¬ thing of the composition of the soil, and from these facts draw our conclusions. On the other hand, we know but little concerning the amount of fertilizing ma¬ terial that is carried away in the drain¬ age waters. We know in a general way that millions of tons of dissolved mate¬ rial are carried into the sea every year in Florida alone; we know that soils formed by the decomposition of limestone may finally, through the action of carbonated waters, have the lime so thoroughly leached out as to render them unproduc¬   tive until lime has been applied. We know that soluble nitrogen compounds, like nitrate of soda, are easily leached away. Our knowledge on these points, however, is not yet sufficiently accurate to enable us to draw quite definite con¬ clusions.  Realizing the importance of more defi¬ nite knowledge along these lines, it has seemed to us worth while to supplement our plot experiments with some work that will enable us to control, to a greater degree than we can in the field plots, the various factors involved.  PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENT.  The plan adopted enables us to collect the drainage water, resulting from the natural rainfall, from a definite quantity of soil in which one orange tree is grow¬ ing. To do this, four heavy galvanized iron tanks, having a diameter of a little more than five feet, and a maximum depth of four and a half feet, were constructed. They were set in the ground forming a square so that the distance from center to center is about fourteen feet. At the middle of this square is a pit, about eight feet deep and six by six feet on the in¬ side, for collecting the drainage water. (Figure, i.) From the lowest point in the bottom of each tank (as indicated in    io'o        Figure 2) a pipe leads through the wall of the pit to the collecting vessel in the pit.  FILLING THE TANKS.  After being put in position, the tanks were filled as follows: Over the sloping part of the bottom was placed a layer of water-worn quartz pebbles, the coarser material being placed around the drainage opening and the finer above. On the top of this layer of pebbles were placed 45 inches of soil in the following manner: When the soil was taken from the site which each tank was to occupy, the top 9 inches were taken off first, followed by three one-foot sections. The four lots of soil were kept separate, and the last foot taken from the ground was placed on the gravel in the bottom of the tank, then the next foot, and so on to the top 9 inches. The soil was well tamped as it was put in, each tank having the same weight of dry soil, 8,625 pounds. The tank was con¬ structed so as to give a surface area of one two-thousandth part of an acre, so that results can be calculated to the acre by multiplying by 2,000. Four such tanks with the collecting pit form a unit.  SETTING OUT AND FERTILIZING THE  TREES.  The tanks were opened to the rainfall on July 7, 1910, and on July 15, one or¬ ange tree was set out in each tank. These trees, however, soon became infected with withertip, and made but little growth, and therefore probably had but slight influ¬ ence either on the soil or the composition   of the drainage waters. No fertilizers were applied, as it seemed best to find out first the composition of the drainage water from the soil that had not been in¬ fluenced by fertilizers. The original trees having died, they were replaced with healthy three-year-old trees on the 14th of last February. A little later these were fertilized as follows: The tree in tank No. 1 was given the equivalent of two pounds of a mixture analyzing 5 per cent, ammonia, 6 per cent, phosphoric acid, and 6 per cent, potash, made from sul¬ phate of ammonia, acid phosphate and high-grade sulphate of potash. Tank No. 2 received the same, and in addition will have beggarweed grown on it during the rainy season. Tank No. 3 received the same treatment as No. 1, except that ni¬ trate of soda is used as the source of nitrogen. Tank No. 4 had also the same as No. 1, except that dried blood was used as the source of nitrogen. It will be observed that the phosphoric acid and potash remain constant in all the tanks, both as to amount and source, and that the amount of nitrogen is also constant, but that it is derived from different sources for three of the tanks. This treatment will be continued from year to year, the quantity being increased with the demands of the trees. We will thus be enabled to make a comparison of the loss of nitrogen when these three mate¬ rials are used as sources of nitrogen, and the other factors are constant. Since the time when these fertilizers were applied, but little water has accumulated and no complete analysis has been made. The results here reported are on samples of water collected before the fertilizers were applied.

Water began to come through the tanks on July 30th, and the first collec¬ tion was made on August 1st. Between this date and October 19, six other collec¬ tions were made, the seven collections av¬ eraging about 22 to 24 gallons each per tank. From July 7, when the tanks were opened, to October 19, the total rainfall was 24.11 inches. Computing, from these figures for the two thousandth part of an acre, it is found that the amount of rainwater falling on one of the tanks dur¬ ing this period was 330J4 gallons. The average amount collected from each tank during the same period was 160J4 gal¬ lons. It will thus be seen that nearly one- half of the water that fell on the tanks was collected as drainage water. No doubt the amount would have been some¬ what less had a crop of weeds or grass been allowed to grow over the entire sur¬ face, and had the trees been making a normal growth.  We have made fairly complete anal¬ yses of these samples, and from these re¬ sults have calculated the total amount of fertilizing constituents washed out of the soil, and then converted these results into pounds of commercial materials per acre. For example: the total nitrogen found in tank No. 1 was calculated to its equiv¬ alent in nitrate of soda, and this amount multiplied by two thousand to bring it to pounds per acre. The results are set forth in Table I:  LOSS OF NITROGEN.  From this it is seen that nitrogen com¬ pounds are lost in much larger amounts   than any of the other materials. This was to be expected, inasmuch as these compounds are not held in the soil in the same way that phosphoric acid and pot¬ ash are, but we had not expected to find such a wide difference. In this case, how¬ ever, it is probable that the loss is greater than it would be under ordinary field con¬ ditions, on account of the soil having been thoroughly stirred and aerated before be¬ ing placed in the tanks, and the subse¬ quent abundant rains having made the conditions for nitrification especially fa- favorable. However, the loss is prob¬ ably but a fair indication of what we may expect, and some light is thrown on the question of the time when these losses are heaviest. Since October 19th, 1910, the rainfall has been comparatively light, and the amount of water passing through the tanks correspondingly small. As a result, the loss of fertilizing constituents is very much less than during the rainy period. This accords with results ob¬ tained at Rothamsted, England. There the heavy rains come during the winter months, and it is found that the loss of nitrates is great when nitrogenous mate¬ rials are applied in the fall, but is reduced to a very small amount when these mate¬ rials are applied in the spring. There was found also a far greater loss of nitrates than of phosphoric acid and potash.  LOSS OF OTHER CONSTITUENTS.  Next after nitrogen, lime and magnesia are lost in greatest amounts, while potash and phosphoric acid are lost in compara¬ tively small quantities.  The accompanying diagram shows the amounts, in parts per million parts of            FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   109   water, of the potash and phosphoric acid or potash. In this particular soil there is in the seven samples from Tank i. The about twice as much phosphoric acid as large amount of the nitrogenous materi- nitrogen.

The slow way in which the nat¬ ural phosphates dissolve in the ground waters, no doubt, accounts in part for this. It is certainly not due to the absence of phosphates, for in many places in the State the soil is better supplied with phos¬ phoric acid than it is with either nitrogen   in saying that because we do not find phosphoric acid in the drainage water it is not available for plant growth. The magnificent and abundant growth of hardwoods and 1 other vegetation in some of our hammocks must convince us that such a view is not well founded, for the ash of some of these is high in phosphoric acid. In this connection it may be pointed out that the orange tree and fruit requiie less phosphoric acid than they do of either                              no        nitrogen or potash. This is shown in results obtained in our experimental Table 2, the figures for which are taken grove. This grove is located on the bor-   Table II.

From this it is seen that the amount of potash in the leaves is more than four times as great as the phosphoric acid, while in the fruit the amount of potash is nearly six times as great as the phosphoric acid. When we couple this faqt with the further facts that the phosphoric acid is not lost in the drainage waters to an ap¬ preciable extent, and that our soils are almost universally deficient in potash, we are led to ask the question, “Have not, in some cases at least, our formulas con¬ tained relatively too much phosphoric acid or too little potash? In the light of the facts before us, is a formula containing 7 or 8 per cent, available phosphoric acid and 8 to 10 per cent, potash a rational one?” Without stopping to give a di¬ rect answer to this question at present, we may ask the further question, “Is it necessary to apply phosphoric acid so often as we are accustomed to do?” To answer this question I will refer briefly to   der of Lake Harris, and the soil is a brownish red, coarse sand, well supplied with natural phosphate. The trees were set out in January, 1909, nearly two and a half years ago. One plot out of forty- eight receives no fertilizer whatever; and while this plot is not the best, it does stand well up in the list, its rank being twelfth in increase of size, as determined by measurement of the trunk. But for a slight yellowing of the leaves, indicating the need of nitrogen, it would be impos¬ sible except by the merest accident for a stranger to pick it out from among the other forty-seven plots, all of which have been fertilized. We also have in this grove four plots which have received their phosphoric acid in the form of finely- ground raw rock. These also stand well up in the list of those having made the best growth, one being second, another sixth, another nineteenth, and another twenty-second, all in the first half. While we should not be too hasty in drawing conclusions until the work has pro-                         FLORIDA ;STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   in   gressed farther, at the same time I am free to make the assertion that in the making of a grove natural phosphates (that is, finely-ground untreated rock) may, to a large extent, replace the acid- treated rock or acid phosphate. A ton per acre of this finely ground rock should be applied at the time of setting out the trees, and an additional ton at intervals of two to three years. If the soil is kept well cultivated and is supplied with an abundance of humus, and receives an oc¬ casional treatment of lime or ground lime¬ stone, no orange tree in such a grove will suffer for the want of phosphoric acid. This method would materially reduce the cost of fertilizing, because the materials would be cheaper and the expense of handling less. These statements are made with reference to the orange, but will, I believe, apply equally to the pineapple. They are not intended to apply to vege¬ table and other quick-growing crops ; though I am confident that the raw rock may, with profit, be used much more widely than it is at the present time.  Reference should be made to the fig¬ ures for Tank 4, since the results for this tank are higher than for the others. I11 explanation of this it may be stated that in taking out the soil for this tank, char¬ coal and bits of burnt sticks were found in the first foot or two, showing that at this point a stump or pile of logs had been burnt when the land was cleared a few months before. The presence of ashes made the conditions for nitrifica¬ tion more favorable, with the result that more of the nitrogen of the organic mat¬ ter was converted into nitrates than in the other tanks, and the nitrates thus formed appear in the drainage water. The pres¬   ence of ashes would also explain the high phosphoric acid, potash, lime, and mag¬ nesia in this tank. This affords an ex¬ cellent illustration of how alkaline mate¬ rials applied to our acid soils promote nitrification, and is perhaps a hint to us to apply them at some other time than at the beginning of the rainy season, unless there is a vigorous crop on the land to take up the nitrates that are formed.  The question will naturally be asked r “Would not some of this soluble matter be again brought within reach of the plants by capillary action, under nor¬ mal field conditions?” At times when rains are not heavy, no doubt some of the fertilizing constituents would thus be brought within reach of the plant. In times of heavy and long-continued rains, and especially during the rainy season, when it is raining almost every day and water is constantly running out of the soil into small streams, ponds, lakes and rivers, we necessarily lose all that material which is dissolved in the water that runs off. It is a part of our research to learn under what system of fertilizing we can get good results, and at the same time have a minimum of loss in the drainage waters.  The work is only begun, but it bids fair to give us some really valuable results. It will take several years of careful and painstaking work to secure the knowledge that we need. As funds are available, other units or batteries of tanks will be installed to enable us to take up other phases of the fertilizer problem.  Credit is here given to Assistant Chem¬ ist Mr. S. E. Collison, for a large share of the analytical work involved.     Tropical Plants   E. N. Reasoner.   Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  It is a lamentable fact that many of the new settlers of Florida have come here with the impression that the whole of Florida has a tropical climate: this has been given to them by indiscrimi¬ nate newspaper articles from enthusi¬ astic writers calling our vegetation “tropical/' and by scheming land agents stating that certain places were below the “frost line" so that most tender plants might be grown without dam¬ age from cold. This has resulted in many failures and disappointments, and in consequence a great number of people have been turned against our State, and give prejudiced reports tO' our further harm. Our Society should seek to correct both the newspaper ar¬ ticles and reports and advertisements of unscrupulous real-estate men, giv¬ ing a true acount, without any reserva¬ tion whatever, of conditions as we of larger experience have found them. It seems strange, indeed, that ever since the time of Ponce de Leon, people have been prone to tell untruths about Florida.  The State of Florida extends through over six degrees of latitude, of which only the lower three have a   sufficiently high temperature for tropi¬ cal trees, and even this area is liable to sudden frosts across its entire terri¬ tory, any winter. Yet the land along the coast, and interior portions pro¬ tected by lakes or by extra altitude, is valuable for growing tender vegetation in immense variety. A difference of even one mile away from coast or lake protection may be fatal, so no one should plant tender trees without thor¬ ough investigation at first hand. There are very numerous varieties of tropical fruits produced in our warmest sec¬ tions, and the intelligent planting of more trees will certainly prove profit¬ able under the right conditions coupled with the owners watchfulness in providing protection from cold when needed. Very many winters have passed, in my recollection, with¬ out sufficient frost at Oneco to even kill beans, but one can never be sure of an open winter, and protection must be provided to a greater or less extent, depending on the location. Our most southern coast produces many fruits without any protection at all and the trees are very seldom injured, so that judicious selection of land will reduce the protection necessary to a mini¬ mum.                         .113   FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   Small trees can be protected by banking the trunks with surface soil, also by standing brush etc., around them during the winter. After a tree gets up to six teet or more in height it will stand a considerable white frost —one that would kill a small plant to the ground. When cut back by frost, a great many subjects will sprout up, but this is a loss of time and hence the trifling labor necessary for the early protection is well spent.  Firing orchards by the use of crude oil promises to be our best means of protection on a large scale, but of course wood or coal may be used if cheap enough in the locality.  Protection by the use of sheds with skeleton roofs which are covered in winter with cloth affords an absolute protection, if firing is resorted to at dangerous temperatures, the cloth keeping out the wind and giving off very little heat. We find that a very small amount of heat is necessary in such a shed, and that firing is rarely necessary over once or twice a winter. This is, perhaps, expensive, but for certain subjects may be used with a surety of success, even in middle Flor¬ ida.  Protection by building walls around a small area and using fires, even with¬ out any roof, is also a success, as has been demonstrated by Mr. Millen, of Dade City, who has three fourths of an acre so arranged for a guava orch¬ ard. The walls around this orchard are fourteen feet high and only on the north and west sides, yet during six¬   teen years he has lost but a little growth and raises immense quantities of fruit yearly. The guavas are set fairly close, being twelve by twelve feet, and this helps conserve the warmth. The fruit of the guava is so valuable for cooking in all ways that this fruit alone may be the source of a large income to the growers of Flor¬ ida.  The pineapple growers seem to have worked out a very economical system of shedding, using their lumber for walls and woven lath and wire for cov¬ er, suspended on a very light frame¬ work of timber and heavy wire; pines so grown are undoubtedly of superior size and quality, making a profit on the shedding expense. This system would not of course be applicable to other tropical fruits, as the pines require the shade continually and the lath is not taken down at all. For purposes of protecting tropical trees under a cover¬ ed shed, the cloth or other material must be used only when absolutely necessary or else the trees will be in¬ jured by the lack of sunshine, and also fail to set fruit properly. Our system has been to fasten down very thin cot¬ ton cloth, slightly heavier than cheese cloth in December, and to reef back portions of this late in January to allow entrance of sun, wind and bees. If nec¬ essary these portions are quickly closed. The cloth is totally removed in March. The ideal shed would have about one-half or two-thirds of the low¬ er part of the wall of lumber, the upper portion of removable cloth so arranged        1 14  that ventilation could readily be effect¬ ed, and with a cloth roof easily spread or removed at will, as by the Berry system. We find that our permanent wooden walls cast far too much shade for best results with most fruits.  For a heating system under cloth one must provide a means of carrying out all smoke and gases, so we devised cheap sheet iron stoves for burning wood, that cost at a local tin shop but $1.25 each. For these we use about 25 feet of five inch stove pipe stuck into permanently fixed wooden flues.  The long lines of pipe radiate about all the heat, and also eliminate any possibility of burning the wooden flues. We use eighteen stoves per acre, each stove being 24 inches long, 16 inches wide on the ground, and 16 inches high, burning coarse stove wood. With these in use we have maintained an average temperature of 40 degrees in¬ side when the outside temperature was under 24 degrees. We do not light the fires until the temperature inside falls to 32 degrees, as the foliage being without dew under the cloth does not readily freeze.  A short list of fruit trees and plants suitable for sheds in the upper part of South Florida would include the Gua¬ va, Pineapple, Pawpaw, Roseapple, Man¬ go, Surinam Cherry, Barbados Cherry, Cavendish Banana, Avocado and Sapo- dilla. This brief list may be added to quite extensively if one cares to grow rare and interesting fruits not com¬ monly seen. Extending this list we have at Oneco almost fifty sorts of the finest Indian mangoes—(which being   without fibre, are of superlative value) — and various other subjects under test; in fact, our acre shed has been used now for ten years as an experimental orchard with excellent results. Seed¬ ling mangos and avocados are so large that we do not consider their cultiva¬ tion under a shed likely to prove profit¬ able, but grafted kinds so grown, whose fruit brings a much higher price, should pay handsomely. Their season of fruiting is also more under control than that of seedlings, hence one can raise kinds for ripening at certain times of the year.  In this connection I wish to warn mango growers against the importa¬ tion of mango seeds from any part of the world in which the terrible mango weevil is known, or liable to occur. This insect has proved more harmful to the mango industry of Hawaii and the Philippines than the whitefly to the citrus industry of Florida. It annually destroys 45 to 75 per cent, of the man¬ go crops in those sections of the tropics where it has been introduced. The mature insect is readily imported in seeds from infested countries, and a re¬ quest has been made President Hume tc have an article on the life history of this dangerous pest inserted in the Society’s year-book.  We find, too, that irrigation pays for intensive culture of fruit trees under sheds.  For our most protected areas near the coast of South Florida, from Clear¬ water on the West Coast to Merritt’s Island on the East Coast, may be grown an immense variety of tropical        FLORIDA /STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   fruits, economic and ornamental plants, trees, etc., in the open air, with but slight risk of damage. The avo¬ cado and mango, especially, promise much for an extensive orchard busi¬ ness and are now being quite rapidly put out in the best budded stock, while pineapple plants have been grown in the open air over thousands of acres for many years. The Harts Choice and Orinoco bananas may be successfully grown all over South Florida without any protection at all, as the loss of   115  leaves and some fruit does not amount to a serious check to the production of a fine lot of fruit in summer and au¬ tumn. The common guava as well as the rare Dovyalis Gardneri, should be grown all over South Florida outdoors, even without protection, as they bear on sprouts of but fifteen or eighteen months, thus, if even one winter in several is without severe frost, these will bear well the following summer and autumn.   MANGOES.   John B. Beach.   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen:  Progress in mango growing has gone forward steadily since our last report. Last year the crop of Mul- gobas was small, owing probably to the fog and rainy weather which oc¬ curred about the time of blooming, and the demand at 25c each f. o. b. far exceeded the supply. This year pros¬ pects for a crop seem much more prom¬ ising, and we have no fear that the de¬ mand will fail to keep pace with the supply. Many new varieties of great¬ er or less merit fruited for the first time last summer, and more are going to bear their first crop this year. It is too early to tell much about the value of these new sorts till they have pro¬ duced several consecutive crops, but none has yet appeared which surpassed the Mulgoba in market qualities, and   shipping value. This fruit is more deli¬ cate than the common seedlings, and more subject to loss from fungus and other causes while green, and to secure a good crop pains must be taken to destroy fungus with Bordeaux, and also a little worm which girdles the stem of the fruit and causes it to drop before mature. We think arsenate of lead applied with the Bordeaux will nip this fellow’s career in the bud, and the slight expense attendant on one or two such sprayings is repaid many fold by the increased value of the crop. Bennett Alphonso continues to hold its own as a heavier yielder than Mulgoba, and nearly as good a market fruit. Rajpurri is putting on its third crop, and continues to yield well and produce fibreless fruit of most excel¬ lent flavor and rich quality. The little     n6        Round Amini bore an enormous crop of most beautiful fibreless fruit last year, as heavy a load as any turpentine seedling, apricot yellow with carmine cheeks, but this year, owing to dry weather, it is late in putting out, and owing to this fact has at present writ¬ ing not blossomed. Many trees of other varieties are in the same posi¬ tion, and while many are loaded with half grown fruit some have not as yet blossomed, but may still bloom and produce a late crop. Avocadoes made a good crop last year and indications are that they will do as well this sea¬ son. Prices for late varieties were quite up to the standard last fall, and the demand for Trapp trees for plant¬ ing far exceeds the supply. California is getting to work in earnest on Avo¬ cado culture, and many buds of the Trapp have been sent there by mail, though the laws will not permit the   entrance of any nursery stock from Florida.  As to the pineapple industry, it seems likely that it has now reached the rock bottom of the late depression caused by a combination of poor sea¬ sons, overproduction of small fruit, and West Indian competition. Perhaps 25 or 30 per cent, of the former acreage has been maintained (discouraged growers having abandoned their fields) and the acreage which has still been kept up will this year produce a good crop of first class fruit, and it will come at a time when the foreign crop will be out of our way, and undoubted¬ ly yield a remunerative revenue. In future, intensive culture and reduced acreage will undoubtedly put this in¬ dustry on its feet once more, for Cuban competition has felt the same disaster of over production, and fields have been abandoned there just as much as here.     PINEAPPLES IN HAWAII.   C. G. White.   Mr. President and Members of the Flor¬ ida Horticidtural Society :  My experience with pines is of six years length, and in this locality. This region will turn out about 120,000 cases of canned pineapple this year.  I have about 35 acres planted, about 10,000 plants per acre: good to run 20 tons of fruit per acre or better, weighed without tops. Some acres have gone   as high as 30 tons, and one year my average was 25 tons. This statement applies only to the first two crops of a planting. Such yields are made in no other locality in the islands.  The variety planted is the Smooth Cayenne. The Red Spanish is hardier, but very inferior in quantity and qual¬ ity. None of the new hybrids tried so far, Matthams, Dade, Eden, Deleciosa,     *           FLORIDA /STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   Jensen, or Coquina are in the least promising competitors, although deli¬ cious eating.  The qualifications for a first class canning pine are close texture, tender flesh, good flavor, four or five pounds weight, and barrel shaped with shallow pits that there may not be too much waste in peeling and sizing.  The crop is produced generally without fertilizing.  Our soil is heavy, containing so much iron that it acts like clay, except that it is fairly porous when not puddled. The Department of Agriculture some years ago remarked that if the sample submitted was a pineapple soil, it was a most unique one.  The temperature changes here are inside of from 50 to 85 degrees F., and there are no sudden changes. The rain¬ fall averages about 80 inches a year. Much ditching needs to be done as pines are intolerant of wet feet. I am ridging the rows on my more level lands now, but cannot say with what success. Pines grow best in warm weather, dry soil, with heavy dews and light showers. A great deal of culti¬ vation is necessary here. Our cultiva¬ tion is by horse sweeps as long as possible, and by scuffle hoe all the time. I cul¬ tivate once in ten days when I can. During the harvest and planting season everything is neglected except the pressing business in hand, so that for four months cultivation suffers.  We use Jap. labor. Some of it is remarkably good on routine jobs. The Jap. has a temperament that makes him move on just as he gets really val¬   11 7  uable. He likes new ventures even when he loses on it. So it is a heart¬ breaking job to teach scientific meth¬ ods. The men are all able to read and write their own language. The Jap. intelligence has been greatly overesti¬ mated in the United States. I pay $22.50 a month with house and fire¬ wood, and give a bonus at the end of the year which is likely to bring the wage up to $28.00. The bonus is to hold the labor if possible and keep the interest up. It is based on net profit and the days worked. The average Jap. likes to work but three weeks a month. I am usually short handed. You see I do not have cheap labor. The ton cost is $9.00 to $12.00 and the cannery pays $16.00.  The preparation of the ground is not easy, guava and boulders are stubborn things, and the soil is difficult to fit. We aim to give about three plowings, ten inches deep, and many harrowings. Planting is done in the very loosest soil condition possible. This fitting ex¬ tends over months for the purpose of sweeting the soil, and of killing out the Thielaviopsis. This rot is our greatest trouble in both plant and fruit. Luckily direct sunlight quickly kills it.  We plant with success from March to October 30th, but the best results come from April to September plant¬ ing. Most of the planting has to be done, however, in September and Oct¬ ober.  We get a crop in from 12 to 24 months, depending on the season of planting and the sort of plant used. Shoots produce the soonest, then slips,     n8        and then tops. Tops give the largest crop and the most uniform season of ripening, and they are safest for a novice to use. On the other hand we often get three crops from shoots while we are getting two from a top planting.  The main harvest season comes in summer, there is a secondary ripening in winter or early spring, and there are scattering fruit all the rest of the year.  In most weather at least crowns and slips really need no stripping to grow pretty well. But all the sorts of plants root more quickly and uniformly when stripped. It is not good practice to neglect this slow job. The knobs that are fleshy are cut off the end of the slips when prepared for planting, but the plants are all shucked sidewise, the leaves coming off together. Shuck¬ ing sidewise damages the stalk of the plant least. A shoot may be mostly shucked in one operation if three or four of the bracts or leaves are started along up the plant. The thumb is mainly used in this side shucking. We never shuck up into the fender stalk of the shoot beyond the showing of brown; or beyond the biggest diameter of the stalk in slips in tops. I like best fresh plants, fresh shucked for plant¬ ing.- If mealy bug is present all plants are dipped in whale oil soap, using i pound to eight gallons of water.  For marking the row a cable clothes line is used, and the space between plants is indicated on it by a few wraps of wire inserted between the line strands, thus securing its position. The   planting is done on that side of the line that will leave it unimpeded, when the line is moved to mark the next row. A good idea for a line stake is an iron one made of a half inch rod, with a cross piece welded to the middle, to serve as a shoulder for the foot in forcing it into the ground. This saves time and trouble. The stake needs to be about three feet long.  A grub mattox is used in planting. The mattox man swings the pick into the ground and pulls it towards him, his assistant inserts the plant behind the mattox before the dirt has a chance to partially fill the hole. The mattox man then makes a little jab to bring dirt to the inserted plant. Packing the soil about these plants is worse than a waste of energy.  This team of two men will mark and plant (but not distribute) 5,000 plants a day. The tops are put in as deeply as possible without getting dirt into the center. The shoots are planted six to eight inches deep.  A day’s planting and preparation of plants is being systematized here as 800 shoots, or 1,000 slips, or 1,200 tops per man of the gang.  The ripe pines are brought out of the field in two trays slung to a shoul¬ der pole, the tops are removed and the fruit are loaded into boxes at the road¬ side to go to the cannery scales. This Japanese method of moving the pines out of the field seems hard to improve on.  The pine is a fastidious plant. If conditions are at all off, the plant loses interest in life. Land that has been      FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   at all puddled shows up badly, while poor drainage is sure death. Planta¬ tions of old land even with fertilizer cannot compare with those on virgin   soil. So our soil problem is not rota¬ tion but rest for some years with a leguminous cover if possible. The best cover so far is the Pigeon pea.   TROPICAL FRUITS RECIPES AND CONFECTIONS.   Effie Stone Rolfs.   Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  From my first experience with tropical fruits when my candied citron proved a failure, and my guava jelly proved to be a syrup, I have made an effort to obtain and try to use every tropical fruit raised in Florida.  On looking up the items for this article, I find I have used nearly thirty species of tropical fruits. These notes and re¬ cipes have been written with the hope that it will tempt some of you to use more Florida grown products. If we realize the importance of fruit in our daily diet, it would be regarded as a necessity rather than as a luxury,  Julius Davis Chandler in a magazine article writes:  We are told in Paris that a woman made herself wealthy by collecting peel from hotels and cafes. She hired girls to cleanse it. Then she sold it to distillers, cordial makers, and perfumers, according to quality.  Now, I would not advise that we get rich in this way, but we are certainly letting a lot of raw material go to waste in our packing houses and groves.  The strictly tropical fruits are known to comparatively few even in our own   State. Many of the recipes here given are not original but occur in widely scat¬ tered literature, such as the Florida Farm¬ er and Fruit Grower, The Florida Agri¬ culturist, the bulletins published by the United States Department of Agricul¬ ture; bulletins published by Florida Ex¬ periment Station and Tropical Agricul¬ ture and Cookery by Mrs. F. R. Rams- dal, and in other places. Others have been given to me by friends and still others are the results (sometimes success¬ fully, sometimes unsuccessfully) of my repeated efforts to use tropical fruits. Other recipes for the use of tropical fruits, may be found in Riley M. Fletch- er-Berry’s Fruit Recipes.  Please note that as the acid in fruit may vary according to variety or ripeness of same, the quantity of sugar required will necessarily vary.  A good food chopper (not one where food is forced through holes) is indispen- sible in making marmalades, sherbets, ices, etc. The tropical fruits are paticu- larly adapted to the making of quickly prepared desserts, as well as those prepar¬ ed and set aside for several hours to chill.  A most refreshing ice may be quickly prepared if a cup of shredded fruit or fruit juice be sweetened and kept in the     120        refrigerator. Two tablespoonfuls of this added to a cup of shaved ice is good at any time (and would be enjoyed right now).  The candied fruits are so much used to serve at afternoon teas and similar gatherings that several recipes are given.  Apricots.  Being imbued with the idea of trying every fruit on the market some Florida grown apricots were purchased. They were good to eat from hand but when cooked the fibre had so toughened that to use the fruit at all, it had to be sifted. Without sifting, one could as well eat boiled wiregrass.  Avocado.  According to Patrick Brown (Civil and Natural History of Jamaica, London, 1789, p. 214) horses, cows, cats, dogs, as well as all sorts of birds feed on this fruit.  Growers well know that poultry will eat every fruit hanging near the ground. Rats will climb the trees to make a meal from it, and crabs and gophers are fond of the fallen fruits.  The number of ways an avocado may be served is as varied as the possible salad combinations. One should not, however, deluge this rich fruit with oil or over¬ power with condiments its mild nutty flavor.  A green avocado is not edible. They should not be used until the meat cuts smoothly with a teaspoon and is about the consistency of well-frozen ice cream. No one should attempt to eat the fruit after it has softened, as it becomes rancid like old butter and is simply nauseating.   The simplest way to use the fruit is to cut it in half, remove the seed, and dip out meat with a spoon. If liked, add salt, pepper, lime-juice, or vinegar. It is well to note that the less the meat of the avo- dcao is handled the better it retains its freshness and nutty flavor. Much hand¬ ling deteriorates from the delicacy of this fruit.  Sandwich —Remove the meat from the skins. Add such condiments as are desired and spread evenly on thin slices of bread. Serve soon after being prepared.  Salad —Remove the meat from the skins. 'Cut into half-inch cubes, add a small amount of chopped onion and serve on lettuce leaves with dressing made with fruit juice.  In Soups —This is a very popular way of using this salad fruit of the tropics. It should be served either in skin or re¬ moved and cut in small cubes. If in the skin, dip a portion in soup spoon before filling spoon with soup. If served in cubes, drop two or three in soup at a time, and when these are eaten add more. The avo¬ cado must not remain long in the hot soup or it will become oily.  As Garnish for Salads —The unbroken shell of fruit may be used as a salad cup. The meat cut in thin slices or small cubes adds much to the attractiveness of a po¬ tato, salmon or other salad. The cut slices or cubes should be carefully handled and added to the salad just before serving so as to retain all freshness and flavor.  Barbados Cherry.  Preserved Cherries —  1 cup sugar J4 cup water           121   Boil and add i quart Cherries Let boil fifteen minutes and place in jars and seal.  Cherry Jelly —Cover fruit with water and boil. When fruit is soft, remove from fire and strain. Take three cups of hot juice. Boil and skim. Add two cups granulated sugar and boil again until jel¬ lied.  Cherry Sweet Pickle — i cup sugar i cup vinegar  Cinnamon, cloves and spice to taste Heat the liquid and pour over one quart of cherries. Let this cool. Pour off the liquid and reheat to the boiling point. Put fruit into the liquid and when boiling put in jars and seal. If there is not enough syrup formed to cover the fruit, more sugar and vinegar in the above propor¬ tions may be added. This liquid should be at the boiling point when added.  Bergamot Lime or Limeberry.  In Guam these are much used as a mar¬ malade.  Marmalade —By taking a sharp-pointed knife and inserting it at the stem end, the seed may be easily forced out. Then soak the fruit over night in salt water to remove all the oil from the skin. Repeat this, changing the water, until enough of the oil has been removed to render the fruit palatable. When this point is reach¬ ed boil until fruit is tender. Drain and add to syrup mentioned below. Cook and seal in well sterilized jars.  Syrup for each quart of pulp: i pound sugar i pint water   Candied —Select large fruits and re¬ move seeds and oil as for marmalade. Then cook in syrup until they begin to crystalize, when they may be spread on a plate to dry. They are equal to but diff¬ erent from Marachino cherries for con¬ fection or garnish.  Syrup for each pound of fruit: i pound sugar i pint water  Cashew.  In Tropical Agriculture and Cooking, page 16, published at Nueva Gerona, Isle of Pines, the author gives rule for pre¬ serves and also for nut candy, and fur¬ ther states in regard to the nut:  ‘‘The kernel is delicious either raw or roasted. To roast them the natives spread them on a clean piece of ground, light a large palm leaf and hold it over the nuts. The oil soon ignites and by keeping up a fanning motion they are kept burning until the oil in the shell is exhausted, and the kernel is roasted. The shell contains a thick oily caustic juice called cardole, the fumes of which are very disagreeable, if not dangerous, while roasting.”  I have roasted these nuts in the oven. Then removed and eaten the kernel and found them excellent, but from the above and also the report of the case of poison¬ ing in Washington recently, one needs to exercise care in roasting them.  Cecropia.  This peculiar finger-shaped fruit much resembles the fig. It can be eaten fresh   122        from the tree or made into paste as is done with figs, for cake filling, i cup fruit y 2 cup sugar y 2 cup water  Boil until thick and spread between layers of cake. If needed to thicken, a teaspoonful of cornstarch or arrowroot may be added.  Carissa.  (Carissa Grandiflora.)  My one trial was quite satisfactory. Place the fruit, either whole or cut in half —the latter preferred—in boiling syrup prepared by using one-third as much su¬ gar as fruit with water to moisten. Boil fifteen minutes and seal in sterilized jars.  Jelly or Marmalade —This was not tried, but will doubtless make either of .above according to usual methods.  Cerinam.  ( Monster a d eliciosa .)  This fruit is shaped like a huge ear of 'corn, the pips resembling the kernels. These pips when ripe, turn a beautiful light green color and are easily detached from center. It may be served either alone or blended with sliced banana or other fruit.  The fruit can also be cut cross-wise and served in slices. Do not use until well ripened. A peculiar feature is that this fruit begins to ripen at base. Only a portion is ready for use at one time. The rest must be laid aside to ripen.  Citron.  This is one of our citrus fruits that is not usable except when candied or made into preserve, pickle, or marmalade. Fruit   should be taken either entirely green or just before maturing.  Curing Citron —(Florida Agriculturist, April i9 ; 1905)—Cut fruit in half and remove pulp. Place rinds in strong brine for two weeks. Take out and boil in fresh water until tender.  Then a process of boiling in syrup com¬ mences. Four different syrups consist¬ ing of sugar, glucose and water are em¬ ployed. By the first boiling the brine is entirely eliminated and the three consecu¬ tive boilings in the syrup make the fruit sweet and palatable. The citron is then laid on trays and subjected to the drying treatment until it hardens. After hard¬ ening, it is powdered over with specially prepared sugar and packed for market.  Family Use —Cut the fruit into thin slices or into inch cubes. Soak over night in salt water. Drain and cover with cold water. Let it boil and taste to determine if a sufficient amount of oil has been removed to render fruit palatable. If not, repeat the process. When the right flavor has been obtained, boil until the citron is tender. Drain off the liquid, and put into syrup made as follows: To each pound of fruit allow one pound of sugar and one of water. When the liquid is boiling add the prepared fruit and con¬ tinue to cook for one-half hour; and then put into sterilized jar and seal. When wanted to use in fruit cake, puddings, etc., drain off syrup and cut in pieces as when using the commercial product.  Confection —Prepare the fruit as di¬ rected abdVe. Drain the syrup from the fruit. Heat the syrup and replace the fruit. Boil until syrup candies. Place on plate to dry off and when dry sprinkle with dry sugar.       FLORIDA >STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   123   Sweet Pickle —Prepare the fruit as di¬ rected for family use. Then place in a syrup which is prepared as follows :  1 cup sugar 1 cup vinegar Spices to taste  Boil and add fruit. Cook thirty min¬ utes and seal.  Marmalade —Cut fruit and prepare as for family use, but before placing in the syrup, run the slices or cubes through a coarse food chopper. Cook it in the syrup for ten minutes and seal. When it is removed from the jar for use, it can be candied or not as one prefers. It is a very valuable addition to one’s supply of culinary sweets.  Dates.  Dates may be used in puddings, and cakes, or they may be stuffed with some tropical nut as a confection, (which see)  Figs.  The fresh fruit may be used in a va¬ riety of ways.  Fresh —Cut the fruit in slices and sprinkle with sugar. Serve with whipped or mock cream. Some of the larger va¬ rieties are easily peeled and in this way make a more dainty dish.  C armed —  1 peck figs 6 pounds sugar 1 quart water  Make a syrup with the sugar and water. Add the figs and cook until the fruit is clear and transparent. Place in well sterilized jars, and seal at once.   Sweet Pickle —  1 peck of figs 1 quart of sugar 1 quart of vinegar  Boil the vinegar and sugar and then add spices to taste. Then pour this over the fruit. When it has cooled, drain the fruit and if there is not enough liquid to cover the fruit add more vinegar and su¬ gar. Heat this syrup to the boiling point and pour over the partially cooked fruit. Continue the boiling for ten minutes. Put the fruit in well sterilized jars, and cover with boiling syrup. Seal while hot.  Cake Filling —  1 pint figs, (canned or dried)  2 tablespoonfuls sugar  Juice of one lemon or orange  Pass the figs through the medium cut¬ ter or food chopper. Add the sugar and cook until they form a thick pulp then add the lemon juice, beat well and when cool spread between the layers of a cake Ice the cake with plain icing.  Sandwiches —  1 cup of figs (canned or dried)  J4 cup nuts  2 tablespoons of fruit juice  Pass the figs and nuts through the food chopper; blend with the fruit juice and spread between slices of well buttered bread.  Pudding —  1 cup of butter and suet mixed  1 cup of syrup  T eopr  i teaspoon of soda  3 cups of flour  1 cup of figs, canned  1 cup of citron, crystallized  2 teaspoons of cinnamon  1 teaspoon of allspice         124        Mix ingredients and steam three hours. Serve with hard sauce flavored with fruit juice or pineapple sauce (which see).  Guava.  The much abused guava can be used in any way that an apple or peach can be. The jelly has a world-wide reputation, but so far as I know the only published scientific method of preparing same is that given by Mr. John Belling. Annual Report, Florida Experiment Station, 1908.  Jelly —(Annual Report of Fla. Exp. Sta. 1908; Press Bulletin No. 118) :  1. Cut the guava in pieces with a sharp spoon (not iron) or with a plated knife.  2. Heat them until quite soft in an enameled or aluminum vessel with a small amount of water at the bottom or in a double-boiler without water.  3. Put the soft fruit in a strong cloth bag or folded in a cloth between boards, under a strong pressure.  4. Measure the hot juice. Heat it in a deep clean pan (leaving room for the extensive frothing), adding a quantity of granulated white sugar equal in bulk to the undiluted juice.  5. When the sugar has dissolved the hot solution may be filtered through cloth.  6. Boil down until the thermometer in the liquid marks the point which gives jelly of the color and consistency de¬ sired; which may be 113 degrees C. (235 degrees F.) or some neighboring temper¬ ature.   7. Run the hot liquid into glass jars or molds. Tough jelly which is not sticky may be satisfactorily packed in shallow ornamental boxes, as in done in. Cuba.  From careful experiments made by Mr. Belling, he states that the depth of color seems to be increased by additional amount of acid, prolonged boiling, and higher temperature at which boiling is stopped. His full report is very interest¬ ing.  Canned No. 1—  8 quarts of guavas 1 quart of sugar 3 quarts of water  Pour the sugar into the water and let it come to the boiling point. Peel and quarter or halve the fruit and add it to the boiling syrup. Cook this until the fruit can be easily pierced with a silver fork. Then put into well sterilized jars  Canned No. 2—Prepare the syrup as directed above. Peel the fruit and re¬ move the seeds with silver spoon (If an iron spoon is used the fruit will be dark colored.) Put the meats into syrup. Boil for ten minutes. Transfer to well steril¬ ized jars and seal at once.  Canned No. 3—Prepare the fruit and syrup as directed in No. 2. Add three quarts of water to the pulp. Boil for ten minutes and rub through a collander to remove the seeds. To the strained pulp add one quart of sugar. When boiling add the meats of fruit. Boil the meats and pulp for ten minutes. Place this in a well sterilized jar and seal at once.  Preserves —Prepare the fruit either of the three ways described above and place in the heated syrup using two times as much sugar as for canning.      FLORIDA »STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   125   Marmalade —True marmalade is made with only fruit pulp and sugar in propor¬ tion of one pint of sugar to one quart of pulp . Cook the fruit as for making jelly (which see), and rub it through a col¬ ander to remove the seeds. Rinse the preserving kettle with cold water before putting the pulp into it, in order that there may be a slight coat of moisture on sides and bottom. Put in the guava pulp and sugar together and boil this for about an hour. Pour into well sterilized jars and seal. It may be kept also in jelly glasses covered with parafine.  Guava Cheese —I did not succeed with this until I obtained the pulp from a jelly factory. Use two cups of sugar to three of pulp. Cook as directed for making jelly and cover tumblers with parafine. This will slice like cheese and is most de¬ licious having the rich guava flavor.  Sweet Pickle —Peel the fruit and re¬ move the pulp, as for canning No. 2.  1 cup vinegar 1 cup sugar Spices to taste  Boil the liquid and pour over fruit. Let this cool and repeat the operation until the fruit is tender. Seal up in sterilized jars.  Toast —This makes a most delicious dish for breakfast as well as for dessert. Peel and cook the fruit. Sweeten to taste and pour hot over buttered toast.  Dumpling No. 1—Place one pint of fruit in porcelain kettle; sweeten to taste and when about half tender drop in biscuit dough. Serve with cream or sauce made with sweetened guava juice thick¬ ened with cornstarch or mock cream (which see).   Dumpling No. 2—Make a biscuit dough with  1 cup flour  1 teaspoon baking powder  1 teaspoon lard  Milk to soften  Roll and cut into squares.  In the center place handful of peeled guavas from which seeds and pulp have been removed and placed to cook. Roll the dumplings up and place in baking dish where the juice strained from the pulp added to one-fourth cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon butter are boiling. Bake fifteen minutes (?) basting frequently. Serve with sugar and cream, guava sauce, or mock cream.  Mock Cream —This makes an excellent substitute for whipped cream.  2 tablespoonfuls sugar  1 pint milk  2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch  Heat the milk and sugar to boiling,  add the cornstarch wet in cold water and cook two minutes stirring constantly. Pour this over well beaten whites of two eggs and beat until cold.  Sauce —  1 cup strained guava pulp y 2 cup of sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarch  Boil pulp and sugar and add cornstarch wet with cold water. Boil two minutes- stirring constantly.  Roly-Poly —  1 quart guavas 1 cup sugar 1 cup water 1 tablespoon butter  Peel the fruit and remove the pulp from meat. Boil the pulp and water and strain into baking dish. Add sugar and      126        butter and place on a stove. When boil¬ ing put in roly-poly.  Make the dough as for dumplings. Roll out to one-half inch thick and spread onto this the guava meats. Roll up and place into pan. Bake for thirty minutes, bast¬ ing frequently. Serve with sugar and cream, mock cream, or guava sauce.  Tapioca —.Cook a half-cup of tapioca as directed on carton in which it is re¬ ceived. Pour this over one quart of peel¬ ed and sliced guavas sweetened to taste. Bake for thirty minutes in a covered dish. Then remove lid and cover the tapioca with a meringue made with whites of three eggs and pulverized sugar. Place it in an oven and brown. Serve cold with whipped or mock cream.  Guava Ice Cream —  3 pints milk 2 pints cream i pound sugar i tablespoon gelatine Whites of two eggs i pint guava pulp sweetened  Heat one pint of milk and add the gel¬ atine previously soaked in cold water and pour over well beaten whites of the eggs. When this has cooled off add the re¬ mainder of the milk and well whipped cream. Place this in a freezer and when thoroughly chilled add the sweetened guava pulp. Freeze as ordinary ice cream.  For Dessert No. i—Slice well ripened fleshy guavas and sprinkle with sugar. Let stand several hours before serving. It is a mistake to use seedy guavas for des¬ sert and still worse to use fruit that has not fully ripened. The texture and flavor is greatly improved by slicing and sugar¬ ing them several hours before serving.   It is best to keep dessert in a refrigerator.  For Dessert No. 2 —Peel and cut in halves. Remove the seeds with spoon. Run the pulp through colander, add sugar, and return the pulp to the meats and serve.  Pie —Line the pan with crust and fill with fruit either sliced or quartered and with or without seeds. Sprinkle with sugar and flour. Add a little water and bits of butter and bake.  Kentucky Guava Pie —Line the pan with crust and fill with the sliced or quartered guavas. Sprinkle with sugar, flour, and cinnamon and a tablespoonful of water and bake.  Blanc-Mange —  2 cups of hot milk J4 cup of sugar i egg yolk  4 tablespoons cornstarch 54 cup cold milk 54 teaspoon of salt i teaspoon of butter i teaspoon of vanilla extract  To the scalded milk add the cornstarch mixed with cold milk. Cook until thick¬ ened. Add the sugar, salt and butter which has been blended with the egg yolk. Cook in double boiler. Pour this into moulds dipped in cold water and set aside to cool. Serve with sliced and sugared guavas and syrup as fol¬ lows : One-third of a cup of sugar and one and a half cups of juice. Cook five minutes and cool.  Chutney —Make same as mango chut¬ ney, substituting guava for mango.  Grapefruit.  This fruit is never better than when cut in half, seeds removed, and served for           FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   127     breakfast or as dessert for dinner. An¬ other dessert is made by peeling the fruit carefully and removing from the sections all the white or rag. Pile on dish and sprinkle with sugar.  I Salad —Prepare as above and arrange  in rosette form on plate. Add nuts and  I celery seed and just before serving place Golden Salad dressing in the center.  I Golden Salad Dressing —  2 eggs  y 2 cup of lemon juice  cup of orange, pineapple, or grapefruit juice  I Beat the eggs, add the other ingredi¬  ents, and cook in a double boiler, stirring constantly. Remove from the fire as soon as lightly thickened and cool as quickly as possible.  Sherbet —  2 cups of juice pressed from grapefruit  1 cup of pineapple juice 2 cups of sugar 2 cups of water Juice of one lemon Stiffly beaten whites of two eggs Boil the sugar and water five minutes. When cold add the fruit juices. Place in a freezer and chill before adding whites of eggs. The freezing will make nearly a gallon.  Sherbet —  6 grapefruit 4 cups sugar 1 pint water  1 tablespoonful of gelatine Soak gelatine in water and then bring to a boil. Add sugar and fruit juice. When cool freeze and when partly frozen the whites of two eggs may be added to make a smoother, whiter sherbet.   Grapefruit and Mint Frappe —This de¬ licious and refreshing ice is made by steeping a bunch of fresh mint in a suf¬ ficient amount of hot water to extract the flavor. Strain and while this is cool¬ ing boil together one pint of water and one pound of sugar and a tablespoon of gelatine soaked in one pint of cold water. Add to this one quart of grapefruit juice. Put into a freezer and freeze quickly. Serve in sherbet cups.  Marmalade —Take the peel of ten grapefruit and place them in salty water. Let this soak for two hours. When all is ready cover with water and let it boil until clear. Drain and rinse well and re¬ move the white portion. Put the re¬ mainder through food chopper. While the peel is boiling remove every particle of rag from the fruit and place with five pounds of sugar on the stove to heat. Add chopped peel and cook until thick like jelly. Put into glasses and cover with parafine.  Strazvs or Candied Peel —Cut the peel¬ ing into narrow strips and soak over night in water with a liberal handful of salt. In the morning drain off the water from this and put in cold water. Bring to a boil. Repeat this several times to re¬ move the bitter taste from the peel. In the last water boil it until tender and drain. Prepare a heavy syrup of granu¬ lated sugar and water, enough to cover straws and boil until it spins a thread. Put the straws in and boil until all the moisture has evaporated. Great care is needed at the last to prevent burning. Spread on oiled paper to harden. Dry sugar may be sprinkled on to help in tak¬ ing up the moisture.       128        Sauce —The juice makes excellent sauce for cottage or other pudding by adding sugar to taste and cornstarch or arrowroot to thicken.  Punch or Ale —Blended with oranges, lemons, and pineapples, either alone, with one or all together, and boiled granulated sugar syrup added to sweeten; then di¬ luted with one-third water and poured over lumps of ice in punch bowl, the grapefruit makes a drink that when once tried will be tried again.  Kumquats.  As a decorative fruit when used fresh, the kumquat is very beautiful.  In using the kumquat as in other cit¬ rus fruits, the length of time and quanti¬ ty of water to be used in extracting bit¬ terness from peel varies with individual fruits; some requiring more and others less. This can only be regulated by test¬ ing the liquid and changing until pala¬ table.  Crystallized —Carefully wash the fruit and cook in boiling water until tender and transparent changing water as necessary to eliminate oil. Drain and boil about half an hour in syrup. Use one cupful of sugar and one-half cupful of water. Make this in sufficient quantity to cover the fruit. Boil until the syrup spins a thread. Drop the fruit into the syrup and when it is clear drain the syrup off and place fruit on plates or oiled paper to dry. If not thoroughly candied, the syrup may be reheated and fruit reboiled but care must be taken not to toughen by too much boiling.  Preserve —Fruits may be preserved whole, but many cooks prefer to cut them   into halves and remove the seeds. Re¬ move the oil as directed for crystalliza¬ tion. Boil in syrup and seal in well steril¬ ized jars. One cupful of sugar and one cupful of water will make a good syrup for this fruit.  Marmalade —Cut the fruit into halves and squeeze the seeds and pulp into gran¬ ite colander which has been placed over granite or stone jar.  Remove the oil from rinds as for crys¬ tallizing and when still slightly bitter (as this is characteristic of the famous mar¬ malades) drain and put through a coarse food chopper. Mix with juice and meas¬ ure.  i quart pulp  i pint sugar  1 pint last water in which fruit was cooked  Make the syrup with the sugar and the water and add the pulp and boil until juice begins to jelly when dropped from spoon. Put it into jars and seal or into jelly glasses and cover with parafine.  Lemon.  It is hardly necessary to touch on this except to state that lime or grape juice can be used in place of lemon juice in nearly every recipe.  Salad Dressing —  2 eggs beaten  34 cupful of lemon juice 34 cupful of pineapple or orange juice  34 cupful of sugar 34 teaspoon of salt  Mix the juices, sugar and salt and add the eggs well beaten and cook in double boiler until creamy. If for meat salad     FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   129   add to the boiling mixture one teaspoon¬ ful of butter.  Candy —See confections.  Icing for Layer Cake —Strain the juice of one lemon and stir into it by degrees powdered sugar to make a stiff icing. Spread on while the cake is hot, using knife dipped in cold water.  Ice or Sherbet —  2 cupfuls of sugar 2 cupfuls of boiling water 4 cupfuls of lemon juice Whites of two eggs or 1 table¬ spoonful of gelatine  If gelatine be used soak in one-half cupful of cold water and add to boiling water. Pour all over the sugar and stir until dissolved. Add the lemon juice and freeze. If the whites of eggs are used, beat well and add to mixture when put in freezer.  Lime.  Limes are preferred to lemons by many persons in ades, ices, or sherbets. (See lemon.)  Loquat.  To Can —  6 quarts of loquats i*4 quarts of sugar *4 pint of water  Put sugar and water in preserving ket¬ tle and when dissolved put in fruit and heat slowly to boiling point. Boil ten minutes and put in well sterilized jars and seal at once.  Mangoes.  Few persons, even those living where many bushels of mangoes go to waste   each year realize the possibilities of the fruit. Like the guava they can be used nearly every way that an apple or peach may be used. We have been told repeat¬ edly how to eat the fresh fruit but J think no one has told us how to make pies, shortcakes, puddings, dumplings, etc.  Canning —Peel the fruit and cut into neat slices, cutting from stem end. Put in boiling syrup, boil ten minutes, and place in well sterilized jars and seal at once. Make a syrup by using one cup¬ ful of sugar and one cupful of water. Do not attempt to cook a large quantity at one time or the slices will break up.  Marmalade —Peel the ripe fruit and put into a pan with water to half cover. The pulp may or may not be cut from seed. The latter makes a smoother marmalade. When the fruit is tender, rub through a granite colander. Return to preserving kettle with one cup of sugar to each quart of pulp. Boil thirty min¬ utes and seal at once.  Jelly —For jelly the green fruit is used. Peel and cook the green fruit. Strain and to each cupful of boiling juice add one cup of sugar. Boil until jelly forms when the juice is dropped from a spoon.  Green Mango Pie —This is equal to rhubarb pie and is so similar to it that many persons mistake the mango pie for it. Peel and slice the green mangoes. Line the pan with good paste and put the fruit into it. Sprinkle with sugar and flour and add a tablespoonful of water.  Ripe Mango Pie —Peel and slice ripe fruit and proceed as above, using less sugar.  Dumplings —In any recipe where peaches or apples are to be used, substi¬ tute ripe mangoes.   130        Chutney No. i—This recipe was kind¬ ly furnished by Mrs. Florence P. Hay¬ den.  io large firm mangoes pint seeded raisins pint lime juice pint vinegar 2 Chili peppers 2 Garlac buttons grated i medium sized onion i tablespoon white mustard seed i tablespoon ground ginger i heaping tablespoonful of salt ip2 pound brown sugar Pare and cut mangoes in small pieces. Put all ingredients together in a crock or bowl. Let it stand covered over night, and cook it very slowly next morning for three hours. Put in glass jars or bottles and seal at once.  Chutney No. 2— i quart canned mangoes i quart spiced otaheite gooseberries 4 apples  y 2 pint seeded raisins  1 pt grapefruit and orange juice mixed  2 Chili peppers 2 onions  i tablespoonful mustard i tablespoon ful ginger i tablespoonful salt i cup brown sugar Cook as above.  Otaheite Gooseberry.  Spiced —In this we may have most ex¬ cellent substitute for spiced cherries.  Make a syrup with one cup sugar to one-half cup water, add spices to taste. Put the fruit into the syrup and boil un¬ til tender. Seal in sterilized jars.   Jelly —Cover the fruit with water, boil and strain. Put six cupfuls of juice to boil for ten minutes and add four cup¬ fuls of sugar, and boil until it jellies when dropped from a spoon into an iced saucer.  Chutney —See Mango Chutney.  Orange.  The orange can be used in a great many different ways, but we Americans make very little use of it in any way except as a fresh fruit. As Floridians are or- ange growers, we are missing a great op¬ portunity in not popularizing the many different ways in which it may be used. Many carloads of oranges that are ship¬ ped as fresh fruit at a loss could be bet¬ ter made into preserved fruit and in this form be marketed at our leisure.  Orange Dainty With Marshmallozvs —  Six oranges Six lemons  2 cups sugar or more if desired 2 cups boiling water poured over all  Strain the juice of oranges and lemons. It should be about a pint. Add sugar and boiling water and let stand thirty minutes, and add two quarts of grape juice and one and a half quarts of ice water. Cut one-half pound of marshmal¬ lows in quarters and allow four pieces to each glass. Serve with lady fingers.  Float —To one quart of water, add juice and pulp of two lemons and one cup sugar. When boiling add four table¬ spoonfuls cornstarch stirring all the time. When cold pour over four or five sliced oranges and over this pour mock cream.               FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   ! Sherbet —  9 oranges  3 lemons or one grapefruit i quart of boiling water pound sugar  Pour water over sugar and stir well. When cold add fruit juice. Put it into a freezer and freeze. In warm weather add to the boiling water two tablespoon¬ fuls of gelatine previously soaked in cold water or whites of two eggs may be ad¬ ded just at freezing point.  Compote of Rice —Boil one cup of rice  I until soft. Put into double boiler with one cup of milk and half a cup of sugar, and add the yolks of two eggs well beaten. Stir this until thick as boiled custard. Then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of eggs and pour over a dish of fruit cut up and sugared. Either oranges, pine¬ apples, guavas, or mangoes, may be used according to the fruit that happens to be in season. (Adapted from Tropical Ag¬ riculture and Cookery.)  Oranges and Rice —Cook one cup of rice in boiling salted water until it is ten¬ der. Drain and rinse in cold water. Add a cup of milk, one-half a cup of sugar and one teaspoonful of cornstarch. Heat  t and cook for ten or fifteen minutes. Pour it into molds to cool. When cold turn into serving dishes and heap around it sweetened orange cubes, and add a little lime, lemon or grapefruit juice.  Shortcake —Make shortcake in the us¬ ual way. Split and butter. Cut four oranges in cubes. Add sugar and a table¬ spoon of lemon juice. Serve it with mock cream.  Frappe —  8 lemons 12 oranges   131  1 large pineapple  2 quarts Apollinaris water Squeeze the lemons and add sugar to  make the juice very sweet. Peel and chop the oranges and pineapple. Let this stand until you are ready to use. Put lump of cracked ice into a bowl; pour over it the lemon juice and chopped fruit. Stir this well and add the Apollinaris water.  Fruit Hash —Take large bright oranges or grapefruit. Cut carefully into halves and remove the pulp. To this add pine¬ apple, banana or any fruit at hand sweet¬ ened to taste. Fill the orange or grape¬ fruit shells and serve on plates. Decorate with five citrus leaves arranged around the shell as doily.  Table Decoration for Yellow Lunch¬ eon —Peel carefully and section as many oranges as needed. Arrange the leaves in front of each plate to serve as doily, and on each leaf place a section of or¬ ange. The leaves of the satsuma are very nice for this. They may be arrang¬ ed in center of table as centerpiece with fruit piled high. A very beautiful effect can be obtained by using the leaves and sections as a runner for the entire length of the table. Out of season crystallized sections may be used.  Marmalade, an English Recipe —  1 dozen oranges f  1 pint of water Equal weight in sugar Peel the oranges and carefully remove the seeds; boil rinds in water for two hours changing water to take off a little of the bitter taste. Cut the pulp into small bits; taking care to remove all seeds and cut the boiled rind into chips (or run through food chopper). Boil the sugar and water together to form a syrup, skim               132        carefully and when clear, add the pulp and rind. Boil all together for half an hour when it should be rich and thick.  Orange Straws and Candied Peel —See Grapefruit Straws.  Papaya.  Fresh —  Experience shows that the rich pulp of a fully-ripe papaya, eaten at the end of a dinner (with sugar and cream if preferred), accelerates digestion. Thus eaten, it is in the opinion of some, one of the best fruits of the tropics. Some of the papayas, however which are grown in South Florida are inferior varieties. In this fruit nature has provided an effi¬ cient remedy for dyspepsia, and as its qualities become better known, it will be much more in demand.—John Belling, Press Bulletin 87, Florida Experiment Station.  Sauce —The green fruit makes an ex¬ cellent sauce, resembling that made from apples. To prepare for sauce, cut the fruit into segments and peel. Add water and cook until tender. Add sugar and lime or lemon juice to taste. This can be used in any way one would use green apples, either for pies, dumplings, sauce, etc.  «  To Make Meat Tender —We have been told that to roll tough meat in the leaves of this plant will render the meat tender and palatable. I wonder who has tried it on wiregrass beef or razor back pork.  Pineapple.  The pineapple can be used in almost as many ways as there are fruit recipes in the cook books, but they are at their   best when well ripened and' used fresh from the plant.  There are many ways to prepare the fresh pineapple for table use, but there is one way in which it should not be prepar¬ ed. A pineapple should never be cut crosswise of the fruit. Why? Because it leaves a part of the woody unpalatable core in the center. Always slice length¬ wise of the fruit and reject the core.  Ground —Cut the pineapple in sections lengthwise and remove the peel and core. Put the slices through a food chopper.  The cores should be ground separately and only the juice of them used, as they are woody and unpalatable.  Grated —Grated pineapple is not so easily prepared as above, but is much nic¬ er since the fibre remains attached to the core. Small pineapples with tops left on are easier to grate than large ones. Cut off the rough outside leaves from the top, thus making a good handle to hold the fruit while grating. The large fruits may be quartered before grating. The rough skin as well as the eyes should all be care¬ fully removed before one attempts to grate the fruit.  Shredded —Prepare the fruit as for  grating. Then with a silver fork begin  at the base and pick into small pieces.  Place these into fruit bowl and serve them  with or without sugar. If sugar is used  add it just before serving. This prevents  toughening the fibre in the fruit. If a  quantity of juice is desired let the sugared  fruit stand for several hours before serv- •  mg.  As a Centerpiece —A handsome and economical centerpiece can be arranged by using a symmetrical pineapple with pretty top. Peel the fruit carefully and                 133   with sharp knife remove the eyes, cutting a line each side of the eyes diagonally around the fruit. This gives a series of spiral grooves. Cut smooth at the base and slash lengthwise into segments near¬ ly to the top of the fruit. Place the pine¬ apple on a cup in the center of a fruit bowl and arrange some green foliage to hide the cup. Tradescantia or guava leaves are good for this purpose. A few small flowers may be artistically placed among the leaves.  Take the pineapple from the bowl and place on a plate. Hold the fruit in the left hand and cut off the top. Replace the top to the fruit bowl. The sections will fall apart ready to be served on the individual plates. In the north, especially in hotels, the pineapple tops are frequent¬ ly used as center pieces.  Shortcake -—  1 cup flour 1 tablespoon lard 1 teaspoonful baking powder 1 cup grated pineapple y 2 cup sugar 1 teaspoonful lime juice Milk to make soft dough  Bake the dough in either one large tin or several individual tins, and split open. Butter and spread with prepared fruit.  Sauce No. 1—  1 cup grated pineapple y 2 cup of water y> cup of sugar 1 teaspoon butter  Heat and add 1 tablespoon corn starch or flour.  Sauce No. 2—One tablespoon butter beaten to cream. Add one and a half cups powdered or granulated sugar and   beaten white of one egg. Beaten until very light and just before serving add one cup grated pineapple.  Cake —Make a favorite cake batter, flavor with lemon and bake in two layers. Boil one cup granulated sugar and two tablespoons pineapple juice until it spins a thread. Ice the top layer. Then add two tablespoons of strained pulp to the remainder of the icing and spread this between layers. This cake is at its best if eaten soon after baking. If it is to be kept a day or two use water instead of pineapple juice to cook sugar for icing, and put pineapple pulp into the icing after icing top layer.  Marmalade —Use one quart of pulp and one pint of sugar. Peel and grate the pineapple or grind through a food chopper. Mix and stir well and then place the pulp and sugar on the stove and stir carefully until the boiling point is reached. Put the fruit in and boil until it is clear and transparent. Then put in well sterilized jars and seal at once. A supply of marmalade is the housekeeper’s friend. In this she has the basis for many quickly prepared desserts.  Canned —Prepare the fruit and proceed as for marmalade using less sugar. Or the fruit may be picked to pieces as de¬ scribed for use as a fresh dessert. Cook it in water until tender Then place in boiling syrup and boil ten minutes. Put in well sterilized jars and seal. Long boiling in the syrup toughens the fibre.  Marmalade With Pears —  1 peck LeConte or Keiffer pears  2 large pineapples  2 quarts of sugar     134        Peel the fruit and put it through a coarse food chopper. Add the sugar and boil it until clear. Seal in well sterilized jars.  Punch No. i—  i quart of syrup from canned strawberries  i quart grated pineapples 34 dozen lemons 34 dozen oranges i quart sugar teaspoon salt  1 quart boiling water  2 quarts ice water  Make the syrup with sugar, salt and hot water. Pour this over the fruit and let it stand at least four hours. When ready to serve add the ice water and a generous piece of ice. A pint of fresh strawberries cut into small pieces can be added to advantage and will improve the appearance of the punch. They should be added just at serving time.  Punch No. 2 —  ij4 pints pineapple juice 34 pint lemon juice 34 pint orange juice 34 pint grapefruit juice  3 cups sugar  1 quart of boiling water  Make syrup of sugar and water. Let this cool and add to the fruit juice. Strain and pour over cracked ice.  Sherbet No. 1—  1 pint grated pineapple 1 cup sugar 1 pint boiling water 34 cup lemon juice 1 tablespoonful gelatine 1 cup cold water  Soak the gelatine in cold water and add it to the boiling water and sugar. When   cool add this to the fruit juice. Strain into freezer and freeze.  Sherbet No. 2 —  4 cups grated pineapple Juice of two lemons 1 quart of boiling water i/4 pounds sugar Whites of two eggs  Pour the boiling water over the sugar and let it come to a boil. Remove the syrup from the stove and pour it over the fruit. Strain into the freezer and let chill. Then add the well beaten whites of eggs and freeze quickly.  Tapioca —Cook as directed on the package, and when the tapioca is done beat in well sweetened grated pineapple. This makes a nice dish either hot or cold. The tapioca may be cooked in milk and eggs added. Then add the 'fruit and bake.  Sponge —Dissolve one-half package of gelatine in one cup of cold water. Add two-thirds of a cup of sugar and one- half a cup of water to one cup of grated pineapple. Boil this for ten minutes and then set to cool. When cold beat the juice into the gelatine and pour the mix¬ ture over the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. One-half teaspoonful of lemon juice will help to bring out the flavor. Set the dish into a pan of cold water and beat until it begins to set. Then pour into a mold to harden. If canned pine¬ apple is used it will not have to be boiled. Simply sweeten to taste, add to the gela¬ tine and proceed as above. Care must be exercised to mix the sweetened juice and gelatine when both are cold and chill as quickly as possible. Otherwise a chemi¬ cal action takes place that makes it im¬ possible to harden the mixture.        FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   I3S      Roll—  4 eggs i cup sugar i cup flour  i small teaspoonful baking pow¬ der  Mix and bake as usual. While hot spread on the following and roll quickly, i pint can sliced pineapple, or  1 cup grated fresh pineapple  2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch 2 tablespoonfuls lemon juice  1 tablespoonful butter Sugar to taste  Heat the fruit juice and sugar.

Foam Toast —  i J4 cup pineapple cut in small blocks 8 slices zweiback or dry toast )/2 cup sugar Whites of two eggs Juice of one lemon  2 level tablespoonfuls cornstarch i tablespoon ful butter  Moisten the zwieback slightly with hot water and put in warming oven. Add to the lemon juice enough boiling water to make one cup liquid. Let, it come to a boil and stir in the sugar and cornstarch. When clear and thick, add the butter and pineapples. Cook for a moment, and then fold in stiffly beaten whites of eggs. As soon as foamy turn on zweiback and serve.  Salad —Mix with grapefruit, celery, and nuts. Heap on lettuce leaves and pour over it mayonnaise.  Waldorf Salad With Pineapple Dress¬ ing —  1 cup celery  2 cups apples   cup pecan nuts Pineapple Dressing:  Whites of four eggs 1-3 cup sugar 1-2 cup pineapple juice 1-3 cup lemon juice 1 tablespoouful cornstarch Sauce With Ice Cream —Put a cupful of pineapple juice into a cup of granu¬ lated sugar and cook, ten minutes. Add the yolks of two eggs and whip over boiling water with an egg beater until foamy. Take it from the fire and whip again with the stiffly beaten whites of eggs.  Pyramids —Arrange with unpeeled fruit. Cut a fresh unpeeled pineapple into pyramid-shaped pieces (it will easily break into such sections, by using a fork and beginning at the bottom taking an eye at a time) each extending to the heart of the fruit. Lay the pyramids on their sides in a circle on a fancy plate with a little mound of sugar in the cen¬ ter. They are eaten with the fingers and afterwards finger-bowls are passed. This is both a pretty and delicious introduc¬ tion for a ladies luncheon.  Crystallized —Peel and cut fruit in neat cubes. Boil in water until tender. Drain and pour over it a heavy syrup made of granulated sugar and water. Let cool and repeat until it is well sugared. Place on plates to dry.  Frozen Custard —  1 quart milk  1 cup sugar 5 egg yolks.  2 cups grated pineapple  1 teaspoon ful lemon juice Scald the milk and add sugar. Pour one-half over the beaten eggs. Mix this      136        with the half left in the boiler and cook until custard coats a spoon. Remove from fire and chill thoroughly before ad¬ ding fruit. Freeze it immediately.  Pie—  Yolks of two eggs cup sugar  2 tablespoonfuls of sugar  i teaspoonful butter  Cook as for lemon filling and pour into baked crust. Beat the whites of two eggs to stiff froth and add one tablespoonful of sugar. Spread upon the pie and brown.  Pudding —Line a buttered pudding dish with cold mush. Fill with sweeten¬ ed pineapple and bake. Serve with cream or pineapple sauce.  Brown Betty —  1 cup bread crumbs  2 cups grated pineapples cup sugar  1 teaspoonful cinnamon  2 tablespoonfuls butter in small bits  Butter the pudding dish and put in a layer of crumbs and then some fruit, but- . ter and cinnamon. Repeat this until all is used. Bake or steam. Serve with hard sauce, made by creaming a teacup of sugar and one-half a cup of butter. Flavor it with pineapple juice.  Roselle, or Jamaica Sorrel.  We have been told of the many ways in which the calices of roselle (Hibiscus Sabdcirriffa) can be used. In fact, Ros¬ elle is the Florida cranberry. If we have a few plants of it in our garden, we have all the material for pies, sauce, dump¬ lings, jellies, fruit coloring without   spending a cent of our hard-earned cash for northern grown products.  It is not necessary to give recipes for the above. The calices are removed from ovary and used in the usual way. For a pretty dumpling, nothing equals it. Roll the prepared calices in the biscuit dough and bake or boil. The pretty pink color- gives such an appetizing appeal to the hungry man that if he sees the dessert before finishing the previous courses, he is more than eager to get to enjoy it.  A salad may be made of stems, leaves, and calices just as turnip salad.  A syrup that can be used for coloring purposes can be made of calices or stems, and leaves. This may be boiled in the ordinary way and sealed in bottles for future use.  To make the jelly use less than the us¬ ual proportion of sugar. The jelly is excellent for cake, but is not as firm as guava jelly.  Sapodillo.  This fruit is the peach of the American tropics. Peel and serve as ripe peaches. Mrs. Haden said last year, “I find that the fruit makes one of the best sweet pickles I have ever made.” We Ameri¬ cans have been too busy hunting foreign things, and dodging the criticisms of for¬ eigners to develop our own resources.

Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen •  It is hardly likely that I can give our members any new points on this subject, but it is doubtless a timely topic for the beginners among you. So please consid¬ er this a discourse for novices, and with your permission I will begin with the very first process, namely, the proper prepara¬ tion of the land for the grove.  Without going into the subject of soils let us take for granted that your pur¬ chase, Mr. Newcomer, is really suitable for a grove, that it is well drained and has no impervious substratum nearer than six feet to the surface. The chances are that your land will be the average pine land of the state, so we will so consider it. Fertile land is at a premium here, and yours cannot be classed as such. However much Florida may be advertised as having a soil of incomparable fertility, the average is decidedly infertile. A fer¬ tile soil is one that contains all the ele¬ ments necessary for plant growth and is free from deleterious substances and con¬ ditions. Our virgin lands are acid ex¬ cept where limestone approaches the sur¬ face and are more or less deficient in all four elements, nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash and lime—particularly the last two.  The first step, then, is to make the land sweet by applying limestone—one to two   tons per acre. To this might well be ad¬ ded the same quantity of finely ground natural phosphate rock, called “floats.” Let this material be well plowed in, and if subsoiling can also be done, so much the better. Do all this at least a year previous to setting out your grove and on this land plant some legume. The vel¬ vet bean will give the best yield of vines destined for humus and will supply 140 lbs of nitrogen per acre. After the trees are planted beggar weed may be planted and handled with less labor but the beans would add more to the soil. Thus you have taken three long steps toward soil fertility. In the first place you have pro¬ vided lime for food and as a neutralizing agent; second you have provided a slow . but sure source of phosphoric acid, and thirdly you are supplying humus and ni¬ trogen at little cost. If you keep some legume growing you may easily raise a grove after this first expense with no out¬ lay for fertilizer, excepting a small amount for potash. This process might be called “making haste slowly” and a grove so treated will outgrow the one carelessly planted without preparation, except the digging of the holes. People new to the state do not understand the peculiarities of this soil.  Now, the objects of cultivation are three fold, to conserve moisture, to let      140        in more air and increase the activities of the soil bacteria which are busy making plant food available. Plowing must be done with discretion. If the ground is too wet it may be “puddled,”as it is call¬ ed, and the air thus excluded, or if done during, or just previous to a season of rains there will be a heavy loss of nitrates, for the bacteria will be stimulated and their product carried away in the drain¬ age water. The fall is by all odds the best time to plow a grove. Spring plow¬ ing of any depth is unwise as one may thereby cut off the fine feeding roots which the trees have been growing dur¬ ing the winter in anticipation of the de¬ mands of spring growth. Under ordi¬ nary conditions, root pruning is no more necessary than top pruning, which is to say, not at all. And in general it may be said that any method of cultivation which turns up roots, large or small, may justly be regarded with suspicion.  A young grove may be plowed to ad¬ vantage once or twice a year if the plow is run shallow near the trees. Later on the middles only should be plowed and if the trees grow as they should the time will come when the plow should be laid aside. The disk or cutaway harrow will go deep enough and the Acme is the best all around grove cultivator. I once heard a man say that he would not have a grove—and his trees were large—if he could not plow it. When one is so ad¬ dicted to the use of the plow it would pay him better to satisfy the cravings of his appetite for plowing on some other piece of land and let his grove alone. There is hardly any orange land in the state that calls for continued plowing.  Clean culture all the year around may   give good results at first but at best they are temporary, and the continued practice is both expensive and injurious. Our ideal is to raise a good quantity and qual¬ ity of fruit at the least cost. Neither continued plowing, nor 12 months clean culture will fit in this plan. Keep the grove covered with something during the hot rainy weather. This cover crop mow as soon as the rains stop—about mid Sep¬ tember in central Florida. Then begin a light cultivation if weather is dry and if you intend deep working don’t do it before the trees become dormant or you may keep them growing too late. Har¬ row during the winter enough to con¬ serve the moisture, but after blooming* every ten days or two weeks. Then get another cover crop started. Many grow¬ ers think that legumes in a grove coarsen the fruit and produce dieback. But those who have investigated more fully believe these evils due to the fact that in his fertilizing the grower has not allowed for the nitrogen furnished by his cover crop. These thoughts bring up the whole sub¬ ject of fertilizing, but that is another story.  It may be set down as an axiom, other things being equal, the less cultivation a grove receives, the finer quality will be the fruit. Light cultivation is the rule on hammock lands. On higher land we must cultivate more or else plant the trees farther apart. In my opinion it is a mis¬ take to plant large growing citrus varie¬ ties any nearer than 30x30. Thirty-five feet apart would be better. Peach trees may be planted in the centers or the trees might just be planted closer, to be thin¬ ned out later. Trees widely planted will be more healthy, require less fertilizer.                        stand drought better and ultimately bear more fruit. They may also be sprayed or fumigated easier than trees crowded to¬ gether. Thick planting, will yield more fruit at first, but it will not be long be¬ fore their yield will cost more per box. However, they may better protect them¬ selves from wind and cold.  Now just a word about stocks. For general planting neither the rough lemon nor trifoliata has a real merit. Sour stock is fully as good for low or heavy soils as trifoliata and on light soils the pomelo equals the rough lemon without having its disadvantages. Fruit on rough   141  lemon is likely to be coarse, dry up soon and stays green about the stem. For the peninsula trifoliata is to be condemned.  Well, I have wandered all over the cit¬ rus grove. It is said that the labor unions, agitate for more pay, less work and shorter hours. What we should strive for is more fruit, better fruit, at less cost. And I believe wider plantings, less deep cultivation, more humus, lime and floats are sign boards pointing directly to our desired haven.  I am indebted for material to Prof. Rolfs, Prof. Blair and Prof. Hume.   Vegetable and Truck Crops in Florida   /   C. K. McQuarrie.   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen :  Commissioner McLiirs Report for 1909-10 makes me feel that I must take off my hat to the truckers of Florida. A substantial increase in value of 70 per cent, over the previous year, leads us to congratulate ourselves on being permitted to interest our¬ selves in the State’s welfare to this ex¬ tent. Florida alone as a State can boast of such a per cent, of increase in values of vegetable products. The truck and vegetable crop for 1909-10 is reported as valued at $6,825,972.  The acreage for vegetables in 1907- 1908 was 42,357, and for 1909-10, 54,047, an increase of a little over 11,000 acres growing truck crops, and an increased return in value of approx¬ imately 70 per cent, in favor of the 1909-10 crop.  We are not fond of figures and will not dwell longer with them, but in this case they have served a splendid pur¬ pose. This 70 per cent, increase in values in truck crops has come with less than 20 per cent, increase in acre¬ age. There are reasons:  1. Better and more intensive meth¬ ods of cultivation have been advocated and practiced.  2. Truckers have learned that all fertilizers are not alike and no two va¬   rieties of plants need exactly the same fertilizer, and that fertilizers are really plant food in which the plant lives and subsists.  3. They have learned how to con¬ trol the moisture problems and the value of irrigation.  4. They realize that trucking is a business of itself and must be skillfully managed.  5. Experience has shown them that inferior products cannot be loaded on cars and transported long distances, profitably to the producer.  6. Discriminating markets refuse inferior products and injure the future sales with good products.  7. Truckers realize as never before the value of good seed. and proper planting.  Many of our vegetables grown at a season when forcing is necessary are extremely perishable. Careful crating and packing is therefore an important part of this industry.  Improved quality and greater quan¬ tity with a correspondingly small in¬ crease in acreage has elevated the veg¬ etable industry above citrus and other fruits, and approaches the general field crop values for last year.  It is a striking fact that several of our most important commercial crops       FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   were until recently considered unsatis¬ factory for Florida conditions but now we have reason to believe that a still greater variety is possible.  With the increased supply and val¬ ues naturally arises the question of over-production. Each year we are confronted with an over-supply of one or more important vegetable crops. Coming in direct competition with those growers closer to Northern mar¬ kets and where freight rates are con¬ siderably reduced, the crop remains un¬ touched or dumped when it reaches its destination. While these conditions are more or less discouraging, it does not mean that more of these products are being grown than can be marketed and consumed. It merely emphasizes the need of a greater distribution of the products and not necessarily greater distance in transportation.  The facts are that hundreds of small towns that could use a large amount of these products never get an opportu¬ nity, the need therefore of organiza¬ tion and co-operation, which slowly but surely comes about with such an important industry. We have become so accustomed to shipping to New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, etc., that we hesitate to consign our cars elsewhere. Others would like to have those products, but so far have been unable to get them.  The population of our Northern towns is on the increase. A large per¬ centage of this populace in the ranks of mechanics and in the various profes¬ sions and industries must buy their vegetables, and are becoming rap¬ idly educated to a vegetable diet in   143  preference to such an extensive meat diet.  Considering these facts we cannot compare our trucking industry with some other industry that produces lux¬ uries instead of necessities that have a duration only for a period and finally pass into history. The trucking indus¬ try has to do with a product by which the people are fed.  The South is the home of truck crops, and there is no section of it that will produce any better or larger crops than our own State. For the most part,, truck crops like a rich sandy loam soil and plenty of warm sunshine. Mois¬ ture is an essential element in all crop growth, and while our rainfall during the trucking season is inadequate in many sections for several crops, we al¬ ways have at hand an abundant supply of water for irrigating purposes.  In preparing the soil, no matter for which crop, it is vastly important that a thorough cultivation shall precede planting. Irrigation, high-grade fertil¬ izers, good seed and plants, etc., are always to be emphasized, but unless the land has been thoroughly cultivated before planting, much of your efforts will result in failure.  The land should be plowed as deep as possible without turning up too much raw subsoil. Thorough working at this time gives the soil a good sup¬ ply of oxygen and greater power to absorb and hold the needed moisture. Shallow plowing followed by insuffi¬ cient surface cultivation results in an impoverished moisture content.  An experiment at the Florida Exper¬ iment Station conducted at the termi-   144        nus of a long drought shows a moisture content in cultivated soil equal to inches of rainfall, or 175 tons of water per acre. More than that found in the soil not cultivated during the same pe¬ riod in a depth of soil through which the roots feed and secure their water supply. Continuous surface cultivation is important while the plant is grow¬ ing, otherwise a tremendous waste of water or moisture will occur at the ex¬ pense of the crop.  OUR WASTED PRODUCTS.  It is hardly necessary to call atten¬ tion to the enormous waste sustained each year by truckers and fruit grow¬ ers from our lack of canneries, to use up surplus production. Take the trou¬ ble, if you will, to examine the pack¬ ages that reach us through our grocery stores put up by New York and other Northern canneries, and often filled with our own products. After these second-grade products reach these Northern markets a greater profit is realized by putting them up in quart cans and then distributing it through¬ out the United States and even into European countries.  There is not a trucking or fruit¬ growing section of Florida but that   wastes tons of valuable products that would reach the high-class markets if they were put into air-tight cans in the proper condition, properly labeled and distributed.  We have expensive packing citrus houses conducted on a larger scale and could not get along without them. Per¬ haps we are contented with our present profits, but we are not seizing our pos¬ sibilities so long as we permit the thou¬ sands of tons of vegetables to go to waste as we do at present and for want of canneries in these sections.  I cannot better illustrate this tre¬ mendous waste than refer to a corre¬ sponding waste once permitted in our meat packing industries, and which now, under more economical manage¬ ment, make up the bulk of profits in the business.  We are just dawning the horizon of our possibilities for vegetable growing in Florida. As Florida fills with peo¬ ple and all her land cultivated, the de¬ mand for all her products will increase, but with more and stronger competi¬ tion we cannot continue to make the business profitable unless most eco¬ nomical methods replace our present wasteful ones.    Ornamentals   J. C. Bates.   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen of  the State Horticultural Society :  Having been placed upon your Com¬ mittee on Ornamentals, I have chosen vines as my branch of this important and interesting subject. Vines appear to me to be somewhat overlooked or neglected in our State; I presume be¬ cause we have so many beautiful native vines climbing everywhere they have a chance, or are allowed to, they are so common we fail to appreciate them as much as we should. Indeed, I some¬ times think this fact may, in a measure at least, account for the lack of proper appreciation of even our beautiful climbing roses. Of these there are so many varieties that thrive splendidly in almost everv section of our State, when well fertilized and given some¬ thing upon which to climb, if nothing more than an old fence. They will change any unsightly object into a thing of beauty. The following are some of the desirable varieties: Sol- ferteer, Reve-d’Or, LaMarque, Mrs. Robert Peary, Estella Pradelle, Mare- chal Neil, Riene Marie, Henrietta, De- voniences, James Sprunt, Bride’s Maid, Clothilde Soupert, Marie Guillot and others too numerous to mention here.  We have many native and ex¬ otic vines, among them the yellow jas- samine, otherwise known as Gelsem-   num Sempervirens, which stands with¬ out an equal. It is evergreen, bearing very fragrant yellow blossoms, appear¬ ing in great profusion in early spring, which makes it a thing of beauty. Like other vines, it can be used in covering arches, trellises, summer houses, old fences, etc., and should have a place in every Florida garden.  There are many other native vines worthy of mention, but neither time nor space permit their discussion at this time, so I will dwell on a few only of the cultivated varieties in more gen¬ eral use. Rhyncospernum jasminoides is a beautiful evergreen vine producing from April till June fragrant white flowers, and when in full bloom is very conspicuous and makes a lovely shade for porches.  Mexican Pink Vine, or Antigonon leptopus, a perennial bearing great sprays or racemes of beautiful rose pink flowers from June till frost; heart- shaped leaves.  Wistarias are deciduous vines of great merit, bearing clusters of flowers in early spring before becoming fully leaved. Both purple and white are de¬ sirable and can be trained in handsome tree form or allowed to climb, which they will do a great deal if allowed full sway, often covering the tops of very large trees, reaching a height of sixty feet.    146        Trumpet vines are worthy of men¬ tion, there being a number of varieties of which the following are a few of the most desirable:  Bignonia Radicans: A strong grow¬ er, deciduous with dark green com¬ pound leaves, bearing large clusters of brilliant orange-colored flowers during the summer months.  Bignonia Tweediana: An elegant vine of delicate appearance, clinging closely to brick, stone or wooden walls, bearing attractive chrome-colored flow¬ ers in spring.  Bignonia Speciosa: Glossy green leaves, producing clusters of purple trumpet-shaped flowers in early spring.  Bignonia Venusta: Dark green leaves, enormous clusters of orange colored trumpet-shaped flowers. This is a strong grower, too tropical for lat¬ itude much north of 29.  Alamanda Hendersonii: Climbing shrub, glossy green leaves, with yel¬ low trumpet-shaped flowers.  Alamanda Williamsii: Smaller than the above; flowers very handsome, though tropical, and are not grown in open ground north of latitude 29.  Bougainvillea, Glabra Sanderronea, or Paper Flower: Very conspicuous, shrubby vine with masses of magenta- colored flowers, mostly during winter, but showing some bloom most of the year. Like the Alamandas, are too tropical for outdoor culture north of latitude 29, but are most desirable ev¬ ergreen vines for the extreme southern portion of the State.  Dutchman's Pipe, or Aristolochia Elegans: Perennial, green leathery  leaves, odd-colored as well as odd¬   shaped flowers, being mottled brown¬ ish purple with bright yellow center, shaped like a Dutchman’s pipe. Grows from seeds which are produced in quan¬ tities in pods which open at the stem or upper end and are held by threads, forming an odd little basket in which the seeds rest till blown out by the wind or gathered.  Solanum Jasiminoides : Very green, glossy leaves, white flowers in bunches; almost constant bloomer.  Solanum Seafortheanum: Delicate, compound leaves, flowers sky-blue, followed with scarlet berries.  Solanum Wendlandii: Large vine with coarse pinnate leaves, elegant bunches of large lilac-blue flowers; perhaps more tropical than the above varieties, but is also a perennial.  Honeysuckles are so well known that it is unnecessary to more than make mention of them.  Clematis, of which we have several varieties, for quick, dense covering or shades, are very satisfactory. One of the most beautiful and satisfactory is a native of this State.  We have innumerable annuals which are not to be despised, such as morn¬ ing glories, cypress vines, thumberger, and even the velvet bean and kudzu, are valuable as ornamental vines, for which purpose they were first used in this country before their economic value became known.  It has been said that money and time spent for ornamentals is squandered. With this I take issue. Next to that dearest name on earth—Mother—is Home. The more beautiful and attrac¬ tive, the dearer, and the most pleasant      I   FLORIDA »STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   147   recollections of our lives are those of our childhood homes with the beautiful shrubs, flowers and vines. Then we owe it to our children as well as to our¬ selves that we make our homes as at¬ tractive as possible, and this can be accomplished quicker and best by let¬ ting vines cover the summer houses, shade the verandas, cover the other¬ wise unsightly fences and other places, so that our homes may become verita¬ ble things of beauty and a joy forever.   Henry S.  Mr . President , Ladies and Gentlemen :  Let me describe to you the prettiest place I have seen in Florida. The place is on the narrow strip of land lying between the Indian river and ocean, and about six miles above the Jupiter lighthouse. The general character of the land is this : The ocean beach runs up quite steep to about twenty feet above the sea level; the land then runs fairly level toward the river for a dis¬ tance of about a hundred yards, then it drops off rather abruptly at first and gradually afterward until, when it reaches the river, another hundred yards away, it is only about three feet above the water level. The growth on the land between the river and the bluff was originally a heavy hammock. With this general description of the land in mind we are now ready to visit the place.  As we land at the wharf, this being the only way to reach the spot, the first thing we notice is a mass of growth along the shore, mostly olean¬ ders, with some palmettoes and Span-   Being a native of this State, with a Floridian’s pride in this glorious Land of Flowers, I long to see the day when all our homes, from Escambia’s land¬ locked harbor on the west to the At¬ lantic’s roaring billows on the east, from the Okefenokee’s tangled jungle on the north to the sun-kissed key of the Gulf on the south, are garland-en¬ twined and rose-embowered, so that our lovely State may indeed blossom in a manner worthy of her name.   Pennock.  ish bayonets mixed in. This is a wind¬ break. From the end of the wharf ex¬ tends an avenue of grass leading up to the house on the top of the bluff some hundred yards away. The avenue is lined on each side with palms, Phoe¬ nix canariensis, with acalyphas be¬ tween and long flower beds in front of each row of palms, with some small flowering plant in them like nastur¬ tiums or sweet alyssum. As you walk up this avenue from the wharf you come to a cross avenue; you stop and turn to the left and look, and you stand and look, and look, for the sight is a magnificent one.  The avenue is lined with cocoanut palms on each side, fine, big ones, with their leaves almost touching in the middle overhead, and the view is a long one, too, for more than one man has continued this avenue. Between the cocoanuts are hibiscus trimmed to low bushes and acalyphas treated the same way, with the green grass between and the bright red of the hibiscus blossoms. They are always in flower in the win-    148        ter time, and the deep red of the acaly- phas with the gray trunks and waving leaves overhead is a sight worth see¬ ing. Looking to the right a little you look over the hibiscus immediately in front of you to the lawn and on up to where it is topped with a fine row of Australian pines and oleanders. These keep off the ocean winds and are on either side of the house running par¬ allel with the river and ocean. The natural growth from here to the ocean is not very high—not more than ten feet—and it has been left untouched excepting for an avenue that runs down to the ocean. This is more an avenue of convenience than beauty, for it is hard to make the grass grow, or any¬ thing else, here. It is lined on each side with century plants. As you stand on the porch, though, the little view of the ocean that you get makes you want more.  The lawn is spotted with a flower bed or two near the foot; not too many, though, for the broad expanse of lawn with the avenue of palms at the bottom has made the place more effective than many flower beds.  As we walk up the cocoanut-lined avenue we see a slat house on the right. This is for the more tropical plants, and it is hidden from view of the house with an embankment of hi¬ biscus in front and bamboo behind. There is a traveler’s tree there and some of the more tender palms. The top, which can hardly be seen, is cov¬ ered with a bougainvillea, and when it is in full mass of color it looks like a colored church on a picnic day when purple is the style. Around behind the   house is tucked the vegetable garden. If one should be dropped down here from somewhere up North in the win¬ ter time without ever having seen Florida, they would say: “Ah, how well named.”  Beyond the slate house is a small orange grove, and on one side there is a slat windbreak that has a hibiscus on it, trained and trimmed as a vine. Here is where beauty and utility are combined. The salmon hibiscus re¬ sponds most readily to trimming. On the left side between the avenue and the river are various specimen plants and trees. These are well protected from too much wind by the river front windbreak. Here there is an araucaria about thirty feet high, and did you ever see a pandanus utilis fifteen feet high ? It looks like a huge grayish yel¬ low snake standing straight up, and a few projecting here and there horizon¬ tally from the main one, and each hold¬ ing in its mouth a bunch of stemless saw palmetto leaves.  As we go further up we come to the next man’s place, and at the junction of the avenue we are on, and the one that runs from the river up >to his house there are on the four corner four grand specimens of Phoenix canaden¬ sis. They are beauties, having an ex¬ panse of about sixteen feet, making a fine, dense shade. With two of these out on the lawn, with a nice comfort¬ able couch beneath, what bliss for the summer time. As we go further—but we are off the place we started at, so will return to our launch with one more lingering look.@@    
Report on Peaches and Other Deciduous Fruits@@   W. L. Floyd.@@   While the growing of peaches for Northern markets is somewhat uncer¬ tain, because of variable weather con¬ ditions which prevail at blossoming time and immediately following, and the competition of the growers nearer the markets, yet, as Florida is rapidly increasing in population in the cities as well as in the rural districts, the oppor¬ tunities for disposing of fruit within the State are becoming greater. This should stimulate the more general planting of small orchards.  The early varieties are generally quicker to respond to warm weather conditions in winter than the later ripening ones, and are consequently more likely to get their fruit killed by the cold snaps of February and March. In planting for within the State mar¬ kets more attention can and should be given to later and safer varieties. Most of us this year have lost all our crop of Jewels and Waldos, but not all the later kinds.  Farmers’ Bulletin No. 440, U. S. De¬ partment of Agriculture, “Spraying Peaches for the Control of Brown-rot, Scab and Curculio,” recently issued, contains valuable information for the peach grower. The authors say: “Al¬ though many insects and parasitic fungi occur on the peach, the brown   rot (Sclerotina fructigena) and scab or black spot (Cladosporium carpophi- lum) are responsible for practically all the damage to the fruit crop, and the insect injury is limited almost entirely to the attack of the plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar.) The use of lime-sulphur wash, to which has been added arsenate of lead, is the remedy recommended. The tabulated results of its use show decided benefit.  Prof. Fawcett, of the Florida Experi¬ ment Station, has obtained results by cross inoculations and laboratory inves¬ tigations, which indicate that gummo- sis of the peach and that of the orange are caused by the same fungus.  The working of the peach on certain native plum stocks in order to secure immunity from root knot has passed beyond the experimental stage; to those who contemplate planting peach¬ es on old land, especially land suspected of containing root knot, we advise planting trees on the plum stock. Sev¬ eral nurserymen in the State are offer¬ ing them for sale.  A nursery in a near-by State is offer¬ ing a peach which they call the “Early Wonder.” They claim that it will do well as far south as Northern Florida; that it is of good size, flavor and color, and ripens in May. One of our Florida    150        nurseries is offering a new freestone peach which has been named “Glen.” It is described as a large oval, measur¬ ing 2 j 4 to 2^4 inches in length, a Peen- to Honey cross, yellow, with deep su¬ ture, dotted and washed with red; ripening June ioth to 15th.  Plums are of but little commercial importance. There should be a few trees in the home orchard. The Excel¬ sior seems to be the most satisfactory variety in the larger part of the State. A new hybrid plum originated near Lake City, FJa., is being offered this year. It has been named “McRea.” The tree is said to be a vigorous, heavy annual bearer, the fruit of me¬ dium size, yellow in color, washed with red, thickly dotted with small light- colored dots. Flesh firm, yellow, be¬ coming juicy; good shipper; ripens June ioth to 15th. It is of the same type as the Excelsior and Terrell, but of different flavor.  The low price that prevailed for pears last season has caused a lack of interest in them. Most of us have learned that by cutting out all blighted branches as soon as they appear, cut¬ ting well back into the new wood, that we can reduce the injury from this disease to a minimum, and secure fairly good crops, other conditions being fa¬ vorable; but when there is no demand   for the fruit this watchfulness and labor will not be performed.  The fig should receive more atten¬ tion than it does in Florida. The Ce¬ lestial, or sugar fig, bears large crops; seldom winter kills anywhere in the State, and there is good demand for the fruit in the markets of our large towns and cities. Picked and packed in quart boxes, 24 to 32 to the crate, as straw¬ berries are marketed, they are attrac¬ tive and sell readily in Tampa, Jack¬ sonville and elsewhere. There are sev¬ eral varieties that do well in the State. The new fig, “Leon,” originating in Tallahassee, gives promise of proving a desirable variety for Northern and Western Florida.  Japan persimmons are gaining slow¬ ly in popular favor. A few of our hor¬ ticulturists are giving special attention to improving and popularizing them. The success of the experts in the Bu¬ reau of Plant Industry at Washington in rendering insoluble the tannin in the unripe fruit so that it may be eaten while hard without any puckery, astrin¬ gent effect in the mouth, will, it is thought, help much in (rendering it popular in Northern markets. It is an attractive fruit; we have several varie¬ ties which do well, and we should do what we can to aid those who have de¬ termined to make it one of Florida’s commercial fruits.     Weather Bureau   A. J. Mitchell.   Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen :  Prof. Hume: I might say in this con¬ nection, a few good words for the weather man, for some of the bad things he has been doing. This past winter he has been striking at it very closely, and has been getting on his good behavior, and he has helped us out of many a tight place, and while we cannot give much time to our friend, Weather-man Mit¬ chell, still he is going to kindly say a few words to us.  Mr. Mitchell: You notice the tact he uses in limiting my time. He said he would let me get up, provided I could stay only a few minutes. Now, the idea of a man known as “Mr. Windy” saying what he has to say in a few minutes! This Association has very patiently and intel¬ ligently listened to the entomologist, the bugologist, and the germologist and all the other ologists, so I think now you should allow the ice-man a few minutes.  When I look into the faces of those in this Association, I am impressed with the fact that I am looking into the faces of those who, to quote the words of Mil¬ waukee, have made Florida famous. I am not handing out a panegyric to you, when I say this. I say it because it is true. It is to the citrus grower, the farm¬ er, the truck grower, more than anyone   else, to whom we owe thanks for putting Florida on the roll of states where she is today.  It has been my fortune, and frequently you thought it was your misfortune to have been in touch with Florida growers since 1894—a long while ago; I was a boy then. I want to say this, and I want to drive it home; that while I do not own a bit of citrus property in the state, I daresay there are times when I feel more interest and concern than you do over the welfare of your property. I reflect a sentiment that permeates, every¬ where, the man who has jurisdiction over any department of the country. Of course, the point of interest to you is the prompt receipt of warnings of frost and cold waves. The weather man does his best, but the weather man sometimes be¬ lieves there is a lack of co-operation on your part. For instance, the government has so much money to expend for tele¬ graph services. Sometimes we have to duplicate telegrams in order to reach a very small area; therefore, it behooves every citrus grower, everyone interested to co-operate. In this connection I wish to invite attention to the fact that Mr. Temple, the head of the Citrus Associa¬ tion, lent us valuable and effective aid in co-operating with the Weather Bureau.    152        I wish to say if there is anything you think can be improved upon in our depart¬ ment, do not hesitate to send a suggest¬ ion to us. By the adoption of your sug¬ gestion, we may be able to give more ef¬ fective service. Should any ideas occur to you by which we will be able to get you more information, more quickly and effectively, let us have them. The weath¬ er bureau realizes that it is here to serve you; that is our duty and our pleasure.  The weather bureau appreciates the gravity of the situation. There is always an interest in your welfare. It some¬ times fails, but does not everything else fail once in a while. In your sickness you send for the doctor, but the patient some¬ times dies. Sometimes you get a lawyer to pull you out of difficulties, but often you lose your case. That is the way with us; we do our duty by you so far as we can, but sometimes we fail. However, we have this satisfaction; we know more about the business than anybody else.  When normal conditions prevail the weather provokes no more than passing comment. But there are times when pub¬ lic attention is deeply absorbed in its se¬ verity and probable duration. And why not ? Is there anything that is not affect¬ ed by the weather? Centuries ago there were theories tending to elucidate the complex question of foretelling weather changes. Fabled romance, however, found its counterpart in the signs and sayings of the superstitious. But myth¬ ological and astrological tenets no longer receive attention for the sunlight of ad¬ vanced thought has evolved more tangible theories.  It is obvious to the thoughtful, whether   in northern latitudes or the sub-tropics, that abnormal weather intensifies the con¬ dition of the human race, and leaves its impress on all things within the sphere of man’s activity.  Next in far reaching consequences to tornadoes, or those intensive disturb¬ ances born in the tropical seas and called hurricanes, comes the cold wave of great anti-cyclones. Though the antithesis of the cyclone or hurricane in its mechanism and attendant characteristics, when un¬ duly energized, its sphere of operations is limited only by the confines of our country, leaving no industry directed by the skill of man untouched. This factor, so potent for ill to the husbandman in the lower continental latitudes of the United States, where citrus fruits, vegetables and other crops indigenous to the subtropics are grown, is now recognized.  In a fundamental discussion of the genesis, life and propagation of cold waves the fact that the cyclone or low area is a sort of by-product, materially modifying at times and at others enlarg¬ ing the scope and accentuating the se¬ verity of the cold wave, cannot be re¬ garding the formation of the cold waves, be retarded in its east and south move¬ ment frequently depends on the inten¬ sity and accelerated movement of the area of low pressure, which is usually of great¬ est depth during January and February, although there have been marked excep¬ tions in favor of December and March. “While the forces involved in the form¬ ation of cold waves are still matters of theoretical meteorology, their origin and field of operations have been practically determined.           153   The expression “cold wave” as a term is applied to anti-cyclones of great inten¬ sity. Its significance depends on temper¬ ature changes within a stipulated period over certain divisions of the country. And the degree to which the temperature must fall in order to verify a cold wave warn¬ ing is regularly regulated by the degree of cold required to damage crops or other interests over sections for which warn¬ ings are ordered.  OLD AND NEW IDEAS.  There has been sundry hypotheses re¬ garding the formation of cold waves. The idea was once advanced that the leading factor in the formation of the intense cold was radiation into space from the upper strata of the atmosphere, and a conse¬ quent mixing of the upper and lower strata. This method was supposed to de¬ velop the cold and high pressure. Other meteorologists adhered to the belief that the cold of winter was simply the descent of cold air from above. These theories proved untenable, however, for observa¬ tions showed that radiation was more active in the lower stratum of air.  Elliott, the meteorologist of India, points out that the average daily range of temperature is nearly twice as great in the plains of India as at the adjacent hill stations. This fact has been amply sus¬ tained by many of our weather stations, those having elevations of five to six thousand feet showing higher temperature during a cold wave than the lower level stations. This supports the accepted be¬ lief that cold waves are very shallow. Reference has been made by some au¬ thorities to the fact that in the formation   of cold waves the loss of heat by radia¬ tion must be very great to overcome that resulting from compression.  4 ,  A GREAT RADIATOR.  The earth is a great radiator and the air rising therefrom experiences reduced pressure, expands and becomes cooler. It may be stated that many meteorologists maintain that the enormous land area of the British Northwest Territory, from which radiation proceeds the greater por¬ tion of the time, is the controlling factor in building permanent areas of high pres¬ sure, which drift southward as cold waves along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. The chief features of high pressure areas or anti-cyclones are low temperature, generally light winds and clear, dry weather. The mass of air cir¬ culates around a center, the layer of air having a movement out from the center and the direction of rotation conforms to the movement of the hands of a watch in this hemisphere.  Regarding the formation of cold waves, General Greely says. “The greater part of the anti-cyclones which cause cold waves probably ninety percentum are out¬ flows of dry air, chilled to a very low tem¬ perature by radiation over the barren grounds of British America. Without doubt, the very low temperature to which the air falls is due to the barren treeless character of that country, which is cover¬ ed by scanty vegetation during summer, and free from ice and snow during winter, so that radiation from the bare ground proceeds with great rapidity during the long winter nights in this sub-arctic re¬ gion.”   154        Cyclones, or lower pressure storms with a circulation spirally inward and contra-clockwise in this hemisphere, form along the periphery of anti-cyclones as the result of gravitation, and with the south¬ erly movement of a cold wave a cyclone frequently develops far in advance—pre¬ paring the way, as it were, for its future activity. In fact, cyclones seem to be a sort of sine qua non to the cold wave, es¬ pecially when their movements are rapid and their depth of such proportions as to present an inviting passage for the cold wave in its march to the North Atlantic. Generally the point of exit from this con¬ tinent, following in the wake of the low area storm.  ! THREE TRACKS FOLLOWED.  Within our field of observation there is, as a rule, one of three tracks open to the cold wave in its eastward drift with the general circulation, and the leading factor in determining the section to be swept by it is the track of the last low area which is generally well defined. The en¬ ergy of a cold wave is wasted by opposi¬ tion and delay. And yet there are instan¬ ces where retarded movement seemed but to gather more life, and after a delay of twelve to twenty-four hours the great drama is resumed with its erstwhile se¬ verity.  Sometimes cold waves seem to lose their potency by a lack of unity. Reach¬ ing the Mississippi Valley, they frequently divide, one part crossing the lower lake region, the other moving southward to the Gulf States, and thence northeast, as though in pursuit of the dismembered por¬ tion.   The three paths traversed by cold waves, are, i: The track along the North¬ ern boundary of the United States to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. 2. The path south to about Colorado, thence east to the North Atlantic. 3. Southward along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to Texas, thence northeast over the Atlan¬ tic coast states. Cold waves following the last track frequently dip southward to the Gulf, being drawn thither by a low area storm near the Gulf margin into which they pour their enormous mass of cold air.  THE COLDEST YEAR.  This condition prevailed in February, 1899, when a disastrous cold wave over¬ spread the South and Southwest.  In density of pressure, scope of influ¬ ence, prolongation of life, and untoward damage to man and beast, it stands un¬ rivaled on our records for three-quarters of a century, and possibly unexampled during the life of the Nation. The only cold wave approaching it in severity oc¬ curred in February, 1835. And after eliminating questionable factors, such as may arise from a lack of standard in¬ struments and proper exposure of the same, it is reasonable to conclude that the cold wave of February, 1899, represents the most extreme meteorological condi¬ tions with which the Southern section has been afflicted during the past century. Minimum temperatures over West and North Florida ranged from zero to mi¬ nus 2 degrees.  At this time a high pressure area of great magnitude had overspread the British Provinces and Northwestern        155   states and was rapidly settling southward along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.  The pressure was 31.42 inches at Can¬ adian stations with isotherms of zero and minus 10 overlying Northern Texas. A temperature of minus (—)4o degrees ob¬ tained along the northwest boundary. By the morning of the 12th the isotherm of 10 degrees had reached the west gulf, and on the morning of the 13th it was felt at all South Atlantic and gulf stations. On the nth there appeared a feeble storm center in the gulf, which rapidly devel¬ oped into a storm of great intensity and which augmented the severity of the al¬ ready highly energized cold wave, giving the lowest temperature on record over the South and Southwest.  HOW COLD WAVES TRAVEL.  Several essential conditions must be fulfilled that a cold wave retain its for¬ mation and reach the Atlantic Seaboard with a reasonable share of energy. “A necessary condition,” says Prof. Garriott, “to the southward sweep of a cold wave is an unbroken area of high pressure ex¬ tending over the Rocky Mountains and plateau region.” This may be supplemen¬ ted by the observation that an active cy¬ clone, usually an accompaniment, to the south and east drawing down by vertical action the cold, dense air of elevation, in¬ sures the continuation of the cold wave beyond our field of observation.  The low area storm being propelled eastward as an eddy in the atmospheric world marks out with almost unfailing accuracy the section where temperature will be lowest. Most of the cold waves   move east over one of the northern cir¬ cuits, and for this reason their severity is not felt to any great extent south of the central valleys.  Those that take the southern circuit, however, overspread the greater portion of the country east of the Rocky Moun¬ tains; and the resulting damage depends on the aera covered by them, which fre¬ quently exceeds 2,000 miles.  The cold, dry air flowing off in all di¬ rections during a cold wave is not alone due to the temperature of the sub-Arctic regions translated south and east by the general circulation equally to, but the vertical action that is going on within the great anti-cyclone; a process whereby the cold of the upper air levels is brought down, proving a potent factor in aug¬ menting the cold condition of the lower strata.  A  FEBRUARY THE COLDEST.  Cold waves are most frequent during January, the culmination of winter con¬ ditions, although the most disastrous ones in the Southern States during recent years, occurred in February. The great damage in Florida, at Gulf or South At¬ lantic stations during February results from the advanced condition of fruits and vegetables. By that time crop growth has been stimulated by several weeks of warm weather. The orange shows bloom and the tomato, bean, celery, cabbage and other succulent plants are susceptible of great damage. Several cold waves in the Southern states have been more frequent during the past two decades than during the previous half-century. The earliest cold wave in Florida that caused lasting   156        damage and of which the present gener¬ ation has knowledge was that of Febru¬ ary, 1835, when citrus trees two feet in diameter were killed. The subsequent cold waves doing marked damage occur¬ red in January 1886, December 1894, and February 1895 an< ^ 1 &99-  Cold waves are generally felt first in Montana and their average daily move¬ ment is about 600 miles. The time re¬ quired to reach the Atlantic Seaboard de¬ pends on the track followed and the pos¬ sible opposition of low areas, which fre¬ quently develop.  VIRTUES OF COLD WEATHER.  < ♦  Many virtues have been ascribed to cold waves; it is conceded they have some. Their utility, however, is largely inferen¬ tial while their disadvantages are direct and effective. Severe freezes are bene¬ ficial to the extent of disintegrating soils and making available the material nec¬ essary to support plant life; the heavy snow, usually an incidental feature over limited districts, gives warmth to the ground thereby protecting some cereal crops. Prof. Moore, Chief of the Weather Bureau, sustains the position that the dry cold air intensifies vitality, making buoyant the listless and recharg¬ ing the nation, as it were, with more ener¬ gy and higher incentives.  To the fruit and vegetable grower of the South the cold wave is an erratic and unwelcome factor, cutting down profits and consuming dividends, though itself inert and non-productive. It negatives energy, push and pluck, and puts a pre¬ mium on fear and trepidation for the last named state is that of the fruit grower,   who, with surplus of energy and a mini¬ mum of capital, goes forth to deserve suc¬ cess, if not attained, in a business vulner¬ able at all times to attacks from frosts and freezes.  WILD WEST EFFECTS.  The limitations on the influence of cold waves do not terminate with the indus¬ trial world. Human effort comprehends action—peaceful as a rule—war-like if necessary. And in considering the wel¬ fare of people we may view them singly or collectively. Nations are but aggrega¬ tions of men, and are subject to the same influences. Who knows the true weight that should be accorded prrevailing weather conditions at times when the fate of nations is involved? The retreat of Napoleon from Moscow supposed to have been accomplished 1 in a pitiless blizzard, is a pertinent query; and the historic secenes of our own soldiers at Valley Forge and in “Washington crossing the Delaware’’ are memorable events in our natural history.  CLOSE STUDY NECESSARY.  The fact that there is only one force capable of destroying the citrus industry of this state, judging the future by the past, should impel everyone interested to seek the closest possible alliance with that bureau of the government whose province is to give warning where direful condi¬ tions threaten.  By close alliance is meant cordial co¬ operation ; a co-operation that recognizes- the interdependence of grower upon grower. Let the citrus industry, as a    FLORIDA »STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   157   whole, be the unit and from it radiate authoritative instructions to sub-agents whose functions are to see an ever widen¬ ing field into which all special warnings of severe frosts and cold waves find lodg¬ ment.  I am not unmindful that but few things in life are perfect, and this fact is distressingly realized when a predicted cold wave fails to materialize. The weather man is comforted, however, in the knowledge that the failure is usually a prediction of something that failed to ma¬ terialize, and not the arrival of condi¬ tions that were not predicted, which makes a great difference when viewed from the standpoint of a beneficiary, such as are fruit and vegetable growers.  Hitherto studies have been confined, mostly to the terrestrial plain, resulting   in such deductions as were founded on empirical processes. The perfected kite and the sounding balloon are now poten¬ tial agents in furthering the exploration of the upper air, giving ground for a welt founded hope that, when all data are co- rellated, we shall know more of the law of the upper air currents.  The Weather Bureau sends aloft al¬ most daily at Mount Weather, Va., either the kite or balloon, and already the data have illuminated some subjects hitherto rather obscure for we know more about the conditions governing temperature in¬ vasions, as well as wind direction and wind velocity of the upper levels, as com¬ pared with those of the lower terrestrial plain. All this information will ultimate¬ ly be made to do duty for the farmer and fruit grower^ the sailor, and the dweller within the city.@@   
Report of Standing Committee on Pecans@@   W. W. Carroll.@@   Mr. President f Ladies and Gentlemen :  Owing to the fact that the prepon¬ derance of interests connected with the Florida State Horticultural Society are engaged in producing or planting out •citrus and other semi-tropical fruits, very few suggestions have come to your committee whose task it is to make a showing for the rapidly devel¬ oping and important pecan industry.  Since no particular features have been urged for this committee’s consid¬ eration, a general report is offered, covering some of the points that may be of interest or use to those whom this report will reach.  About 1,500 acres were set out last season in Jefferson county. Orchard planting is taking hold in Leon county and the northern tier of counties show an awakening of interest in pecan planting.  The enemies of the pecan have not increased and those already known to us appear less formidable than they once did. Many now agree that “Ro¬ sette” is due to local conditions, such as soil-acidity, frost injury, soil pov¬ erty. The remedy for scab cannot as yet be definitely prescribed, but it is known that Bordeaux spray is to a con¬ siderable extent a preventive. Biting insects yield to arsenical sprays, and   the twig-girdlers and husk worms are easily held in check by burning twigs, dead husks and trash accumulating un¬ der the trees.  It is suggested that, while many plantings of pecan orchards on a large scale by promoting concerns give promise of successful issue, when prop¬ erly fortified with means and capable labor to carry out contracts, a very solid though different sort of develop¬ ment will result from arousing the in¬ terest of farmers to the point of setting out small pecan orchards as a part of a general scheme of diversification.  The following suggestions are of¬ fered as rules for planting pecan trees:  1. Select non-acid soil or correct acidity before, or soon after, planting.  2. Prepare land thoroughly and keep in condition by growing farm crops or legumes between the rows.  3. Dig holes of ample width and depth, and use two to three feet of tap¬ root.  4. Use good trees bought of relia¬ ble nurserymen.  5. Do not cut back trees unless six feet or more above ground.  6. Puddle trees in clay mud and keep moist until set.  7. Tamp earth well with rammer while filling holes, using top-soil to fill.    FLORIDA »STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   159   8. Put no fertilizer in holes when planting, and not over one-half to one pound to tree worked in on surface.  9. Use enough water to moisten filling if planted in dry weather.  Cultivate shallow every ten days till July 1st, and then '‘lay by” with peas.  In winter season, during dormancy, apply lime-salt-sulphur wash, or some of the new sulphur washes to prevent hibernation of insects.  Varieties should be selected with re¬ gard to soil and climate. For instance: Russell should do well in lower lati¬ tudes, but is too tender for the north¬ ern section. Vandeman is a favorite in the south, but shows scab in middle of northern part of the State. In the cen¬ tral peninsula Curtis is a favorite.  Frotcher thrives on sandy well- drained soils, but is not recommended   for stiff, heavy land. Many other va¬ rieties have their champions for differ¬ ent sections, but the question of adapt¬ ability to soil and climate is always im¬ portant.  It is only a question of time when such bodies as the State Horticultural Society and such authorities as the United States Department of Agricul¬ ture will openly express opinions un¬ friendly to schemes promising large revenues from pecan plantings at such early ages as four or five years. People expecting profitable yields of nuts in four to five years from setting will be disappointed. Therefore, it is well to suggest that the fairy-tale element be eliminated from the pecan business. It is big enough and strong enough and genuine enough to get along without false or misleading promises.   Irrigation   T. F. Holbrook.   Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  *  Irrigation is not a new subject, but one that is commanding the attention of all intelligent farmers and gardeners everywhere. In the western part of our country can be found irrigation systems that existed before that sec¬ tion was settled by its present popula¬ tion. These systems are now decayed and almost destroyed.  Growers throughout the entire coun¬ try are realizing that with competition so fierce, they must make the most of their products in order to secure the best results. Even here, in Florida, where the rainfall seems abundant, it is the best investment a farmer can make, and every farmer or trucker who has considered this question seriously is putting in irrigation. The Florida farmer who has not prepared to irri¬ gate, does not see the value of it, until he has a fine crop of vegetables die from want of water, then, too late, he realizes he could have more than paid for an irrigating plant with this one crop.  It is only when crops are scarce that growers realize high prices. The dry weather we so often have is one cause of vegetables being scarce and high. If you have your land irrigated, you   are protected from drouth; if not, you are the loser.  Quality is also of great importance in the way of prices. Sufficient water, when needed and properly applied, in many instances more than doubles the yield, and not only guarantees vege¬ tables and fruit of first-class quality, but frequently hastens the crop to ma¬ turity several weeks, and as a result, the crop brings a much better price.  We can readily see that it is best to irrigate as we are more sure of a crop, get a larger yield and better quality of fruit or vegetables, and obtain better prices.  We have three systems of irrigation in use in Florida. The first is surface irrigation, or running the water along the rows or in ditches. The second is sub-irrigation, or carrying the water underneath the ground in porous tile. The third, spraying the water over the plants and surface.  While any of these three systems are preferred to no irrigation, we recom¬ mend the first only to parties who are not able to install a better system. This method is used in some parts of Flor¬ ida with fairly good results. When using this method, one gets the best re¬ sults by turning the water into the ditches, or trenches, every five or six days, and within two or three days     FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   161   afterwards giving the ground a thor¬ ough working or cultivating.  The second system, or sub-irriga¬ tion, has been considered satisfactory where the land is low and requires draining, or where cheap artesian wells can be had, as no power is required to distribute the water. Recent experi¬ ments, however, show that with this system, the soil, or ground, closely sur¬ rounding this tile becomes too wet and s °ggy before sufficient moisture has reached the more distant parts. This moisture from beneath also drives the heat upwards and out of the soil, there¬ by causing the soil to become cold.  The third system, or spraying, is highly recommended, and gives satis¬ factory results under most conditions, and makes trucking and fruit-growing successful and profitable on land that otherwise would be a failure. When using this system it is unnecessary to cultivate the ground after each irrigat¬ ing, as proper spraying does not pack the soil. The water supply can be eas¬ ily controlled, and by applying the moisture to the surface, the heat is not forced out of the soil, but into it. I have in mind a celery grower on Terra Ceia Island, who last year installed a plant of the Skinner System of Irriga¬ tion. He also had sub-irrigation and used the two systems on adjoining land, or practically the same land. The celery received the same attention and nder both systems. The result was that the celery grown under the Skinner System of spraying not only made a larger yield, but matured   from three to four weeks earlier than that on the sub-irrigated land.  Another feature in favor of the spraying system is the ability for spray¬ ing with fungicides, insecticides and soluble fertilizers, as this can readily be done with but little additional cost.  A plant must have not only water, but air, and when we appreciate how much air a plant requires and how much water the soil will hold, we have the danger of too much water. The tendency frequently is to water too much. Each farmer or gardener must learn this from experience. Conditions must be carefully studied, and the water supply be under control to per¬ mit its being applied carefully and properly. We know the soil is not made up of a solid mass, but of par¬ ticles laid together with air space be¬ tween. If we magnified the soil we would find it more like a box of or¬ anges, and authorities say that 50 per cent, of the space of soil is air, or only 50 per cent, of what is apparently soil is solid matter. This bears on irriga¬ tion in one way, and that is the capacity of soil to hold water. Extensive tests have brought out the fact that soils will hold water by saturation to a great extent before the water will run off. This, of course, varies according to the kind of soil. According to tests made, plant growth stops absolutely, in clay land, when the saturation goes as low as 8 J 4 per cent., or when there is 8 per cent, as much water by weight as soil. In red clay this is 12.4 per cent., in sandy clay 13.5 per cent., and in sand 9.35 per cent.        162  Percolation is also an important question. A professor at the Wiscon¬ sin University saturated an eight-foot column of sand with 25 to 30 per cent, water. In less than twenty-four hours he found that nearly two-thirds of the water had percolated out of the sand, and in four days there was but little more than 6 per cent, of water in the sand. In sand of various degrees of fineness, in four days, there was from 6J4 to 13^2 per cent, of water, and in nine days a little less; but, there was not enough water left on the top of the column after twenty-four to forty- eight hours to continue plant growth. We can saturate the soil, but the next question is the disposition of the water. One man tested his soil, which was a clay soil, with a clay sub-soil, and at four feet turned to sand. The water was seven or eight feet below the sur¬ face. In one test the first foot of soil contained 10 lbs. of water, the second foot 17 lbs., the third foot 14 lbs., the fourth foot 10 lbs. and the fifth foot 7 lbs. The top foot had a limited amount of water, which decreased slightly from the second to the fifth, and then increased until it reached the water table; there being 22 lbs. of water in the first foot above the table. At the end of the growing season it was practically the same, except the water table had gone down a little.  Now, consider what water does when it gets into the soil. Professor King states that one-acre foot of ordinary sand contains 4,000 lbs. of phosphoric acid, 16,000 lbs. of nitrogen, lime, mag¬ nesium, soda, sulphur and other sub¬   stances soluble in water. One of the greatest effects water has is the dis¬ solving in itself salts—just as we dis¬ solve salt in water—in order to make it valuable and of use to plant life. In order to be effective, it must dissolve enough of this plant food to be suffi¬ cient for the plant, and here we have the question of how much water. If we use too much water, we dilute this plant food and the plant does not thrive properly, as the solution is not strong enough, and it takes too much water to secure the required amount of food. Hence, if we use too much or more water than the plant will absorb to ad¬ vantage, the water must go somewhere and will very likely carry some of the plant food with it. One of the best ways to find whether much water is lest by deep percolation is to dig trenches as deep as the feeding roots and the moisture that passes beyond the deepest roots in its downward course may be considered wasted.  The chemical action is also quite im¬ portant. Chemical transformation is more active when soil or surroundings are moist, and the germs which act on decaying matter, turning it into ammo¬ nia, and ammonia into nitric acid are more active when moisture is present.  We also have the question of evap¬ oration. We find in various experi¬ ments made in California, they applied from eleven to thirteen inches of water in ten hours, and found the evaporation in the first five days to be 14 per cent, and from the sixth to the eleventh day 11.4 per cent. Some sections of this plot were cultivated so the surface of                      163   the plot consisted of a mulch six inches deep. This was done after the fifth day, and it was found the evaporation from the sixth to the eleventh day, in¬ stead of being 11.4 per cent, was re¬ duced to 5.6 per cent.  In another experiment, eight inches of water was applied in ten hours. The evaporation in three days was 10 per cent; from four to six days in the part not cultivated it was 3.6 per cent. At the end of the third day, part of the soil was cultivated, and with a six-inch mulch, the evaporation was reduced in the second period of from four to six days to 1.2 per cent.  In both these experiments the ground was so wet it was several days before it could be cultivated.  In another locality, more exhaustive experiments were made, and the water applied in a way that the effect on the mulch could be observed from time the water was applied. The evaporation in a fourteen-day experiment where there was no mulch and the ground was not cultivated was found to be 45 lbs. of water. An identical pl'ot with a four-inch mulch lost 13 lbs., with an eight-inch mulch 5 lbs., and with a ten- inch mulch 1 lb. In other words, the uncultivated soil remaining in the con¬ dition in which the water was applied lost forty-five times as much as the plot under similar conditions, which was protected by a ten-inch mulch.  It has been found that the equivalent of one to one and one-quarter inches of rainfall is evaporated from the soil in a growing season.   Regarding the temperature as affect¬ ed by water. It is readily understood that soils with excessive moisture are cold soils. Plant growth stops when the temperature reaches approximately 45 degrees. When it is recognized that germination at 72 degrees soil temper¬ ature in three days equaled the germi¬ nation through a period of sixteen days under the same conditions except the temperature being reduced to 60 de¬ grees, we can appreciate the effect an undue amount of water in the soil would have on the growth and ma¬ turity of a crop.  Frost protection is a very important question. We know that groves and farms near large bodies of water are not so liable to frost as those farther away from the water. It is an interest¬ ing fact that the condensation of at¬ mospheric moisture into dew liberates a vast amount of heat. In condensing from vapor into water, a pound of dew liberates enough heat to raise five pounds of water to the boiling point. Also a ton of water crystallized into ice would liberate enough heat to raise an equal amount of water from 32 to 112 degrees. In some of the colder sec¬ tions of the country, winter irrigation has given satisfactory results. The pur¬ pose is not only to store water in the soil, but to prevent winter killing of the trees. Experience has shown that it is not best to apply too much water to orchards during the latter part of the growing season as it produces an immature growth which is easily dam¬ aged by frost.  Growers are beginning to realize the importance of correct water distribu-   164        tion. It is needless to say that in sec¬ tions where high-priced crops are pro¬ duced, as is the case in Florida, there is seldom a crop, or season, when the increased returns as a result of irrigat¬ ing will not pay the cost of irrigation. Many growers who have irrigated part of their acreage have reached the con¬ clusion that it is not profitable for them to grow crops on other than irrigated land.  Now, let us return to the method of applying the water. The above exper¬ iments certainly show that the loose condition of the soil, as would result from the use of a good spraying sys¬ tem, saves more than enough water to compensate for the evaporation of the water as it passes through the air. In one of our horticultural meetings, one man stated that when he took a bath he preferred to take one all over in¬ stead of only washing his feet; and he believed that spraying the plants from above was more beneficial for the same reason.  In connection with this, we have the experiment of a professor who, noting that in dry, hot and dusty climates, some of the plants kept putting forth new leaves. Investigating the matter carefully, he found the pores of the old leaves were clogged with dust. The new leaves seemed to be an effort on the part of the plant to develop addi¬ tional breathing space so the water taken by the roots could be dissipated into the air. The professor found that by washing and sprinkling the leaves, the growth of new leaves was stopped. We all know we do not bathe the body for the purpose of absorbing water   through the pores, but to open the pores so the moisture, or perspiration, can be dissipated into the air. This condition will also hold good in plant life.  I have also obtained some informa¬ tion which, while not relating to South¬ ern crops, will practically show the same conditions. In California, where so many of our irrigating experiments have been made, an effort was made to determine the effect of various quanti¬ ties of water applied to crops. On wheat, various plots were watered with different amounts of water from seven to twenty-seven inches. It was found the maximum crop was produced from the plot receiving the eighteen inches of rainfall during the season, and the minimum from the plot receiving twenty-seven inches, which was about half of the amount of the crop receiv¬ ing the eighteen inches. The crop re¬ ceiving the seven inches was slightly better than that receiving twenty-seven inches. While the amount of water varies for different crops, these experi¬ ments show that a specified amount produces the most effective crop and that more or less than this amount does not produce a maximum crop. A max¬ imum crop cannot be secured by any method of irrigation unless some means are devised whereby every square inch receives the proper amount of water.  Kindly allow me to state here that with the Skinner System of Irrigation this can readily be done. Many of you are familiar with the construction of this system, which consists of lines of pipe approximately fifty feet apart,         FLORIDA ,ST ATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   165   elevated overhead on supports, and small brass nozzles placed three or four feet apart in each line of pipe. These nozzle lines are connected to main or supply pipe with special fittings so that they can be rotated. The water is forced out through these nozzles in the form of spray or mist into the at¬ mosphere, and gathering more or less nitrogen from the air, falls to the plants and soil like a gentle rain.  We aim to distribute the water slowly. It has been demonstrated that one inch of rainfall per week is a suffi¬ cient quantity even in extreme For truck crops I believe it best to divide the amount of water required per week into two or three applica¬ tions, while for orange groves the re¬ quired amount can be applied at one time, or once a week. In this State it is best to water late in the afternoon  9  and at night.  We recognize that the question of irrigation is one that requires a great deal of study and experiment. Our purpose is not to solve the problem for the individual grower, but to sup¬ ply a system of irrigation that will eliminate labor and enable the grower to put on the soil the necessary water at the time it is needed, and in the most effective way.  We give a more uniform distribution of water than any other system has been able to do. Recently there has been developed an automatic device, or turning machine, which is operated by the pumping engine, that rotates the nozzle lines not only together but   in unison, which saves labor and se¬ cures an absolutely equal and uniform distribution of the water over every inch of the ground. This is very im¬ portant and essential, especially where the system is used for frost protection.  To protect from frost with the Skin¬ ner System, the nozzle lines should be kept constantly rotating, distributing the water over the plants or trees every three to five minutes. This means that every leaf and every particle of ground is getting from the water which is lia¬ ble to be frozen into ice, a consider¬ able amount of heat. By keeping the water constantly free and thoroughly distributed, there is a constant heat be¬ ing distributed over the field, and the temperature is higher than it would otherwise be. A heating device has also been developed for raising the temperature of the water. This is very valuable, and in a recent demonstra¬ tion in Texas, crops were protected through a three days’ freeze, accompa¬ nied by high wind, when the thermom¬ eter registered 16 below freezing.  The Skinner System of Irrigation can be seen throughout Florida as well as in the trucking sections of the United States and foreign countries. Its practicability is demonstrated, and although its original use was to protect from drouth, in many recent experi¬ ences it has demonstrated that the ap¬ plication of water at the proper time, in correct amounts and manner, is an essential feature in producing the best crops and earliest maturity which re¬ sult in obtaining the highest prices.   Legislative Report   Mr. Hume: I want to bring up at this time the report of the legislative com¬ mittee appointed at Orlando last year. This consisted of Mr. Temple, Mr. Bur¬ ton, Mr. Rose and Dr. Inman. Dr. In¬ man is no longer with us.  Mr. Temple : Mr. President, I wish to say on behalf of that Committee that we took up this matter and threshed it out pretty thoroughly; we also made consid¬ erable personal investigation as to what had been done in other states, and had considerable advice on the subject, and after thorough investigation it was de¬ cided that a slight modification of the law as existing in the State of Washington would be followed closely, as that was admitted to be the cleanest-cut, most ef¬ fective horticultural law in the United States. We, therefore, after consultation with attorneys had drawn up a bill that followed very closely the law as existing in Washington, only changing it where it was advised by counsel to meet our pe¬ culiar or particular state conditions. That bill as prepared, was submitted to the president, Mr. Hume, and also your Ex¬ ecutive Committee, and any further re¬ port would be in their hands, not in ours. The committee performed to the best of its ability, the duties imposed upon them, and that duty was at an end when it placed its report in the hands of your president and executive committee.   Prof. Hume: At the time this bill was referred to the president for action, Mr. Temple referred it to me with the idea of having it sanctioned by the Society, and I referred it to the Executive Com¬ mittee, and I would be pleased to hear from the chairman of that committee in regard to the action taken on this bill as drafted by our Legislative Committee of last season.  Prof. Rolfs: The meeting of the Executive Committee at Gainesville took place at Gainesville during the time of the meeting of the Seminar, at which all of the members, excepting Mr. Hubbard, were present; I believe it was decided to refer it back to the Society without rec¬ ommendation. That is all the report I can give.  Prof. Hume: The report of the com¬ mittee was taken up, and on motion it was carried that the executive committee take no action, but refer the whole matter to the Society for its consideration. That brings the report of our legislative com¬ mittee back to the Society for its dis¬ posal. What is your pleasure with re¬ gard to the report of our legislative com¬ mittee? I do not think I need to go into any of the details of the law that was drawn up; most of you are already famil¬ iar with it; nearly all of you get the Flor¬ ida Grower, where it was published.  Nobody seems to want to say anything. It puts me in mind of an old-fashioned         >   FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   • i   167   Quaker’s meeting, but the spirit does not seem to move any of you. Some action  I must be taken in regard to the report, and it is time somebody said something.  Mr. Gillette: I move the report be laid on the table.  Motion seconded.  Mr. Temple: Mr. President, who seconded that motion?  Prof. Hume : Mr. Griffiing.  Mr. Temple : While I would not move the adoption of this bill, being a mem¬ ber of this committee and acting chairman of this committee, I feel it is perfectly proper that I should discuss it. Some of you who were here, perhaps remember well the strong arguments brought to bear in favor of a horticultural bill for the State of Florida. I myself spoke rather feelingly, because I had spent a great deal of money in fighting on£ of the pests that had been brought into this state. I felt  I strongly then; I feel strongly now, in favor of some law that will protect the grower from the danger of having other diseases and insects brought into this state. We have the whitefly, and we know from recent discoveries that there are insects compared with which the whitefly is a joy and a delight. There is an orange worm that, if we ever get it started, will make us forget the whitefly altogether. We have imported from Cuba another whitefly, perhaps harder to fight because of its hairy covering which makes it impervious almost, to insecti¬ cides. Now, it seems shameful to me that when you appoint a committee to take up this matter, and present to your consideration a report that embodies al¬ most in toto a law which has been proved to be constitutional in the state where it   was adopted, and protects them against pests and diseases, that it should be laid on the table, because it meets with the disapproval of some nurserymen of this Society. Gentlemen, it is an outrage.  Mr. Gillette: Mr. President, there are always two sides to a proposition or ques¬ tion of any kind. It is true that I am interested in the nursery business. It is also true that there are probably thirty or forty individuals in the State who make their living out of the nursery busi¬ ness. I doubt if there is one of those men, and I think I speak advisedly, who is opposed to any reasonable inspection law, or any law which will provide pro¬ tection against insect pests. In fact, it is to the advantage of every nurseryman to keep them out.  The law, however, which was published in the Grower* if put into effect in the State of Florida, would virtually pui every nurseryman in the state out of busi¬ ness. It may be constitutional, but law¬ yers in the state have said it is not; por¬ tions of it, at least. There are portions of that law which make statements of this kind: I haven’t it with me. In the first place, it says: “no nurseryman shall sell trees, five per cent, of which shall be untrue to name, without being liable to a fine of $500.00, or six months imprison¬ ment, or both.” I wish to submit to the members of this Society if that is a fair proposition for any business to work under. I do not believe there is a nur¬ seryman in .,the State of Florida who does not use every means possible to keep the varieties true to name. It is part of his stock in trade; it is one of his assets, and he would be an idiot to do other¬ wise. But we are helpless, to a certain        •   168  extent. Suppose I have a budder in my nursery who, for some reason, has a grudge against me, and he knows this kind of a law is on the statute books. He says to himself that he will “do” me, and he mixed the bud wood on me. How is the nurseryman to know that this has been done until the trees begin to bear fruit? If, at the end of that time, five per cent, are untrue to name, the nursery¬ man is liable to $500.00 and imprison¬ ment for something he could not possibly prevent in any way I know of.  Another way in which the nurseryman may suffer, and where he cannot possibly help himself. Suppose I sell a man one hundred trees. Perhaps I may have trouble with him about a settlement, or some other trouble. This man, knowing the law is on the statute books, says, “I will get even with him” and he takes out the trees he has already planted and re¬ places with some other variety. When the trees begin to bear, over five per cent are untrue to name, and the nurseryman has to suffer.  Why should we have fine and imprison¬ ment held over our heads? There is no other business under heaven that could exist and prosper under such a law as that.  So far as the introduction of insect pests, the nurserymen are as anxious as anybody to keep them out. We are all fighting against them as hard as we know how.  Our state should have an inspection law, there is no question about it. Al¬ most every state requires an inspection for stock going into it. But the bill that was drafted was of such a drastic nature that no man doing business, as we are   doing it, could afford to sit idly by and have this Society endorse it, without a protest. We have talked this matter over, and feel that it would absolutely put us out of business.  There has been a bill introduced which will cover all the grounds and that bill has been reported favorably in the House and Senate. As I understand, the bill which we are discussing was reported on unfavorably. I may be wrong about that, I do not know. The bill we have prepared, puts in the hands of the Board of Control which, as we know, is con¬ nected with the Florida State Institution at Gainesville', giving them absolute au¬ thority to formulate reasonable rules for the inspection, and fumigation of nur¬ sery stock coming into the state and being grown here. We are as anxious to pro¬ tect the grower as the grower is anxious to be protected. All we ask is that we have some measure of protection our¬ selves. We certainly oppose annihilation.  Mr. Temple: The gentleman who has just spoken seems to be perfectly famil¬ iar with the deliberations of your exec¬ utive committee to which that bill was referred, because he said “we discussed this bill and found it meant annihilation.” He is also familiar with the fact, I learn¬ ed during his speech for the first time, that is, the presentation to the legisla¬ ture of a bill to take the place of the bill presented by the legislative committee. I can only say that I deplore the fact that men as deep in the counsels as these gen¬ tlemen are, should have prepared a sub¬ stitute bill and presented it to the legis¬ lature without intimating to the commit¬ tee that it was their intention to do so. It seems to me the least they could have             FLORIDA /STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   169   done would be to have consulted with the committee and drawn to its attention the very facts presented here tonight.  Moreover, he says the new bill has been approved by the House and Senate, and that the bill prepared by your com¬ mittee has been rejected. Now, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that bill has never been presented to the legis¬ lature.  Mr. Gillette: Mr. Temple, I knew nothing about the meeting of the exec¬ utive committee. I have not spoken to one of them in regard to it at all; in fact, I did not know they had held a meeting, and when I said that, I did not refer to the executive committee, but the nur¬ serymen.  Mr. Stewart: I do not know what this bill is, but Mr. Gillette’s opposition to it makes me rather in favor of it. The very fact that doctors, lawyers and merchants are held to a strict accountability in the transaction of their business, makes it proper that nursery men also should be held accountable. When they sell us well defined varieties of fruit, and charge us their regular price for them, they ought to be made to see that we get the varie¬ ties we pay for. I believe any nursery¬ man could guard himself against some¬ one putting the wrong buds in his trees. I do not believe that any man who comes here to Florida to put his money into a grove, should run the risk of putting in another variety of fruit from what he wanted and paid for. I don’t believe that if a helper in a nursery “gets sore’ at the nursery owner, that the buyer of the trees ought to pay for their scrapping.  So far as the insects are concerned, my county has suffered damage amounting   to thousands of dollars by the introduc¬ tion of insects on two or three little, ordi¬ nary plants brought there by some nur¬ seryman. I do not believe the law can be too stringent against the introduction and dissemination of insects and diseases, or that the nurseryman can be made to be too careful about what he is selling to us at a fancy price.  If that is the only objection, I would like to see it referred to the Legislature and passed. If it is here, I would like to hear it read to see whether or not I am in favor of it or not, but if the only ob¬ jections to it are those given here, I am in favor of it.  Prof. Hume: In relation to the read¬ ing of the law, I would be willing to have it done, but the law covers consid¬ erable space. It is a lengthy law. I do not believe we can have it read; still, if it is the wish of the Society, we will have it done.  (The bill referred to will be found fol¬ lowing this discussion on page 177. Sec¬ retary. )  Mr. Stewart: I think it should be read or referred to a committee. I do not think it should be thrown away without any at¬ tention being paid to it. The Society cannot tell anything about the bill with¬ out knowing what is in it.  Mr. Stockbridge: There is one point I would like to call to your attention, that is that the same objections made to this bill, are practically the identical ob¬ jections made in every state in the Union to any bill of this character. You will remember the first attempt to restrict and control the fertilizer trade. When the first fertilizer control bill was intro¬ duced in this country, in the Massachu-   170        setts legislature, the very identical excep¬ tions made to this bill were made there, and the same arguments were made, ex¬ cept in the place of the word “varieties” substitute “fertilizer.” It is just exactly as feasible to change the contents or tag on a sack of fertilizer as it is in the case of the nurseryman changing the variety or changing the tag. But it seems to me that the fertilizer men will agree now that it works really to their interest and pro¬ tects the honest fertilizer man against the dishonest one. I think that the law in question, with some amendments, should pass. There may possibly be some points where it should be changed, but the principles are correct. The fertilizer laws have worked out to be not only of bene¬ fit to the fertilizer consumer, but to the fertilizer manufacturer.  Mr. Stewart: I make a motion that this bill be approved and recommended to the legislature for passing, and that a committee of this Society be appointed to see that it is properly presented to the legislature, and that the committee be em¬ powered to add to, and substitute what they may think necessary to get it in such shape as to insure its passing.  Mr. Miller: I read this bill when it was first published, with considerable -amusement, to think that such a bill could he introduced, or proposed for the state of Florida. I cannot conceive how an orange grower could favor such a bill. It places his property in the hands of an inspector, to destroy the grove and charge up the bill for destruction to the owner. He is absolutely at the mercy of this in¬ spector. Further, it creates a great num¬ ber of office holders, which would require an immense amount of revenue of the   state funds, to put this law into opera¬ tion. That alone, I believe, would pre¬ vent the bill from ever passing our leg¬ islature.  In regard to the nursery inspection, I think other laws just as feasible can be drawn up that will prove satisfac¬ tory to the nursery interests and to the growers. If this bill passes, it means that the purchaser of nursery stock in Florida will get it out of other states.  Mr. Griffing: I do not think the So¬ ciety here, Mr. Stockbridge or Judge Stewart realize or appreciate what is in this bill. That matter of the trueness to name of varieties is only one of many. That matter is not as important to the nurseryman, as the fact that we want a law. The nurserymen want a law. Please understand that right now. In this state, there are probably three or four million dollars invested in nursery inter¬ ests. About 50 to 75 per cent, of their prodtict leaves the state. Without a law we are unable to ship into most of the states. Up to the present time, through the courtesy of the director of the Ex¬ periment Station, and the courtesy of Dr. Berger, and the entomologist of the Ex¬ periment Station, they have consented to inspect the nurseries and give them a cer¬ tificate which the states requiring an in¬ spection has seen fit to accept. That cer¬ tificate, however had no legal standing. It was simply accepted as a courtesy, and because they had confidence in our state institutions.  The Department at Washington has in¬ structed our Director of the Experiment Station, that the State Entomologist shall not hereafter inspect nurseries. That leaves the nurserymen of Florida with-     FLORIDA /STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   out any provision for inspection. The states to which we ship from 50 to 75 per cent, of our stock, nearly all of them re¬ quiring inspection, are now closed to us, because our stock is not inspected and we have no way of getting it. Don’t you see that the nurserymen are anxious to have a law?  The law that has been proposed by your committee carries with it an appro¬ priation so large that I am afraid that it would never pass. You know there are a bunch of legislators who go to Talla¬ hassee every year who are called “watch dogs of the treasury,” and if a matter involved a considerable amount of money, they would fight it, no matter how much merit it might have.  The nurserymen could not wait for that law to pass, and, besides, there was a possibility of its not passing, so we got together and formulated a law, on the same lines as some of the most effective laws of the country. It places in the hands of the Board of Control, who have the management of the University and the Experiment Station, the power to formulate the rules and regulations covering the inspection.  Now, if the measure which this Board of Control wish to enforce upon the nur¬ serymen is not sufficiently stringent, the objection can be laid before them and the measure made stronger.  There are features of this law which are impracticable. We have a great many people who believe in the natural enemies for the insect pests. I am one of these. We spent thousands of dollars in spray¬ ing a large peach orchard. The following year we introduced the fungi into the or¬ chard at less than one-tenth the cost of   171  the spraying, and the fungi were more effective. One feature of this law re¬ quires that every tree over a year old should be sprayed with lime, sulphur and salt, and do you know the results to the fungi ?  We nurserymen want a law which will protect against the importation and dis¬ semination of insect pests, and I believe the bill that has been passed favorably by committees of the House and the Sen¬ ate provides this protection.  The measure Mr. Gillette mentioned, I think you will find a law already on the statute books which partially or wholly covers it; that is, if a man knowingly sells trees that are untrue to name, you can get him with laws already on the statute books. If he does not know it, you can¬ not convict him before a jury. Further than that, you cannot prosecute a man after two or three years, and by the time you find out that the trees are untrue to name, the time has elapsed and you can¬ not get him anyhow.  We have a law now before us in the legislature which will provide the nur¬ serymen with the inspection which they must have, and which will protect the. horticultural interests against a careless nurseryman who might import diseases, and against the nurseryman from outside the state, according to the rules that your Board of Control may see fit to place up¬ on the nurserymen and the transportation companies.  How many of us remember a few years ago, we were sure that certain diseases and insects were going to put us out of business entirely? We do not think near¬ ly as seriously of them today. The scien¬ tific knowledge acquired of them has en-   172        abled us to combat them until they are minor troubles. Do you think it wise to put a law upon the statute books describ¬ ing all these different diseases and insects and laws regulating their control, or is it best to place the authority in the hands of a responsible body of five men, to make rules and regulations which will cover the different troubles which will come up from time to time, and before which a committee from this Society, or any other body could go and stand more chance of getting a reasonable ruling than you could before a legislature of 150 men, more than ninety per cent of whom have no in¬ terest in horticulture ? They do not un¬ derstand the insect pests, or diseases, or methods of control. It is my honest opin¬ ion that we should leave it in the hands of the Board of Control to make these regulations. They will have expert data at their command who can give them the proper advice, and the matter will be taken out of politics. They will be ac¬ cessible to a committee which might be appointed from this Society or from the nurserymen.  I think that the remarks of Mr. Gil¬ lette have been misconstrued. It is not that the nurserymen fear prosecution on account of sending out some variety that may not be true to name, but the fear that we are not going to get a law, that moves us to action.  Mr. Stewart: There was a committee appointed by this body. I would ask if this committee of nurserymen submitted their bill to this committee or invited them to assist them in preparing their bill which, in a way, is a substitute for the bill submitted by the Society’s committee.  Mr. Grifffng: The nurserymen acted   independently entirely, and prepared the bill and had it presented.  Mr. Stewart: Did they consider or re¬ port to the committee of the Society?  Mr. Griffing: We did not have time. Time is a vital feature in getting a bill through the legislature. It is very doubt¬ ful now if we get the bill through much before the close of the legislature. The bill is of but little interest to the majority of the legislators, and bills of that kind move slowly. It is very easy to sidetrack them and adjourn before the measure is reached. Furthermore, the nurserymen were working as nurserymen, and we did not know what we could do with the committee if we went to them, and if we delayed until this meeting before we brought this matter up, the chances are we would not get the bill up to Talla¬ hassee in time to get it through.  Mr. Stewart: As I understand it, the method of procedure is to go before a committee of five—that is, the Board of Control, and get rules adopted by them. They become a kind of executive board to make rules and adopt laws for the regu¬ lation of the diseases, etc. The law is passed and referred to the Board of Con¬ trol to make rules and regulations. That would be an act of the legislators, to cre¬ ate the law.  Mr. Griffing: Certainly, the legisla¬ ture would pass a law giving them the authority. Has not the legislature the right to place matters of this kind under the supervision of others besides the leg¬ islature? Of course, the law must be made in the first place by the legislature. We do not mean that the Bord of Control will have the right to make laws; we know that they cannot do that, but they     FLORIDA »STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   173   can make rules to cover the requirements, and carry out the law as an act.  The Board of Control, you understand, is the body which governs the Florida Experiment Station and the University and our school system. Possibly some¬ one more familiar with the working of that body could give you more informa¬ tion than I can.  Prof. Rolfs: It seems that this nur¬ serymen’s bill has been interpreted as being broader than it really is. It is merely a general rule for covering the in¬ spection of nurseries. In regard to the bill that was approved by the nursery men, I was acquainted with the provis¬ ions of that. It legalizes what the Ex¬ periment Station had been doing before, and it does not cover anything but the inspection of the nursery.  Now, about the question Mr. Griffing asks about the Board of Control. The Board of Control has charge of all the institutions of higher education in the state; the Women’s College, the College for the Deaf and Blind, the College for Negroes, and the University of Florida.  In regard to the general wording of the bill. I do not know that we care to go into that particularly, but its general pro¬ visions give the Board of Control merely the same power that it exercised over Dr. Berger before, but in an entirely legal way. Before, it was merely semi-legal; there was no state inspection for the nur¬ series.  Mr. Temple : Does that law, as you are familiar with it, have any power whatever on importations with a view of shutting out diseases, insects, etc., from coming into the state? From what I can gather, it affects nursery stock alone.   Prof. Rolfs: Answering your ques¬ tion, I think not. I think it is confined to the nursery stock alone. It does not affect the general horticultural law we need so much for the state. We need the horticultural law, and it would greatly lessen the work and worry of the Ex¬ periment Station if we could have a gen¬ eral horticultural law. In this case, the nursery men met and asked me to help them with a particular bill, and I helped them as much as I would help anyone else.  Mr. Tabor: I think it is due to the executive committee, and myself as a member of it, to say that in our action we simply did what we thought to be for the best interests of the Society. We wanted to leave for the Society to deter¬ mine whether or not they wished to en¬ dorse this bill. We did not wish to say that as the Executive Committee, and yet we felt it, and we talked this matter over thoroughly. We did not believe, as has already been said, that the bill would go through the legislature. We did not be¬ lieve that the legislature would appropri¬ ate the arnonut of money that the passage of this bill would entail. We knew that we had to do something in the way of protection, and there was a bill presented to the Executive Committee by the nur¬ serymen, to see if they would sanction that in place of the Temple-Burton bill. The Executive Committee thought that they should sanction no bill. They felt that if the matter came before the Hor¬ ticultural Society, they should thresh it out.  I am sorry that the so-called “Temple Bill” is not before you to be read. I am sure there is not a member of this So-   174        ciety that does not appreciate the work the committee did in presenting that bill. I am sure there is not a member of this Society who does not thank the members of that legislative committee for the work they did. In thanking them for that work, I do not know that we should nec¬ essarily adopt their conclusions. Mr. Temple is perfectly right in standing up for something that he presented and had a great deal of work in connection with. He went into it from his standpoint and thought it was a good bill, and I think Mr. Temple is to be upheld to the extent that they did the best they could, and I am sorry if there should be anything ap¬ proaching ill feeling about this.  I do think the Society should know ex¬ actly what they are voting on.  The nurserymen believe that the bill .could not pass the legislature. They do not believe it to be—the nurserymen I am speaking of now—to the best interest of the state that it should pass. The nur¬ serymen have to have protection of some ; kind, or go out of business, and with three or four million dollars worth of property it became necessary to take some prompt action or that property would be jeopardized, if not wiped out. I sub¬ mit that the nurserymen are entitled to some protection.  I hope this matter will be rightly set¬ tled. I do not think because we differ from another man’s idea that his motives -are wrong. I respect any man who will .stand up for what he believes to be right. That is why I am on the floor now, to uphold the so-called nursery bill and re¬ lieve the executive committee of any onus in any way. They simply did nothing; They sanctioned neither bill. They did not   believe the Temple bill to be the one which should be upheld by this Society, and they left it for the Society to say whether they would uphold it. They did not sanction the nurserymen’s bill, the one in which I am interested. We did not think we should endorse it as the Executive Com¬ mittee of the Society, but put the whole matter before the Society to act on as they saw fit.  Mr. Temple: Just in closing my ar¬ gument, I want to drive a few facts home. In the first place, the so-called “Temple Bill” has absolutely no Temple in it. I did not instigate one line of that bill. I take no interest whatever in its passage or rejection by this Society, other than my interest as a producer of citrus fruits. Therefore, I have no personal pique in the matter.  This bill carries with it an appropria¬ tion of $25,ocx) for its operation, and not $60,000, as was stated during the argument.  Again, it is strange to me that with all the fault found with this bill tonight, that those faults have not been found and passed on by the people of the State of Washington. The first good horticul¬ tural bill ever adopted was, I believe, the California bill, and that bill was admit¬ ted to be good and sufficient, and yet they afterwards had to add things to that to make it more specific and more drastic. Later, Washington, adopted the features of the old and new bills, and added to it still further elaborations as shown by the necessities of the case, and the bill as presented to this Society contains not one word or idea of our own, or of that com¬ mittee. We have taken existing laws that have borne the tests of time, and sifted       FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   1 75   these laws and found what is best and tendered it to you. It took time to do it, but when it was done we immediately re¬ ported it to your president and executive committee. Now, what? Your execu¬ tive committee tells me on the floor of this room that as they did not see fit to approve the Temple bill, and as the nur¬ serymen’s bill was presented to that com¬ mittee for their consideration, with the request that they approve it, that they could not recommend the other. Did it occur to them, as fair-minded men, that the square thing was to report that so- called “nursery bill” to the committee they have appointed, and ask their opin¬ ion on it ? That seems to have been lost, and I don’t like it.  Mr. Tabor: I think there is another little side to that thing that should relieve the executive committee of some of the fault, and I will tell you what it is. I saw a letter from Mr. Temple to our president in which he said something like this: “Here is the bill that we have form¬ ulated ; we have done the best we could. It could not be presented before the leg¬ islature except with the Society’s sanc¬ tion, and it is ‘up to’ them to do what they please with it.” I understood that they were simply carrying out their ideas of duty in presenting this bill, had pres¬ ented it, and that they would not feel in any way interested, in their official ca¬ pacity as a committee, if the Society did not accept it. I submit for myself and for the executive committee that we had no thought of slighting them in not present¬ ing for their consideration the nursery bill. We could not amend their bill. The nursery men’s bill is so simple in com¬ parison with theirs it is almost nothing,   and we had not the slightest idea that it was going to rankle or make them feel that we had overlooked them in any way by not presenting to their consideration,, the other bill.  Prof. Rolfs: After considering the matter, I believe that I have not acted the way I would have if I had thought of it in the way Mr. Temple has presented it. As an executive committee we should have turned it back to the committee. I think Mr. Temple is right, and I am glad to stand corrected, and if it were to do over again, the matter would not have had the handling which it had. I assure you that the handling was not due to the influence of anyone else, but it was my fault, and not the other fellow’s fault. I want to confess frankly to Mr. Temple that I made a mistake there, and did what I should not have done.  Prof. Blair: Would an amendment be- in order? It has been stated on the floor tonight that there are always two sides- to a question. This is a matter of ad¬ justing differences. There is a motion before us to appoint a committee to take this bill before the legislature. Would Mr. Stewart accept the amendment to let this committee represent both sides; say three from the nursery standpoint and three from the growers? We can thrash over this until midnight and never arrive at an end. A committee representing both sides can take it up and discuss the points better than we can. My amend¬ ment is simply that the committee rep¬ resent both sides.  Mr. Stewart: I have no objection to the amendment, but I do not see where there are two sides to the question. The committee which I moved be appointed   176        was to consist of members of this So¬ ciety ? and not to represent either nursery¬ men or growers; simply a committee of the Society. However, I have no objec¬ tion to the amendment.  Mr. Blackman: I want to remark, Mr. President, that the orange growers, cit¬ rus growers in Dade County are so afraid that the Temple bill would not pass, that they organized a Society of their own, and a bill will be presented to the legis¬ lature this year similar to the Temple bill, but only effective in Dade County. That is the way we feel about it down there.  Prof. Hume: Mr. Secretary, will you please take this chair; I feel that I must make some remarks.  (Secretary takes chair.)  Prof. Hume: I want to say this in re¬ gard to the matter of the bill as sent to the president by Mr. Temple. Mr. Tem¬ ple referred it to me for my action. I think that was his first letter to me. I replied to him that I did not think it was my place to act, because we have an ex¬ ecutive committee whose business it is to act for the Society when it is not in ses¬ sion. I turned it over to the executive committee. I wrote Mr. Temple in re¬ gard to it, and told him I believed there were some good things in the bill, and I also told him I thought there were some objections to it.  Now, then, I had something to do, un¬ fortunately, with the nursery bill. Un¬ fortunately for the people of this state, and unfortunately for the people of other states, I am a nurseryman. I am, also, unfortunately, the president of your So¬ ciety, so I am placed in a peculiar posi¬ tion in regard to this whole matter; but 1 will say this in regard to the nursery   men; that the bill introduced by the nur¬ serymen has nothing to do with the bill you have before you for discussion. The nurserymen were suddenly placed where there was no provision made for the in¬ spection of nurseries, and the selling of nursery stock, running up perhaps more than half a million, 50 or 75 per cent, go¬ ing into other states and with no provis¬ ion made by which our product could be marketed—what was to be done? They left the horticultural law alone: they did not touch it. They formulated and in¬ troduced a bill which was in their interest, which provided for inspection of their nurseries which left it in the hands of the authorities which were there before, to make that inspection as rigid as they chose, but which gave the inspection, and that was all they were after. That bill was not a substitute for the original bill, it was a bill made for an emergency. The nurserymen were within their rights.  I agree with Prof. Rolfs that the ex¬ ecutive committee did not handle the bill presented to them by Mr. Temple in the right way. I agree with Mr. Temple in his position. I agree that the Temple bill has many remarkable features in it. But, the nurserymen were in a box, and as business men they had to act, and act quick, and I believe they did right in that.  Now, then, the bill they have presented does not interfere, nor would it interfere, with the workings of the other bill. The only difference in the nursery bill and the bill we are discussing now, is this: the nursery bill is a general bill. It is found¬ ed on the same lines as ninety-five per cent, of the similar bills of this country, and I can read into it word for word the bills of many other states. That bill was           177   a general bill which put into the hands of authorities already in control, the power to make regulations by which the nursery men should be governed. All it did was to provide that the machinery of the Board of Control should be put behind these nursery inspections, and legalize them so that the nursery product can be sold in any of the States where they have inspection laws.  Mr.-: I do not see how we can  intelligently vote upon this bill. I don’t know anything about it except what I have heard tonight, and it looks to me as though the nurserymen’s bill does not cover what we ought to have in this state. It seems to be simply a provision for the nurserymen to sell their stock. The or¬ ange grower is going to be left out; he will have no protection except through the courtesy of the officials, as spoken of to¬ night. The bill we are interested in is the bill given to the executive committee. From what we have heard tonight, we are led to believe that it would interfere with the grower; that it will leave the power to chop down his trees and destroy them, and charge the cost up to him, etc. Are   we going to vote for a bill to put the power in the hands of some individual to come and destroy our groves? I cannot vote for a bill of that kind, but I would like to know very much what that bill provides for. I don’t see how we can vote tonight on that bill, at all.  Prof. Hume: Are you ready for the question? Those in favor of appointing a committee to represent both interests, the nursery and the grower to act on it, please certify by saying “aye.” Cont- trary “no.”  Amendment carried.  Prof. Hume: Now, we come back to the vote on the original motion. Those in favor of appointing a committee to consider this bill, signify by saying “aye.” Contrary “no.”  Carried.  By general consent the committee was appointed by nomination from, the floor.  Committee appointed (to consider the bill presented by the Legislative Commit¬ tee appointed last year.)  Messrs. M. E.

Resolutions   The following resolutions were passed by the Florida State Horticultural So¬ ciety during its twenty-fourth session:  To the Honorable Board of Control, Uni¬ versity of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Honorable Sirs :  We beg leave to submit for your con¬ sideration the following resolutions, viz.  Whereas, There is a great need in the State of Florida, of men trained in the practical work of treating for scale in¬ sects, whitefly and fungus diseases of cit¬ rus, and other fruit and nut trees, and Whereas, We find that there are com¬ paratively few men who have the requi¬ site knowledge to handle insects and dis¬ eases of citrus and other trees in a prac¬ tical and up-to-date way, and  Whereas , There is a very great de¬ mand on the part of Horticulturists for men, well equipped with proper knowl¬ edge of such work. Therefore, be it Resolved, That the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural Society respectfully request the University of Florida to hold a three or four weeks’ course, giving in- of fungicides and insecticides. Be it further  Resolved, That if such a course is pro¬ vided for by the University, that the Florida State Horticultural Society will pledge itself to secure the attendance of fifteen men competent and willing to take such a course of instruction. Be it further   Resolved t That the University of Flor¬ ida give the course of instruction at such a time of the year as may be practical for the faculty of the University to do so and at the same time be as convenient for citrus and other fruit and nut growers as may be.  Respectfully submitted,  (Signed) O. W. Connor,  L. B. Skinner,  W. J. Driscoll, Committee.   SPECIAL COMMITTEE.  A meeting of the Special Committee to act on the Horticultural Bill as drafted by the Legislative Committee of the Flor¬ ida State Horticultural Society was held on May 5th at the Aragon Hotel. Mem¬ bers of the committee present were Messrs. Gillett, Taber and Conner rep¬ resenting the nursery men, Messrs. Stew¬ art, Felt and Painter for the growers. Mr. Gillett was elected chairman and Mr. Painter secretary.  The following resolution was offered by Judge Stewart:  Whereas, The time being so limited, the bill being so voluminous and so many important questions being involved, and it being practically impossible to get this bill in proper condition to present to the Legislature and passed at this session, therefore be it            Resolved, That the bill be referred back to the Florida State Horticultural Society with this suggestion, that a com¬ mittee representing all interested be ap¬ pointed by the president to reconstruct the bill to be presented to the next meet¬ ing of the Florida State Horticultural So¬ ciety.  Seconded by Mr. Felt. Carried.  (Signed) M. E. Gillett,  Chairman.   WEATHER BUREAU.  Whereas, The Florida Times-Union and the Evening Metropolis of Jackson¬ ville, Fla., are publishing the daily weather maps; and  Whereas, Such action places import¬ ant weather data in the hands of fruit and vegetable growers every 12 hours, and makes possible a wider field in the distribution and study of meteorology—a science so vital to the interest of this State and to the public at large; Be it  Resolved, That the Horticultural Association of Florida hereby makes known its appreciation of the enterprise, and commends said papers for their effort in furthering the cause of knowledge. And further be it  Resolved, That the Secretary be in¬ structed to furnish the Editors of the publications named with copies of this Resolution.  H. Harold Hume, Pres. Society.  P. H. Rolfs, Chmn. Ex. Com.  E. O. Painter, Sec. Society,  Jacksonville, Fla., May 5th, 1911.  SCHOOL BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT.  Whereas, There is now pending be¬ fore the Florida Legislature, a bill au-   189  thorizing counties to issue bonds for the erection of school buildings and school equipment, therefore be it  Resolved , That the Florida State Horticultural Society heartily approve this bill and instruct the Secretary to send a copy of same to Tallahassee to be instrumental in the passage of this bill, that our legislators may be advised of the facts that we are strongly in favor of same.   GOOD ROADS.  Whereas , I learn with deep regret that we cannot hear Mr. Chas. H. Hoyt’s paper on “Good Roads” tonight, especi¬ ally as he came so far to give it, and as I am probably the principal offender in taking up the time I feel we should ten¬ der to Mr. Hoyt our sincere regrets at his not being able to stay long enough to give his paper, therefore be it  Resolved, That the Florida State Horticultural Society regrets circumstan¬ ces were such that Mr. Hoyt could not deliver his illustrated lecture on “Good Roads” and that the sincere thanks of the Society be tendered him for his attend¬ ance at the meeting to deliver the lecturre.  W. C. Temple.  Carried.   GREEN FRUIT.  i  Mr. Hart: There is one other matter which I think should be brought before this Society and upon which they should take action. That is the matter of ship¬ ping green oranges out of the State. That works against us more, perhaps, than any other one thing, and I think some official           190  notice should be taken of the bill which is now before the Legislature prohibiting the shipment of this green fruit out of Florida. Those of us who have the pres¬ ent and future interest of Florida at heart, and who want to deal squarely with consumers, should not be made to suffer by the few who are after the dollar ‘Tight now,” and care nothing for the reputa¬ tion of the Florida orange, or a “square deal” with those who may be deceived into buying their green stuff, so long as they succeed in getting a few dollars more.  Prof. Rolfs: As usual, Mr. Hart has said the right thing at the right time. Some action should certainly be taken by this Society; therefore, I move that the Horticultural Society unanimously ap¬ prove the matter of prohibiting, or cur¬ tailing as much as possible, the shipment of green (possibly the word “green” is ill-advised, and had better be changed to unripe or immature) fruit.  Motion seconded.  Mr. Hume: It has been moved and seconded that this Society approve Bill No. 140, introduced by Mr. Massey, which prohibits the sale and transporta¬ tion of immature citrus fruits.  Motion unanimously carried.  Mr. Hart: I will say that it has al¬ ready had the first and second reading and will go to a vote in a few days. What action we take should be at once.  Mr. Hume: I believe the bill is one of the best bills that has ever been intro¬ duced into our Legislature. The ship¬ ping of immature citrus fruits from Flor¬ ida has done more injury to the Florida citrus market than possibly any other one thing that has been done in the way of   handling citrus fruits in this State, and I do not believe this Society can do any¬ thing better for themselves individually and to the State at large than to give their endorsement to this particular bill.  I will instruct the Secretary to forward the resolution to the Legislature.  (The resolution was duly forwarded to Tallahassee and the following is the bill as passed.—Secretary.)  Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State  of Florida:  iSection 1. That it shall be unlawful for any one to sell, offer for sale, ship or deliver for shipment any citrus fruits that are imma¬ ture or otherwise unfit for consumption, and for any one to receive any such fruits under a contract of sale, or for the purpose of sale, or of offering for sale, or for shipment or delivery for shipment. This section shall not apply to sales or contracts for sale of citrus fruits on the trees under this section; nor shall it apply to common carriers or their agents who are not interested in such fruits, and who are merely receiving the same for transpor¬ tation.  Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any one to misbrand any package or any wrapper con¬ taining citrus fruits; and all citrus fruits shall be deemed misbranded if the package or the wrapper shall bear any statement, design or device regarding the fruit therein contained, which is false or misleading either as to the name, size, quality or brand of such fruit or as to locality in which it was grown.  Section 3. Whosoever shall violate any of the provisions of this act shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprison¬ ment, and the fruit, whether immature or otherwise unfit for consumption or misbrand¬ ed. shall be subject to seizure and disposition as in the case of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs.        I 9 T   FINAL RESOLUTIONS.   Whereas , At the meeting of the twen¬ ty-fourth annual session of the Florida State Horticultural Society the members of the Society were the recipient of many courtesies and favors, therefore be it Resolved , That the thanks of the  members of the Florida State Horticul¬ tural Society be extended to the Mayor and the Board of Trade, to the hotels and citizens of Jacksonville generally for their considerate attention. Be it further Resolved , That the thanks of the So¬ ciety are due to the officers who have so   ably discharged their duties and to the standing committees who have contribut¬ ed so fully of their knowledge and ex¬ perience for the advancement of horti¬ culture in Florida. Be it further  Resolved , That the thanks of the So¬ ciety are due Mr. Mills, the florist, for the beautiful decorations in the hall dur¬ ing the time of the meeting.  E. S. Hubbard,  W, L.

Some Diseases Due to Malnutrition   B. F. Floyd.   The average citrus grower can recog¬ nize the presence of disease in his trees, but he frequently fails to distinguish be¬ tween different diseases, and to ascertain their causes. Some will attribute all their tree troubles to unfavorable growth con¬ ditions; while others consider them to be due wholly to the attacks of insects, fungi, or bacteria.  CLASSES OF PLANT DISEASES.  All plant diseases may be included in two large classes: those that are due to the attacks of living organisms, and those due to unfavorable growth condi¬ tions. These two classes are not entirely independent of each other. It often happens that trees growing under unfa¬ vorable conditions are in consequence made more susceptible to the attacks of parasites, and vice versa. For example, citrus trees weakened by the cold are more susceptible to attack by the wither- tip fungus (Colletotrichum gloeosporio- ides) ; and also citrus trees attacked by the withertip fungus are more easily in¬ jured by cold than are healthy trees. Cit¬ rus trees badly infested with the white- fly are more susceptible to injury by cold than are healthy trees; but in this respect, as well as in other instances of insect in¬ festation, the contrary is not known to be the case.  what is disease?  The dictionary says that disease is a   morbid condition resulting from a failure or disturbance of the normal living pro¬ cesses. It defines the word morbid as be¬ ing in an abnormal state; or, not sound and healthful. Therefore, a plant dis¬ ease is an unsound or unhealthful state that results from a failure or disturb¬ ance of the normal living processes in the plant body.  v  WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF A DISEASE?  The cause of a plant disease is that thing or condition that produces the fail¬ ure or disturbance of the normal living processes in the plant body. These things and conditions are, first, hostile organisms, such as insects, fungi and bacteria; second, unfavorable growth conditions; and, third, a combination of these factors.  From this it is seen that hostile organ¬ isms affect the plant in nearly the same manner as do unfavorable growth con¬ ditions, in that each affects the normal living processes. For example, the with¬ ertip fungus, in attacking the citrus tree, affects the living processes in that tree as truly as does lack of soil drainage or severe cold.  ♦  WHAT ARE THE LIVING PROCESSES IN THE PLANT BODY?  Processes within the plant that are necessary to life are, respiration, nutri-        FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   tion, absorption, transpiration and growth.  The plant breathes, that is, it uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a by-product, as man and other animals do. It absorbs raw food materials from the soil and air, and manufactures them into food for the repair of old parts and the building up of new parts, this building up process being growth. It evaporates the water it does not need by the process called transpiration. These are the living processes in the plant, and it is the fail¬ ure or disturbance of one or more of these that produces that state of the plant called disease.  WHAT are FAVORABLE GROWTH CONDI¬ TIONS?  The conditions that are essential to the life of the plant may be classed as fol¬ lows :  1. Proper food; which is obtained from the soil and air.  2. Water; which is the carrier of the food materials and is a necessary part of the living substance.  3. Proper temperature; which makes possible the vital activities that go on within the body of the plant.  4. Proper light; that furnishes the plant with energy.  5. Proper freedom from mechanical and other disturbances that might prevent the plant carrying on its activities.  6. Proper amount of oxygen in the air surrounding the plant and in the air of the soil.  These are the external conditions that are necessary for the maintenance of normal life processes within the plant. Any failure or disturbance of these fac¬   195  tors affects the living processes of the plant, and may result in that state known as disease. Diseases that originate thus are known as Physiological Diseases. If the disease results primarily from a dis¬ turbance of the living processes by im¬ proper feeding it is known as a malnu- tritional disease.  On the other hand, if the living pro¬ cesses are disturbed by living organisms, such as insects, fungi, or bacteria, the disease produced is generally spoken of as an insect, fungous or bacterial disease.  I  SOME DISEASES DUE TO MALNUTRITION.  \  Although much has been said and written of malnutritional diseases, little has been done towards working out a thorough system of proof that these dis¬ eases are actually due to conditions of malnutrition. For ,this reason many diseases are classed as malnutritional dis¬ eases that are reallv due to other known  *  or unknown causes.  Harter, in a bulletin on the control of malnutritional diseases (Virginia Truck Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 1) claims that the truck crops of that region, especially cabbage and spinach, are affect¬ ed with malnutritional diseases, the con¬ tributing causes for which are soil acidity, a deficiency of humus in the soil and the absence of desirable nitrifying bacteria. He states that remedial and preventive measures should consist of : (1) Limi¬  tation of the amounts of fertilizer used; (2) adjustment of the composition of the fertilizer to suit the crop require¬ ments; (3) the rational use of lime, and, (4) the maintenance of the organic mat¬ ter of the soil.   196        Amongst the diseases of the citrus, Dieback, Melanose, Yellow Spotting and Frenching have been classed as malnu- tritional diseases. But from recent in¬ vestigations it is concluded that Melanose is probably due to some organism. As in the case of all other malnutritional dis¬ eases, the primary cause of Dieback has not yet been traced; but it seems probable that it is connected with the nitrogenous feeding of the plant. The probable cause of Frenching is a disturbance of feeding conditions in the roots.  O. Butler (Bui. 168, California Exper¬ iment Station) concludes, from his ob¬ servations, that' the grape-shrivel is a dis¬ ease of the fruit of grapes that is due to improper feeding conditions.  The injurious effects of over-fertliza- tion and of chemical injury may be classed as malnutritional troubles. Many cases of injury to the citrus tree from giving very large amounts of readily available fertilizers are known. Quite frequently injury is reported from the use of bluestone, both beneath the bark and on the soil around citrus trees, for the treatment of Dieback.  Headden (Bui. 131, Colorado Experi¬ ment Station) reports an injury of fruit trees which he concludes is due to arsenic in the soil, that had collected there from the continued use of arsenical sprays.  Other instances of presumed malnu¬ tritional troubles might be mentioned.  TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DIS¬ EASES.  The method of treatment for a disease due to organisms is radically different from that which must be employed for   a disease due to adverse conditions of growth. The purpose of the treatment for a disease due to an organism is to kill or prevent the growth of that organ¬ ism. For that reason, we use insecticides, such as whale-oil soap, for insects; and fungicides, such as Bordeaux mixture, for fungi; and we prune to remove the diseased portion which serves as a source of infection for healthy parts. But in the treatment of diseases due to adverse growth conditions, these methods are worthless. For these diseases it is neces¬ sary to right the conditions under which the plant is growing. These conditions are those which have been enumerated above. *  conclusion.  The facts presented in this paper may be summed as follows:  1. A plant disease is an unsound or unhealthful stat$ that results from a fail¬ ure or disturbance of the normal living processes in the plant body.  2. The causes of disease in plants are insects, fungi, bacteria, or adverse factors of growth.  3. Diseases due to adverse factors of growth are known as Physiological Dis¬ eases; among which those due to im¬ proper feeding conditions are malnutri¬ tional diseases.  4. Though there are many malnutri¬ tional diseases, it is difficult to prove that a disease belongs to this class.  5. To treat diseases due to organisms, it is necessary to destroy or prevent the growth of the organism.  6. To treat a physiological or a mal¬ nutritional disease, it is necessary to right the growing conditions of the plant.     Secretary’s Report   Mr. President, Members of the Florida  State Horticultural Society, Ladies and  Gentlemen :  Another year has come and gone and the twenty-fourth annual session of the Florida State Horticultural Society will soon be a thing of the past. Before the meeting the secretary was very enthusi¬ astic over the prospects of a very large attendance as the number of new mem¬ bers and renewals exceeded that of pre¬ vious years about a hundred or more. The number having paid up to the time of the meeting last year was 221 while this year we have 341 which shows an increase of about 33 1-3 per cent. I re¬ gret to say^ however, that the attendance is not quite as large as in previous years as at the present time we have enrolled only 148 and of course part of these are Jacksonville people.  I think this lack of attendance is due mainly to the rate, or lack of rates, that the transportation companies offer to the members of the Society. The members are probably aware that unless as many as 200 reach Jacksonville by rail and have either bought a straight ticket, or come on mileage, that there will be no reduc¬ tion in the return rate. From the present indications it seems our attendance will not reach the 200 mark, consequently there is no rate given us. The special   rate given us is not quite as low as the rate that could be secured by the use of mileage. It must be rather exasperating to people who give so much to the rail¬ roads in the way of traffic going and com¬ ing that they should not be given a rate of one fare for the round trip.  Owing to the liberality of a number of our members, the Society was enabled to pay all of its obligations last year and still leave a balance in the treasury. I estimate that this balance and the income from the regular members this year will nearly if not quite be enough funds to take care of the expenses for this year and the members will not have to be cal¬ led on for donations.  I wish to thank these liberal members personally and in the name of the So¬ ciety for their contributions.  I also wish to call attention of our members to the fact that the reports of the Florida State - Horticultural Society are in demand all over the United States. During the last year we have sold three copies of the 1905 report, two copies of the 1906, three of the 1907, three of 1908 and sixty-four of 1909. Besides the above we have had inquiries for copies dating prior to the fire at which time all the available copies were destroyed in Secretary Powers’ office. I mention this so our members may rea-         198  lize the standing of our Society among, the horticulturists of the United States.  I respectfully submit the following as my report:  Donations received since the May,   1910, meeting.  E. S. Williams.$ 5.00  W. F. Inman. 25.00  S. C. Inman. 5.00  L. B. ^Skinner. 25.00  S. C.

Chilton, Dr. F. W. Inman,  S. C. Littlefield, N. L. Pierson,                     1 •     DR. FREDERICK WILLIAM INMAN                 Necrology   Mr . President, Ladies and Gentlemen :  During the past twelve months the hand of death has fallen more heavily on our Society than has been the case for many years.  In the order of their decease we have to report the loss of the following mem¬ bers :  Benjamin F. Chilton, of New Smyrna, Fla., died Aug. 16th, 1910, 62 years of age.  N. L. Pierson, of Pierson, Fla., died 1910, 61 years of age.  S. C. Littlefield, of Little River, Fla., died, Sept. 10, 1910, 76 years of age.  Creswell M. Barton, of Jacksonville, Fla., died Nov. 6th, 1910, 50 years of age.  Dr. F. W. Inman, of Florence Villa, Fla., died Nov. 6th, 1910, 70 years of age.  Dr. P. J. A. Berckmans, of Augusta, Ga., died Nov. 8th, 1910, 81 years of age.  Mrs. Abby Guild Carter, of Merritt, Fla., died Apr. 3, 1911, 63 years of age.  The following resolutions are feelingly submitted by your Committee on Nec¬ rology :  Whereas, Having been deprived by death of so efficient and valuable mem¬ bers as Dr. P. J. A. Berckmans and Dr. F. W. Inman, and a number of others   whose good work and influence have greatly added to the usefulness and effi¬ ciency of the Society in its labors, and Whereas , We owe it to their memory on behalf of their labors and interest that a just and fitting appreciation of their work be shown and due expression of our own loss be recorded, therefore, Resolved, That the death of Dr. P. J. A. Berckmans has taken from the Hon¬ orary Roll of this Society one of the most illustrious names known to our present day horticulture, whose loss must be felt for many years to come, not alone in his own and our states, but throughout the whole world, since his work has been internationally beneficial. That in the death of Dr. F. W. Inman the horticul¬ tural and social interests of the state have suffered irreparably, and a most efficient laborer is taken. That in the deaths of Benj. F. Chilton, N. L. Pierson, S. C. Littlefield, Creswell M. Barton and Mrs. Abby Guild Carter we feel the loss of interested and faithful members of the Society whose time and thought have been willingly contributed toward strengthening the influence of the So- icety and the advancement of its work.  Resolved, That our deepest sympa¬ thies be extended the families, relatives and personal friends of our deceased co¬ workers, and     204        Resolved , That these resolutions be put upon record in the transactions of the Florida State Horticultural Society, that memorial notices be given due entry in the Society’s Report and dedicated to the   memory of Dr. P. J. A. Berckmans, one of the country’s foremost horticulturists, and that space in this portion of the transactions be given to a likeness of Dr. F. W. Inman.   DR. PROSPER J. A. BERCKMANS.   For many years past the horticultural world has been most familiar with the name of Dr. P. J. A. Berckmans, of Augusta, Ga. His death Nov. 8th, last, was a very serious loss and is a national calamity, inasmuch as his labors along  horticultural lines for many years have been of the greatest importance to the country. His works were authoritative and his researches instructive. The ripe information resulting from his labors has done much toward bringing into national repute all lines of horticultural knowl¬ edge, and popularizing the subject. Quot* ing from the Augusta Chronicle of Nov* ember 9th, 1910:  “The death of one of Augusta’s dis¬ tinguished citizens, Dr. Prosper J. A. Berckmans, comes as a distinct shock, not only to this city but to the people of this and other states; for, although advanced in age, being 81 at the time of his death, Dr. Berckmans was, almost to a week ago, in such robust health and spirits as to give no warning of his early demise. In fact, almost up to the week of his death he came and went as usual and took the same active interest in his own affairs and affairs in general as ever; so much so, indeed, that when the news of   his serious illness was first published in last Monday’s Chronicle, the general hope and feeling was that, despite his years, his strong constitution would con¬ tribute to his rapid recovery. But to the great sorrow and everlasting loss of this city and section—which he loved so well, and to whose welfare and advancement he contributed so much—this was not to be, and on Tuesday night this splendid man breathed his last, falling as some great oak of the forest that had towered above his fellows for so long, leaving a void that the present generation will not live to see filled.  “It is only when death summons one of the truly distinguished, honored and be¬ loved members of a community that even his neighbors can realize the fullness of the loss; for, however much we may have recognized his deeds in life or ap¬ preciated the force of his character and scope of his influence, it is only when we come to understand that he has been for¬ ever taken from us, that we fully com¬ prehend his true value. And it is dealing in no superficial praise to say that this was never more true than in the death of Dr. Berckmans; for, look where we will there is no one to take his place amongst us.        FLORIDA ♦STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   205   “But, while this is true of Dr. Berck- mans held a peculiar place in the esteem and affection of Augusta people, and has long played an important part in the life of this city and section, it cannot be said that he belonged to us alone, or that the sorrow and loss caused by his death will be confined to this community; for not only was he a distinguished citizen of Augusta, but an honored and esteemed spirit of the world—a man whose name and works have received the highest re¬ cognition and distinction, and to whom, almost every day brought some fresh evi¬ dence, some new expression, to empha¬ size how widely and how well his works and character were appreciated.  “Dr. Berckmans was one of the fore¬ most horticulturists of his times and the highest recognition of his abilities and achievements have been offered him by the most noted horticultural societies of both continents. Wherever the science of horticulture and botany is known, the name of Dr. Prosper J. A. Berckmans is known. He was an honorary member of various scientific organizations stretching from Georgia and Carolina to England, France, Belgium and Germany.  “But in Augusta the admiration and affection in which Dr. Berckmans was held, has not all been for his intellectual achievements, nor for the pride his neigh¬ bors and fellow citizens have felt in his honored position in the world of science. His gentle courtesy, the perfect kindliness of his nature and his unfailing chivalry and genial personality have endeared him closely to those who were thrown with him and made for him such life¬ long and devoted friends as few men really know.   “Nor have any citizens of Augusta the distinction of having done more for the advancement and advertisement of their city than Dr. Berckmans. The magnif¬ icent nurseries, “Fruitlands,” which sprang into life and beauty and useful¬ ness under his care, have spread in fame all over this country, and the business which is carried on there is now an in¬ ternational one.  “Dr. Berckmans showed his belief in the wealth and future of this section when he first settled here in 1857.  “He was a pioneer in horticultural works and experiments in this part of the world and he has had an immeasur¬ able influence in developing and beautify¬ ing Augusta and its attractive country territory.  “Dr. Berckmans was the son of Dr. L. E. Berckmans, of Belgium, who, with Dr. Geneval, and the Conte de Merand, were leaders of the war of liberation of 1830, by which Belgium was severed from her constrained union with Holland.  “Dr. Berckmans was a native of Hol¬ land, coming to this country for the first time in 1848, and later in 1854, when he made New Jersey his home. He came to Augusta from Plainfields, N. J. in 1857, and has been living at his home, “Fruit- lands,” since that time. Mr. Berckmans was twice married. His first wife was Mary Craig, of New Jersey. His second wife, Mrs. Edith Frome Berckmans, sur¬ vives him. He also leaves three sons and a step-son: Mr. Robert C. Berckmans, Mr. L. A. Berckmans and Mr. P. J. A. Berckmans, Jr., and Mr. Alonzo F. Purdy.  “The Berckmans family dates back with honor for a thousand years in the   206        annals of Belgian genealogy and Dr. Prosper A. Berckmans, when he first came to America, brought with him the traditions and ideals of the best stock of the old world. He was educated at Tours and also in Belgium and Paris and even before completing his education had gained for himself some note as a stu¬ dent of botany. His interest in horti¬ cultural subjects was at first only that of an amateur, and it was not until he had   been in America for several years, first settling in Plainfield, New Jersey, in the year 1854, and then coming to North Georgia and finally to Augusta, in 1857, that he decided to make it his life ob¬ ject and work. He leaves Augusta the legacy of a well-spent, honorable and suc¬ cessful life and the example of a public- spirited, loyal and distinguished citizen. He leaves the world far better off for his having lived.”   DR. FREDERICK WILLIAM INMAN.   Dr. F. W. Inman was born at Park- man, Grange Co., Ohio, Oct. 19, 1840, and died at his home at Florence Villa, Fla., Nov. 6, 1910. His youth was spent on the farm and he secured his educa¬ tion at the district school and at West Farmington Academy. In i860 he mov¬ ed with his parents to Brooksville, Cuya¬ hoga Co., where he commenced the study of medicine. He attended medical col¬ lege at Cleveland, O., two winters and completed his professional studies at Ann Arbor, Mich., from which institution he received his diploma with high honors. Shortly before graduating exercises the President of Ann Arbor Medical School received urgent appeals from the U. S. War Department for medical student vol¬ unteers, and assured those who elected to respond to the call, that if their student averages were such as to justify, their di¬ plomas would be granted without final examination, and Dr. F. W. Inman was one of the five who responded. On his excellent record as student he was im¬ mediately commissioned at the age of   twenty-three as Assistant Surgeon of the 179th O. V. I., with rank of captain. He was at once sent to his regiment at Nash¬ ville, Tenn., where he found sick and wounded in deplorable plight for want of hospital quarters and attention. With characteristic energy he set about to in¬ crease the comfort of the men and soon won the lasting gratitude, of the sick and wounded under his charge. Returning from military service he married Miss Florence E. Jewett, on Jan. 1, 1867, who survives him. For a number of years fol¬ lowing he enjoyed a large medical prac¬ tice, associated with his father-in-law, the eminent Dr. Mendall Jewett, of Akron, Ohio. He then became interested in mer¬ cantile business, and later in milling, cul¬ minating in his connection with the Qua¬ ker Oats Company, in which he was largely interested at the time of his death.  In the winter of 1886 Dr. and Mrs. Inman came to Florida, chiefly on account of Mrs. Inman’s health and for a much needed rest for himself. Both received much benefit and were greatly delighted     FLORIDA »STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   207   with the state and climate. Here he rec¬ ognized the wonderful possibilities of Florida, and before the following winter he had made plans for a permanent home here. The situation, as he knew, called for pioneers of the right type, and how well both himself and his estimable wife were gratified is best told by results achieved. All along his active career he had encountered storms which only the bravest hearts could weather, but none was more severe than that which he met in the great freeze of 1894-5, when it seemed everything had been swept away. Undismayed, though with limited resour¬ ces, he set about to right his ship. Amid every phase of discouragement, as well as on the crest of the wave of prosperity, he was never known to turn a deaf ear to an appeal for assistance from a worthy source, or to shirk a responsibility.  Dr. Inman was the founder and Presi¬ dent of the Florida Citrus Exchange, and was the owner of the fine property of Florence Villa, including one of the fin¬ est orange groves in the state. He was a leader in promoting the citrus industry of Florida and was keenly alive to the wel¬ fare of its interests. His death has been   a severe blow to this Society and is deep¬ ly deplored by its members. He leaves a bereaved wife and brother to mourn him, and his personal friends offer their condolences to them in their bereavement. On Saturday evening preceding his death he seemed in excellent health, talking pleasantly with relatives, and retired about 11 130 o’clock. He awoke about 2 o’clock and found that the right side of his body was paralyzed. A physician was summoned at once, but by sunrise Dr. Inman had passed away.  One of the pathetic incidents surround¬ ing his death is that he had invited a num¬ ber of his personal friends to spend Sun¬ day with him, anticipating a most enjoy¬ able day. Near noon Sunday his Tampa friends arrived and were astounded to learn their host had already passed away. Mr. W. C. Temple, General Manager for the Florida Citrus Exchange arranged for a special train from Tampa to carry Dr. Inman’s many friends to Winter Haven to assist at the interment.  Dr. Inman has gone, and there is a va¬ cancy in our ranks. His life was ex¬ emplary, resourceful, fruitful, encourag¬ ing. Let us take heart and complete his work.   BENJAMIN F. CHILTON.   Benjamin F. Chilton was born at Hax- ham, near Exeter, Devonshire, England, May 18, 1848, and died at his home in New Smyrna, Florida, Tuesday, August 16, 1910. He came to America in 1873 and lived two years at Indianapolis, Ind., came to Florida in 1875 and the following   year located at New Smyrna, where he resided to the time of his death. He married Miss Mary E. Tucker, Feb. 3, 1880.  Mr. Chilton had been manager of the Ronnoc Grove Estate, owned by Mr. Washington E. Connor, of New \ork.     208        for quite a term of years, after having made a fine grove of his own in Turnbull Hammock, and which he brought into profitable bearing condition and sold shortly before the freezes of the winter of 1894-5.  For thirty-seven years Benj. F. Chil¬ ton served his adopted country and state nobly and well. He was a true man: true to his God, his country, his family, and true to his fellow men. He was a public spirited citizen, always active in fostering every good cause with which he was connected. As a citizen of New Smyrna he served on the Council for a number of years, was elected President of that body nearly every term and was fill¬ ing that position when called to his rest. He was a consistent member of the Con¬ gregational Church, a deacon and a trus¬ tee. Also he was a member of the New Smyrna Lodge of F. and A. M., of Do¬   lores Chaptei in Daytona, and was a member of the F. U. of A., holding the highest offices in all excepting the Chapter. For many years he was an act¬ ive and valued member of the Florida State Horticultural Society, ever ready to assist in its advancement in every way he could. At the time of his death he was one of the Vice Presidents of this Society. Mr. Chilton was a skilled hor¬ ticulturist and florist, and loved his work.  In his decease this Society looses one of its most loyal members; his adopted town of New Smyrna, one of its most respected and public spirited citizens, his family a loving husband and father, and the community a worthy man who will be sadly missed.  The deceased leaves a wife, five sons and two daughters to mourn his loss, and these have the deepest sympathy of all who knew him.   N. L. PIERSON.   Mr. N. L. Pierson was born in Swed¬ en November 14, 1841, and died at Pier¬ son, Florida, in 1910.  Mr. Pierson came to America in 1874, and in the following year to Florida, where after a short time he took a home¬ stead at Pierson, living there until his recent death. He was deeply interested in the general progress going on in the country and in his adopted state, and was particularly alive to the farming and hor- ticulturaal industries carried on about him, and in which he was always active and enjoyed his work. He was one of   those sturdy souls whose delight it is to see things moving forward continually, improving existing conditions, lightening the burdens of the race.  Mr. Pierson was twice married. His first wife died in 1885 ' m Sweden, while on a visit to that country. Six years later he married a second time, his second wife surviving him. He leaves no children. The sympathy of the Florida State Hor¬ ticultural Society is extended the widow of Mr. Pierson and the many friends who mourn his death.     FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.   209   S. C. LITTLEFIELD.   Mr. S. C. Littlefield was born in Snow- ville, N. H., in 1834, and died at Little River, Florida, Sept. 4, 1910.  When a youth of about fourteen years he came to Georgia. After a number of years he was married to Miss Emma Stanley. Mr. Littlefield was a veteran of the Confederacy, and in 1897 he mov¬ ed to Little River, Florida, where he soon became interested in the possibilities of the State and turned his attention to truck gardening. He was an enthusiastic hor¬ ticulturist in his line, and by his labors and example did much to add to the in¬   terest of the country in his portion of the state, and to increase its value. He has the honor of shipping the first car of cel¬ ery from Little River, and also was the first extensive grower of onions in that place.  Mr. Littlefield was a member of the Episcopal Church, and was an influential Mason of the Past Master’s degree. This Society is indebted to him for his loyal interest in its labors. He leaves a son and three daughters, to whom we extend this expression of our appreciation of their father’s work with us, and share with them their loss.   CRESWELL M. BARTON.   Creswell M. Barton, who died October 30th, 1910, in Jacksonville, Florida, was born in Ottawa, Canada, of English par¬ entage, fifty years ago. With his parents, he came to Florida in the year 1878, and resided in Jacksonville and vicinity con¬ tinuously up to the time of his death.  For many years after reaching man¬ hood he was engaged in the undertaker's business in Jacksonville. Upon retiring from this business he became the general salesman of E. Bean & Company, in whose behalf he exerted able and untir¬ ing efforts. For the last nine or ten years he was the salesman for the W. A. Mer- ryday Company, of Palatka, whom he served with characteristic fidelity. An able, genial, companionable, conscientious salesman, he was a favorite not only with   his hundreds of customers throughout the state, but also with the traveling men and his associates.  For many years Mr. Barton took a very active interest in the military affairs of Florida. He was a member of the Wil¬ son Battery from its organization up to the time that it was merged into the Flor¬ ida State Troops, and he gave his time and service during the yellow fever epi¬ demic in Jacksonville.  He was an active member of the Odd Fellows, Red Men, United Commercial Travelers, and of several other fraternal organizations in this state.  He was married in 1889 New York City, to Miss Helen Lockery, who sur¬ vives him. Cres. Barton (as he was      210        familiarly called by his friends) was a true, kind and devoted husband, and a loyal, obliging and conscientious friend.   His death is a distinct loss, not only to his many friends in Jacksonville, but throughout the state.   MRS. ABBY GUILD CARTER.   Mrs. Abby Guild Carter was born in Easton, Mass., in 1848, and died in Mer¬ ritt, Florida, April 3, 1911. She was ed¬ ucated at Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Mass. In 1867 s ^ e was married to Mr. David A. Carter, of Pittsburg, Pa. Short¬ ly after her marriage she and her husband became winter visitors to Florida for about a quarter of a century, when, about ten years ago, they built their home on Guildmead Grove, about midway be¬ tween Indianola and Merritt, and where for about five years they enjoyed this beautifully situated home together until Mr. Carter died.   Mrs. Carter was a most estimable lady and was loved and respected by all whose pleasure it was to enjoy her acquaintance. She was much interested in the horticul¬ ture of the State, and particularly so in the developments going on about her. These she watched with keen enjoyment and was pleaased to note the material growth of her adopted state, manifesting her appreciation through her connection with the Florida State Horticultural So¬ ciety, of which she was a respected mem¬ ber.  All of which is respectfully submitted.  G. L. Taber, Chairman.  W. S. Hart.@@
