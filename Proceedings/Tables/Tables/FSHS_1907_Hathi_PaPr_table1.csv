"Report of Committee on Grapes, Figs and Persimmons,.",P. J. Wister.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Appointed Chairman of the Committee on Grapes, Figs and Persimmons, I com- municated with the two other members of the committee, Mr. Bacon, of Ormond, and Mr. Steele, of Switzerland, for their co-operation with reports of the northern part of the state where my experience with these fruits has been none. The require- ments of these fruits and their culture have at a previous meeting of the Society been so well and ably discussed that it would be only a repetition of what others have already said to indulge on these points; and I have, therefore, limited my- self to a report relative to our experience with these fruits on the lower east coast. The southeast end of the peninsula has been settled, as you all well know, at a comparatively recent date, and as the set— tlers were attracted more by the culture of citrus fruits and pineapples, the grapes, ﬁgs and persimmons have been practically neglected altogether. As a side issue to citrus and pineapple culture, the majority of settlers seem to havie taken tropical fruits, such as mangoes. avocadoes. guavas, etc. Only in a few isolated instances have I found anyone planting the fruits under consideration. Very little systematic culture has been given these fruits, and the following notes have been made from very few plants and not large plantings. Of grapes, a number of Eastern vari- eties, as well as vinifera. or California grapes, have been tried. The experience of all who have tried growing grapes is that severe pruning is injurious, causing the vine to die back; and this is no more practiced by those who are acquainted with our local conditions. Most of the vines that I have noted of late are train- ed on a trellis, or overhead, allowing the vines to grow, pruning away only dead wood, which system is being practiced on a trial vineyard at the Subtropical Laboratory. Our experience has only conﬁrmed that of others, that the vines fruit well the ﬁrst two or three years, and after that begin to die back and set very little fruit. The vigor and adaptability of the different varieties vary greatly. The vinifera grape, which has been more un- der my observation than the eastern grapes, is very much subject to attacks from. blackrot and mildew. Only by fre- quent sprayings with Bordeaux mixture is it possible to obtain good fruit. Again, the berries mature very unevenly in the bunches. which tends to make the fruit less salable, and I consider it very doubt- ful whether we will ever ﬁnd a vinifera grape that will prove satisfactory. I have not noted any insects attacking the grape severely enough to lbe called a pest. Mr. Thomas Spence, Buena Vista, Florida, who has had more experience with grapes in the lower part of the state than any other person I know, writes me: “General- ly speaking, I am. as you know, through with trying vinifera grapes, as I think        the mildew and other fungoid troubles will not admit of growing them success- fully. Last year, as you know, was a very poor one for grapes, and there were none that could be said to succeed. The year previous there were some nice grapes on Black Hamburg, Brighton, Delaware, Duchess and one of Roger's Hybrids; but I don't consider that any of them have made the growth this season to warrant us in expecting any satisfactory results. They all seem to die back without ripen- ing their new wood properly, and they are very capricious as to starting new growth in the spring.” The scuppernong has not, to my knowl- edge, been tried. The “Key” grape has been much spoken of at previous meet— ings, but in addition to dying back, sim- ilarly to other grapes, and ripening its berries very unevenly on the bunches, it is very inferior in quality, and not to be recommended for planting. The Angu- lata (a California grape) and Delaware are (from limited experience) so far the most promising varieties. The ancestors to our cultivated grapes are indigenous to temperate climate, and their descend— ants have all been accustomed to a resting season in the winter. For plants of this character the winters in South Florida are hardly cool enough for plants adapted to a colder climate, and it appears as if the introduced vines did not quite know whether to grow or not, throwing out feeble growths now and then, and not ripening the wood properly. There are frequently found vigorous wild vines in the hammocks that bear fairly good-sized bunches of very palata- ble grapes. I have, during the past two seasons, noted three vines that look very promising and are apparently immune to the two diseases above mentioned. In the interest of every grape lover in the state I would ask that anyone who knows of such vines would try to get cuttings and try hybridizing these with either Cali- fornia or Eastern grapes. We might, in this way, ﬁnd a variety more wholly adapted to our climatic conditions than an introduced grape. I am particularly interested in the improvement of the grape by means of hybridization and crossing, and I would be glad to receive communi- cations from those acquainted with wild promising vines. In looking up the ﬁgs, I ﬁnd that in the upper end of the county (Dade) trees that had been planted eight or more years ago had made good growth the ﬁrst few years. but later died back, or are doing poorly. The cause has generally been ascribed to the presence of nematodes. While this may be the cause in some in- stances. I believe that improper treatment is the cause in others. In still others, that they are planted in an unsuitable location. In Miami there were young trees planted in 1903 that now stand 10— 12 feet high, with a spread of ten feet, that last year bore well and looked very promising. These trees have received good attention. The fact that these trees are doing so well, and that the ﬁg does well further up the state, seems to prove that the fault does not lie entirely with the nematodes, which are well distributed throughout the southern states where the ﬁg is well established and yearly gives good crops. Fig culture is with us very much in the experimental stage, and there is apparently considerable difference in the adaptability of the different varieties. The ﬁg will hardly attain commercial im- portance on the lower east coast in com—         petition with citrus and tropical fruits ; but there isnothing more delicious than a well ripened ﬁg or preserves made from it, and every family ought to have a few trees for home consumption. A year ago the Subtropical Laboratory received a consignment of capriﬁgs from California, through the Department of Agriculture, of which some varieties did very well last year, when the freeze of last winter killed nearly all to the ground. They have spro’uted very well, however, and are making rapid growth. The fruits of these ﬁgs are not edible, but the plants are necessary for the propagation of the Blastophaga, which again is necessary in the capriﬁcation of the Smyrna ﬁgs. Later on, when the capriﬁgs are well es- tablished, Smyrna ﬁgs will be tried and Blastophagas introduced from California where this insect is well distributed in the ﬁg region. The progress of this experi- ment will be watched with much interest. Persimmons can scarcely be said to have had a trial in the lower east coast. I have seen remains of trees that were planted several years ago, but I am satis- ﬁed that the failures in many instances lay with the cultivators. Trees that I know receive intelligent By w. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have very little to say on the subject of grapes, ﬁgs and Japanese persimmons. There was a time, years ago. when I was familiar with all the varieties of ﬁgs which are grown in Florida, and with most of the northern varieties of grapes. But for several years I was engaged in other v culture are now making good headway for their age (four years), and are this year bearing their ﬁrst crop. The native persimmon grows wild on river banks and moist land, and there is apparently no reason why the Japanese persimmon should not do well budded on this stock.  DISCUSSION. Mr. Gibbs—What is the color of the leaf of that wild grape to which you re- fer? Is it the wild scuppernong? Mr. Wister—It is very similar. Mr. Gibbs—Over on the Indian River peninsula where I live, nearly opposite Melbourne, there is an interesting grape slowly getting a foothold among the wild scuppernong. The foliage is much lighter in color, and the fruit nearly as large as the Concord, and is a dark red. It is very acid, but it is the best jelly grape we have tried. It is not a true bunch grape, but often shows clusters of three to ﬁve berries. It is sometimes found bearing heavily, but generally seems to be a shy bearer. I have heard it called the “Missim” grape, but have suspected it was an escape from some of the Munsons that were brought in by Dr. Hall, an early settler. C. Steele. business, which prevented me from keep- ing up my acquaintance with them. Du- ring the last three years, circumstances have enabled me to learn something of present conditions. But the subject has been so thoroughly and ably discussed by previous committees, that there is but lit- tle left to report. So far as I know, no        new varieties of any of these fruits have been introduced within the past year. Possibly it may be well to call attention to some facts in regard to grape culture in this state. There is no difﬁculty in making the vines grow, that is, the difﬁ- culties are only such as are to be met in the culture of any other fruit, and the vines of most varieties will ripen good crops. beautiful bunches of fruit of ex- cellent quality. and they will ripen at a time when no other grapes are to be found in the markets of northern cities. About twenty years ago, being at that time connected with the Florida Dispatch, I was in Orlando at the time when the ﬁrst crop of fruit began to ripen on the vineyard of the Niagara Grape Company. In company with several gentlemen of Orlando, I went by special invitation to visit the vineyard, to inspect the vines and sample the fruit. We found thrifty vines bearing a good crop, fully as large as the age of the vines would warrant. The bunches were large and the berries beautiful in appearance, and of as good quality as the Niagara ever produces. Yut within a few years the vineyard was abandoned. I never heard the full partic- ulars, but understand that it was owing to the fact that the cost of transportation was so great that no proﬁt was left for the growers. Another instance where the express companies put on a rate which was not what the trafﬁc would bear, but enough to kill it, as it did the early at- tempts at peach growing. A little later, a number of Niagara vineyards were set out near Moultrie in St. Johns county. Within a few years they also ceased to ship fruit to northern markets, probably for the same reason. That these vineyards have not been en- tirely abandoned, is shown by the fact that last year the St. Augustine papers contained advertisements of wine made from Niagara grown at Moultrie. Possibly you may wonder why straw- berries can be proﬁtably grown and ship- ped from Florida, when they must be sent in refrigerators, while grapes can go by ordinary express. The difference is that the strawberries reach the northern markets when there is a scarcity of fruit, while the grapes ripen in midsummer and must compete in the markets with rasp- berries, blackberries, cherries, etc.; con— sequently they will not sell for so high a price. Fig culture in Florida has never be— come a commercial success. The fruit is so soft, when ripe, that it cannot be shipped to a distant market. So far as I know, no effort has been made to in- troduce the Smyrna ﬁg, from which the dried ﬁgs of commerce are made. They are 'being successfully grown in Califor- nia, and I see no reason why their cul- tivation could not also be made proﬁtable in this state. The greatest drawback to proﬁtable ﬁg culture in Florida is the fact that the trees are very susceptible to the ravages of root- knot. As was shown in the address of Prof. E. A. Bessey before this society last year (see the annual report for last meet- ing), the only remedy for this trouble is to starve out the nematodes which cause it. Japanese persimmon trees grow thrifti- ly and bear large crops of fruit. Yet very few have succeeded in making the culti- vation proﬁtable. The chief reason for this is the fact that the fruit is yet so new in market that very few have ac— quired a taste for it: hence the demand        3; is small. But the same trouble exists that prevents grapes from being proﬁtable—- the transportation charges eat up all the proﬁts. DISCUSSION. Mr. Skinner—I would like to ask on what ground ﬁgs grow best in South Florida. Mr. W'ister.—On what we would call low pine lands. The trees that I men- tioned in my report have been grown _on low pine lands and cultivated the same as you would citrus trees. Mr. Skinner—I am fond of canned ﬁgs and would like to grow enough so that I could have a mess of ﬁgs 0c- casionally. I have never been success- ful with ﬁgs grown on pine land, and thought of starting in on hammock land, and wondered if I could do it suc- cessfully. Mr. Wister—I see no reason why the ﬁgs should not do well on ham- mock land. Mr. Gibbs—I have only grown ﬁgs I on a small scale, but in 1904 when I began planting, I found it stated in a nursery catalogue that the ﬁg would not stand cultivation in Florida, and should be planted by the side of ‘build— ings, or the ground under it be covered with planking or some equivalent; so I gave mine the protection of the fat coquina rocks. For one fast-growing White Adriatic, I disregarded Prof. Hume’s advice and laid a ﬂoor of an ever-widening circle of saw palmetto roots under it from stem to tips of outer branches, but it grows almost too fast for me. I have to keep carry- ing to it more big palmetto roots, and don’t know as I can ﬁnd enough to prevent the tree’s escape by rapid ex- tension of its root system. And as for the ﬁgs, they are the ﬁnest ﬁgs I ever saw. Mr. Hubbard—In relation to grapes, I have heard that in addition to the great expense of transportation, the chief drawback in Niagaras is that the grapes will not adhere to the bunch, but drop off in great numbers and spoil the appearance of the fruit before it reaches the northern market. This, of course. very much affects the sale. Prof. Rolfs—Mr. Winters, can’t you tell us something about those experi- ments you tried on the kaki? Mr. \Ninters—-American travellers returning from Japan have frequently told us about Japanese methods of fer- menting the persimmons. Almost without exception, these travelers have spoken in the most complimen- tary terms of the advantages to the fruit from this process. Brieﬂy stat- ing, the process as practiced in Japan is to secure used saki casks. Roughly speaking, the Japanese saki corres- ponds very well to what we know as beer in this country. The Japanese secure used saki kegs, remove the head, and then pace in it the persimmon fruit. Care is taken by the Japanese horticulturist to select the fruit that has turned red but still very ﬁrm. We are told that much of the success in fer- menting kaki in this way depends on the expertness of the person who does the fermenting. First, in the matter of selecting the fruit, when it is sufﬁ- ciently matured, and not over matur- ed; and second, in removing it from the casks at a time when it has fermented sufﬁciently. With a view of ﬁnding out something about this method, some experiments were taken up at        J the Experiment Station last year with persimmons in different stages of ripe- ness. As saki casks could not be ob- tained, glass jars were taken in place of these, and alcohol was substituted for the saki fumes. The fruit used in this experiment were of the Costata variety. All of the fruit were mature, but still hard and totally unﬁt for eating at that time. The lot was made up of three grades according to stage of maturity. First, a lot of slightly bruised fruit which had been gathered for a few days and would have been ripe naturally in about three days; second, a lot of fruit that had been stored for a few days with the ripest fruit gathered on the date of experiment, most of which would have ripened naturally in about ﬁve days: and third, a lot of the ﬁrm— est fruit, which was fresh from the tree that day and which would have ripen- C(i‘ naturally in about a week or ten days. Equal quantities were weighed and placed in ten lots. so as to have the fruit in each lot as nearly the same size and stage of maturity as possible. We then prepared ten 2 I-2 gallon jars in which to do the fermenting. Glass was chosen because this would enable us to make observations from time to time without opening the ves- sels: and also because it does not give off any gas or liquid as wood might even absorb liquid or gas. Eight of these jars were then prepared by plac- ing some absorbent cotton in the bot- tom, to which had been applied approx'. imately I oz. (25 cc—of 95 per cent. alcohol. A glass plate was placed over the cotton to keep the fruit from com- ing in contact with the alcohol and yet allow the gas of the alcohol to rise and ﬁll the jars. The jars were then ready for the fruit, which was carefully placed. Another set of glass plates large enough to cover the jars were then placed on, being made fast and air-tight by parafﬁn. Two aquaria, to be used as checks, were prepared without the use of alcohol. Each jar was numbered, the stage of maturity of the fruit in each being noted. These were allowed to stand away from the direct sunlight for nine days when one of the checks and a representative number of the others were examined. They were then examined every two days. In the two check lots, there was no external change to be noted in the fruit, except a gradual ripening which was shown in the darkening of the fruit. When one of these was examined, after standing nine days, the fruit was mellow and some of them even soft, but none of them were entirely free of the puckery taste. As the rip- ening continued, they became very soft before the astringent quality dis- appeared, and at this time the fruit had begun to mold. There was no striking internal change in color, ex— cept the natural darkening as the fruit became ripe. Among the fruit treated, the least mature fruit gave the best results. In the two aquaria containing the least mature specimen, the fruit remained very ﬁrm, was in excellent condition after sixteen days’ standing, and kept very much better than the riper fruit which was carried through the same process. \Vhen examined after the nine days, they were mellow through and through, and were free of the as- tringent ﬂavor. The sickening sweet        ﬂavor of the naturally ripened fruit was replaced by a pleasant sub-acid ﬂa- vor. It was in Ithe greenest or ﬁrmest lot that the least external change and the greatest internal change took place. After sixteen days’ standing in the closed jars, this lot was entirely ﬁrm and the ﬂesh was of a darker and richer color than those of the same stage not fermented. They were free from the puckery quality. It was a ﬂavor that one would not as readily become tired of as in the case of the naturally rip- ened fruit. From this experiment, it is shown beyond a doubt that the fruit is im- proved by this process. It also clearly shows that to obtain the best results fresh. ﬁrm fruit, free from bruises, should be used. The fermented fruit keeps much better in closed vessels than when exposed to the air. We would suggest, therefore, that the fer- mentation vessels be so constructed as to allow them to be closed after a portion of the fermented fruit has been removed. Mr. Gibbs—Had the fruit used in your experiments ripened to its natur- al color? Mr. Winters—No, sir. It was ﬁrm and totally unﬁt for eating. Mr. Gibbs—A good many of them get their full color before they are ﬁt for eating. Mr. Winters—This was not that va- riety. Mr. Rowe—What can I do to pre- vent my persimmons from losing nine- ty-ﬁve per cent. of their fruit after they are set? Mr. Hollingsworth—I have always found that non-cultivation is the best ,33 for the persimmons. I have lost all my fruit by cultivation. Mr. ——Do you fertilize? M'r. Hollingsworth—Where you ﬁnd persimmons'growing naturally, I think it is a mistake to fertilize. Persim- mons have oﬁ years, and some years they will produce heavily, while the very next year their yield will be very scanty. Mr. —-—What about mulching? Mr. Penny—Mulching is beneﬁcial. The persimmon feeds almost on top of the ground. The roOts spread out almost at the surface of the ground and where you use the mulch it gives them a chance to feed on the surface right where the roots are. It gives the nat- ural conditions of the hammocks and low places where they grow naturally. Mr. Rowe—Do you have any trouble from dropping under the mulch system of culture? Mr. Penny—When we have a heavy crop, we usually lose about nine-tenths of the crop and still have too much. I have seen our trees breaking to ‘pieces with the fruit on them, and at the same time they have lost nine-tenths of their bloom. I have shipped several thousand crates of persimmons, but we have cut the trees all down except a few on the outside of the grove. There is not enough money in them commer- cially in comparison with the citrus fruits such as oranges and grape fruit. There is also the same trouble with persimmons as that mentioned by Mr. Hubbard about grapes; they come in competition with northern fruits. and the transportation costs us too much for the prices realized by the fruit. We ﬁnd that the persimmon grows well with us, and I cannot think of another 3        3% crop in which we can do as well in the quantity of fruit produced. Mr. Bush—Do you cultivate these persinnnons before using 'the mulch, or after? Mr. Penny—Absolutely we do not cultivate. Sometimes, though, we work over the land with a mowing ma- chine to keep the weeds down. Mr. ————-\\’hat kind of land is best? Mr. Penny—Low, ﬁat woods that has been drained. Mr. — What distance apart? Mr. Penny—For persimmons, the trees grow well when set about 20 feet apart; 20 feet in the rows and 25 feet apart. They grow to be large trees 25 to 40 feet high if they are not dam— aged. Their wood is very brittle and a heavy wind will break it down, espe- cially where it is loaded with fruit. We ﬁnd another difﬁculty in persimmons. \/\'e could get a great deal more money for them if they could ripen on the trees. but the birds are very bad and will ruin a great deal of fruit. Then again. if there is a wet weather. the fruit begins to crack. and that ends the fruit for shipping purposes. Mr. What form of fertilizer do you consider the best? Mr. Penny—I should say any good orange tree fertilizer that you would use for hearing groves would be ex- cellent for persimmons. Mr. Painter—Usually the best fer- tilizer for persimmons is one contain- ing but little or no anmiionia. One of two per cent. of ammonia; eleven to twelve per cent. of potash and eight to nine per cent. available phosphoric ac- id. to be made from sulphate ammonia.  Low grade sulphate potash and high grade acid phosphate. Mr. What is the nature of your soil and sub-soil? Mr. Penny—Our soil is low, ﬁat woods. The land was originally well timbered. The soil is-rather dark and has a depth of three or four feet, I sup- pose. Occasionally we ﬁnd a little “hard pan” as we call it, but it seems to be in spots. Mr. Gibbs—Did you say you under- drained that land? . Mr. Penny—Not with under drains, but with open ditches. As I under- stand “under-drain,” it means pipes under the soil. We have to do that with our orange groves in places. Mr. Hollingsworth—In California, there is what is called the “muscat” grape and I would like to know if any- one in the State has made a success of raising it in Florida. It is the best grape I ever tasted. Prof. Rolfs—Lots of people have made a failure of it. But to come back to the persimmon question; it seems to me that it would facilitate our shipping and the sale of the persimmon very considerably if we can put into general practice the process described by Mr. Winters. It seems to me that the question of keeping this fruit for a practicable time is simply excluding the air. That is all this process amounts to. The alcohol or rather the fumes of alcohol, was used to ﬁll up the spaces in the jars that otherwise would have been occupied by the air. The persim- mons subjected to this process were better than when allowed to ripen nat- urally because of the absence of the too sickish taste that frequently accom- panies a dead ripe persimmon.",,
Report of Committee on Citrus Fruits.,"By G. M. Wakelin, Lane Park.","Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen? After conferring together the com- mittee decided that every. member should present an individual report on whatever of interest had come to his attention. There appeared to be no particular phase of the topic for discus- sion and besides it was doubtful wheth- er more than one member could be present. The past eight or nine months have tried the soul of the orange grower. The usual fall drought spread over the whole winter and then, merged with the expected spring drought, has given many sections of the state the driest time known for years. The wonderful vitality of the orange trees has brought them through and will enable them, when properly helped by judicious care and fertilizing, soon to repair the dam- age. The effects however will be only too evident in a shortage of the com- ing crop and, where groves have suf— fered very severely, will reduce their blooming next February. Well, the lesson is—irrigate. Pipe is high and advancing all the time but it is not nearly so expensive as buying fertilizer at $30 to $40 a ton to make' bloom and fruit only to have it all fall 05. The harrow is a wonderful irri- gator and mulching is also very helpful but both are limited and the grower ﬁnds he must add water to the soil or else stand by and see the bloom and fruit he worked so hard to get cover the ground. Especially is watering necessary in old groves where the trees are large and often too close together. Many of the trees of which I have charge are in this category and had they not been watered they surely would have died. I hope the commit- tee on irrigation has some new sugges— tions as to methods of irrigation. In addition to the long continued drought the poor orange groves had a freeze to contend with last December. It seemed as if Jack Frost had a partic- ular grievance against those who had tried to escape him by migrating from the old orange belt to the southern counties. ,But in the eastern half of Lake county where I am located there was slight damage done. The tem- perature with us did not fall below 27 degrees and fruit was uninjured. In many parts of the state however orang- es were badly frozen and alas! shipped to market as sound fruit. A suspicion was thus cast upon sound fruit even when under a guarantee, and buyers generally took advantage of the situa- tion to keep prices down to a frozen level. I am informed that up to a few days ago grape fruit that had been dam- aged by frost was still going into the Philadelphia market. Unless a grower has a particular trade to supply through some commission man it certainly will not pay him to consign fruit, however        sound it may be, after there has been a freeze in the state. We need to give more attention to hardy varieties. Trifoliata stock is not a success in light soils so its cold resist- ant qualities are not always available. But there is a variety of orange that is cold resistant and thrifty above the or- dinary. This is the Jaffa. Its heavy, thick, vigorous foliage protects its branches admirably, it bears, even while young, good crops of heavy, ﬁne flavor- ed fruit that is sweet early in the fall and will hang on until late in the spring. The Jaﬁ'a has not had the recognition of its value to which it is entitled. It is unfortunate that so many of the trees planted years ago are of no particular variety but just orange, like the man’s hound that was mostly “just dog.” Such trees not infrequently are charac- terized by second grade fruit and not much of that. In uniformity of quality of product California is away ahead of us despite the fact that a good Florida orange is without a peer, here or abroad. In California the growers are effectively organized, and the various citrus un- ions exercise a strict supervision over the fruit marketed. Fruit in any way inferior is not shipped. \Ve need to campaign toward this end and a higher sense of honor among shippers. There is too much green and frosted fruit shipped from Florida. The state is getting the name of shipping inferior oranges. Have any members had experience with what has been called tuberose blooming? Sometimes trees young or old will put on, on a few branches, close packed bloom enough to cover the whole tree if properly distributed. Such bloom always sheds off leaving the tree bare of oranges. It is a serious matter for trees to so expend their en- ergy to no purpose. What is the cause of this and what can we do to make a tree properly distribute its bloom? As a mere curiosity I am going to place on the table a freak orange of some good qualities. It was discovered among some tardiff tnees. While it has the navel feature it is quite seedy. But the skin is thin and silky and the flavor of the pulp really excellent. In form it is very ﬂat so that the secondary or- ange within extends well above the me- dian line. This report is well estab- lished as there are a number of trees which bear this kind and no other. If the seeds could be educated out of it we would have a new navel of superior quality. DISCUSSION. Mr. Penny—I would like to ask Mr. Wakelin more about that bloom he spoke of. \‘Ve had last year on our tangerine trees a good deal of bloom that appeared to be very short—the bloom buds. Is that the way yours were? Mr. Wakelin—No, I never knew tangerine trees to do that. The bloom has been distributed over them. Other trees would put on sometimes ﬁfty blooms all on the terminal shoots, but they would not amount to anything because they all fell off. For all the good such blooming does us, the tree might just as well be dead. The blooms this spring resembled bridal wreath more than an orange tree. There was an exceedingly heavy bloom. Mr. Thornton—I have noticed that the trees are full of bloom—almost like the bridal wreath as Mr. \Vakelin says. and this after the dry weath-        37 er we have had, too. I think it is the dry weather causes it. Mr. Hollingsworth—I wish to ask if this is the case this season more than usual. Mr. Wakelin—Our trees have al- ways done more or less of it, and I have not thought it was on account of the dry weather. We had a drought from the ﬁrst of February to the ﬁrst of April. Previous to their bloom they were not suffering for water. Mr. Hollingsworth—My experience on these lines has been simply and purely practical. I have corns on my hands like a small boy has on his heels because I have got right down and worked with my men. I think the same rules apply to the orange trees in Florida as to the peach and apple trees in Western Missouri, where I was rais- ed. I have found that any abnormal condition such as dry weather, or any- thing like that will produce an abnor- mal condition of the tree. If a limb is injured by rubbing or chaﬁng, it tries to reproduce itself and perhaps goes to the other extreme in _order to establish its equilibriumt we had an old apple tree back in Missouri that had never borne, and it had a spot on it that I thought made a pretty good target. and I shot at it, and after that, it bore. I think a tree tries to offset the injurious effects and many of them will bloom out fully and never show thatvit is in an abnormal condition. Mr. Wilson—I would like to ask if the same thing happened all over the State that happened in my grove this year. An insect appeared, we call it the “thrip” at Gainesville. I noticed it this year for the ﬁrst time. It is a tiny insect resembling the hen mite. It looks like what comes in the rose in the spring and makes them blight. I was so very anxious about the grove and bloom on account of the drought that I suppose I noticed the bloom more than usual, and I think it is the same- thing we call thrip, which de- stroyed the strawberry crop around Gainesville about ten years ago so that there have been absolutely none raised on account of it. , I would like to say while I am up that my grove is like the grove the gentleman spoke of; the trees were heavily loaded with bloom, but we had no rain and I devised a scheme to water them. I went down with four teams and stopped at Ocala and got whiskey barrels and put them on the wagons and applied three barrels of water to each tree while the trees were in bloom and thought I had solved the problem of making the fruit stick. Now, the oranges vary in size from one the size of the end of a lead pencil to nearly a full grown orange, and they have never stopped dropping from the time they started. At what period can you tell when the fruit that is on is going to stay on? When can you safe- ly estimate your crop? 'Mr. Taber—I think there is one thing we should have settled. Did he thoroughly wash out those whiskey barrels before he began to water the trees. Prof. Rolfs—And I think we ought to know whether he got them from Ocala or Gainesville. Mr. Neil—I would like to ask Mr. Wilson if it was after that that the thrip did any harm. Mr. Wilson—I think it was before. I think there would have been a good    many more 11' it had not been for the thrip, because they got into the bloom before they cracked open, and I expect in many cases they cracked the bloom. I noticed when the orange began to show itself, it was a very pale yellow, and I believe the thrip destroyed the life of the bloom. Mr. Neil—He asked when he might estimate his crop. I have had some experience in that line, and I would say that the best time to estimate your crop is the day before you go to sell. There are so many circumstances that may affect your crop at any time, that it is difﬁcult to say just when you can estimate with any degree of certainty. Now, about that dropping he speaks of. I have my very serious doubts whether a tree ever drops any more fruit than it ought to. \Ve used to have these annual droughts; it was exceptional to go through a season without one and we used to fret a great deal about them. I used to water a great deal. but never saw that I had any more fruit than my neighbors who did not water at all. I don’t believe that a tree ever throws off any more than it should. Mr. Longley—I have had a little ex- perience with thrip. Year before last, I had considerable thrip in my bloom. but I had a good crop notwithstanding. Last year I saw a lot of it, and sent for some thrip juice. I sprayed my trees in the bloom and it cut off about half my crop. The thrip punctures the lit- tle orange when the bloom opens and you will often notice that the bloom be- fore it opens is punctured as though you had stuck a needle through it. You will ﬁnd in one bloom a hundred of these little punctures. I believe we will have a pretty good crop of truit this year, however. Mr. W akelin—We notice our orang- es sometimes fall oﬁ after they are pretty well grown, and of a bright green color and glossy. They fall off and leave their stems on the tree. It looks as though something had gotten between the stem and the calyx and pried it off. You cannot see anything the matter with the orange, and the tree has not suftered for water, either. Mr. Penny—I would like to ask the gentleman if he had a good crop of fruit after these fell oﬁ. Mr. \Vakelin—No, I don't think Sn. They robbed the tree. I notice often times where these oranges fell off, they would be the only ones on the ends of twigs and should not have fall- en off, for they had no neighbors to crowd them. Mr. Hubbard—The thrip has always been present with us more or less since I began orange culture some twenty- ﬁve years ago. Most seasons it has very little effect on the fruit. The thrip seems to get at and feed on the honey that is secreted at the base of the orange. In some cases, the thrip may be a beneﬁt in mixing the pollen. I do not think it does much damage except to mar some specimens of fruit. They sometimes gnaw snaky. little tracks that run around on the peel.. As to the abnormal growth. I think it is caused by shock to the tree. The bloom and the foliage start from the same class of embryo and it depends on the condition of the tree at the time when that embryo is formed whether it will produce leaves or bloom. It depends largely on the climatic condi- tions. If the shock by cold is great,        39 it may go to an excess of bloom, and if a drought comes on, it may make more foliage than bloom. An exces- sive crop is usually caused by some shock, disease or starvation. Mr. Hume—I do not believe that anything done at the time of bloom has much effect. I am inclined to believe that shock is caused to the tree by cold, drought or some such climatic conditiOn. As far as Mr. Wilson’s plan of watering is concerned. I think he should have started watering long be- fore he did, and done it about twice a week. I think his labor was all wasted. I think to get a good crop of fruit to hold on the tree, you should begin back a long time previous to the time that the bloom comes on. Mr. Hollingsworth—I experimented on the watering question this year for the ﬁrst time. \Ve had a rain nine weeks ago that caused the bloom to come out in just a few days. Certain parts of my grove were in full bloom and then we had nine weeks drought. and the trees were going to cast their bloom. I took a coal oil barrel, and excavated around each tree in a circle some six or eight feet. We designated six tangerine trees that were heavy in bloom. I gave three barrels of wa- ter to them as rapidly as it would soak down and then ﬁlled the excavation up with dry dirt so as to hold the mois- ture. Those trees have set a very good crop of fruit. I have the nucleus of an old grove of about forty-ﬁve trees that are about forty-ﬁve years old. They have had foot rot. die back. etc. (let me remark in passing that a neighbor of mine said his grove was of no use until the foot rot got into it) but still bear- ing very heavily. I watered a few of these trees at the same time we ex- perimented with the younger stock and ﬁnd the same holds good in both cases. Through the middle of this grove is a ridge, and on the slope of this ridge I had put out about a hundred sweet seedlings some six years ago. This drought overtook these seedlings. They shed their leaves in the tops two- thirds of the way down and directly after the rain, within a week, they put on a bloom. We had watered the trees in the middle of the ﬁrst drought, and when the rain came. they were so vig- orous they reacted again. The second drought caused them to cast that bloom, and then about ten or ﬁfteen days ago they put out a right good bloom, which set the second time on the same limb. That is a freak I can- not explain. They have shed off their bloom and formed oranges about the size of peas and we believe they are go- ing to stick. Dr. Richardson—I have been |nuch interested in the discussion. and I am particularly interested in the talk of Mr. Hollingsworth. I am inclined to think from his talk that the thinking he has 'been doing has made corns on his brains as much as hard work has made them on his hands. An eminent physiologist, when ask- ed what time he would begin treatment of a child] to make it a healthy. well de- veloped human being said he would- go back one or two generations before the child was born. I think that applies to orange trees as well. It has been argued that the injury which the trees have received ' has been the the cause of excessive bloom. It has also been intimated that shooting into a tree or doing anything to bring        about an abnormal condition will cause bloom. I think our present difﬁculty can; be traced back to the cold of last December. I am of the opinion that it was this that produced the abnormal bloom, and is more to blame than the drought from which we are all suffer- ing. I think that this cold left the trees in an improvident condition, but that when they recover from the shock they received last winter, they will again at- tend to business. I don’t think there is anything to worry about. Mr. Neil—I presume this will not end the discussion or get off the sub- ject of irrigation. I am afraid that if it took as much as three barrels of water to a tree once a week and we had to apply that three months before the bloom and four months after, it would not be a practical proposition. I have always been opposed to irrigation be- cause I‘do not believe that orange trees throw off any more fruit than they ought to throw off. I think an orange tree knows how much fruit it can bear and bring to maturity, and if you force it to maintain and ripen more fruit than it is able to, it is an irrepara- ble injury to the tree. We are supposed to have two of the best groves in the eastern part of the coun- ty and I do not apply exceeding over one barrel of water, and that only once a week or ten days. Rain water is the best to use, lake water is the next and artesian water is the last. I have some trees pretty well loaded with fruit, but our watering them did not save their fruit, but kept the trees in ﬁne condi- tion. I did not begin to water until the bloom had appeared. We are in hopes of having the second bloom, and I think we will have two-thirds of a crop in the State this year. Mr. Skinner—I would like to know how much of a crop we have, from the orange growers’ standpoint and the sellers’ standpoint. We ought to be able to get at a pretty accurate idea of how much of a crop we will have. I would like to have the men from the different sections get up and say what percentage of a crop they think they will get. I have tried the kerosene barrel method—not the whiskey barrel—and have abandoned it. If. Mr. Neil will go back to the season of 1897-98, he will remember that the drought at that time, was fully as bad as the one we have just had. Around Sutherland and Dunedin whole regions of pine woods and oak woods died. I tried to save my crop with barrels, and worked hard. I poured water under my trees, and my neighbor _across the fence did not do anything, and when the time came to bear, his bloomed and mine didn’t. If you don’t water at the right time, don’t do it at all. My experience is that an irrigating plant nearly pays for itself every year you put it in. Mr. Stevens—I have tried a little watering, and I ﬁnd that it keeps the wilt off the leaves and keeps the trees in growing condition, but some of the fruit is on the trees, and some on the ground. I don’t think they have drop- ped more than is necessary for them to drop. Mr. Sampson—I want to speak about a particular kind of dropping. Even where the growth appears per- fectly vigorous and healthy, the fruit will drop off, but the stem and calyx will remain green and will draw nour-        41 ishment from the tree all through the season. It is not a natural drop, but something is the matter with the tree. No insect work as far as can be seen, but a sap disease apparently. Mr. Waite—In speaking of this dropping. Last year, I think we had as normal conditions as we ever had in Florida; a warm winter, plenty of rain, and one of the heaviest blooms I have ever seen. The trees were white, we had a good crop of fruit set, but about the ﬁrst of May we had for about ten days a cold wind from the east. The nights were very cold. Immedi- ately after, we found that our trees were shedding their fruit and the same conditions existed as mentioned by the gentleman. The stems were green and kept green during the entire season. I was speaking to one of the oldest growers in that section, and he stated that in 1898 the same conditions ex- isted. Our crops were heavily dam- aged by the fruit shedding after that cold east wind. I ﬁnd in some seclud- ed places in our groves (where they had protection) we had a good crop- of fruit, while where the wind had a good sweep the trees had only about one-third of a crop. Where we expect- ed 75,000 boxes we had only 25,000. Mr. Willis—I am not old in the or- ange industry; only about four years. We put in a twenty-horse power en- gine and ran pipes all over the grove. We irrigate about every ten days. The trees are in ﬁne condition and holding their crop very well. We began ir- rigating early in March, and our trees look as good as they would if condi- tions had been favorable, and growing all the time. Mr. Skinner—I would like to hear from Mr. Hume and Mr. Rolfs about that calyx dropping. I don‘t believe that the east wind does it. I am losing thousands of dollars right now. Prof. Rolfs—So far as I have worked upon it, I ﬁnd that there is an irritat- ing agent there that gets in between the orange and the calyx. Under cli- matic conditions, such as drought, cold, etc., it would shed off below the pedun- cle so that there would be no calyx left on the tree. My scientiﬁc work has been limited to the small fruit, not larger than a hazel-nut and at that time I could not get the fungi that caused the fruit to drop to infect the fruit. After . the fruit arrives at about the size of a hazel-nut, from this time until the fruit is colored, there seems to be a period of immunity. It is possible that this east wind or other cold wind has a de- pressing effect upon the plant and al- lows these fungi to infect and knock them off. Mr. Hart—I would like to air my views on these subjects, too. Accord- ing to my little experience, I think that the distance between the trees in a grove has a great deal to do in decid- ing whether it needs irrigation in a dry time, or not. My trees are mostly set twenty feet apart, some of them thirty. One of the groves has the trees set eighteen feet apart; that is on a piece of ground that has some oyster shells in it. At times, a few of these trees have the dieback, and I think for the past two years, to correct this, I have hardly put a cultivator in it. We had a dry spell as you all know covering six months, and it was not broken until lately. On that grove, some of the oranges got soft. so that they began to drop from the trees in        42 February, so I started to pick them. Perhaps I got two hundred boxes of soft fruit and I threw out what we could not ship and sold the rest at $2.00 a box. That, no doubt, was the result of the drought, and I am con- vinced that non-cultivation and close planting had a great deal to do with it. The trees are large ones, interlock- ing their limbs and roots so as to oc- cupy all available space. In my other groves, the trees have come through in ﬁne shape; they show little curling of their leaves and have a good setting of fruit today. If there is a drought on, I would cultivate often and keep the surface very ﬁne where this does not interfere with treatment of dis- eased conditions. You know it has been said that two cultivations are equal to a rain. The planting of trees according to the new horticultural method, which I suppose you all understand as the Stringfellow method, is also a matter I would like to speak about. Quite a number of years ago, our former presi- dent, Mr. Adams, and myself met Prof. Budd, who was one of Mr. Stringfel- low’s ﬁrst converts, at an American Pomological Society Convention in Washington. and we went over the ground thoroughly. Soon after, we plan-ted according to this new method experimentally. On uncultivated ground. it is claimed to work ﬁner than where the ground has been thorough- ly cultivated beforehand. The roots put down and go deep and do not suf- fer from drought; the fruit is ﬁnely and highly colored. and will stand ship- ping better. according to the claims of its advocates. I planted some of them by the Stringfellow method and some of them by the old method in alter— nate rows, and during this drought those trees planted by the Stringfellow method have come through and show but very little harm from the drought, while the alternate trees set by the old method have suffered some. I think the conditions have been exactly the same except the difference in the meth- od of planting. Those trees have been planted at least eight years. long enough to have them show deﬁnite re- sults. Mr. What is the size of the tree? How do they compare? He (Mr. Stringfellow) claims a larger growth. Mr. Hart—It is rather in favor of the “new horticulture” style of setting trees. I went over them just a short time before coming here to note that particularly, and it is in favor of those set out by the Stringfellow method, though not very marked. The ground in both styles of planting was thor- oughly cultivated. Mr. Longley—I set out a grove that way some twenty years ago. I did not know that it was anybody's method in particular. I had not found out that the roots went down straight, but that may be the cause my grove did not suf- fer. I know of a neighbor who was setting out some lemon trees some seventeen years ago and he tried the experiment. He set one of them ac- cording to my suggestion. For the ﬁrst year. the tree that had the roots spread out made the best growth. but the next year the other one came up with it. and the two are very much alike. I do not know that the roots have anything to do with it. Mr. Kerr—I was about to ask to have        43 the roll called of those present; so that we might comply with Mr. Skinner’s sug- gestion as to how much of a crop of oranges we can expect this year. Mr. Rolfs—Suppose you conduct this, Mr. Skinner, as you were the one who suggested same. Mr. Hollingsworth (DeSoto)—-For the last two or three years I have been trying to estimate the orange crop, and have missed it so far, and I have said I would never make another prediction. -I think, however. that DeSoto county will not have as much as last year. The im- mediate neighbot‘hood of Arcadia will grow nearer to last year’s crop. Our county had between 700,000 and 800,000 boxes. The county has shipped since 1898 about 25 or 30 per cent. of the state’s entire crop. I think, however, this year DeSoto will not have more than half a million boxes, if that much. We hope the condition for the remainder of the season will improve very much, but even in that case we will not have much more than half a crop. I don't think our grapefruit bloom was up to the average. \Ve see now occasion- al b100m. The bloom is scattered over a long period. My estimate would be that if the conditions until the time of gather- ing are favorable, there will be 450,000 boxes. Dr. Phillips—I am not a member of this association, but for the last two years have made a specialty of oranges. There has alwaYs ‘been a haphazard way to esti- mate the orange crop. Nine farmers out of ten will decide what they are going to have, and their expectations are always colored by their desires, and they will say. “Oh, yes sir; we are going to have a magniﬁcent crop."" I know there is a long—felt want in this state for deﬁnite statistics. I know it is of interest to me, and I think to everyone else in the state that is engaged in the orange industry. Mr. \Vaits (Manatee county)——We will have about 10,000 boxes. If it had not been for the freeze we expected about 60,000 or 70,000 boxes. I have not been over the whole county. Outside of our own groves the trees seem to be setting a very good crop. From what I can hear, there will be one-half or two-thirds of a crop. The grapefruit crop is shy. Mr. Brown (Manatee county)—I can not speak for the county. but in our own groves we will not 'have ten per cent. of a crop: less than ten per cent. due to the freeze and the drought. Mr. Hampton—I have been traveling around in a good many different sections of the state, and I don't believe there will be on an average twenty-ﬁve per cent. of a crop. That is a very conservative estimate. for in many places there will not be ten per cent. .\'Ir.—-—(Polk county)—I think there will be about ten per cent. of a crop. I don't think I have seen a grove that has even ten per cent. Only one or two groves have a crop worth mentioning. Mr.—Our grove “has been very late and the fruit is so small it is hard to make an estimate. I would say that the crop at the end of our grove will amount to half a crop; in other words. about 12,000 boxes. , Mr. (Hillsboro county)—-I don’t think our crop will be a heavy one. and I doubt if the grapefruit will come to half a crop. I do not know whether the east- ern part will have much of a crop or not. I have heard that it would be Short. Mr. Hoard (Orange county)—I thin         individually we will have twice the crop we had last year, and I think it is due entirely to our irrigation. Our irrigation plant has more than paid for itself this year. Mr.\Vakelin (Lake county)—Down in Lake county the trees bloomed in the reg- ular time. They continue blooming un- til about now. The younger trees bloom- ed at the regular time, and they have done pretty well. There was about two-thirds of a bloom until the latter end of March. Mr. (Orange county)-—S o m e trees bloomed pretty well early in the season, but most of it fell. After the rains, many bloomed again, and now a part of the trees are white with bloom. I think in our neighborhood the orange crop will not be more than a third of a crop. Mr. (M a r i o n county)—Not over one-fourth of a crop, or less. Mr. Hart (Volusia county)—-I will say that on the east coast where protected there is a reasonably good crop, and more have protected their groves this winter than ever before; but I think that on the west side of Volusia county in groves not protected, there is a short crop. Mr. Kerr (Volusia county)—In the northern part of Volusia county the groves are showing up well, the treees are looking ﬁne, and we will probably have half a crop. I attribute this greatly to the excellent location of the county, etc. Mr. (Lee c0unty)—I do not think there will be more than half a crop. Prof. Rolfs (Dade county)-—I know it is shy in Dade. Member—How much was the entire crop in the state last year? Mr. Skinner—It we 5 around 4,000,000.    somewhere Mr. Tilton—How do you regard the June bloom fruit? We have a little of it in our grove. Mr. Hubbard—The scattering June bloom is usually thick skinned and dry and pulpy and of poor shipping quality. Mr. Hart—If you have nothing else on the tree it is pretty fair. If mixed up with the regular season fruit, it is poor. It is always thicker skinned. I had much rather it would stay off than come on, although when there is no other fruit on the tree it does very well. Dr. Phillips—I want to bring up the question again of getting up reliable esti- mates. I have heard variohs estimates gotten out by parties in the month of May, and perham they will get out an- other the next month that is entirely dif- ferent. and when the crop is gathered, it is‘entirely different from either estimate. I think this society should adopt a method to get the correct statistics, say, in the month of July, when experienced orange men can estimate a crop with a degree of accuracy. Then, I think, each county should be represented, this society ap- pointing a person or persons to go out and send in an estimate to headquarters. Then let the society force the railroad companies to prepare to handle the crop which we will give them. If we have a big crop, the transportation should be prepar- ed beforehand to take care of it. Suppose it is necessary to pay a man for his ser- vices; it will be worth much more to the orange grower to have information he can rely upon. If it is rumored that we have a larger crop than we really have, it has a depressing inﬂuence upon the price and we lose a great deal more money than these statistics will cost us. Mr. Hart—I would say that this could        45 easily be done if we had an appropriation from the state, or some income more than we have at present; but we have had to economize in every direction. Mr. Longley—As far as my experience is concerned, I believe that all of the or- ange growers here and elsewhere would be willing to pay a bonus for just such information. The information is sent out all over the country that we will have an enormous crop of fruit by parties bent on depressing the price of our fruit. I have no doubt but that every orange grower has lost hundreds of dollars every year. If we assess every member ﬁve dollars it would pay big to get just that information. Mr. McLane-—This is a very important question, and I move that the president appoint a committee of ﬁve gentlemen whose duty it shall be to formulate a plan to present to this body tomorrow by which statistics can be secured. I think that everybody will agree that it is a matter of vital importance; not only the men who produce the fruit, but the men who buy it should have some intelligent idea. we know that every other crop produced in the United States is estimat— ed. I make that motion and hope some- body will second it. Motion seconded. Mr. Painter—While on this subject I wish to state that I undertook last year to get up information just like what you are talking about now. I sent out over 12,000 letters, addressed to growers all over the state, asking them for the very information that you are seeking for. How many replies do you think I got out of that 12,000? Just 1,200. The trouble is to get the information from the grower. They seem to be afraid to give the in- formation out, and seem to want to make you think they have a big crop, whether they have or not. Mr. Phillips—I can readily appreciate that very few people will answer ques- tions like those, and realize how very hard it is to get this information. My sug- gestion is to get conservative business men, pay them for their time and let them go over the counties and get this informa- tion from an unprejudiced standpoint. Not one man in a hundred would refuse to let him estimate his crop. Not to have this estimate costs the state of Florida hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. .McLain—The motion is already before the meeting that a committee of ﬁve be appointed to formulate and pre- sent to this body a plan whereby this in- formation can be secured. I call for the question. Motion put and carried. Mr. Cribb—There is a doubt in my mind if this information would be worth anything to us. I never saw an orange grower who could estimate his crop with- in ten or ﬁfteen per cent. Prof. Rolfs—The following committee is appointed: P. Phillips, A. H. Brown and Wm. C. Richardson.  WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. Prof. Rolfs—The matter of citrus dis- eases being up for discussion, I wish to make a few remarks in connection with this subject. The most serious disease and the most peculiar one that we have had anything to do with recently is the one which causes withertip in citrus. The causative agent here is colletorichum gloeosporiodes. This species of fungus is probably the same as the one that oc- curs on the mango and the avocado; a        fact which is of considerable interest to us. especially since the avocado and man- go occur in the same region, and often in the same orchards, with the citrus. Mr. Neeld will remember that in 1893 the mango bloom blight occurred pretty severely on the sub-peninsula. Up to that time the trees had fruited heavily. In 1894 the bloom blight was so bad that only a small crop matured, and investi- gations were started at once with a view of establishing what caused the diseases. Some information was gotten as to the identity of the fungus, but in the winter of 1894-95 the trees froze to the ground, leaving us without an opportunity of carrying on the work already started. Since 1901 investigations on the same disease were begun in the mango or- chards of Miami. The mango bloom, when attacked by this fungus, soon turns black and falls off. During the period of bloom, various species of insects visit the mango blossoms for pollen and for honey. These crawl about over the blooms, passing from dis- eased blooms to healthy ones. As the insects pass over the diseased bloom, they come in contact with the spores of the fungus. These adhere to their body or to their appendages, and the spores are then carried to the healthy bloom. In addition to the insects, the winds also help in disseminating the fungus spores. It therefore seems almost impossible for a single bloom to pass through this trying ordeal without becoming infected. As a rule. a small quantity of fruit sets in spite of all these adverse conditions. As soon as the calyx and corolla have fallen away from the flower, the young fruit is not in immediate danger of being infected. The recently set fruit stands in a perpen- dicular position, consequently the danger of fungus spores coming in contact with it is greatly reduced. When, however, the fruit has reached about the size of a pecan nut. the weight becomes too heavy and the fruit causes the peduncle to turn over and bend downward. This gives the fungus a chance again to attack it, since the spores from other portions of the tree may be carried, by moisture, down on to the fruit and infected. - On some trees, where the fungus did not affect the bloom, or those which are not affected by bloom blight, the disease gets started sometimes on the young fruit. In such cases the young fruit falls from the trees. literally by thousands. While the fruit is quite small it tums entirely black be- fore falling off. As it advances in size to that of a hen's egg, this blackening becomes less apparent. After the fruit has arrived at about the size of a hen’s egg the epidermis becomes too hard for ready infection. The fungus spores, however, are washed from the epidermis just as before. The fungus, however, in place of causing infection, merely causes irregular streaks over the fruit. or what might be called tear streaks. TREATMENT—AS soon as bloom blight makes its appearance on the mango, it is necessary to begin a vigorous campaign of spraying. using the ordinary form of Bordeaux, going against all recommen- dations heretofore in regard to its appli- cation. Direct the spray here against the bloom and right into the open blossom. Spray every third day, and continue this until a crop of fruit is set that is vastly heavier than the tree can bear. As soon as a very heavy crop of fruit is set, spray- ing may be discontinued until a large pro- portion of the fruit has become large        47 enough to bend the peduncles over, and the fruit hanging in a pendant condition. Then spraying should be again resorted to. An application of once in two or three weeks will be sufﬁcient at this time.“ After the fruit has arrived at the size of a hen’s egg no further spraying need be done. \VITH ERTIP OF CITRUS. For the last six or seven years, work has been carried forward actively on the study of withertip of the citrus. As said before, this disease and the mango blight are caused probably by what is the same species, Collctotrichmn gloeosporioidcs. Similar to the bloom blight of the mango we have a bloom blight of the citrus, in- cluding grapefruit and lemons. Citrus bloom, when attacked by this fungus, sheds 05 in great quantities, leaving scarcely any fruit set. As soon as the grove owner discovers a condition of this kind. he should give careful attention to the blooms. If withertip fungus is pres- ent in this stage of the citrus bloom, a considerable number of the petals in place of being pure white, as they should be, or withering a brown. will have turned a brownish red. By means of the hand lens. one will be able to learn to distin- guish fungus infested petals from petals that are merely dropping and withering. TREATMENT.——Here again, as in the case of the bloom blight of the mango, our recommendations are contrary to the usual practice of. spraying, in that we advise spraying directly into the bloom, using Bordeaux mixture of the ordinary strength. “While this operation will de- stroy a quantity of the bloom. it will be comparatively insigniﬁcant when compar- ed with the amount that it saves. As new blooms open constantly, the spraying should be repeated at short intervals, prob- ably not more than three or four days apart. This, of course, will depend upon the severity of the disease in the grove, and the possibility of doing the work with the spraying machine. After the bloom has shed and a con- siderable quantity of the fruit has set, there is still considerable danger from withertip fungus. If a large quantity of young fruit is shed off free from the calyx, one should regard it as a very sus- picious condition and make careful examination for the withertip fungus. If the fungus occurs, the young fruit should be sprayed as promptly and thoroughly. as possible. From the time the fruit is set until it reaches about the size of a large hazel-nut it is very apt to be attack- ed by this fungus. After the fruit has reached the size of a large hazel nut there appears to be little danger of its being attacked by this fungus. From this time until the fruit reaches the coloring stage, it seems to enjoy comparative immunity. During this period, when the fruit ap- pears to enjoy immunity from fungus at- tack, the tree itself seems to be vulnerable to its injuries. For controlling the disease in the tree We would not advise spraying, but would advise pruning. Prune out all dead and diseased wood, and do it as thoroughly as your time and pocketbook will permit. This pruning out should be done preferably before the middle of July in the summer time, and before the middle of February in the winter time. In the fall of the year, after the fruit has begun to color, it is again vulnerable to the attack of this fungus. The mark- ing on the fruit, whether it is grapefruit or oranges, is rather characteristic in that it makes a large brown sunken area, be- ginning usually with small size spots and        increasing in size. In groves where one notices considerable dropping of fruit, this disease should be suspected at once and a careful examination made for it. If the fruit is dropping from this cause, spray wtih an ammonical solution copper carbonate (ammonical copper carbonate). In using this fungicide, the spray should be directed toward the fruit as much as possible, keeping it away from the leaves and branches of the tree. We know from experience that an application of fungi- cide is pretty certain to be followed by an attack of scale insects, since the fungi- cide kills off the fungus which attacks the scale insects, as well as the fungi which attacks the fruit. Mr. Gibbs—Did I understand you to say that you threw a good, strong spray upwards right into the bloom? Prof. Rolfs—Yes, we did. But the rains and dew carry the spores downward, and by spraying downward the fungicides follow the paths of the rain and dew drops. Mr. Skinner—I want to ask a question, too. We are all interested in the buying of nursery stock. We don’t want to get any more insects than we can possibly help, and I want to bring up a point that has been in my mind for some time. When the state inspector signs a certiﬁcate, say- ing that there is no white ﬂy or other insects in a nursery, I think we ought to be able to place dependence on that certiﬁ- cate I understand that last year some nurseries got certiﬁcates saying that they were free from white ﬂies when I knew positively that they did have white ﬂies, and I think we should insist that if certiﬁ- cates are given they should be honestly given. If the nursery that has white ﬂy will clean their trees and promise to do the best they can to get them out, they should have a certiﬁcate to that effect, but they should not have a certiﬁcate say- ing that they are free from white ﬂies. I think the experiment station, or who- ever gives the certiﬁcates, should give them honestly. I would like to make a motion that this society, as a body and as a society, shall request whoever is in authority to give these certiﬁcates that they give them strictly in accordance with the law, and not give certiﬁcates that are no good. Dr. Berger—I wish to say that these certiﬁcates were given to the best of my knowledge, honestly and honorably. If there were any white ﬂies I certainly did not know it. I know that so far as I am concerned I did not give a single certi- ﬁcate where I had any doubt that the cer- tiﬁcates would not be telling the truth. Mr. Skinner—How do your certiﬁcates read? Do they all read one way? Dr. Berger—Yes, sir. Mr. Skinner—That this nursery is free from white ﬂy? Dr. Berger—Yes, sir. Mr. Skinner—I will not mention any names, but I know of certiﬁcates being given when it was a patent fact known to everybody that the certiﬁcates were given when they did have white ﬂies. I think the growers should have some protection. Mr. Bell—I move that a committee be appointed by the president to examine in- to this matter and report at some future meeting the course they think this society should take in relation to it. Prof. Rolfs—In regard to the matter of giving these certiﬁcates that are given to the nurseries in Florida. The other states in the Union require that stock shall be certiﬁed before it can be shipped. The        49 state of Florida makes no provision for the inspection of nurseries; consequently our nurserymen are placed in the position of not \being able to ship their nursery stock into another state. Is Mr. Skinner going to sit down on the nurserymen and say they cannot ship their stock out on account of having no inspection? The other states, as a kind of waiver on the delinquency of this state, have said, “We will allow the stock to come into our state upon the certiﬁcate of the entomologist of the experiment station.” Dr. Berger, or one of his assistants, has made the inspection, has granted certiﬁcates, and if there were any white ﬂies in there, they did not know it. You could do more about it if you had a state entomologist. Mr. Skinner—Well, I know there are certain nurseries in this state that have the white ﬂy, but still have a certiﬁcate saying they have not got the white ﬂy. I think a certiﬁcate ought not to be given saying that it is free from white ﬂy when it really has them. Prof. Rolfs—The state has made no appropriation for a State Entomologist. Dr. Richardson—There is a motion be- fore the house, which, I think, covers the ground fully. I do not think that Mr. Skinner meant to insinuate that there is anything maliciously wrong; at the same time it is possible that there is an in- spection that does not inspect, and if this is so, a very great wrong is being done. We do not want to send the white ﬂy out of our state as the white cotton cushion scale was sent in. We have no means of inspecting except in the method that has been put before you, because there is no provision for it. Now, suppose a proper committee be appointed to look in- to it and settle this matter at this point without any further discussion. Quesion called; motion put and carried. Mr. Bell—I move that the ﬁrst vice- president be empowered to appoint this committee. Motion seconded and carried. Dr. Berger—I would like to have the ﬂoor for a few minutes. I would like to ask Mr. Skinner if he ever saw any nursery stock sent out from a nursery with my certiﬁcate, when it had white ﬂy? Mr. Skinner—No, sir. Dr. Berger—I wish to state that all certiﬁcates were given in good faith to cover shipments out of Florida, as there is no law in the state of Florida compel- ling any inspection of stock not going out of the state. Inspection is made for other states, and whatever the state of Florida gets out of it, it gets under the inspection laws of those states. Mr. Belle—It has been the practice of some nurserymen to defoliate everything, and I think we should require that. In shipping stuff through the states some- thing may get on it. Some nurserymen make it a practice to defoliate everything; others do not defoliate at all. Member—A short time ago, trees were sent out of a certain part of the state to another place, and it was understood that there were white ﬂies in that section, and when they came they were defoliated; but when trees came from another part of the state where there was no white ﬂy, the foliage was on. Mr. Taber—The ﬁrst vice-president has announced that the following com- mittee is appointed to report on the ques- tion of certiﬁcates of inspection: W. C.      _   Richardson, chairman: H. B. Stevens and 1. D. Bell. Prof. Rolfs—\Ve have with us the State Entonmlogist from Georgia, Prof. Smith. \Ve would be glad if he will give us a short talk. Mr. Taber———Can’t you tell us about the operation of your law, etc.? Prof. Smith—I am glad to tell you about the inspection law in Georgia. In the ﬁrst place, we have there a State Board of Entomology, supported by the state appropriation. and their work is laid down in the law which created the de- partment. Onebranch of the work is the inspection of the nurseries in the state. The State Entomologist, or duly author- ized assistant, is required to visit every nursery in the state each year and make a careful inspection of the nursery and surrounding conditions. and if the nurs- ery is found apparently free from the San Jose scale and other insects and diseases, the nurseryman is given a certiﬁcate un- der which he can ship stock to any part of the state. and that certiﬁcate is usually accepted by any entomologist in any other state where they require a certiﬁcate. I have been in Georgia only four years, but know somewhat about the working of inspection in other states. and I think that perhaps we make a more thorough inspection than the majority of the states. I want you to notice this point, that the law requires us to inspect the nurs- eries. and if we can do so consistently, we give a certiﬁcate saying that the stock is apparently free from San Jose scale. There is no entomologist in the world who can say that a plant is absolutely free from San Jose scale. You cannot say that a nursery is absolutely free; but after it has been carefully inspected by a com- petent inspector who has had considera~ ble experience, he can tell you pretty well whether it is infected or not, and if he ﬁnds no sign of that pest, we feel safe in giving the certiﬁcate. Mr. Skinner—You spoke of the San Jose scale. It seems to me a couple of years ago a lady-bird was imported from China. What has become of them? Prof. Smith—Most of them have died out. Of all the colonies started in sev- eral states the one in Marshallville, Ga., was the most successful. In the summer of 1903 we found that they were destroy- ing some of the scale, but not enough to make any appreciable decrease. Next spring it was impossible to ﬁnd many there, probably on account of the spray- ing that had been given the previous win- ter. In the summer of 1905 I sent one of my assistants to every place in Georgia where a colony had been established, and also sent him to DeLand, Florida, where we had sent some of those lady—birds, and he found almost none whatever. The general concensus of opinion is that the lady—bird will probably never become ac- climated in the United States. I might state further. with regard to the nursery inspection, that there is a need. I think, in Georgia and other states of some change in the nursery inspection laws. It is getting to the point where it is almost impossible for all the nurs— eries in the state to be free from the San Jose scale, and I feel that the time is com- ing when the scale will get in such a great number of the nurseries that it will be necessary to issue a different kind of a certiﬁcate than what we have been issu- ing. If the nurserymen are prevented from selling their stock by reason of ﬁnd- ing a little of the scale in a small block,        ' 51 perhaps only in a little corner, of the nurs- ery. it will be an unjust law. Mr. Griﬁ‘ing—I understand there is a movement among the entomologists to get a uniform law about inspection. Prof. Smith—Yes, sir; the entomolo— gists of the United States at their last meeting advocated that, and the nursery- men have also taken it up and tried to get them to work together. They should work together, with the idea of getting some uniformity in the laws, or some one law that Would be adopted by all the states. i Prof. Rolfs—Tell us how much is ap- propriated annually by the legislature for this entomological commission in Geor- gia. Prof. Smith—$10,000. Of course, on- ly a portion of that has to be used for nursery inspection. If we did nothing but keep with the nurseries. we would not need that much. Our work covers a larger ﬁeld now. _ Mr. \Naite—I would like to ask Mr. Rolfs in regard to this scab or scaly bark that I have noticed in a few groves in this section; that is, on the Gulf Coast, some time ago. I presume Prof. Rolfs can give you a better description of it than I can. Prof. Rolfs—Last year. immediately upon the experiment station being sep- arated from the university, Mr. Fawcett took charge of that work on the scaly bark and has been working upon it since that time. Mr. Fawcett—I was in hopes that the subject of scaly bark would not come up, but I will try to tell you all I can about it. This disease became known to the experiment station only about two years ago. when a specimen was ﬁrst sent in to us from this vicinity for‘our examination. In investigating the distribution of this disease I found it was conﬁned to a limit- ed area including this peninsula from just above St. Petersburg to a few miles above Tarpon Springs. The ﬁrst infection covers only a small spot, and this enlarges until ﬁnally the whole limb becomes scaly and scabby and reminds one of the progress of leprosy. Almost nothing is known of a remedy for scaly bark, but we are beginning some investigations with a view toward pre- venting the spread of this disease. Mr. Longley—Does it appear only on the orange tree, or does it also attack other citrus fruits? Mr. F awcett—It is conﬁned almost en- tirely to the sweet seedlings variety. Grapefruit seems to be free. we have begun experiments with the Bordeaux mixture. Mr. Skinner—I think it was from my grove that the specimen you s ak of came. I have experimented a little with this disease myself and inoculated the trees and the roots with a little bit of sulphite of copper with beneﬁcial results. The scaly bark is almost identical, I think, with the “brown spot"" that occurs through this section and makes the fruit rot. (The specimen referred to was sent in by the Secretary and taken from Mr. Skinner’s grove.) Mr. Fawcett—I might say that along in the fall about August, the fruit becomes I covered with these spots, and there is every indication that the fruit has be- come infected from these scabs. The disease is a serious one and needs to be looked into. Mr. Waite—I would also like to ask if, in treating the disease called “Mela-        nose,” blue stone under the trees would be beneﬁcial. Prof. Rolfs—In connection with this subject I would like to say it is what some people call physiological disease. That does not express anything, but it is due to malnutrition. It is very closely related to dieback. You can cure a tree by spraying it with Bordeaux mixture. Melanose and dieback do not usually oc- cur on the same tree, although I have seen the two diseases on one tree. It is what you might call “citrus tree indiges- tion.” In the case of the dieback we made very careful experiments to see whether an application of blue stone to the soil would be of advantage. we found no advantage in treating the dieback in this manner. We also applied it to (the leaves and found it of no advantage. We tried the lime on the leaves of the dieback tree and saw no advantage. In these experi- ments we had untreated plots that we used as checks. In three plots that were treated with Bordeaux mixture they at once responded and showed beneﬁcial re- sults. Now, I will say that, not having made the experiment of applying blue stone to the soil, we are a little inclined to doubt if it would be advantageous in treating this disease. ' Mr. Waite—In one section of our grove last year we had a good deal of fruit af- fected by melanose, and a gentleman liv— ing up the river who had quite a large grove, told me it was so badly infested that nearly all the fruit dropped off be- fore it was matured. and he said he used about one or two pounds of blue stone around the trees, and the next year very little fruit was affected. and the second year there was none at all. I applied some, but did not know whether it was the right thing to do or not. Mr. Hoard—~I have used blue stone as a remedy for dieback for several years. and always with good results. Have cur- ed small trees that were almost dead and put them in ﬁne condition. Have also used it on large seedling trees which were so badly affected with dieback that nearly all of the fruit would split and drop off early in the fall. I commenced using it on these large trees the year before last, with the result that the fruit was much improved last year; so I gave them an- other dose last year and am using it again 'this year. In using it on small trees, care must be taken not to use too much, as an overdose would be fatal. Large seedling trees will stand from three to ﬁve pounds twice a year, broadcast. Member—W'hat else do you do besides that? Mr. Hoard—Nothing at all. \Vhen- ever I see a tree with symptoms of die- back I get some pulverized blue stone and apply it just as I would fertilizer. I have used it in the liquid form and have also put small pieces under the bark, but have come to the conclusion that it makes very little difference how it is applied so the tree gets it, and have adopted the easier method of throwing it broadcast. Mr. Penny—I use blue stone under the trees. I put it on the crown roots and cover it over. I have thought possibly that is where they get the most beneﬁt from the Bordeaux. Prof. Rolfs—\Vhere we applied it to the soil there was no beneﬁt from the Bordeaux. Mr. Donovan—I tried the same ex- periment last summer with blue stone in spreading in a circle around the tree to        the outer edge of the branches. It seems to do my trees good. They are dieback stock, and the trees this year do not seem to show any dieback. I didn’t do any thing else, so I think it must be due to that treatment. I have also sprayed with Bordeaux and killed the dieback. Mr. Waite—Prof. Rolfs, did I under- stand you to say that lime applied to the soil would not correct the conditions there? Prof. Rolfs—In our experiments we wanted to ﬁnd out what element in the Bordeaux corrected the disease, so we applied slaked lime to the soil in the plot, and in another plot we used lime on the leaves to ﬁnd out whether the application to the leaves was necessary, or whether it was necessary to put it on the ground where it would be taken up by the roots. In the place where we used the lime on the leaves or on the ground, it gave us negative results; in other words, were no better than our checks. But in those cases where we used Bordeaux mixture on the leaves we got decidedly better re- sults. We had the lots laid off with about thirty trees in the plot and went through one set and then took another set. Our conclusion was that, from the test we made, Bordeaux mixture must be applied to the leaves to be of advantage in curing the dieback. Mr. Waite has spoken more of the melanose than of the dieback, but it is very analogous to it in its behavior. Mr. Waite—I have suggested that you use lime. I applied lime to the amount of 1,000 pounds to the acre and only this past winter, and I thought of applying it again this summer. Prof. Rolfs—There are a good many things that may cause this dieback, and you want to make sure just what is caus- 53 ing it when it makes its appearance. Top pruning may cause it; carbonate in the soil may cause it; or if there is too much acid in the soil—humic acid—that may cause it. If it is the latter, lime would correct the conditions. Member—Is blue stone an antidote for humic acid? Prof. Rolfs—I think not. would have no effect. Mr. Waite—I would like to know if anyone has cured iby inserting blue stone under the bark and kept check, so that he could tell if it had any effect. Mr. Cooper—I had some trees on our place that had the dieback, and I tried the experiment. I took every other tree down the row and put blue stone under the bark, and it set up a terrible “spew,” but it straightened them right out. Last year I applied it just as you Would fertil- IZCI'. Member—What quantity? Mr. Cooper—A piece about the size of a grain of wheat. Member—How large were your trees? Mr. Cooper—We tried it on trees six inches through. I had one tree on a'little ﬁve-acre place that certainly was a for- lorn object, and it was astonishing how it picked up. Last year we tried some by casting it broadcast and with as good results. I mean to keep the experiment up. Mr. Hampton—I had some experience with this blue stone inoculation and ﬁnd where it is used carefully it is very satis- factory. I have taken trees and inoculat- ed them in three different places, but I never used more than a piece the size of a small grain of wheat. Where you use more it splits the tree until it looks as thought it had been frozen. I think it        Member—Does this add to the growth of the tree? Mr. Hampton—The tree shows a big, thrifty green leaf. and I never found any bad effects if used carefully. Member—What is the chemical action of the blue stone that causes the beneﬁcial action? Prof. Rolfs—I don’t believe that has ever been worked by the chemist. I do not think that we know just what the chemical reaction is. Mr. Hampton—For the past two or three seasons I ﬁnd that the kumquat, where budded on the rough lemon, espec- ially, has the sap oozing out right at the connection of the bud and the stock. I would like to know the cause. Prof. Rolfs—\Ve have not succeeded in getting any cure or any deﬁnite in- formation as to the cause. Mr. Skinner—Isn’t that identical with the same disease that is in Cuba? Prof. Rolfs—I think not. As near as I can tell from observation without in- vestigation. it is not a genuine disease. It almost invariably occurs where it is budded on the rough lemon. Mr. Hampton—I am of the opinion that the stock of the rough lemon out- grows the ‘bud, and I think it throws out too much sap for the bud to absorb, and it throws it out in the form of gum. Mr. Grilling—Regarding the fungus asked about. Prof. Rolfs discovered this red fungus (Sphaerostible coccophila) about ten years ago. \Ve have had it in mind since that time, but we didn’t have the courage to try it. In the meantime it cost us anywhere from a few hundred up to about four thousand dollars a year to keep the scale under control. That does not mean that the orchard was badly infested; you probably wouldn’t ﬁnd one tree in a hundred that had any scale on it. We used the spray as a preventive to keep it down. At the Horticultural meeting last spring, in Jacksonville, F. P. Henderson reported that owing to his inability to spray he got this fungus into his orchard and it practically cleaned up the scale. We went to Mr. Henderson’s orchard and found the conditions exactly as he had reported them. You could see that ninety per cent. of the trees had been infested and the wood was pitted with the marks of the scale, but you could not ﬁnd a live scale in the orchard. \Ve immediately went to work to introduce the fungus in our 650 acres of peach orchards. Although it was the last of July, we tried to inoculate all the infest- ed trees 'by taking a piece of limb infested with either the red fungus (Sphaerostible Coccophila) or the black fungus (M yrarn- gium durii), and binding on the limbs of the infested peach trees. Last fall we thought that the fungus was not go- ing to do the work, but, much to our sur- prise, this spring the orchard is coming out with practically no live scale showing. It took a lot of nerve to do it, but I be- lieved that if you have got the nerve to keep your spraying machines out and en- courage the natural enemy, it will help you out. Prof. Rolfs—Mr. Griﬁing left off the most important part, and that is the cost of applying the fungus. Mr. Grifﬁng—VVe didn’t know where to ﬁnd a supply of the fungi, so arranged with Mr. Henderson to furnish the limbs infested with the fungus and carry it to the orchard in sufﬁcient quantity for ﬁve hundred acres for $200.00. I do not suppose it cost us to put it on the‘trees        55 over $250.00 or $300.00. Since then we ﬁnd that we could get quantities of the fungus by hunting up live oak trees that were infested with obscure scale. You can ﬁnd it almost anywhere if you look carefully. You will ﬁnd where the oaks are infested with the scale, the fungus will be growing out over the scale. I think the one that has done the best work is the black one, which seems to work equally well during either the wet or the dry weather. I don’t think the cost of applying the fungus will be over $1.00 per acre. Mr. Berger, please tell them what per cent. of the scale you found had been killed. Prof. Berger—We estimated thing like 99 per cent. Mr. Grifﬁng—Prof. Smith from Geor- gia has just been in the orchard. He came to see what the results were, and he might tell you. Prof. Smith—I came from Georgia principally for the purpose of investigat- ing the red fungus on the scale, because if it will do the work in Georgia, it is of great importance to our fruit grow- ers. I visited that orchard last Monday and found that the scale was practically dead, as has been reported. In 'fact, a larger per cent. was dead than Mr. Ber- ger has reported in the majority of the orchard. We could not ﬁnd much red fungus, either, at this season of the year. Of course, I am not well enough acquaint- ' ed with the work of this fungus to ex- plain the condition, but certainly some- thing has killed the scale in that orchard, and if not the fungus it is something equally valuable. In my own personal opinion. I think, there is very little doubt but that the fungus is doing the work. Mr. Griﬁing—I want to say right here, some- too, that when we visited the Henderson orchard last June we didn’t ﬁnd any fun- gus. \Ve simply found that the scale was dead. Mr. Rowe—Would it not be possible to dissect some of those insects and ﬁnd out what was working on the inside? Prof. Rolfs—That is exactly what I did ten years ago and presented the re- sults of my work to this society at the Orlando meeting, and before I got through reading my paper I had the house entirely to myself. I never tried it again. The red—headed fungus has several stages in its life history, some of which are invisible to the unaided eye. The life history of this fungus being unknown, it proved a serious obstacle in its practi- cal use as an insecticide. \V e found that the scale was dying off without any ap- parent cause. After learning the life his- tory of the fungus all of this difﬁculty disappeared. In my studies I found no difﬁculty in getting pure cultures of this fungus from insects that showed no signs of disease to the unaided eye. (For a full discussion of this fungus see Bulletin No. 41 of the Florida Agricultural Ex- periment Station.) After we have discovered this peculiar- ity of the fungus we then found that by taking some of the diseased insects we could readily get cultures of this fungus from them, proving quite conclusively that it was the cause of the death of those particular insects. Since that time, however, we have made considerable pro- gress, and have added the black fungus as an ally in killing off the San Jose scale. The red-headed fungus likes a moderately dry season, while the black fungus wants, or prefers, an extremely rainy one, such as we had last year. Con-        sequently, the black fungus ﬂourished bet— ter last year than the red-headed. I think it is a good plan to have both of these friends in our peach orchard. In this connection, I might say that the long scale of the citrus is also severe- ly attacked by these two fungi. In addi- tion to these we have the white-headed fungus which Mr. White has been using for several years with the greatest satis- faction to him and those people who are watching the operation. Mr. Hudson—“fill someone please tell us how much time is required for apply- ing the fungus lbefore the scale is dead? Mr. Grifﬁng—Until last January or February we were afraid that the experi- ment was going to be a failure, but when the scale came out this spring it soon dis- appeared. Mr. Hart—I have talked so much on this subject that I am a little modest about saying more. It does do me so much good to hear Mr. Grifﬁng get up and talk about the nerve it takes to try the experiment he has been trying and found successful. That very nerve I have been preaching and urging on all my friends for the past twenty years. I am pleased beyond measure to know that so many are adopting the natural and rational method of controlling injurious insect pests, and when Prof. G0ssard stated at the Miami meeting that over 50 per cent. had adopted these methods I felt like test- ing the case and letting it go on. I be- lieve you are on the right track, and will do all I can to encourage it. Mr. Skinner—How about the natural enemy of the rust mite? Has it got any? Mr. Hart—J have found quite a num- ber of these and have been careful not to drive them away by spraying. I never sprayed for the rust mite. I am not thick- headed enough to say that I would never spray under any conditions, for that would be foolish; but I would not spray until I had tried almost everything else, even should dire disaster threaten in some new form. Mr. Hampton—Let me tell you how I treat my trees for the rust mite. I powder the dry Bordeaux on the trees, and it keeps my fruit nice and bright. I have not given up spraying altogether, but ﬁhd it injurious in many respects. I had much rather put the dry powder on than to spray it. I have also used the dry sul- phur. Mr. Hart—In my crop this year there was but a small part of one per cent. of rusty fruit. In fact. I did not pack a sin— gle box during the season. Mr. Hampton—As I understand, your grove is in a hammock or in dark ham- mock soil. I have found that on light, clay soil the oranges will be more in— clined to be rusty than on the dark, clear soil. Now, I would like to know how that holds good with the balance of your experience. Mr. Hart—I think you are right in that. \Ne all know that by covering the ground with mulch it will do away to a great extent with the rust. The rust mite does not like a direct. strong light or reﬂected light. If you can cover the ground in some way, you can do away with a good portion of the rust mite. Mr. Hollingsworth—I never see results without looking back in an effort to locate the cause, and I have wondered if the climatic conditions have not had a great deal to do with the disappearance of the scale. I can think of nothing else to lay it to, and I think that the radical seasons        57 we have had did a great deal towards the destruction of the scale. Mr. Griﬂing—Last year we had a very wet, rainy winter and spring and early summer. This year we have had identi— cally the reverse, so I don’t see how the dry weather can be accountable for the disappearance of the scale. Mr. Hudson—I have noticed in setting out young trees, that the scale appears on the body of the tree within about ten months after it has been planted out. I have used a little coal oil and ﬁnd that it works very well. The older trees can stand the scale better than the younger ones. I have also noticed that the scale takes more readin where there has been much vegetable matter in the way of beggar-weed, etc. Mr. Waite—Is there any injurious ef- fect to the orange trees by using sulphur- ous acid as a spray for foot rot? Prof. Rolfs—There would be no in- jurious effects by using it in a diluted state. The dilution is about one to ten of sulphurous acid. The sulphurous acid is one of the ﬁrst remedies recommended for foot rot, and you will ﬁnd that it does no damage to the sound wood. Sul- phurous acid is what was recommended ﬁrst, and by mistake some people have used sulphuric acid. This latter will cure the foot rot all right—so will a red hot iron. I would like to say in connection with the rust mite and the red spider, that in each of these cases I have found that diseases attacked them as well as higher insects. They do not exactly belong to the insects, but to the spider mites. They are attacked by diseases as well as higher life, but when you attempt to inoculate them with disease germs you will see that it is a very diﬂicult thing. The practica- bility of the scheme falls down when you come to applying it. The difﬁculty is almost unsurmountable. Dry sulphur, or the sulphur and lime that Mr. Hamp— ton has recommened, is a perfect remedy for it. On my own trees I used this calcium sulphide and had it applied merely to the fruit. I gave the colored man special instructions to apply it to the fruit only. By use of a hand lens, one can tell when the mites are migrating to the fruit and causing it to turn them to a rusty or golden rust. If they are present in sufﬁcient numbers to cause it to turn to a golden rust, the spray should be ap- plied. Member—How can you spray the fruit without spraying the leaves at the same time? Prof. Rolfs—The citrus fruits are nearly always on the end of the branch, and are away from the leaves. The fruit that is inside in the dark is not apt to be attacked by the rust mite.",,
"Report of Committee on Diseases, Insects, and Method of Control.",Ernest A. Bessey. (Pathologist in Charge of Sub-Tropical Laboratory.),"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I regret that it is impossible for me to be present in person at your meeting in St. Petersburg, but my work compels me to be out of the State. My report, accordingly, will be read by the Secre- tary and will, naturally, be somewhat shorter than if I could be present to ex- plain the various points. I have conﬁned my observations to the Southern part of the State and have asked Professor Hume to include in his report something about the diseases occurring in the Northern part of the State and diseases of nursery stock. Probably the greatest interest in the matter of diseases centers around the struggle with white ﬂy. This has been gradually spreading Ibut has not, so far as I am informed, made any very great jumps. According to a statement of Mr. C. B. Thornton of Orlando, the unpre- cedented drought the past winter and spring has been beneﬁcial in one respect in that it reduced the injury from this pest. He states in a letter to me that “the red fungus stood the dry weather and is still active, while the yellow, while it spread very rapidly after its ﬁrst appear- ance early last summer, has itself been attacked by a fungus enemy and is now virtually exterminated. My experience with the red fungus has been so satis- factory that I will have no further use for my spray-pump.” On the other hand, the dry weather has been favorable to the spread of the purple and long scale, but Mr. Thornton is con- vinced that the fungi will keep it under control. The exceedingly dry weather has had a more or less harmful effect on the Man- atee snail which requires a certain amount of moisture for its favorable development. Especially disastrous have been the ﬁres which have run through the hammocks in many of the groves in that vicinity, since these totally exterminated this bene- ﬁcial mollusk in the region burned over. The orange disease known as “blight,” or in some parts of the State as “wilt”, has slowly continued to spread through the State. It has now ﬁrmly taken hold in the lower end of Merritt’s Island and is doing great damage to the groves there. There is nothing new in the method of treatment that can be reported at this time although I have started to take up the investigation of this disease again and hope, upon my return to the State this summer, to do a good deal of work upon it. In view of this, I would be very glad to get into communication with all orange growers who are troubled by this disease. In a few localities I have found the disease to attack severely not only the        59 orange, but 'pomelo and Tangerine, al- though the most serious injury is done to the orange. This past season a peculiar disease has been noted in several parts of the State. It resembles in some respects foot-rot in that there is observable diseased tissue from which gum ﬂows, but differing from that disease, it is found on all parts of the tree, in many cases'being found both on the stock and cion if the bud is rather high, and in other cases being conﬁned to the cion alone. Mr. Thornton reports that he has treated some trees with sul- phuric acid solution. also boiling water, with apparently great improvement. I can at present say nothing regarding the cause of the disease for that is unknown to me. In some cases, however, it seems to be due possibly to unfavorable effect of the stock on the cion, for it is far more abundant in those trees where the cion is larger than the stock. Mangos and avocados suffered severely last summer from the rotting and spotting of fruit due to the anthracnose fungus C ollctotrichu-m glocosporioides which has been shown by inoculations with pure cul- tures to be the same as the fungus caus- ing the disease of the citrus known as “wither-tip"". The past winter has been so dry that the disease was not nearly as abundant as the previous winter, but yet in many groves the blossoms were de- stroyed by this fungus so that but few fruits were set. This is especially true of the avocado. In general, however, the fungus is far less abundant than last year and as a result a far greater number of mangoes and avocados set than last sea- son. It was noticed that those trees which were sprayed with Bordeaux mixture dur- ing blooming period set fruit far better than those which were not so treated. In this connection a point of great interest was observed by me in the vicinity of Miami regarding the effect of improper fertilizing upon the injury from the fun- gus. A grove of budded avocados set out two years ago near the city of Miami was fertilized with a formula about as follows: Phosphoric acid . . . . . . I 5 per cent. Ammonia . . . . . . . .3 to 4 per cent. Potash . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 4 per cent. As a result doubtless of the low amount of potash in the fertilizer and of the lack of potash in our soils, last year’s growth did not harden up well; furthermore, probably as a result of the excess of phos- phoric acid, the young trees blossomed very profusely, although they were far too small to do so properly. The fungus promptly attacked the blossoms (for the trees were not sprayed) and spread through the blossoms into the stocks of the inﬂorescence and into the twigs, the tissues not having been hardened up the fungus did not stop, however, as it us- ually does. but kept spreading down the trees, in many cases killing them to the ground ; in others, girdling some of the larger limbs by running down short spurs. I think there is no reason- able doubt but that this excessive injury could have been prevented had the trees been properly fertilized. Of course the destruction of the blossoms by the fungus would require more than proper fertiliza- tion to prevent, viz: spraying with Bor- deaux mixture. Celery suffered quite considerably around Sanford this year. from two dis- eases; one, a leaf spot disease caused by the fungus Ccrcosfora apii, and the other, black-heart. probably caused by bacteria. Nematodes probably caused somewhat more than the usual amount of injury to I      ()0   truck-growers on account of the drought, the affected plants showing the result of the injury much sooner on account of the limited water supply. Nothing fur- ther than was said last year can be stated now with reference to combating these pests. It seems probable, however, that where sub-irrigation can be used to soak the soil full of water for a period of sev- eral days, the trouble from nematodes can be prevented, or very greatly reduced for some months or years to come. . Possi- bly on this account, the trouble due to nematodes is less abundant around San- ford than at Orlando where this sub-irri- gation cannot be successfully practiced. Report of Committee on Control of White Fly. (F umigation.) ‘ By Dr. A. W. Merrill. Mr. President, Ladies and Gen-tlcnwn: The history of the use of hydrocy- anic acid gas for insect pests covers a period of nearly twenty-one years. The process was discovered and brought to its present degree of per- fection in California where it has steadily grown in favor until, at the present time, thousands of tons of potassium cyanide are used annually for controlling scale insect pests. This remedy has also become well estab- lished in the orange growing sections of New South \Nales and in South Africa. Vv'herever it has been adopt- ed, it has proven to be the cheapest and most effective of the direct rem- edies for citrus pests. Several years ago, Prof. H. A. Gos— sard, well known as the former exper- iment station entomologist. undertook some experimental fumigation work in this State and was led to conclude that the efﬁciency of this treatment against the white ﬂy is such that if a fumigated grove were segregated from all others, one fumigation would render it so nearly clean that it would need no ad- ditional attention for two or three years. Prof. Gossard predicted that “a process that has been found so val- uable in every other part of the world, is certain to eventually come into favor in Florida.” Having in charge the white ﬁy inves- tigation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the writer secured the assistance during the past winter of Mr. Stephen Strong, a horticultural commissioner of Los Angeles County, Cal.. a man of wide experience in prac- tical dealings with citrus pests and probably as well posted on the subject of fumigation as any other man in that State. Modern fumigation methods as adapted for use with trees of all sizes. were employed for the ﬁrst time in this State during the past winter months        61 and considerable data has been obtain- ed which shows the superiority of fum- igation over even the most successful spraying, both in regard to cost and effectiveness. It is the writer’s object to give in this paper a concise statement regard- ing the methods involved in the fumi- gation of orange groves and the results obtained thus far by the experiments along this line, looking to the control of the white ﬂy. Much more extensive experimental work will be conducted next winter with the object of testing improvements suggested by past ex- perience, and of reducing the necessary cost to a minimum. CONDITIONS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR GOOD RESULTS. Isolation of an infested grove is the most favorable condition for successful control of the 'white ﬂy by fumigation. Next in importance as a favorable con- dition is concerted action among the owners of adjoining groves, in the case of groves not sufﬁciently isolated for independent action. Whether or not this concerted action will be obtained in any particular instance rests with those interested in the success of the orange growing industry for the prob- lem of how to accomplish this was solved many years ago in California. In Florida, Orange county has already made a beginning towards the adoption of a systematic campaign against the white ﬂy, having organized a Horticul- tural Commission with powers equivalent to those of similar commissions in Califor- nia. The ofﬁcials having the matter in charge, however, have not felt justi- ﬁed in attempting active ﬁeld work on a large scale until careful experiments shall have determined what course can be followed with a certainty of uniform results. ’ The third condition which strongly favors, if it is not absolutely necessary for good results, is the absence of the white ﬂy food plants other than citrus trees. Chinaberry trees including the variety called “umbrella” tree cause untold injury to orange growing inter- ests. While all of these trees do not become infested each year owing to various circumstances which it is unnec- essary to mention here, it is well known that in many. localities, espe— cially in central and northern Florida, adult white ﬂies produced by them occur in myriads throughout the towns in midsummer. Chinaberry and um- brella trees favor the rapid dissemina- tion of white ﬂies from centers of in- fection, also their successful establish- ment in uninfested localities. They seriously interfere with the success of fumigation as well as of all other rem- edial measures by furnishing a favored breeding place where the white ﬂy can regain its usual abundance in a much shorter time than would be the case if it were entirely dependent upon the citrus trees for its food supply. Of the other food plants of the white ﬂy, cape jessamine and privets should, like the chinaberry and umbrella trees, be classed as public nuisances in all or- ange growing sections. W HEN TO FU MIGATE. Fumigation for the white ﬂy should be done during December, January and February, beginning about two weeks after the adults of the last fall brood have disappeared, in order that        all of the eggs deposited by these adults may have time to hatch. It should be remembered that the pres- ence of adults is practically a positive indication of the presence of unhatched eggs. It is impracticable to attempt to destroy the egg stage by fumigation or, as a rule, by any other direct means. The scale-like stages, techni- cally known as the larval and pupal stages, are readily destroyed when the dosage is properly estimated. Ordinarily, it would be undesirable to continue fumigation after the adults begin to emerge in considerable num- bers in the spring. This time, of course, varies according to locality and weather conditions, but in general is between the middle of February and the ﬁrst of March. For some not well understood rea- son, fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas in bright sunlight is liable to cause injury to the foliage even though in the absence of bright sunlight the same dosage might give entirely satisfactory results. On cloudy days, it is safe to fumigate during the middle of the day, but on clear days the work should not be started until between four and ﬁve o’clock in the afternoon. Fumigation should not be attempted in a strong breeze particularly if the tents have not been made gas tight or nearly so by one of the treatments which will be referred to hereafter. The presence of moisture on the leaves in the form of dew does not seem to have any del~ eterious effect upon the foliage al- though in California it is considered necessary to increase the dosage in such cases to ensure effectiveness of work against scale insects. The tents are more difficult to handle when wet, and it has not yet been determined whether. everything considered, it is desirable to continue to fumigate when the foliage has become wet with a heavy dew. EQUIPMENT. Many different styles of fumigating outﬁts have been employed in orchard fumigation in California since the ﬁrst discovery ,of the process. Ordinarily a person unfamiliar with the practices of recent years, pictures to himself some clumsy process of shifting bell or dome shaped tents from tree to tree by means of huge derricks, mounted on wheels and provided with gafts and an intricate system of ropes and pul- leys. Such methods, however, have long since become a thing of the past and their use is remembered only as in- teresting incidents in the early history of the fumigating process. Practically all modern tents for fum- igating purposes are made in the form of regular ﬁat octagons, and are gen- erally made of six-ounce drill and eight- ounce duck. A tent of this pattern is call- ed a “sheet tent” and its size is stated according to its diameter. In general a sheet tent is large enough for a tree that measures not over two-ﬁfths of the given size. For trees up to 14 feet in height, bell or dome shaped tents, held open at the bottom by means of a gas pipe hoop are sometimes used. With small trees of uniform size, they are easy to handle and they require less material in their construction, but they are not as adaptable for general use as are sheet tents, and hence are not as extensively used. It is the general custom in Califor-        63 nia at present to use untreated tents— that is, tents which have not been treated with any material either by dipping or painting for the purpose of making the canvas more nearly gas tight. This is not the result of such treatments having proven unnecessa- ry, but seems rather to be due to the practice of fumigating by the contrac- tor system, whereby the contractor for a certain price per tree furnishes the equipment and labor and the owner of the grove supplies the chemicals. The contrac— tor naturally prefers to use a larger amount of the chemicals per tree rather than to be put to the expense of treating his tents so as to better conﬁne the gas. A tanning solution obtained from tan- neries and known as “oak ooze”, and a decoction made from the prickly pear cactus, have been used extensively in California in years past for increasing the tightness of the tents. Linseed oil and ﬂexible paints have also been used. to some extent. The subject of the de— sirablity of treating tents is one which needs further investigation. Tents when not over 48 feet in di- ameter, lare placed in position over trees to be fumigated by means of so called “changing poles.” Larger tents are handled by means of uprights or derricks. The changing poles are light poles varying from 15 to 20 feet in length and attached to the tip of each, is a rope somewhat longer than the pole itself. Uprights or derricks are of simple construction, braced at the bot- tom to prevent them from falling side- ways, and provided with pulley blocks and ropes for raising the tent. Cypress is a very desirable material to use in making uprights on account of its 'gravity test of 66 degrees. lightness. Uprights are made from 25 to 32 feet in length according to the size of the trees to be covered. They need be only within two or three feet of the extreme height of the tree for the uppermost branches readily bend forward when the tent is being pulled into place. The material used in the generation of hydrocyanic acid gas are Potassium cyanide (K C N), Sulphuric acid (H-2 5 O—4) and water. It is essential that the potassium cyanide be 98 or 99 per cent. pure, and that the acid show a The pro- portions of these materials used in gen- erating the gas are, one part of the cyanide, one part of acid (liquid meas- ' ure) and from 3 to 4 parts of water. The commissary consists of a mov- able table provided with balances for weighing the cyanide, a large stock pitcher for the acid, a measuring glass graded for ﬂuid ounces, rubber gloves for the man who measures the acid, and a tin scoop and leather gloves for the man who weighs the cyanide. The generator tray is placed on top of the commissary table while “weighing up.” It is made with a removable upper rack for convenience. The upper rack contains two rows of tin cans for hold- ing the cyanide. Directly below each can in the lower rack or body of the tray is a pitcher for holding the acid for the given tree. The gas is gener- ated in earthernware jars of a capacity of from one and a half to three gallons according to the size of the tree. For large trees, two generator jars are fre- quently used. PROCEDURE. The systematic arrangement of de- tails is of great importance in fumiga-        tion. First, the dosage should be care- fully estimatedand a so-called “sched- ule”‘prepared showing the location of each tree and the amount of cyanide which should be given in each case. The work done by the agents of the Bureau of Entomology during the past season has not been completely Sum- marized as yet, and it is therefore im- possible at this time to present a table of required dosage for trees of different sizes. Before deﬁnite recommenda- tions of this kind be made, it is desir- able that further experiments be con- ducted with tents treated by different methods. A general idea of the amount of potassium cyanide required with an untreated tent of eight-ounce duck, can be obtained from the follow- ing table which includes only a few examples selected from the many rec- ords: Example of results obtained with exposure of 45 minutes.

The measurement of the circumference is made within a few feet of the ground. To obtain the distance over, the end of the tape is held in one ,hand while the reel is thrown over the center of the tent and the measurement made from ground to ground. Tables will be prepared in due course which will show the proper dose for trees of va- rious sizes, but with a little experience in calculating the dosage from actual measurement, a fumigator should be able to estimate the amount of potas- sium cyanide with sufﬁcient accuracy. In each outﬁt, from two to ﬁve men are employed according to the size of the trees. For medium sized trees up to 22 feet in height, four men can work to advantage. This crew can handle thirty tents every forty-ﬁve minutes, and can treat about 400 trees in a night’s work of ten hours. For trees from 23 to 35 feet in height, der- ricks or uprights are used, and a crew of ﬁve men are needed to handle about 12 or 15 tents every forty-ﬁve minutes. The changing of the bell or hoop tents from one tree to another is a sim' ple procedure, requiring but a few sec- onds’ time for two men. Sheet tents are placed in position over the trees up to about 22 feet in height by means of the changing poles described, and require from less than a minute up to a minute and a half for each tree. Trees from twenty—two to thirty-ﬁve feet in height can easily be covered by means of the derricks or uprights. The uprights being placed in position, the tent is raised by means of the pulley attachments, the uprights are then pulled forward by means of a rope at- tached to the top, and as they fall the tent is pulled over the tree. The cov- ering of the largest trees can be ac- complished in between one and two minutes. It is readily seen even from this brief description, that the mechan- ical difficulties involved in this process are insigniﬁcant when compared with the labor. required for spraying and in addition, it lacks the many disagreea- ble features which always accompany the application of liquid insecticides. \Vith the schedule before them, the _A      PLATE I.

(Diagram adapted from \Noodworth.)             65 fumigators weigh the potassium cyan- ide and measure the acid, arranging the dosage for each tree in the racks of the tray, the cyanide in the upper rack directly above the pitcher of acid for any given tree. One man usually measures the acid and generates the gas and is known as the “generator.” From two to three men look after the changing of the tents and are known as “tent pullers.” Another man known as the “tent kicker” follows the tent pullers and pulls or kicks in the tent at the bottom and also raises the edge of the tent while the generator passes in with the can of potassium cyanide, pitcher of acid and the generating jar containing the required amount of wa- ter. The jar is placed near the base of the tree and the acid poured in follow- ed by the cyanide, after which the gen- erator passes out quickly and the edge of the tent is dropped into position. The commissary is usually located where it will be most conveniently sit- uated for the entire night’s work. Af- ter shifting the tents and generating the gas, all hands return to the com- missary and the materials weighed up for the next change of tents. This procedure is varied somewhat accord- ing to the number of tents operated and the individual practices of the fum- igators. POISONOUS NATURE or THE GAS. The necessity of observing simple precautions in fumigating w'it‘h hydro- cyanic acid gas is so well known that, although this is one of the most dan- gerous poisons, there is no record of a fatal accident resulting from its use as an insecticide. After removing the tent the contents of the jar should be emptied between the rows of trees and covered with earth. When emptied close to the trees the roots are likely to be in- jured, especially when'the soil is very porous. Great care should be taken to avoid pulling the tents over any of this material even after it is supposed to be carefully buried. EXPENSE OF FUMIGATION. Wherever the surrounding condi- tions are such that a 'grove'would re- ceive full beneﬁt from the almost com- plete extermination of the insects, the cost of fumigation would ordinarily be about the same as three sprayings, but its eﬂiciency in checking the white ﬂy would be equal to at least six sprayings at the rate of three per year. At the outside, the cost, making ample allow- ance for wear and tear of tents, should not exceed that of four sprayings. Even on this basis, the cost of fumi- gation in a period of two years would not exceed two thirds the cost of the best of spraying while the results ob— tained would be far more satisfactory and uniform. These estimates are based on the cost of fumigation with untreated canvas. With canvas made approximately gas tight, the cost would doubtless be reduced fully lone- third. Fumigating tents are expensive as a ﬁrst outlay; those large enough to cover a thirty foot tree costing about $90.00 and to cover a ﬁfteen foot tree, about $20.00. It is not advisable as a rule for an orange grower to in- vest several hundred dollars in fum- igating tents for his exclusive use, al- though many with extensive groves would doubtless prefer to do this. In some citrus fruit growing countries where fumigation is practiced against scale insects, several growers form a 5        club and share the cost of the fumigat- ing outﬁt, which is kept at the disposal of each of the members in turn. Such a plan might be followed in many cases in this State. A few orange growers with a crop worth annually $10,000 or $15,000 would not be put to an unrea- sonable expense in the joint ownership of an outﬁt costing $1,000. Fumigation by the contractor system as it is now done to a great extent in California, may also come into use. The plan which can be most strongly recom- mended is for each orange growing county in the State, when the proper time arrives, to maintain an outﬁt large enough for the needs of the orange growers within its limits, and to pro- vide for fumigation under the direction of a County Horticultural Commission. The average annual loss due to the white ﬂy in the infested groves in Florida may be conservatively estimat- ed at 33 per cent. Taking into consid— eration the reduction in number and size of the fruit and the indirect loss through the necessity for washing the fruit and subsequent deterioration in its shipping quality. the total loss for the state is not less than three hun- dred thousand dollars per annum. Ac- cording to the Eighth Biennial Report of the Florida Commissioner of Agri- culture. there were in 1903, slightly over three million citrus trees in the State. more than one-half of which were non-bearing. The foregoing esti- mate of -a loss of $300,000 per annum is based upon these ﬁgures, placing the number of infested groves at one- eighth of the entire number. Accord- ing to this estimate, there are at pres- ent, omitting nursery stock, about four hundred thousand infested trees in the State of Florida. An avreage of ﬁfty cents per tree would be an ample al- lowance for fumigating the infested citrus trees in the State. This would give us $200,000 as the estimated ex- pense of fumigating these trees. The work of Prof. Gossard and the work of the Bureau of Entimology during the past few months furnishes evidence that no further loss would be occasioned by the white ﬂy for two or three years; hence the sum of $200,000 invested by the citrus growers of Florida who suffer losses from the white ﬂy, would result in the prevention of a loss of at least $600,- 000. This point is made not as a prac- tical recommendation, for the adoption of the practice of fumigation should he gradual, but simply to provide a basis for the estimation of the desir- ability of using this treatment in indi- vidual groves. While it is generally considered that in Florida the natural enemies of the purple scale are so effective that any direct treatment is unnecesarry or un- proﬁtable. citrus groves are frequently met with where this scale is a serious pest, and where the losses prevented by fumigation would amount to sever- al times its cost. In conclusion, the writer would express his conviction that in the case of the majority of the groves, the destruction of the purple scale and other true scale insects would represent an increase in proﬁt which would, by itself, offset the actual cost of fumigation, leaving as clear gain the beneﬁts derived from reducing the white ﬂy to a negligible quantity.",,
Control of White Fly by Stamping Out.,H. B. Stevens.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The loss of fruit by thieving had be- come so great, that the growers at De- Land about decided to organize a fruit growers’ society for self protection, and to help in other ways, that such an organ- ization could; but like most such move- ments, it was only talk until the white ﬂy was discovered on some trees in the very center of the town . That called for prompt action and there was no trouble found in getting the grow- ers together and organizing the “St. Johns River Fruit Growers’ Association.” One of the ﬁrst things they did, was to appoint a committee to devise means for combating the white ﬂy; that com— mittee ﬁrst tried spraying with pure ker- osine, with a result that they destroyed about 90 per cent. at one application, but the diﬂiculty was to reach the other IO per cent. Soon after, the cold of Decem— ber come, and it took off so many leaves from many of the orange trees in the part, that the committee thought was the infect- ed district, that they decided the best plan would be, to go into the matter thoroughly and defoliate all infected trees or shrubs. The matter was brought up before the society and they voted an assessment to meet the expense, and instructed the com- mitttee to go ahead. The way they went about it was this. ﬁrst, they examined the trees and shrubs that they thought might be infected, and if they found any of the larva or pupa of the ﬂy, then they took a few of the infect- ed leaves and with a glass showed them to the owner, and asked his or her permis- sion to remove the plants, or defoliate, as the case might be. If the party objected, then they let him alone, and went to the next place, knowing well, that after he had time to think the matter over, and to understand what an injury the pest would be, and how we were offering to remove it without any expense to him, he would consent later, and so it proved, in every case but one, and in that case the party had to be persuaded by other means than reason. It was soon found, that wherever there were Cape Jessamine bushes there was apt to be white ﬂy and in following up the ﬂy they went over an area of four square miles, and defoliated every infect- ed orange tree or jessamine bush and also privet hedges. Had we anticipated in the beginning, that we should have to go over anything like so great a territory, we might have shrunk from the task, but after we began we did not turn back. After going over every place we found anything on, around De-Land, we turned our attention to near-by places, and soon found that the ﬂy had gotten quite a strong hold at DeLeon. We called the attention of Mr. Mc- Bride to what the ﬂies were doing in his grove at DeLeon Springs, and he at once put a force at work defoliating a ten acre grove, and he says he got it done for $135. Adjoining him, was a grove equally effected, that we could not prevail on the owner to do as Mr. McBride had        done, but they consented to our doing it for them. Now any grower who has ever spray- ed for white ﬂy, knows that he has got off easy, if he has not spent more than $35 on ten acres, and still he knows that he has not killed them all and that enough are left to keep him working the next season. If he could only be sure that he had stamped them out, he would not mind that expense. we have not found a live ﬂy, so far, this spring, in or around DeLand, and all it cost us, was $158.80 to do the work. We consider it a good investment, even if the ﬂies get in next year, for all our groves are free this year anyway. From the experience we have had I feel sure the ﬂy can be stamped out of a'most any section of the State, if the growers will only go at it in earnest, and be willing to lose all the leaves, where- ever there are any signs of the ﬂy found. By doing this work as late as possible, in the spring before the ﬂy begins its general hatch, or the trees to bloom, the work can be done with the least expense, and it need not diminish the crop any more than the ﬂy itself would do, if as much. I wish to say right here that our com- mittee was greatly helped by two visits from Prof. Rolfs, he encouraged us to believe that we could make a success of it, and he helped to make the skeptical growers willing to allow us to take the leaves from their trees. Our society was also greatly helped by a talk he gave us on insects, and dis- eases, and I am sure that if the growers in the different localities of the State, would organize as we have done, and then when a difﬁcult problem comes up, invite Prof. Rolfs to pay them a visit, they would soon ﬁnd that his talks would save them in the expense of working their groves, much more than the society would cost them. So far our society has cost none of its members more than seven dol~ lars apiece. One lesson we have learned at DeLand, that is if you fear the white ﬂy watch your jessamine bushes as the ﬂy will ap- pear on the Cape Jessamine ﬁrst and if you want to delay their coming destroy all such bushes in your neighborhood. The ﬂy will spread faster from one jessamine bush to another than from one orange tree to another. In many cases we found larva on Jessa- mine bushes and no sign at all on orange trees near 'by, but if there were many of the larva on the jessamine bushes we de- foliated the orange trees as a precaution.

Control of the White Fly by Natural Means.,E. W. Berger.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: A study and discussion of the different phases of this subject are exceedingly in- teresting and important whether consid- ered from- a purely practical or from a purely scientiﬁc standpoint. \Vhen con- sidered from a Purely practical standﬂoint it involves mainly the knowledge neces- sary for successful insect control. This, however, includes a knowledge of the life history, habits, and conditions of exist- ence of the insect pests to be controlled, of the fungus or insect parasites or other enemies that feed upon the pest, and the plants or animals that we desire to protect or rid of their injurious insects or other pests. And last but not least, a knowl- edge of the methods for propagating and distributing the natural enemies of the insect pest that we desire to control is absolutely necessary. Thus, to take the ease of the citrus whiteﬂy as an illustra- tion, I ﬁnd that I cannot arrin at a rational understanding of this “whiteﬂy problem” without a comprehensive under- standing of the life history, habits and conditions of existence of the whiteﬂy, of its fungus enemies and of the citrus tree itself. The methods for distributing, or propagating and distributing, the fungi must be solved in reference to the case at hand, guided, of course, by previous ex- perience and the established principles of the subject. When considered from a purely scien- tiﬁc point of view this subject involves phases of the mutual dependence and re- lationship of living things as a whole. Aside from the many interesting facts of this relationship the question arises, how came this relation-ship about P+this de- struction of one kind of living thing by another kind. The truth of the matter is that nearly all animals are a “pest” in so far as some other animals or plants are concerned. Animals that live on decaying animal or vegetable matter are the only exceptions to this among animals. Plants are thus about the only living things that live with- out breaking the commandment, Thou shalt not kill, if you will allow me to temporarily extend this mandate to all living things. But even among higher plants we have those that kill other plants and animals or at least live upon their substance. Thus the dodder in part lives upon and ﬁnally kills other plants; the in- dian pipe, beech drops and the green mis- tletoe feed upon the sap of other plants. A few of the higher plants are also cami- vorous, feeding in part at least upon in- sects and the like, which they capture. Thus the drosera, or sundew, the Venus ﬂytrap, the pitcher plant and bladderwort belong to this group. But the chief des- troyers in the plant kingdom are the bac- teria and fungi which attack both living plants and animals as well as dead ones, . and many of these are to be feared as a scourge, only too frequently leaving com- plete desolation in their path. To this class belong the cholera germ, consump- tion, typhoid, diphtheria and others, of which there are varieties attacking ani- mals as well as man. Among such pests        of plants can be mentioned the several blights of vegetables and fruit trees and some root diseases, all caused by bacteria or fungi. In fact, nearly all plant dis— eases not caused by insects or other ani- mals belong to this class. A printed list would be a long one. But, were plants and animals to vote on the greatest pest of all living things, no doubt man himself would receive a un- animous vote as the most wanton des- troyer. And the object of all this so- called ﬁghting of pests, in sum and sub- stance, is but to make for man, that larger parasite, a little easier living, a little purer atmosphere to breathe, and perhaps add a span or two, to his human existence. Brieﬂy stated, the present relative signiﬁ- cance and abundance of each animal and plant group is the result of a struggle to make a living. In this struggle differ- ent groups began to prey upon other groups and the whole kingdom of living things (plants and animals) has become in a. manner somewhat delicately balanced in regard to relative numbers. NATURE BALANCED AND UNBALANCED. But nature occasionally gets a little out of balance, so to speak. Either some plant or animal group gets out of its place and begins to feed upon some other plant or animal group not normally its food, or it increases abnormally either in propor- tion to its food or out of proportion with its natural enemies. In either case, it be— comes a pest proper, in the sense that we ordinarily use the term. Our so-called ﬁghting of pests consists also in nothing more than in an endeavor to restore the equilibrium in nature or in overbalancing the same in favor of the crop that we wish to harvest. To accomplish this we may use artiﬁcial means for combating the pest, such as spraying, poisoning, fumi- gating, etc., or we may artiﬁcially spread, or propagate and spread, some known enemy of the pest that we desire to con- trol, or in other words, propagate a pest of the pest. As already stated, nature is generally quite balanced in the relative proportion of each kind of living thing. It is only when any one of these ﬁnds a great abundance of food, or some calamity keeps its ene- mies in check, or it is transplanted into some other country or district where its enemies have not followed, that it can in- crease abnormally. I refer, of course in particular, to plants and animals ordinari- ly known as pests. Thus if we plant an or- ange grove, we bring into existence an enormous amount of food for orange in- sects, with the result that the latter may increase enormously, much more rapidly, for a time at least, than their enemies. If left alone, the natural enemies of some of these would (in fact have done so), very likely at sometime strike a balance and control, if they did not exterminate, the same. NATURAL ENEMIES OF SCALE INSECTS IN FLORIDA. However, we do not ordinarily care to wait for nature to strike this balance, as it might necessitate replanting our grove for a life-time, and we either try to keep the insects off by some artiﬁcial means. or we try to discover their enemies and un- dertake to propagate them artiﬁcially, or in some manner encourage their increase. In the case of several of the scale insects of trees, in Florida, the fungus parasites of these have become very efﬁcient when- ever the same were not destroyed by ex- tensive spraying. or whenever the grower        71 undertook to spread and encourage the same. The several fungi parasitic upon scale insects in Florida are the Red-headed Scale Fungus (Sphaerostilbe coccophila), the Gray-headed Scale Fungus (Ophi- 0nectra coccicola), and the Black Scale Fungus (M yria-ngium durii). Several insect friends have also been ac— tive in keeping the scales of orange trees in check. Among these insect friends are several species of lady~bugs (beetles), the larvae of lace~winged ﬂies (Chrysopidae), the larvae of the Hemerdbians (Hemero- biidae), related to the lace-winged ﬂies, and perhaps several ﬂy-like parasites be- longing to the Hymenoptera. The efﬁ- ciency of all these fungoid and insect friends is so great that many citrus grow- ers as well as some others have learned to depend upon them altogether. FUNGOUS ENEMIES OF SAN JOSE SCALE IN FLORIDA. The remarkable mortality among the San Jose Scale some ten years ago near DeFuniak was discovered by Professor P. H. Rolfs (Bull. 41), to be due to the red- headed scale fungus, already mentioned. About two years ago Mr. F. P. Hender- son, of Arno, Florida, introduced some of this fungus into his peach orchard, and later discovered that the scale had been killed to such an extent as to amount to its control, if not its eradication. Based upon this extraordinary success in his own orchard, Mr. Henderson succeeded in con- vincing the Gainesville Orchard Company and the Griﬂing Bros. Company to intro— duce this fungus into the peach orchard of the former near Gainesville, and into the ﬁve-hundred-acre orchard of the lat- ter at Komoko. Mr. Henderson collected the fungus necessary for this work in great part from oak trees, upon which it frequently occurs in great abun- dance, growing upon the obscure scale (Aspidiotus obscurus). judging from in- spections made last February in these or- chards by Prof. H. S. Fawcett and the writer, 95 per cent. to 99 per cent. of the scale was dead at the time of inspection. The black scale fungus (Myriangium durii) has also been instrumental in re- duoing the amount of scale in these or- chards, and Mr. Henderson has stated, if I recall rightly, that he ﬁnds more of this black fungus in his orchard a-t Arno than of the red. \Vhich one of the two fungi in question has been the most ei‘Ieotive in these orchards We have not at present been able to decide. OTHER ATTEMPTS AT CONTROL BY NATURAL ENEMIES. Not a few successful and unsuccessful attempts have been made along this line with other insects. The most notable of these has been the attempt to control the increase of the chinchbug, in several of the States by means of a fungus disease of this insect. The introduction of the Aus- tralian lady-bug to control the cottony cushion scale, orginally introduced into California, is too well known to need any- thing more than mere mention. The former has not been a complete success, and I believe has been generally aban~ doned. while the latter appears to have been an unqualiﬁed success. The failure of the former is due to the general lack of favorable moisture conditions neces— sary for the rapid development of this fungus at the time when the chinchbug is most destructive. Whenever the condi- tions of moisture we're favorable. the        fungus appears to have been abundantly successful in checking the chinoh bug. The fact that past efforts at obtaining an enemy from China of the imported San Jose Scale have not been successful does not indicate that this will not event— ually be accomplished. Efforts are being made to ﬁnd and import the natural ene- mies of the gypsy moth and the brown- tail moth into Massachusetts from Eu- rope. Efforts are also at present being made to introduce the parasites of the purple scale of citrus into Italy where this scale appears to be on the increase. The ofﬁcers of the Pasteur Institute are un- dertaking the introduction of an American robber ﬂy into Algeria for the purpose of reducing the numbers of a certain taba- nid (a member of the horseﬁy tribe) known to be instrumental in spreading a certain disease of the dromedary. While Americans have not been idle in the matter of propagating fungus and in- sect parasites of insect pests, on the other hand some very interesting work goes to the credit of foreigners. I have already referred to the presence of the purple scale of citrus in Italy and the effort to obtain a parasite of the same from Florida. It is now nearly a year that I prepared (at the request of Dr. L. 0. Howard) 9. box of citrus leaves and twigs heavily infest- ed with this scale to be shipped to Dr. Ber- lese of Italy for this purpose. I have also previously referred to the efforts of the Pasteur Institute in behalf of the drome- dary in Algeria. I shall next brieﬂy re- view a few more instances of like nature and interest. Experiments have been made by Ger- man and French investigators to destroy the grubs of cockchafers by means of a fungus frequently found parasitic upon these. An effort has been made in France (but only partially successful) to control a certain turnip weevil by infecting the soil with a parasitic fungus in order to destroy the grubs. In South-west Africa grasshop- pers have been in part controlled by means of a species of mucor (Mucor Iocustici- da), a relative of the gray bread mold. One of the most successful as well as important efforts in this line relates to the destruction of ﬁeld mice in Thessaly by the use of the Bacillus typht' mun'um, or in plain English the bacillus of mouse typhoid. This germ is distributed (1903) on small pieces of bread or other culture media used for growing fungi and bac- teria in the laboratory by several of the states of Germany and Austria. It is not known to be injurious to man or domestic animals. A disease—producing microbe of rats has also been discovered by a F rench- man. In 1906 six disease-producing bacteria were cultivated and recommended by the state laboratories of Russia. These were recommended for the destruction of the following animals: House-mouse, rats, marmots, wood-mouse, ﬁeld-mouse, ear- less-marmot, and the Norway rat. TI-IE WHITEFLY AND ITS FUNGUS ENEMIES. With this fragmentary review before us, I desire next to take up in some detail the work done in Florida on methods of distributing the several fungi, parasitic upon the whiteﬁy. The remarkable in- crease of the whiteﬁy is perhaps best ex— plained by the probable fact that this in- sect is a foreign importation with but a few of its natural enemies, the fungi, coming along with it. The great in- crease of this insect in newly infested sec- tions 'of the state can also be explained in this way: The fungi do not at once fol- low the ﬂy to these newly infested sec—        73 tions. The generally persistent presence of the fungi parasitic upon the whiteﬂy in whitefly infested groves after they have once been introduced, and the thorough- ness with which they do their work, when once well under headway, places these fungi among the most remarkably efﬁcient of fungus parasites. These fungi came unbidden to begin their good work, and not a few growers have learned to spread them from tree to tree and from grove to grove, and are depending altogether upon them to keep the ﬂy in check. The num- ber of the fungi parasitic upon the white- ﬁy is generally given as three, although a fourth one. the red headed scale fungus already mentioned, occasionally develops upon the whiteﬂy larvae; but the number it destroys, so far as observed, is insigniﬁ- cant. These three fungi are the Red, the Yellow and the Brown. The red and the brown are pretty generally distributed throughout the whiteﬂy infested groves of western Florida from Fort Myers to Lake City, and as far east as Orlando. The red fungus has been known for about ﬁfteen years, and the brown for about eleven. I desire to emphasize that this red fungus of the whiteﬂy is not the same as the red-headed scale fungus al- ready mentioned several times. The yel— low fungus was ﬁrst recognized as such by Prof. P. H. Rolfs last September on specimens sent in from “7 inter Park, Florida. At this writing the yellow fun- gus appears to be limited to Eastern Florida, and is found in the groves at Orlando, \Vinter Park. Oviedo, and Mims. The scientiﬁc name of the red fungus is Aschersonia aleyrodes, Web, of the yellow Archersonia ﬂavo-citrina, P. Henn. The fruiting stage of the brown not being known, this fungus has received no deﬁnite name. It is this so-called Brown fungus, furthermore, for which some evidence exists that it represents two fungi. Professor H. S. Fawcett, of the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station has several times observed a form of this fungus that he thought might be the fruit- ing stage and even succeeded in getting artiﬁcial cultures from which he again succeeded in infecting whiteﬂy larvae. This fungus, however, appeared to be a species of Verticillium and somewhat dif- ferent in appearance from that of the Brown as it ordinarily appears. Recently a similar condition, but not fruiting, was observed by him on some specimens sent in by the writer from Palmetto, Fla. These latter specimens presented two fomis of Brown on the same leaf, thus indicating very strongly the presence of two fungi, each working on the larvae of the whiteﬂy. Further observations must detemiiine whether these different appear- ing fungi are different forms of the same fungus or distinct species and also their relative efficiency. A UNIQUE PHENOM ENON. The phenomenon of these several fungi parasitic upon the larvae and pupae of the whiteﬂy in Florida is unique in several ways: (I.) The fact that there are at least three of the fungi practically lim— ited to a single food supply (the larvae and pupae of the whiteﬂy) is surely re- markable; (2.) The abundance of infect- ing material generally at hand in infected groves practically ready to be used for starting the fungi in other groves, to- gether with (3.) The relative ease with which this can be applied in infecting other whiteﬁy-infested groves are facts of great importance to the man in charge of the grove; (4.) The favorable climatic        74 conditions generally existing during a good part of the year in Florida is not the least of these. In the majority of instances where nat- ural enemies of an insect pest were em- ployed for its control the material either had to be'imported or cultivated at some laboratory and distributed from there. Again, since it could not well be foretold when an outbreak of the pest would occur, it became necessary to keep a supply con- tinually under cultivation. In the in- stance of the whiteﬂy the grower need not fear any sudden outbreak of the pest. He knows beforehand just about what he may expect and what the situation is. Nei- ther does he have to depend upon the Station for a supply of fungus. I shall add, however, that we do expect to cultii- vate these fungi at the Experiment Sta- tion, and we expect to leave no stone un- turned until we are able to do so. That our Professor H. S. Fawcett has made Some progress along this line will be evident from some of the lantern slides which I will show later in the evening. I must frankly add. however, that our ﬁrst effort along this line on a large scale was not a success. But, unless some unforeseen and unsurmountable difficulties are encoun- tered we hope to succeed. DIFFICULTIES. I have one regret, namely, that the freeze of last December, together with the pro- longed drought of the past six or seven months. has so reduced the amount of the fungi that it will be diﬂicult to obtain any large quantities for some time this season. I hope, however, that by the middle of this summer a new crop will have started. The frost reduced the amount of the fungi by causing the leaves to drop from the trees, while the drought has caused it, as well as the leaves, to curl and large quantities have been loosened from the leaves and dropped to the ground. Another factor which may possibly in- terfere somewhat with the efﬁciency of the Yellow Fungus is the discovery of a fun- gus (a species of Cladosporium) that lives upon the yellow. This has been observed by Dr. A. W. Morrill at Orlando and by myself at Mims (near Titusville) and Winter Park. When I ﬁrst observed it at Mims last December it was on some trees that had been sprayed and I then lightly passed it over. thinking that the yellow fungus having been injured or killed by the spray this other fungus came on as a saprophyte. Dr. Morrill observed it more carefully at Orlando and consid- ers it a parasite of the yellow fungus. My observations lead me to believe that this second fungus comes onto the pustules of the yellow fungus later in the season after the pustules of the latter have matured and have perhaps undergone some degen- erative changes. Again, from the fact that this second fungus occurs in three- of the strongholds of the yellow fungus, al- ready mentioned, I cannot help but feel that its presence is of no great signiﬁcance so far as the efﬁciency of the Yellow Aschersonia is concerned. If it were a se- rious pest of the yellow fungus I believe that the latter would have been seriously retarded in one or the other of the four places mentioned where the yellow fun- gus has been very effective. Besides, I do not believe it probable that this second fungus could ‘have infested the yellow fungus in all four of the localities men- tioned at one time and I therefore infer that the same has been present for per- haps several years without seriously re-        75 tarding the usefulness of the yellow fun- gus. Dr. Morrill observes (circular to the Press) that the Red Aschersonia is rarely attacked by the Cladosporium. Dr. Morrill has recently called my at- tention to another fungus in the Man-atee country which he believes may be a super- parasite of the brown. This fungus which occasionally overruns the brown much re- sepibles a certain stage of the black scale ~fungus,Myrang1'um duryii, but a com- parative examination of these two by Professor F awcett has so far failed to verify the possibility of their indentity. Personally, I believe in regard to this fun- gus as I do in regard to the Cladosporium overrunning the yellow fungus previously considered, that it attacks the brown fun- gus only after the latter has become weak- ened from old age or other causes such as drought, etc. To sum up, it appears that we have in these two possible super-par- asites a new issue for investigation. CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR THE FUNGI. Nearly all fungi thrive best in the pres- ence of an abundance of moisture, es- pecially in a moist atmosphere. The past year has given me abundant evidence that the fungi parasitic on the larvae and pupae of the whiteﬂy spread and increase but little during cool or dry weather. This fact limits the time for their intro- duction into whiteﬂy infested trees and groves to the rainy season of the year or to the months of June, July, August and parts of May and September. These are the months during which success is most assured, but other periods of rain and warmth will be favorable. The moisture conditions may also be favorably supple- mented by permitting plenty of vegeta- tion in the nature of cover crops, wind- breaks, etc., to grow at the proper season. Irrigation or sprinkling, where the outﬁt is at hand, will help in creating and con- serving a moist atmosphere in a grove. INTRODUCING THE RED AND THE YELLOW ASCHERSONIAS. The chief drawback to introducing the fungi has been the supposed difﬁculty of starting (“planting”) them in whiteﬂy- infested trees. The matter appears to be much more simple than was heretofore supposed. At Lake City the writer suc- ceeded (June 20 and August 8th, 1906) in introducing the Red Aschersonia into four out of ﬁve trees by pinning leaves, with an abundance of fungus pustules upon them, to the leaves of the trees. In two instances the fungus started in an- other part of the tree some distance from the pinned leaves, but as no other infected trees could be found within one-half mile of these, it is considered safe to assume that the fungus started from the infected leaves placed there. In two of the success~ ful instances the leaves with the fungus pustules upon them were dry and had been picked about a month before being pinned into the trees, showing that the spores of the fungus retained their vitality for at least a month and no doubt longer. It was also found that the fungus had started in three different trees at Lees- .burg, into which Judge _I. B. Gains had pinned some leaves. No Red Ascherson- ia had hitherto been observed at Leesburg. Since writing the ﬁrst part of this para- graph. the writer has found the fungus started in each of thirty-seven trees into which he had pinned leaves of the Red Aschersonia six weeks previously (August I 5th) at Leesburg. In all, forty-two trees had been treated in this manner. but ﬁve of them were not examined for lack of        time. In many of these trees the fungus had made good headway, and in one in- stance Judge Gaines reported that it had started at the end of two weeks from the time of infection. W. H. Maxwell of Titusville, also reports that he has ob- served the Yellow Aschersonia to start in two weeks after “planting” (pinning leaves) the same in trees infested with whiteﬂy. The writer has also succeeded in start- ing the Red Aschersonia by spraying a mixture of spores and water on the under surfaces of the leaves in trees infested with whiteﬂy. This method of applica- tion was successful in starting an infec— tion in two out of three citrus trees, spray- ed at Lake City (July 10, 1906). In each case (leaves pinned or spores sprayed) the fungus was observed to have started in three to four weeks from the time of application of the spores or leaves. Eight trees were also sprayed at Leesburg at the same time (August 15th) that the fungus was started there by pinning on leaves, and examination six weeks later, showed that the fungus had started in each tree. These experiments are a complete dem- onstration that this fungus can readily be started either by pinning on leaves or by spraying on spores. there being only one failure in ﬁfty-two trials made during the months of June, July and August, 1906. Hitherto, planting into a grove small trees with fungus—infested whiteﬂy larvae upon them has been considered the only sure way of introducing it. This method is good and sure, where the trees_can be kept from dropping their leaves, but is rather impracticable on a large scale. The infected trees should be planted so that their branches and leaves extend among .sen the injury. the leaves of the tree to be infected. If necessary, the infected trees may be plant- ed in tubs and raised on platforms or oth- erwise elevated. One serious objection is raised in re- gard to the efﬁcacy of the fungus, namely, that when it has practically killed off the whitefly and the ﬂy starts to infest the grove anew. it takes the fungus so long to start that the ﬂy has done considerable damage before the fungus gets it under control. The situation appears to be about as follows. During one year the fungus cleans up the ﬂy; the second year the grove is generally clean, also the fruit; the third year the ﬂy re- infests the grove, and the trees and fruit are again black with sooty mold: then the fungus does its work again; etc. Now, in view of the fact, that the fungus can be introduced by pinning on leaves or by spraying on spores. . the fungus should be started at the same time that the rt-hiteﬂy larvae are ﬁrst observed, and while the progress and injury of the ﬂy may not be wholly offset, yet I believe a great deal can be done in this way to les- It is purely a question of helping nature (the fungus) along by guiding her at the critical moment. This is an important point. A grower should not wait for the fungus to start of its own accord but should start it himself as soon as he discovers the presence of the white- ﬂy and this should be done whether the fungus has previously been present or not. The fungus should be introduced and han- dled with the same rational consideration with which spraying or fumigation is car- ried on. Because the fungus is a natural remedy and will of itself (generally) spread and reduce the whiteﬂy is no rea- son why rational means for artiﬁcially .rfrcadin g the same should not be used.        77 BY SPRAYING ON SPORES OF THE FUNGUS. If it is decided to introduce the fungus by means of spraying on spores, care should be taken to spray against the under surface of the leaves. Future experiments may show that this precaution is not nec- essary but we are not likely to go very far astray by adopting it for the present. Forty well developed pustules having the bright red spots upon them are sufﬁcient for a pint of water. Two well infected leaves may be taken as representing the forty pustules 'but one leaf will frequently have the required number and often more. A pint of the solution, I believe, should be suﬂicient for a tree of ordinary size where a very ﬁne spray is used. From this it will be seen that spraying is the most eco- nomical in so far as infecting material required is concerned. Three thousand leaves will about ﬁll a bushel measure. Two leaves per tree to make the spray, gives us ﬁfteen hundred trees that can be treated with this number of leaves. Where an abundance of leaves are available the spraying solution may be made stronger; it cannot be made too strong. After hav- ing poured the water over the leaves and stirred the same about for a few minutes, ﬁfteen to thirty minutes should be allowed for the spores to become dissolved out of the red spots on the pustules of the fun— gus. Then the mass should be stirred again, thoroughly, in order to wash out all the spores possible. Do not permit the solution to settle but strain the liquid at once through a piece of cheesecloth or ﬁne wire sieve. An atomizer spray is to be preferred because it does not require so much liquid to spray the tree. At all events, a nozzle that produces a very ﬁne spray should be used. The above esti- mate of one pint of liquid per tree was based upon an atomizer spray. If on the other hand, no atomizer is available, a spraying machine may be employed. The spraying solution should under no condi- tions be permitted to stand in a copper or brass tank, for the amount of copper that would go into the solution might be fatal to the spores, as these are very sensitive to copper. If a spraying machine made wholly or in part of copper or brass, must be used, the same should be thoroughly cleaned before using, and then the work should be done as expeditiously as pos— sible. If it is necessary to use the copper or brass reservoir connected with the spray pump or spraying machine this should be partially ﬁlled with the solution, enough only being put in, to spray three or four trees. Spray the solution on the under surface of all the infested leaves giving special attention to the heavily in- fested new growth. If it happens that only a limited amount of the spraying solu- tion is available it may be diluted with water. Thoroughly spraying all the trees with a weaker solution is considered pre- ferable to spraying half the trees, or only part of each tree, with a stronger solution. It goes without saying, that it would be futile to introduce fungus into a tree not infested with whiteﬂy. The fungi in ques- tion, so far as known, can thrive only upon the whiteﬂy, so that there would be nothing for them to live upon in a non- infcsted tree. It will also be well to wait before introducing fungus into a tree until the whiteﬂy larvae can be abundantly found under a considerable number of leaves. To spray every tree in a grove re- gardless of the individual requirements of each tree would frequently lead to waste of material and labor. The writer’s plan of campaign would be as follows: Start the fungus in all the trees in which        the whiteﬂy larvae can be readily found. Later, say in three or four weeks, inspect the grove and spray all the trees not pre- viously sprayed and which now show the presence of whiteﬂy. In another three or four weeks inspect again and spray. Each tree should be considered individually and treated accordingly. Any trees not show- ing a good start of fungus in three to six weeks should be sprayed again, wholly or '_ in part. This kind of procedure should be continued from year to year, and the pre- diction is made that in a comparatively few years, when the citrus growing sec- tions of the State have in this manner been thoroughly saturated with the fungi, there will be no whiteﬂy problem. I have stated above that the fungi in question can thrive only upon the whitefly larvae and pupae and this is probably true in nature. In the laboratory, however, Professor H. S. Fawcebt has been success- ful in growing the Yellow and Red As- chersonias, and to produce spores, upon several of the media generally used for such work. There is but little doubt that the Brown Fungus can be cultivated on the same media. This opens up the pos- sibility of producing spores of the fungi in the laboratory for use upon trees. But as an abundance can generally be obtained from infected groves it is not likely that we shall very soon be compelled to depend upon artiﬁcial means for a supply. The fact, however, that a fungus can be cul- tivated artiﬁcially gives the scientiﬁc in- vestigator greater opportunity for careful and varied experiments and observations that may eventually lead to broad scien- tiﬁc principles of practical value. I wish to state again that if the ﬁrst attempt at introducing the fungus fails to produce a good start in a grove, or in individual trees of a grove, a second at- tempt should be made and a third one if necessary. This kind of spraying is much cheaper (and I believe spraying on the spores is preferable to pinning on the leaves; but both methods can be used) than spraying with insecticides, and is perfectly harmless to the trees. This point, furthermore, should not be lost sight of, that the increase of the fungus in a tree (other things being equal) is in the same proportion that we succeed in starting it in that tree. Thus, if we suc- ceed in starting IOO pustules of fungus in one tree and 300 in another, it will be ev- ident that the spread of the fungus in the last tree will be three times as rapid as in the ﬁrst one, and hence the importance of making as good a start of fungus as possible by repeated sprayings. Attention should also be directed to the fact, that for subsequent sprayings, fun- gus from the trees previously treated may be used, provided it is sufficiently develop ed. This will be evident as the pustules increase in size and become a bright scar- let red in the Red Aschersonia or a bright yellow in the Yellow Aschersonia. BY PINNING ON LEAVES. To introduce the fungus by pinning on leaves I would suggest that from one to a dozen or more well infected leaves be pinned to a tree. The number will be de- termined by the amount available. At Leesburg 12 leaves per tree were used. Each infected leaf should be pinned to the under surface of the leaf on the tree, with its under surface down, that having been its position before it Was removed from the tree and is in closest keeping with nature. The infected leaves might be pinned with the infected (or under) side against the under side of the leaves on the tree, and I have obtained good results in this way,        79 but for the sake of keeping close to na- ture I advise the other way for the present. Each infested leaf should be pinned as high up in the tree as is convenient. that is, at least as high as a man can reach. To pin it higher is desirable. It should, fur- thermore, be so placed that the drip from it, when it rains, will drop onto a cluster, or several clusters, of leaves beneath it. Use two pins for each leaf. I have ob- served that the fungus sometimes starts on the leaves beneath the pinned leaf rather than at the leaf to which the in- fected leaf was pinned. It is well to pin a small piece of paper on the upper surface of the leaves to which the infected leaves are pinned as a mark. This will greatly facilitate later inspections. THE BROW N FUNGUS. What has been said for the Ascher- sonias applies (with one probable excep- tion) also to the Brown Fungus. The spores of the Brown Fungus have not been discovered, and this fact makes it uncertain whether it can be successfully introduced by spraying. This leaves two methods available for introducing the Brown Fungus: (I) to pin leaves having whitefly larvae infected with the fungus upon them onto the leaves of the tree into which it is to be introduced; (2) to plant small trees, having the fungus upon them, into the grove as previously ex— plained for the Aschersonias. (See also Bull. 88, by the writer, Florida Agricul- tural Experiment Station). CONCLUDING STATEMENT. So much on the subject of the fungi. I should be extravagant were I to herald the same as an absolute panacea. They are, however, a very valuable adjunct to a \vh'iteﬂy-infested grove and with a thorough knowledge of how to best intro- duce the fungi, “together with a little extra fertilizer for each tree, the grower will be able to continue the growing of citrus fruits proﬁtably, other things being equal. I should not hesitate, however, to recom- mend judicious spraying in isolated groves (i. c., isolated by sufficient distance or forest barriers from other groves) or on small trees where [the work can be done thoroughly. By judicious spraying"" I mean that the man knows the proper time to spray and to spray thoroughly. And then, I should recommend spraying only in the nature of a makeshift to tide over a certain period pending either the in- troduction of the fungi or fumigation. Following Dr. Morrill’s careful experi- ments and observations on fumigation for the whiteﬁy during the past year, I antici- pate that many growers will take up this method of controlling the ~whiteﬁy, and that rightly so. And, as more experience along this line becomes available it appears not at all improbable but that many grow- ers will prefer to contrdl the whiteﬂy as well as other insects by fumigation. This will be especially true for growers or dis- tricts so isolated as to be comparatively safe from becoming immediately reinfest- ed from nonfum-igated districts. In regard to the subject of insect con- trol by means of their natural enemies in general, many efforts along this line have been only partially successful or complete failures while perhaps only a few can be accorded complete success. But the fact that there are failures does not indicate that any particular effort along this line will be a failure, since each case must be worked out on its own merit. This brings us to another important fact which may be of much value in guiding our efforts to control insect pests by means of their        insect or fungoid and bacterial enemies. We may roughly divide insect pests into (I ), those which are always with us, such as scale insects and the whiteﬂy, and (2) those whose appearance in suﬂicient num- bers to be destructive is uncertain. Among such may be mentioned the several leaf- hoppers, destructive to corn, beans, etc., grasshoppers, chinch-bug, and others. The fact that these latter can generally be found only in small numbers, or practi- cally disappear altogether, except during periodic and sporadic periods of increase, this results in a natural decrease of their enemies to a minimum. It being practi- cally almost impossible to cultivate a sup- ply of their insect enemies on artiﬁcial foods or other insects, and generally difﬁ- cult enough to artiﬁcially cultivate their fungoid or bacterial enemies, it follows that the enemies of these pests are gener- ally not at hand in sufﬁcient abundance to meet the requirements when an outbreak of such a pest occurs. All this, together with the possibility of unfavorable weath— er conditions, in case the enemy supplied is a fungus, makes the proposition a difﬁcult one. When considering the proposition of controlling the ﬁrst (1) class by means of their natural enemies we have this great advantage, namely, that the insect is gen- erally with us in abundance at all times and hence also its enemies; and our work is simpliﬁed to this extent, that-about all we have to do is to devise methods of spreading its enemies to keep them abreast of the pest and to protect them by creating conditions favorable for their increase. If we desire to supplement their natural increase by cultivating them in the lab- oratory, it will be mainly for the purpose of observing them at closer range and un- der peculiarly favorable conditions other- wise unobtainable. It is under the favor— able conditions accompanying this ﬁrst (1) class of insects that we are laboring in our effort to control the whiteﬂy and scale insects of Florida.      PLATE VI.                    EXPLANATION OF PLATE VI.

The Inﬂuence of Packing Methods on the Carrying Qualities of Citrus Fruits.,Lloyd S. Tenny. (Assistant Pomologist.),"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The agricultural interests of the world have made immense progress in recent years, especially true is this in this coun- try. In a single generation there have been developed our modern system of State Experimental Stations and the National Department of Agriculture. It was only recently that the primary object of these institutions and frequently the only real one, was the studying of plant diseases. This in turn gradually led into the work of plant breeding in all its phases, the securing of varieties resistant to certain diseases, those especially adapted to one soil or one climatic condition, and thus the work has broadened, not only along this line but along every line, until now we ﬁnd the Department of Agriculture and many of the State stations undertaking a careful scientiﬁc research along a mul- titude of lines Connected with the farming interests. N0 phase of the subject is considered too small or too unimportant to be left out. One of the subjects into rwhich this study has led us at the Department of Agriculture is the transportation side of fruit handling. The wonderful extension of our railroads and the great headway that has been made in the methods of transporting perishable produce, has made it possible for every section of the country to produce those fruits and vegetables best suited to its soil and other conditions. And so the vineyards and orchards of California, the gardens of Texas, and the semi-tropic fruits and vegetables of Flori- da have come to be well known things over the country. But the one thing which has made all this practicable and - has enabled the man of New York or Denver to have Florida fruits upon his table is the development of the transpor- tation side of agriculture. The study of these transportation subjects and the methods of harvesting and packing fruits intended for distant markets is a study worthy of real investigation. \Vhat com!- mercial advantage would it be to Florida to produce a delicious orange if you grow- ers and shippers were unable to put this on the market at a proﬁt. Uniformly almost during recent years has good fruit demanded excellent prices. Methods of orchard management have been improved, so that the yield is nearly certain and the quality of the fruit high, the various fungous and insect diseases are watched and methods of preventing their spread sought, and so along every line we ﬁnd the conditions such as to jus- tify us in expecting an industry at a very high point of development, and such do we ﬁnd to a great measure. The fact re- mains, nevertheless, that while we are pro- ducing something like a 4,000,000 box 6        crop in this State, worth some ten millions of dollars. that the proﬁts to the ordinary shipper are comparatively small. I real- ize at the same time that doubtless most of the orange men here today are conduct- ing their business on a liberal margin of proﬁt; at the same time you will admit that there are those in your immediate neighborhood who are not so fortunate. These conditions exist in a measure at least from the great losses there are in transit from decayed or wasty fruit. TIIE EXTENT OF THE LOSS FROM DECAY. It is difﬁcult to estimate the extent of this loss, since no accurate and detailed inspection reports are made, but not one of you will deny that there are heavy loss- es. As we have come into closer touch with the shippers throughout the State. [we continue to get more of the inside in- formation regarding this sort of loss. It is not uncommon to hear of cars arriving at destination with 20 or more per cent. decay; even in some exceptionally bad cas- es it runs as high as 50 per cent. From personal conversation with many of the large Florida commission men in New York City, a 15 per cent. loss seems a conservative estimate. One of the very large houses and one that favors Florida fruits, expresses their opinion as follows: “The past season has been an exception- ally good one, and [0 per cent. would cover the losses in most of the cars, but in former years a 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. decay was not uncommon. We should think that a I5 per cent. waste would be a fair average for several years.” .But for our purpose let us be even more conservative in our estimate of the loss from decay in transit and place it at to per cent. which means but 7 or 8 rotten Oranges in each half bix of 1505. \Vith this moderate loss, it means on a crop of three million and a half boxes, the loss of three hundred and ﬁfty thousand boxes, or over one thousand cars of fruit. If the cost of picking, packing and shipping amounts to one dollar and a quarter a box, . then you are paying out over $400,000 to harvest rotten oranges. If you are a ship- per and buy your fruit at a dollar a box, that means another loss of over $300,000, or to put the ﬁgures into one sum, you orange men of Florida are losing each year close to one million dollars from this one cause alone. The purpose of the De- partment of Agriculture in opening this line of experimental work is to determine whether this loss is a necessary one. and, if not. what are the causes and how far are the present packing methods to blame for the present condition of affairs. The subject is one that cannot be covered in an investigation extending over one sea- son alone, nor over two, but it is one that must be followed for a series of years, or 10ng enough to determine experimentally the effects of different methods of picking, hauling, packing and shipping, season af- ter season. So let me say now that any statements made today or any results given, are only preliminary and subject to change as the work develops. The work was begun this past season, and, at the best, only a preliminary survey could be made the ﬁrst year. Had it not been that the results obtained so far were so uniform and so suggestive, we would not feel jus- tiﬁed in bringing before you even this pre- liminary report. I should like to say fur- ther that we are beginning this work with no set idea as to the inﬂuence of the pack— ing methods on this subject, and so have no pet theory to advance. The work will be wholly experimental in nature. and our aim will be to devise methods of handling        83 the citrus crop with the least amount of loss in transit. THE CAUSE OF DECAY. The decay which causes practically all the wasty arrivals is produced by the growth of a common blue mold fungus, a low form of plant life. The spores which form the blue covering on the surface of a rotten orange act as the seed for the repro- duction of this plant. These are ever present, the dust of the air is laden with them, and each orange doubtless has many of them on its surface. Before decay takes place, three things seem to be neces- sary, as they are necessary for the growth of any plant. a soil in which to grow, heat and moisture. One of the characteristics of the blue mold fungus is that it seldom if ever lives on living tissue. A perfectly healthy un- injured orange on the tree is seldom seen decaying. When the fruit is picked the life of the orange does not stop immedi- ately, the cells continue active for some time after. It should, therefore, be im- possible for the fruit to decay soon-after harvesting. and from experiments we see that a perfectly sound orange may be covered with these spores and held in a warm, moist room and yet no decay takes place. But once bruise the fruit or injure its skin, thus killing some of the cells, and one of the conditions for the growth of this decay fungus has been supplied; it has proper soil conditions. If you place this injured orange on your desk in a very dry place, or put in a very cold room, it probably will not rot, but pack it in a box, wrapped in paper, so that any mois- ture there may be retained, and then place the box in a warm, moist spot and the decay will be very rapid. \Vith this understanding of the nature and cause of the common decay, it be- comes easier to see how the harvesting methods might have an important bearing on the keeping quality of the fruit. If the methods are such as to injure it by bruising or cutting the skin, then we would look for decay, and in turn careful methods should give sound fruit. THORN PUNCTURING. Starting our investigations with the fruit as it hangs upon the tree, some in- jury has been done already by thorn punc- turing and branch injury. In seedling or- chards this damage at times may run quite high, and after a period of warm. moist weather, decaying fruit may be found on the tree. Close inspection of some of these in the early stage of the rot will generally show that the decay is begin- ning around some sort of a mechanical injury, although it may be so small that it is scarcely seen without the aid of a hand lens. This class of injury is in- creased by the method of picking, namely in the setting the ladder, by the picker pulling the branches about, and by his hitting the fruit against the thorns. In examining fruit from the same tree, picked by different men, it is common to ﬁnd in one box ﬁve or six fresh thorn bruises. while in another not one is seen. A small number of counts made so far indicate that about 6.6 per cent. were thorn or tree injured. This varies from one to 22 per cent. ths with 5 per cent.. 3.9 per cent., 6.6 per cent. and 6.8 per cent. were found. CLIPPER CUTTING. Enormous damage may be done by puncturing the fruit with the clippers in the act of picking. On the other hand, it        is not necessary to do any damage. Three years ago when Mr. G. Harold Powell, of the Department of Agricul— ture, began his work with the California citrus fruits, he found as high as 15 or 20 per cent. of the crop made subject to de— cay from this thing alone. He and his associates made records on hundreds of boxes, with the result that at that time a 5 per cent. injury was as low as could of- ten be found; frequently the per cent. ran to 25, not infrequently to 40 or even 50, and with some individual pickers even to a higher amount. The shape of the Navel orange as grown in California, with a sunken area around the stem,- favors this injury with the clipper. In attempting to cut the stem as close as possible, the shears punctured the skin. To a much less extent, this damage is found in Florida. The round orange is more easily clipped with a short stem, and there is much less danger of its being cut. A count of a considerable number of boxes show 5.0 per cent. clipper cut. In many cases no injury was done at all, and in a few the percentage ran high. Mr. Powell has demonstrated by many shipping tests, and it is accepted as a fact among California shippers, that an orange with a broken skin is liable to decay in transit. Boxes of that class of fruit have reached New York City this past season with as many as 105 rotten oranges in a box of 1265. When injured fruit is ship- ped under ice or during cold weather, the decay upon arrive? is often small. This same fruit shows a rapid breaking down. however, when it is held a few days upon the market. The following chart will indicate the amount of decay in injured fruit as com- pared with sound lots: CHART I. Apparently free from mechanical injury . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 per cent decay. Mechanically injured . . . . . . . . . .48 per cent decay. The average for the sound fruit is 2.9 per cent. decay, while the injured fruit ran as high as 48.7 per cent. rotten. These ﬁgures are the results of the work done in Florida, and while the tests have been few in number, yet they only conﬁrm the results obtained in California with series extending over a long period of time. , LONG STEM PUNCTURES. Another type of injury is the punctur- ing done by long stems. Some pickers leave a considerable number of stems sufﬁ- ciently long to pucture other fruit. This damage may be done as the fruit is drop- ped into the picking bag, from the move- ment of the oranges in the bag. in the hauling, or somewhere in the packing house. INJURY FROM DROPPING. It_wa.s a question, however, whether all the decay which develops in a car of oranges in transit from Florida could be attributed to the above causes. \Vith 3 or 4 per cent. thorn punctured fruit, 8 or 10 per cent. clipper cuts, and some additional stem punctured oranges, it is difﬁcult to explain a 40 or 50 per cent. decay. These high percentages seem to indicate that at times at least nearly or all of the fruit was made susceptible to decay. To a_ fruit man, unaccustomed to your methods of hervesting and packing, the most probable explanation of this condition would be in the amount of rough handling and drop- ping to which the fruit is subjected. The picker in his hurry lets the fruit fall into        85 his basket or bag and generally takes pains to give each orange an extra shove with his shears as he aims the fruit toward the basket. He often holds the branch with one hand and allows the oranges to drop the 18 inches or 2 feet into the basket. In an ordinary gang, a drop of 12 inches seems about the minimum which any or- ange receives in the picking; two feet is not uncommon. In pouring into the ﬁeld crate, which is 13 inches high itself, the mouth of the bag is held 6 inches above the box, and here is another drop of 18 inches onto the bottom. Not counting the rough handling in loading and in hauling, sometimes over very rough roads, there is another very dangerous drop into the hopper. This is often large and the fruit rolls down a steep gravity run and hits again._ With another tumble into the bins the oranges are ready to pack. The question then is, does dropping make the oranges susceptible to decay? The only way to settle such a question is by experi- menting. Pick carefully some boxes of oranges, pack half the lot as they are, drop the other half a certain known dis- tance—we selected 18 inches—then pack them and hold along with the ﬁrst lot for 10 days or two weeks. Do this, not once, nor twice, but a hundred times, and you will begin to know whether an 18 inch drop will cause any decay. Here are some of the results of our ﬁrst year’s work. These experiments were done in your own packing houses, through the courtesy and excellent co-operation of the owners and foremen. At the same time that the ex- perimental lots were packed, several box- es from the regular house pack of the same fruit were set aside.v These were picked, hauled, and packed in the usual manner and by the regular workmen. In preparing the series of dropped fruit, un- usual care was taken to have the oranges picked carefully and not dropped into the bag and box. All mechanically injured fruit was removed and there were no long stems. Just before packing each orange was held 18 inches above the ﬂoor or bot- tom of the box and dropped separately this distance.

The only difference between the fruit which show- ed 2.9 per cent. decay and that which con-        tained 20.1 per cent. was in the drop of 18 inches. How much of the 22.9 per cent. waste in the house pack may be attributed to a similar cause, we will leave to you to judge, who know something about the amount of rough handling a box of fruit ordinarily receives. SUMMARY. It does not seem best at the present time to make any very deﬁnite recommen- dations. I should like to present, how— ever, the following questions for your consideration. Is there not an immense amount of rough handling in your orange groves and packing houses? Is it not reasonable to expect, and do the experiments not indicate, that the in- jured and dropped fruit has been made susceptible to decay? Other conditions, such as the amount of moisture and heat at the time of packing, the length of delay in shipping, the time in transit and the character of the weather encountered, all have their bearing. But as a preliminary consideration, is it not more than probable that the packing meth~ ods have much to do with the keeping quality of citrus fruits? DISCUSSION. Member.-—VVhat is the character of the land? High pine land fruit? Mr. Tenney—All kinds. This is one of the things of which more deﬁ- nite notice will be taken another year. We did not ﬁnd a great deal of differ- ence in the results where the experi- ments were made with high pine land or hammock land fruit. There were, however. striking differences in indi- vidual lots of fruit. Mr. Hart—A question I have in mind is whether, if that fruit was kept a little while and cured and softened up, it' would not have gone through with less percentage of rot. \Yhen an orange is just off the tree and rigid, the drop would injure it considerably more than after it had been off the tree for 24 or 36 hours, and that brings up the matter of whether curing is de- sirable or not before shipping. Mr. Tenny.—Oranges that have been picked some time will probably not be injured as much by dropping as those that are freshly picked. The difﬁculty, however, lies in the fact that a large proportion of the damage is done in the picking, hence curing some time after picking will not remedy the trouble. Under your present harvest- ing system, the trouble is in getting your fruit into the packing house. There is little doubt that an orange that is cured will stand a drop better than one that is just picked and conse- quently hard. Mr. Hart—Then another important point is that where fruit is shipped in small quantities, it is loaded largely by the freight handlers, and it is not unusual for them to shoulder the box and give it a shove and let it go. Now, if we had cured the fruit, I think it would have been injured less than when packed immediately from the tree and crowded into boxes. Mr. Tenny—The matter of delaying the shipment will be taken up before our work is ﬁnished. I could give you some of the results from the California end. but do not feel justiﬁed in doing that. because the same conditions might not hold good here in Florida. Mr. 'Hart—In putting on the cov- ers of the boxes considerable injury might be done, while, if partly cured,        87 it might get into market in better shape. ‘ Dr. Richardson—There 'has lately come into use a different kind of pack. \Ve used to put the oranges in and press the top down and nail it. Now, the market seems to like a loose pack. The ends of the top are nailed down and the center at the partition, is not nailed down, and it bellies out. Was the pack you used the loose or the ﬁmi pack? I think the loose pack permits the fruit to be bruised. Mr. Tenny—We use the ﬁrm pack. In any case, there was no damage in our experimental lots after the fruit was packed. Any injury that appeared on this fruit was made before the box was nailed up. The boxes were set in the packing houses very carefully and no injury was done by the drop- ping or the rough handling of the boxes. ‘ Mr. Skinner—In my opinion, this is one of the most important sessions. Now, about the picking of the fruit; at the start I want to say that I don’t see what we are going to do. I had one man six feet and over picking for me, and found him with his arms extended full length and dropping them down to the basket. I don’t know how in the world we are going to get rid of the trouble. Last year, I provided my men with a bag to tie around them that had a kind of a proboscis. I also agree that there is a great deal of trouble in the packing, but how to overcome it is a question. Naturally, this brings up the labor question. I shipped this past season about 60,000 boxes, and every time I saw a fellow dropping an orange, it touched me right on a tender nerve. You can im- agine that by the end of the season I was a nervous wreck. There seems to be seasons when everything carries well, and then another season when everything rots. Mr. Sampson ship- ped a carload of oranges to Augusta, Ga. and they were not over three or four days in transit, but when they ar- rived there, they were entirely worth- less. I do not know how to meet these conditions. I expect to try a blower to see if I cannot dry my fruit. The atmosphere in this country is saturated to the full point with moisture, and sometimes the oranges are dripping wet with moisture from the atmos— phere. I would like to know your opinion as to whether it would be prac- ticable to use a blast of that kind to keep the fruit dry. Mr. Tenny—This is a question con- siderably discussed in California. I am not willing to venture an opinion on it. The point in question is this: If the climatic,conditions are such so that the atmosphere contains 90 per cent. or so of moisture, and this moist- air is blown over the fruit. it may ap— parently dry them off, but in reality the air which is around the fruit after it is packed is still very moist. As the oranges continue to give off moisture after being packed, it seems probable that if the weather is moist. there would still be sufﬁcient moisture to al-. low decay to take place. Regarding the question as to why one lot of fruit will decay while another packed appar- ently under similar conditions arrives in a sound condition, is possibly be— cause the atmospheric conditions at the time of the two shipments were en- tirely different. One shipment may have been injured by the pickers, and        at the time of packing the weather was dry, while in a short time the condi- tions may be entirely different, and a lot of fruit injured in a similar manner to the ﬁrst lot may show a heavy de- cay. The relation between the climat- ic conditions here at the time of har- vesting and the decay conditions upon arrival on the market is something we want to investigate further. How much good may be accomplished by blowing air over the fruit, I do not know. Dr. Phillips—I would like to ask what the gentleman thinks about using the brush. Mr. Tenny—If your fruit is not dirty, do not brush it. Do not handle your oranges any more than is abso- lutely necessary. If they do not need washing or brushing, don’t do it. They may be washed or brushed probably without serious damage, but make a practice of handling your fruit just as little as is possible. I know of no wash yet discovered that will kill the spores of the decay fungus and at the same time not injure the fruit. This fungus is the same that causes the blue mold on bread and other things, so the spores are ever present. It is not a parasite. it is a saprophyte; that is. it lives on dead tissues. It will not live on a live, healthy orange. Mr. Gibbs—VV hat class of labor do you depend on in California for picking oranges? Mr. Tenny—JThey have the Japanese, Chinese, Mexican and hoboes. I realize that you have hard labor conditions here in Florida, but we had this same thing to meet in California. But let me ask you this. If all your orange trees were transformed in a night to peach trees, wouldn’t you gather the entire peach crop without punching them or dropping them? Wouldn’t you? Mr. Hart—This seems to be an ex- perience meeting. Mr. Skinner was speaking about the question whether we could overcome the careless picking or not, and I would offer one suggestion which I got from Mr. Stevens in regard to that matter that has been of great help to me. That is, to have all your ﬁeld pickers have a piece of chalk""and put their numbers on the boxes. When it comes into the packing house, if there is any injury to the fruit that has been picked, you can identify the picker who did that work; then, of course, you can speak 'to your foreman and have him see that the trouble is corrected or the picker discharged. Where you have care- less pickers (and they will get careless if not closely watched) they think that their fruit goes in with all the rest so you can- not identify it, and consequently they take little pains. The next point is about the current of air in the packing house. I can take an orange and with my thumb nail cut through the cuticle clear around the or- ange and put it up on a beam and it will dry up and the wound will become air- tight. It can go into the market, if the conditions are fairly good, after it has left my packing house, in good shape. I believe a current of air is very import- ant in a packing house, and if you can sweep a dry current of air through, it will heal those wounds. Now, about the moisture in the atmo- sphere. If the fruit gets cold during the night, and the morning comes up bright and warm, the orange does not warm up as quickly, and the warm air deposits        89 its moisture on the oranges and makes them wet. I have my packing house so built and arranged that I can close it up entirely. If the night has been cold and _ the days are warm I close it up early in the day and keep my oranges dry until packed. If I open a window or a door, even for a few minutes, the oranges are wet. As to the picking boxes, to avoid too deep a drop, I would have my ﬁeld boxes shallow.-- I would not have them as deep as some do. For the picking receptacle I would not use a bag. There may be less danger of injury from dropping, but you can tell your men to put them into any receptacle without a drop. When they put them into a bag they are climb- ing over the tree. It is a thorny tree, and they cannot help but get the bag against the thorns and branches of the tree, or thumping it against the ladder. There is a gentleman here, I think, who invented a metal receptacle, so that you can stoop down and allow the oranges to slide though the lower end without any drop. I believe we can pick into these picking baskets safely. They are the best of any kind that I have found, when of the correct shape. The baskets are made by the Wakeﬁeld Rattan Company in East Boston. I have paid all the way from $1.00_ to $2. 50 for them.  Member What size of basket is most desirable i“ Mr. Hart—I think those that hold about half a box, fairly deep, but not wide from the body outward. The out- side should be higher than that next to the picker. Now, about brushing and washing. I do not believe you can put your fruit in really ﬁrst-class shape with a brush, unless you have water connected with it someway. I wash mine particularly on account of the ﬂy-specked fungus which gives the fruit a little cloudiness. Fruit shipped without has not such a tempting appearance, but that which has been wash- ed meets more the demands of the very best trade and looks like pure gold. If you run a brusher over a rotten orange, you are apt to inoculate every bristle. I do not think that you can get satisfactory results without using water. To put the fruit on the market in the best possible condition, I think it must be washed. I think more and more will come to that conclusion and adopt the washer, and there is at least one washer on the mar- ket that will do it in ﬁne shape and with- out injury if properly handled. Out of my grove this year we lost simply one box of oranges from the whole packing. The lot in which that was, was shipped under extremely severe conditions after it left my hands. This year I shipped until the middle of March. I speak of this to show you that washing does not injure the fruit; if anything, it is of beneﬁt. I 'have taken fruit picked by the same man, put half of them through the washer and the other not, and stored them away in the'packing house and left them there for six or eight weeks, and in each test the unwashed fruit gave away ﬁrst. Mr. Tenny—I would like to ask Mr. Hart if his orange crop was a peach crop, if there would be any bruises on it when it was shipped. Mr. Hart—Not if I could help it; nor are there any on any oranges if I could help it. I am especially particular about that, and not only have my pickers to be careful, but when the fruit goes into the        90 washer there is not an orange goes through, but that there has been a ﬁnger, thumb or eye on 'the calyx, and no long stem goes in. If there is a puncture in that fruit, that fruit is laid aside, every orange is examined again by the grader, and all found injured in any way are dis- carded. Mr. Gibbs—Do you use any mechani- cal agency, such as potash? Mr. Hart—Up to this year I used soap, but this year I have not used any at all and found the results equally as good. I prefer soft water, though I use some pump water. I prefer soft water, and think the oranges can be washed without soap successfully. Mr. Julian—Could you put up ﬁve cars of fruit and do this? Mr. Hart—\Vell. yes, sir; I would wash every orange. Of course, it is pret- ty nearly impossible for the very large shipper to give the careful handling to the fruit that a smaller shipper can, but I would do it just as nearly as I could, anyway, or sell off a part of the grove and get the same or a little better income by giving more care to the balance. From the drying rack they go into the drying crates. These in my packing house, are made ﬁve by six feet and set on a bearing that allows of tipping to run the fruit to either end. The oranges are never two deep when curing. I do not intend to ship in less than forty-eight hours after my fruit is picked; a little longer is just as good. By that time in- jured fruit shows up and is culled out more easily and surely. Report of the Committee on Fertilizer and Irrigation. By E. S. Hubbard, Chairman. M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: In considering the question of fertil- izers I shall pass by the question of sources and percentages of the necessary elements, and devote my time to some of the problems of application and effects. An immense amount of valuable and often contradictory facts can be gathered on these questions, and it seems almost im- possible to draw any exact conclusion on the subject, except that each individual user of fertilizers should strive to use the formula or mixture that will give the best average results under the varying climatic conditions his crop and soil are subject to. It is needless to say that the past winter has been the driest in the memory of the oldest inhabitants. and I will use the Irish potato crop grown in my vicinity for a few illustrations. It has been demonstrated that the grasses transpire through their foliage between 500 and 600 times their dry weight of water in making their growth, and I estimate that Irish potatoes use        91 between two and three inches in perfect- ing the crop. As the evaporation in a season of av- erage warmth and sunshine is doubtless fully as much more a minimum rainfall of between ﬁve and six inches must be registered, provided it is well distributed over the growing period, and no fall is so great as to run off in the drainage ditches. Measured by the Weather Bureau rain guage, the rainfall the past winter was as follows: November, .06 inches; De- cember .44; january .47; February 1.07; March .96. The total during the grow- ing months of January, February and March being just two and one-half inches, mostly in small showers that wet in very little, the greatest fall being just one inch on February 5th. The soil was already dry from the only one-half inch com- bined rainfall of November and Decem- ber, and the evaporation owing to the unusual number of warm, sunshiny days was greater than the average. The rain- fall, therefore, was less than half what was necessary for an average crop, while the crop averaged about two-thirds; the deﬁciency of rainfall having been some- what made up by the subsoil water rising by capillarity towards the surface. I noted exceptions, however, that were interesting. New Year's eve one man had over two acres of seed dropped by hand in ridges split by a bull tongue, so that the fertilizer mixed in the soil was practically exposed. That night there was a shower of .05 inches, and the man woke in fear and trembling lest his seed should freeze before morning. He covered it early next day with a disc ridger and harvested 45 barrels per acre, the average annual yield being about 40 .latter months being 9.48. barrels. This .05 inches of rain, there? fore, by dissolving his fertilizer and sur- rounding his seed with wet soil nearly doubled his yield over an adjoining ﬁeld planted two days earlier. Another man had his fertilizer in the opened ridges exposed to two showers, December 20th and 21st, aggregating .29 inches, and harvested 35 barrels per acre. Another man irrigated with an artesian well running the water in ditches between his lands which are some forty feet wide, and harvested ﬁfty barrels per acre. Later planted potatoes are usually more proliﬁc, and some irrigated ﬁelds at Has— tings are reported as yielding 80 barrels per acre, while newly broken, unirrigated ﬁelds were not worth digging. This illustrates the advantages of dis- solving fertilizers and irrigation in dry seasons; but, on the other ‘hand, the prob- lem of very wet seasons is equally serious. ~ The previous winter the rainfall was 1.42 inches in November, 3.54 in December, 3.72 in january, 3.51 in February, and 2.25 for March; the total for the three There was much cool, cloudy weather with small evaporation, and the rainfall was twice what the potato crop needed._ This sea- son, nitrate or soda applied to the mix- ture before planting was undoubtedly nearly all lost, and similarly to other seasons. the crop was so slow growing and maturing. I judged large percentages of the potash and phosphoric acid leach- ed also. I therefore sent a sample of soil to Prof. Blair for test tube experi- ments of leaching. The soil was about one foot deep in the test tube. and the ﬁrst application of four inches of water leached 37.8 per cent. of the soluble phos- phoric acid. The second application of        three inches of water leached 15.8 per cent., and the third application of three inches leached 6.9 per cent.; a total for ten inches of water of 60.5 per cent. of the small amount of soluble phosphoric acid mixed with the test soil. The ex- periment with sulphate of potash was even more striking. The ﬁrst four inch ap- plication of water leached 67.3 per cent., or over two-thirds of the potash; the sec- ond of three inches 17.3 per cent., and the third of three inches, 6 per cent.; a total for the ten inches of water of 90.6 per cent. of the sulphate of potash mixed in the test tube soil. Now, the condition of fertilizers covered in a ridge of soil is not half so favorable to leaching as these test tube experiments, and when these soluble salts are diffused through the soil, the humus must hold more of the atten- uated solution, yet, at the same time, when the soil is fully saturated with rain and the water table gradually sinks be- low the surface, a large percentage of the soluble fertilizers must be carried with it. If we lose half as much fertilizer as was leached in the experiments, it is a most serious loss and drawback to har- vesting good crops. If we only knew when a wet season was coming, we would apply our fertilizers on the installment plan, or when a dry season was coming we would apply soluble fertilizers in ad- vance; but undoubtedly the safest plan from lack of this knowledge is to apply the less soluble fertilizers and have in reserve an irrigation plant with which to meet the emergency of drought. In this, however, the individual must work out the problem; according to his peculiar needs, or average the good sea- sons with the bad to determine proﬁt or loss. In fruit tree fertilizing, especially if the sod method is used part of the year, soluble chemical fertilizers are a neces- sity, as they will dissolve without evapo— ration or loss. Nitrate of soda is of ex- treme solubility, and sulphate of ammonia probably leaches about as fast as phospho- ric acid. Broadcast applications to or- ange trees, for instance, which have a healthy and unlacerated system of ﬁbrous roots, may be depended upon unless rain- fall is excessive, to be practically all available for plant growth. DISCUSSION. Mr. Wakelin—Let us hear from the gentleman who has Mr. Chase’s property in charge. Mr. Hoard—The pump we are using at Chase & Company’s grove is of simple construction and great capacity and is en- tirely different from any I have ever seen used in this state. It consists of a wood- en box two feet square inside and eighteen feet high, with a steel shaft running through the center from top to bottom. This shaft has a water wheel at the bot~ tom end and another wheel of the same kind] in the middle and an eight inch pul- ley on the top end which is connected with the engine by an eight inch belt. The box stands on end in the edge of the lake where the water is about three feet deep. The lower water wheel is so con- structed that when revolving rapidly it raises the water to a height of seven and one-half feet where the upper wheel catch- es it and carries it out at the top of the box. This gives us an elevation of ﬁfteen feet above the lake and six feet above the highest point in the grove and con- siderable pressure. From the top of the pump the water runs through a ten inch        93 terra cotta pipe across the grove from east to west. This pipe is cemented 'to- gether and buried undler ground and has a ﬁve inch outlet every 90 feet, which may be opened or closed as desired. From these ﬁve inch openings the water is conducted through ﬁve inch galvanized iron pipes to all parts of the grove. This ﬁve inch pipe is in ten foot lengths and is connected in the same manner as stove pipe. We can run four lines of this ﬁve inch pipe at once, or if we are short of piping, we use three lines and run the fourth opening into open furrows. We can run ﬁve of these furrows from one opening, or if we used the furrow system alone we could run twenty furrows at one time. These furrows are about eight inches wide and two to three inches deep and 500 to 600 feet long. This will give you an idea as to the capacity of the pump: We commenced using this irri- gation plant about March Ist, and kept it going every day for over two months. As a result, we will have twice as many or- anges as we had last year. and in all probability three times as many as we would have had this year without irriga- tion. In other words, an increase of at least 5000 boxes over last year. Member—What kind of land is it? Mr. Hoard—Hammock land; porous and thirsty. Mr. Griﬁing—How many gallons per minute do you get? Mr. 1Hoard—J have never ﬁgured that out, but a man from California estimated very it at 120 miner’s inches as they measure water out there. He says this irrigation plant in California would be worth $100,- 000. Member—What is the cost of that plant? Mr. Hoard—I cannot give the exact cost, but it is a much cheaper system than those of like capacity in general use in this state. I believe I would be safe in saying that the whole cost did not exceed $1500.00. The pump alone cost about $150.00 in New Orleans. Mr. Griﬁing—He speaks about irriga— tion in open ditches. \Ne have always had! the idea that we had to pipe the water to get it over Florida sand, therefore con- sidered irrigation too expensive for practi~ cal purposes. The past season, we start- ed pumping water in open ditches or furrows and ﬁnd that all it is necessary to do is to get the water to the highest point from which we have no trouble‘in running it from 500 to 700 feet. The cost is so low that almost any planter can do it. A pipe line sufﬁciently large to de- liver 60 to 70 gallons per minute. 1600 to 1800 feet long ought not to cost over $700.00 or $800.00. This is exclusive of pumping plant. This line in this climate can be simply strung out on top of the ground and moved as occasion demands, thus being able to irrigate a large area with it from one source of supply. A gridiron of pipe lines in the ﬁeld or grove is not necessary for practical, efﬁcient and economical irrigation.      Lime as a Remedy for Acid Soils. By A. w. Blair. (Florida Experiment Station.) Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlcmenf Before taking up directly the relation of lime to acid soils, it may be well ﬁrst, to refer to the amount of lime in differ- ent soils, the ease with which it is wash- ed out, etc., and discuss very brieﬂy the functions of lime in agriculture. Calcium, which is one of the elements of lime, is found in the ashes of all plants, and some lime is found in practically all soils. As naturally found in soils, lime exists in combination with other groups of elements; for example as calcium phosphate (phosphate of lime), cal— cium carbonate (limestone), calcium silicate, etc.; and from these com- pounds it is dissolved by soil waters and taken up by plants. THE AMOUNT OF LIME IN SOILS. According to analyses made by the Florida Experiment Station, the aver- age amount of lime in a number of sam- ples of soil taken on the Florida East Coast, between Lemon City and El- dred. is .012 per cent., and taking the weight of an acre foot (the soil on one acre t0 the depth of one foot), to be 4,000,000 pounds this would give us 496 pounds of lime, or approximately 1-4 ton to the acre-foot. The average amount of lime in samples of soil rep- resenting Orange, Hillsboro, and De- Soto counties is .028 per cent., which is equivalent to 1,120 pounds, or a little over 1-2 ton to the acre-foot. Many soils in the humid regions of the United States contain from .2 per cent. to .4 per cent. of lime and if we take the aver- age of these, .3 per cent., and the weight of an acre—foot of these soils as 3.500,- 000 pounds, we ﬁnd that they contain 5 1-4 tons of lime to the acre-foot, which is twenty—one times the amount in the East Coast soils. Snyder gives the av- erage amount of lime in 200 fertile soils as 2.16 per cent., equivalent to 37 4-5 tons per acre-foot, which is approxi- mately 150 times the amount in the East Coast soils, and 67 1-2 times the amount in the samples representing Or- ange, Hillsboro and DeSoto counties. It is evident from the foregoing that many of the Florida soils contain com- paratively small quantities of lime. The same is true, in a measure, of other bases, as magnesium, potassium, iron, etc. This is to be expected where 8 soil is composed so largely of sand. LIME EASILY WASHED OUT OF THE SOIL- Undoubtedly there was a time when these same soils contained much more lime than at present, but through years of cultivation and leaching it has been lost. The amount removed by crops each year, though small in most cases, must not be lost sight of, especially where no part of the crop is returned to the soil. In addition to this loss there is a constant leaching going on which depletes the soil of its lime. From an examina- tion of the composition of drain-waters from unmanured land, it has been        95 shown that in all such waters lime is the ' ingredient most abundantly leached out, and the same has been shown to be true of the waters of some of the world’s largest rivers. Reade, in his treatise on Chemical Denudation in Relation to Geological Time, calculates that 143 1-2 tons of lime carbonate are annually removed by solution from each square mile of land in England and “’ales, and the average amount remov- ed annually from each square mile of the earth’s surface is about 50 tons. SOILS OF LIMESTONE ORIGIN MAY BE DEFI- CIENT IN LIME. It is commonly believed that soils of limestone origin are rich in lime, but this is not neceSsarily the case. The relative ease with which limestone dis- solves in carbonated waters partly ac- counts for this fact. An instance has been cited where two soils were thought, by the owner, to be rich in lime. derived! from. lime-stone rock, but while the parent rock in one case con- tained 92.6 per cent carbonate of lime, and in the other 91.3 per cent., the soils contained only 3.28 per cent. and .40 per cent.. respectively. In another in— stance. the parent rock contained 30 per cent. carbonate of lime, and the result- ing soil .14 per cent. THE FUNCTIONS OF LIME IN AGRICULTURE. Although all plantsrequire lime, it is not usually regarded as a fertilizer in the sense that phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen are, since it usually ex- ists in the soil in quantities far in excess of the actual food requirements of the plant. (Among the other elements which are required by plants, but which exist in the soil in quantities quite sufﬁ- cient for their requirements, may be mentioned iron, sulphur, magnesium, and sodium). However, there may be rare instances where the soil has been so thoroughly exhausted of its lime that an application of this material would be of value from the standpoint of a fer- tilizer. As we have just seen, lime has a part to play in building up the plant. This is shown by the fact that calcium, one of the elements of lime, is found in all plant ashes. This may be termed its physiological function. Physically, lime improves the condi- tion of the soil; if it be a clay soil it becomes more mellow, and is more eas- ily drained and cultivated; if it be a san- dy soil the lime acts as a cementing Material, binding the grains together, thus lessening the loss of water and plant food by percolation. Chemically, lime aids in rendering more available, elements of plant food which are locked up \in the soil and are unavailable to the plant; especially, is this true of potash. In the processes of the nitriﬁcation of organic compounds, nitrates are formed, and if no base is present to unite with these, they are easily lost by leaching ; however, if lime be present, they will unite with the calcium of the lime, and in this form, calcium nitrate, they are readily available as plant food. Lime hastens the decomposition of organic matter, and aids in the formation of ammonia and other nitrogen compounds from this or- ganic matter. A function of lime which we have been slow to recognize, but which nev- ertheless is an important one. is its power to correct acidity, or sourness, in soils. due partly at least to the pres- ence of organic acids. Such soils are        now known to be quite general, even where the land is high and well drained. These soils are unfavorable to the growth and development of nitrifying organisms, and as a consequence the pro- cesses of nitriﬁcation would tend to cease. Further, the tendency of these organic acids would be to attack such bases as are present in the soil, and if iron be one of these bases, salts of this metal would be formed, and these salts would prove injurious to micro-organ- isms, and possibly also to the tender rootlets of the plant. It is believed by some that lime aids in the production of root hairs, and that by this means the absorption of potash is encouraged. IS THIS CONDITION OF son. ACIDITY A GENERAL ONE? If then there is a tendency under some conditions, to the formation, in the soil, of organic acids, the questions which will naturally present themselves to those interested in agriculture and horticulture are: To what extent are the soils with which I am concerned thus affected, how may I recognize such a condition, and has lime proved an efﬁ- cient remedy? Perhaps the most ex- haustive work along this line has been done by Wheeler and his associates, of the Rhode Island Experiment Station. For something like twelve years they have been working on this problem, and they have shown beyond a doubt, that the sandy soils of Rhode Island do very generally give an acid reaction; and they have further shown, as will be pointed out more fully later, that lime is an efﬁcient remedy. Hilgard has noted a similar condition in the sandy upland soils of Mississippi and other southern states, and earlier, Ruﬂin call- ed attention tO extensive tracts of that‘ character in Virginia. French investi- gators have mentioned large areas of sandy soil in Brittany, Limousin, and other sections of France, as distinctly acid; and in German writings refer- ence to sandy, sour soils is not wanting. Hilgard in speaking of sour soils writes as follows: “The-acid reaction characterizing the ulmic substances, is also characteristic of many woodlands, notably in the United States of the soils of the long-leaf pine region of the Cot- ton States, both upland and lowland, as well as of many deciduous forests in northern climates. Hence, liming, whether artiﬁcial or natural, effects a most notable improviement together with a marked change of vegetation in these lands.” Previous to the work of Wheeler, Hartwell, and others, it was generally considered, in America at least, that only low wet lands, or those that were largely made up of muck, were subject to the sour or acid condi- tions; but we now know, beyond a doubt, that in many places, upland and well drained soils do show a decidedly acid reaction. The question as to how we shall recognize this condition is not al- waysthe simplest. It may sometimes be recognized by the character of the vegetation, or the crops grown on it, but the surest way is a test of some kind. The one most generally used is the litmus paper test, though this is not always satisfactory, since it gives us no very deﬁnite idea of the degree of acidi- ty, and undoubtedly fails in some in- stances, to indicate an acid condition which really does exist. And here it may be said that our knowledge of methods of determining soil acidity is        97 very general. Even the best soil chem- ists are not agreed upon a uniform method, although a number of methods have been proposed and are being tried in various laboratories. When such methods are perfected, as they ulti- mately will be, we can determine the exact acidity of any soil and then cal- culate to a nicety the amount of lime required to neutralize this acidity. Un- til such methods are perfected, investi- gators and agriculturists will have to content themselves with using tenta- tive methods and with ﬁeld trials, using different quantities until the right amount is found for the different class- es of soils. One thing, however, seems deﬁnitely settled, and that is that we must recognize the fact that an acid condition in the soil is more generally prevalent than has heretofore been be- lieved to be the case. \‘VI-IAT CAUSES THIS ACIDITY.P In wet locations where large quanti- ties of organic matter undergo decay, enormous amouts of humus accumu- late as a result of the decomposition. Such humus is said to be usually, though not always, in an acid state. The acidity is naturally dependent upon the lack of bases with which the organic acids may combine. Until compara- tively recently little reference has been made to an injurious degree of acidity from such causes, in upland or well drained soils. That a dangerous degree of acidity may and often does exist in such soils is now well recognized. We have, however. been slow to recognize this fact, and on this account, no doubt, we have often attributed the failure of crops to cold, poor germination of seeds, drought, excessive rains, attacks of insects or fungi, which should have been attributed to soil acidity. The formation of organic acids by the decomposition of organic materials in soils deﬁcient in bases, would then seem to be a reasonable explanation, in part ~ at least, for the existence of acid soils. WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS or AN ACID CON- DITION IN THE sOIL? \Ve cannot answer this question in full; we do not know. As the subject is further studied we shall know more. IfI should say that it causes the wilt of the orange, I might be very wide of the mark, but on the other hand, no one can say absolutely that it does not cause this disease. We do, however, know some of the effects. We do know that it interferes with the processes of nitri- ﬁcation, and thus prevents the plant from getting certain food elements that it should have. We do know that in many instances clover, alfalfa, and other legumes, have failed almost entirely on acid soils, but have done well when the acid of these same soils has been neu- tralized with lime. IS LIME A SATISFACTORY CORRECTIVE? Volumes could be written showing the beneﬁcial results obtained by the use of lime on acid- soils, but here it will only be necessary to make brief reference to a few instances. The experiments con- ducted by the Rhode Island Experiment Station have shown that something like thirty-one plants, including vegetables, grasses, fruit trees, etc., are beneﬁted by the use of lime, while nine are indifferent to its use, and four are injured by it. The Maryland Experiment Station reports that most of the crops grown in that state are beneﬁted by the application of lime, and includes one—Indian Corn—in the 7     -   list of those beneﬁted, that is placed by the Rhode Island Experiment Station in the list of those that are indifferent. Veitch, of the Department of Agriculture, reports a very decided increase in the weight of clover, cowpeas, and alfalfa, on soils that were limed over those that were not limed. In fact, in the case of the alfalfa. no crop was secured on the un- limed plot; and he further shows that in no case does the yield on the plots where the acid was only partially neutralized by lime, equal the yield on those where it was completely neutralized. At the Ohio Experiment Station they have found it difﬁcult to get a good stand of clover on acid soils, the clover dying out in patches, and being supplanted by a grth of sorrel. In one case this unfavorable con- dition was aggravated by the use of fer- tilizers compounded with acid. \Vith a ton of lime to the acre they secured a lux- uriant growth of clover. The report sug- gests that a smaller quantity might have sufﬁced. Others have noted the decided improvement brought about by the use of lime on clover, alfalfa, and cowpeas, where the soil was acid, where before these crops had been a partial or total failure. The beggarweed also is a legume, and may it not be true that the difﬁculty which so many have had in getting a good stand of this crop is due to an acid condition in our soils? In this connec- tion it is of interest to note the following statement taken from the Rhode Island Experiment Station report for 1893 ; “The application of lime on our soils has en- abled us to secure a good catch of clover where it was before impossible.” ARE FLORIDA SOILS GENERALLY ACID.P No systematic study has been made of the soils of this State with reference to this particular point, but judging by tests which I have made of soils representing rather widely separated portions of the State, and by the statements of others, I feel justiﬁed in drawing the conclusion, that our upland soils are more generally acid than we have heretofore supposed them to be. That our muck soils are de- cidedly acid I think no one will question. Many of the muck soils are quite rich in nitrogen, and in addition contain some phosphoric acid and potash, and should prove quite valuable as a fertil- izer, but in many places they are under the ban, because they have been accused of ruining groves and pineapple planta- tions. It is very probable however, that it was the organic acids in the muck that 'were responsible for the damage, and if those who have thus basely slandered muck will try a liberal applica- tion of lime, and by liberal I mean enough to make a fair sample of the mixture show an alkaline and not an acid reaction. there is good reason to believe that their slander will be turned into praise. WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THIS ACIDITY IN FLORIDA sous? As was pointed out in the early part of this paper Florida soils are generally very deﬁcient in lime, and likewise in a number of other bases, and this in itself may explain, in part at least, why our soils have a tendency toward acidity. There being a scarcity of bases to neutral- ize the organic acids formed by decaying organic matter, the acid tendency prevails. Moreover, the large quantities of com- mercial fertilizers that we are constantly using undoubtedly tends to aggravate this condition. There are present in most soils hydrated silicates, and non—acid organic compounds which have a strong afﬁnity for sodium, potassium. calcium, and mag-        99 nesium. When these bases are dissolved by the soil waters, or when they are added in alkaline compounds, they immediately combine with these neutral constituents— silicates and non-acid organic compounds —and thus the soil is prevented from be- coming alkaline until the above mentioned aﬁinity is satisﬁed. This condition, while harmful to sensitive plants, is probably not so harmful as the presence of free acids or acid salts. Further than this, there is good evidence going to show that the reaction which takes place between cer- tain of these soil constituents and added chlorides and sulphates, produces positive- ly acid salts. There can be but little doubt that it is due, partly at least, to the acidity thus produced, that the injury arising from the use of chlorides and the sulphate of ammonia on neutral or acid soils is to be ascribed. It was found in experiments at the Rhode Island Experiment Station with different forms of nitrogen on acid soils. that sulphate of ammonia was pos- itively poisonous to plants when it was not used in connection with lime. When the acidity of the soil was corrected by ap- plications of air-slaked lime, the sulphate - of ammonia was beneﬁcial. This beneﬁ- cial effect is attributed to the fact that the lime restored the alkaline condition of the soil necessary to the transformation (by nitriﬁcation) of the sulphate of am- monia into nitrates, so necessary to most crops. I would not therefore, recom- mend a reduction in the amount of fertil- izers to be used, but would remedy the evil by a liberal application of lime once in two or three years, or oftener if found necessary. The causes above mentioned are gen- eral : there may also be local causes which are responsible for this acid tendency. In some parts of the State sulphur water(wa- ter containing hydrogen sulphide, H1 S) is used for irrigating purposes. Now when hydrogen sulphide gas comes in con- tact with air, the hydrogen unites with oxygen to form water; but it is also true that some of the sulphur may be oxidized to sulphuric acid, and where this system of irrigation is carried on for years at a time, keeping the ground wet during a good part of the year, the accumulations of sul- phuric acid and sulphates may reach con- siderable proportions. Under such con- ditions injury to crops may eventually be expected, unless lime is used in liberal quantities. A statement made to me re- cently by a celery grower of Sanford would seems to bear out this theory. He said that a few years ago only a few barrels of lime were used in Sanford, but that now the market could scarcely supply enough. No doubt this increased de— mand is partly due to the increased acre- age. but it is no doubt also due in part, to the fact that the growers are learning that without it they cannot get good re- sults. This same grower said that he used about a ton to the acre. Notwith- standing this fact, a test of sevenal soils at this point, his among others, showed an acid reaction. Examples of the oxidation of sulphides, with the formation of sul- phuric acid, are to be found in the vicinity of coal mines. Whole tracts of land have become pnactically sterile from having been saturated with water containing free acid and ferrous sulphate formed by the oxidation of iron pyrites. WILL THE CONDITION OF FLORIDA SOILS BE IMPROVED BY THE USE OF LIME? On this point also there has been no systematic investigation, but if the sandy, sour soils of Rhode Island and Massachu- setts, of France, England, and Germany,     0   and of Virginia and Mississippi, have re- sponded well to the use of lime, then there seems good reason to believe that the same will be true of Florida soils. De- tached instances might be given showing the value of lime on Florida soils. I have noted Bermuda grass growing luxuriantly where a mortar bed had formerly been located, and where plaster had been thrown out and ashes scattered, when only a few feet away where the soil had not been thus treated, it was difﬁcult to get the grass to grow. As already noted, the celery growers of Sanford are using large quantities of lime and say they cannot pro- duce crops without it.) Perhaps almost every one has noted the more luxuriant growth of vegetation on spots where piles of logs and brush have been burnt, and while this is perhaps due in part to the potash contained in the organic matter, it is no doubt due also to the fact that the lime in the ashes has neutralized the acid— ity of the soil. LIM E SOM ETIM ES IN] URIOUS. Excessive amounts of lime may have an injurious effect on almost any crop,- while any excess of lime whatever seems injurious to a few plants. Under some conditions, too, lime seems to favor the production of the potato scab. For these reasons it is important that judgment be used in the application of lime to the soil. If lime is used directly with sulphate of ammonia, ammonia gas will be set free and lost. It may, however, be used direct- ly with nitrate of soda and organic fer- til-izers. FORMS OF LIME TO USE. W'here the neutralization of acidity is the only object to be sought, caustic or quick lime will probably be more economi- cal, since fewer pounds are required. However, quick lime, slaked or hydrated lime, and air slaked lime, or carbonate of lime, are probably equally effective pound for pound of actual lime. Marl is a form of carbonate of lime and contains from 5 to 95 pounds of car- bonate of lime per hundred pounds of the material. A good quality of mar] would prove quite effective in correcting soil acidity, its effectiveness depending on the ﬁneness of the material. Phosphate of lime, that is phosphate rock, when ﬁnely ground has also been found effective on acid soils. This is valuable not only on account of its neu- tralizing effects on acid, but also on ac- count of the phosphoric acid which it con- tains, the phosphoric acid gradually be- coming available after having been in the soil for some time. THE LIT MUS TEST. This must be made with considerable care, else erroneous results may be se- cured. The following method if careful- ly carried out will give satisfactory results. Having secured from a drug store strips of both blue and red litmus paper, take one or two ounces of the soil to be tested, moisten in a clean glass or cup with pure vwater (water that will change the color of either paper must not be used), bringing the mass to about the consistency of thick paste. After allow-. ing this to stand about ﬁfteen minutes. part the soil in two places with a clean knife blade and insert a strip of each kind of paper, carefully pressing the soil against the paper with the point of the knife. Allow to stand for about ﬁve min- utes then remove and wash off adhering particles of soil with the pure water. If the blue paper has become red, or shows        101 red spots, the soil is acid; if the red has been turned blue, the soil is alkaline, and if neither has been changed the soil may be neutral. Do not put the ﬁngers or hand upon the end of the paper that is to be placed in the soil. DEFINITE EXPERIMENTS. T'he Experiment Station is beginning some systematic work with reference to the effect of lime on acid soils, and we hope at no distant day to be able to report some deﬁnite results. We shall be glad of the cooperation of any of the members of this society who are interested in the subject. Principles in Tree Pruning. By H. Harold Home. I” 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: To understand the underlying princi- ples of pruning, we should know some- thing of the structure of the trunk of the tree, and its branches. If we examine a cross section of the wood of an old! tree, we note in the centre, the pitch surround- ed by the heart wood. Around this is a band of sap wood and outside of all a protecting cover, the bark. just between the bark and sap-wood lies the cambium layer in which all growth takes place. From it, wood is formed on‘one side and bark on the other. WHERE A BRANCH STARTS. Branches always develop from buds and, where produced normally, the branch is formed from a bud developed the year previous. In consequence the base of the branch is generally one year younger than the part of the tree on which it grows. We commonly refer to the portion of the branch extending into the wood as a knot. This knot has its origin at the pith. If we examine a section cut through the branch and the trunk on which it grows, we will note that the grain of the knot runs to the center of the tree. From this we learn the lesson, that if for any reason the branch should die and rotting should commence, that the rot will extend along the knot into the center of the tree and there continue its work in the trunk. THE HEALING OF THE WOUND. With the removal of the branch all in- ner portions of the tree are exposed by the wound made. The bark being re- moved, the wood is laid bare and decay has an opportunity to begin its work. Every tree in healthy, active growth makes an effort to cover over the wound. The healing does not take place over the whole surface. A tiny ring, or cushion of woody tissue protected by bark, is thrown out from the cambium layer all around the wound. This is called the callus. This callus gradually shoves out, increases in size and! ring after ring of growth is     2   added until the wound is covered. If the wound is small this may be done in a single season, but if large it will take several years. . THE STUB. If a branch is cut off a few inches from the tree the cut end of the stub does not generally heal over. There is no life in it, it dies back and acts as a foreign body. In ninety-nine per cent of cases, the tree makes an effort to heal over the wound at the base of the stub. It is impossible how- ever for it to succeed as the tree cannot exert suﬁicient pressure to cut it off and the callus frequently forms a mound about its base. The stub usually disappears in time by rotting oFf and the result is a knot hole. The ﬁrst principle in pruning is to leave no stubs. KNOT HOLES. When the stub rots away, leaving a knot hole, the rain enters, sand and dirt are blown into it. Sufﬁcient soil is fre- quently formed for plants to grow in it. Everything favors the extension of the rotting process. The ‘heartwood in the trunk and branches sometimes even down into the roots is destroyed. A strong wind blows the tree over, and we wonder why it fell. The rotting of the wood is not due to chemical or atmospheric action. It is due to minute plants—fungi and! bacteria. These live and grow in the wood and bring about its destruction. The fruiting parts of some of the fungi are quite large. those of the shelf fungi for instance. WHERE TO CUT. We have learned that the stub is objec- tionable and injurious to the trees in that it prevents the healing process. Leave no stubs. Make the cut as close as possible to the part that is to remain and in making the cut hold the saw parallel to the branch or trunk from which the branch is remov- ed. The cut should be as smooth as it is pos- sible to make it. It heals better. TO PREVENT SPLITTING. If the branch is large and heavy, an accident often occurs in close cutting. When the branch is half cut off, its weight causes it to split and frequently the injury extends down along the trunk of the tree. This may be prevented by making a cut on the underside of the branch half way through it a foot or two out from the trunk. Then on the upper side three or four inches farther out another cut should be made half way through. The branch will drop off. The resulting stub can then be cut off where it should be. WOUND PROTECTION. A wound has been made and the inner portion of the tree is exposed. how can rotting be prevented? By covering the cut surface with something which will prevent the entrance of decay. The most desirable substance is one which will stick well, wear well and at the same time not interfere with the healing process. As a dressing for tree wounds many different materials have been used, such as shellac, grafting wax, tar and paint. Ordinary grafting wax is not good, it curls up around the edges and peels oﬁ’. A formula used by Mr. W. S. Hart is ex- cellent: One pound of resin and two ounces of tallow; melt these and mix thoroughly. Remove from the ﬁre and        ' 103 after cooling slightly, ""add slowly six ounces of alcohol and one ounce spirits of turpentine. Shellac likewise cracks and drops off; tar is likely to prevent the healing process. Of all the substances which have been used from time to time no material so nearly ﬁlls all the requirements of a wound dressing as pure lead paint made up with good oil. Sufﬁcient coloring should be added to make the paint about the color of the bark. Paint the wound as soon as it is made for no amount of paint will keep the wound sound if rotting has already be- gun. TIME TO PRUNE. It is not advisable to prune trees during the time when the sap is in active motion. At this time it is well nigh impossible to properly protect the wound; the neces- sary coat of paint will not stick to a sur- face wet with sap, which has bled from the tree. The best time to prune is during winter and early spring before growth starts. If it cannot be done then, the trees should be pruned in spring just after they are well out in the leaf. PRUNING TOOLS. Some people like to use an ax, but in the hands of the average individual it is a poor tool to use. About one man in ﬁve hundred knows how to handle it. It should be banished from the orchard and the street. In the writer’s opinion the only time that the ax should be used either on a fruit or shade tree is when it is vigorously applied just above the roots, when it is deemed advisable to remove a diseased or worthless specimen. The ax is synonymous with hacks, cuts, stubs, knotholes, rotten trunks, decayed trees and general neglect. It is opposed to good treatment, intelligent care and a true ap- preciation of the needs and nature of a tree. Banish it! Get a good pair of pruning shears, a pruning saw and knife. The dearest in price are the cheapest. Keep them sharp and with these the right sort of work can be done. DISCUSSION. Mr. Neeld—-—I think the best time to prune a tree is after the sap has fallen and the leaves have fallen. I would like to have your idea. In connection with this subject, I would like to say that our trees lost their leaves in the freeze, and when the leaves came forth again they were little bits of leaves—they never developed. That was largely because there was no moisture in the soil. There were a great many water sprouts, and they put on large leaves. Prof. \Hume—In reply to the ﬁrst ques- tion as to the best time of pruning; an old German adage says, “Prune apple trees while in the bloom.” One of the best sea- sons is after the tree comes out in full leaf, speaking of trees that drop their leaves in autumn. I do not believe in pruning when the sap is moving in the trees, when the wound is likely to bleed freely. If we prune it at that time. we cannot get our covering to stick. \Vait until the tree comes out in full leaf. Either then or prune when the tree is entirely dormant. One of the things that makes spring pruning the best. particularly if you are desirous of removing dlead wood, is that dead wood is much more easily found.     4   About those water sprouts you speak of; I have seen a good many cases where a tree had been severely injured, and these water sprouts had come out with vigorous leaves on them. I think it is a good plan to leave them there. I don’t know that I would take them off at all. Mr. Hart—It seems to me there are a few more points that we might touch up- on. Now, “water sprouts.” I would say by all means let them grow and make leaves just as quickly as you can. They furnish lungs to the trees. If it is an or- ange tree that has been cut back by a freeze, and those sprouts are sour, let them go until they get a good top on the tree, then bud and lop the tops down but don’t cut them off. The sap will ﬂow to the highest buds and these sour sprouts will, while bent to the ground, maintain the large root system and growth until we have a good sweet top there. When the buds get well started, bend them out and spread them out, making a wide tree. They may be long and slim and apparently of very little use, but bend them out and do not cut them off. The result is that you check the ﬂow of sap near the trunk. Where the sap is checked it will push out a new growth and in a little while you get plenty of fruit, the limbs become strong, other limbs surround these and you get a symmetrical tree. The orange tree will become a symmetrical tree in a few years if given a chance and do it with- out pruning to any great extent. There are a few cases where it will be well to nip in and in rare cases to cut a limb, but I think it far better to force limbs in place than to cut them off. Now, in regard to stubs. There are a few cases, perhaps, where it may be well to leave a stub for awhile. For instance, if we have a nursery tree of pretty good size and lop the top down from above the bud, when that bud is grown large enough so that you can remove that old top, it sometimes is best, I think, to cut the old! wood off leaving quite a little stub, and wait until the bud has gotten large enough and has strength so that by cut- ting the stub off close‘ just before the spring or summer growth, it will becover- ed up quickly and no serious wounds or rotten wood remain in the tree. I ﬁnd it practicable to do this in many cases where trees have been injured in some way and heavy pruning of partly dead wood has to be done before renewed growth is strong enough to cover woundls promptly. Mr. Sheppard—I have found a pretty good wound covering in coal tar. It keeps out all the water. is ﬂexible and the wounds will heal right up. Mr. Hume—In my opinion, it is a very unsafe thing to use. I have seen injury done to the trees by it, and the healing of wounds prevented by its use. Mr. Sheppard—I have seen where it has been beneﬁcial. Mr. Hume—Some people still recom— mend the use of gas tar, and the practice is still prevalent in Europe, but has never been followed to any extent in this coun- try. I have used it on oak trees and it works very nicely. On peaches and cher- ries as well as some other fruits, I would not use it. Mr. Sheppard—{It works pretty, well on orange trees. ‘ Prof. Hume—Some men I know had the experience of killing some three hun- dred trees with tar. You cannot convince them that tar is all right.               3 km (I ha. 3%. ,\. VP. mw. On .la 110 , S A S E [ R J N. I S R H e. S m I. .118 ""am I '0 my .3“. Vol ‘ e _h T This Tree.

I pruned two or three years with a saw and used the long clippers and the hand pruner. I think I have used] every outﬁt that any pruner ever did use, and I must say I like an axe the best. You can take a pruning axe and grind it down very thin, and then after you have had practice enough you can cut exactly in the right place. Always strike from the under side of the limb. I am heartily in favor of the axe system over any saw. A saw wound will hold more water than an axe wound. It is the water in the wound that causes the rot. It is very much quicker also.",,
Report of Committee on Ornamentals.,Mrs. E. S. Hubbard.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Let us imagine that we have chosen our new home. Our house and buildings are ﬁnished and our grounds are leveled and ready for planting. We have selected a spot in middle Florida where the temperature occasional- ly touches the frost mark, and where in extreme seasons, ice is formed. \Ve, therefore, must use plants and shrubs that will thrive in our peculiar sit- uation. The ﬁrst consideration is our lawn. St. Augustine grass will prove most satisfactory, for it resists cold weath- er. When frequently clipped, it forms a mat of bright green, and after a severe freeze, it soon regains its freshness. It is planted by slips and roots and is easily destroyed when desired. Bermuda grass thrives best on dry soil, but is browned by frost in winter and is hard to eradi- cate. Our piazzas are furnished withsupports for vines. Strips of poultry netting three feet wide, are, at intervals, set up— right two or three feet from the ground, extending to the eaves. With this ar- rangement, the beloved vines can be en— joyed to the utmost, without injuring buildings or interfering with the painter in his work. First in our list is Rhyncospermum iasminoides. Its dark, ever green foliage forms a thick screen during the winter. In April, its profusion of dainty white blossoms, transforms it into a drapery of lacework. If allowed to do so, it will reach the highest chimney with its trail of graceful fragrance. Akebia qu-inata, its characteristic foliage and its clusters of ruddy purple blossoms lasting from early March until May, must not be forgotten. Chinese Wistaria, if kept in subjection by persistent pruning, will give a wealth of great, fragrant, purple pendants.     6   The English honeysuckle must not be mistaken for the paler and rampant va- riety which will not be satisﬁed with its own space in the border, but which will not be content unless it overruns everything within reach and even usuips the grass plot and ruins the lawn. The English honey- suckle, on the contrary, seldom suckers and needs only occasional pruning. It will reward the grower with bloom and delicious perfume throughout the year. The bark is red and the foliage dark green. The buds are deeply roseate without, and the ﬂowers are pure white within, turning to cream color and ﬁnally to a dull orange. In the early, dewy morning, when the perfume of this honey- suckle mingled with that of the Rhynoos- perm-um and Magnolia ﬂoat through the open windows, the combination is ex— Quisite beyond description. We must not tarry too long with the vines, but mention in brief succession, Bignonia venusta, that glorious vine with its masses of ﬂame colored trumpet- ﬂowers; another variety with wax-like ﬂowers of white and canary. and still an- other rightly named the Gloria, with large throated blossoms of delicate lavender, veined with purple. These vines are har- dy, enduring any cold which visits this section, and also thriving during the heat of the long summer. Many tropical vines can be successful- ly grown here. We must expect them to be cut back, sometimes, by cold weather. They spring up again as if by magic, and seem even beneﬁted by the disaster. Among these are Clerodendron Balfouri, Antigonon leptopus, the showy Rosa de Montana from Mexico, the climbing Alla- manda with great golden ﬂowers, so very noticeable at Miami; Thunbergia frag- rans with snowy blossoms and graceful twining stems, and Bougainvillea, Thun- bergia grandiﬂora, a very elegant climber, has large, white-throated. sky hue ﬂowers and handsome foliage. Lastly, I will rec- ommend Cobea Scandens and its large purple bells always in bloom. Its method of climbing is unique, for it attaches itself to supports by clinging tendr-ils growing at the ends of its compound leaves. Our list of shade and ornamental trees begins with the evergreen oaks which need neither praise nor description. Fol- lowing the oaks are Magnolia grandiﬂora, lo‘blolly and sweet bay, umbrella tree, syc- amore, one of our grandest native trees; Vitex or chaste tree, with purple spikes and whose palmate leaves smell of laven- der; the starry leaved sweet gum, Ilex or American holly; scarlet maple whose bril- liant red seed pods appear in midwinter; and lastly the Liriodendron tulipfera, whose oddly cut leaves and large, showy. tulip-shaped ﬂowers have given it its name of tulip-tree. Cornus canadensis, or white ﬂowered dogwood is most charming with its level masses of foliage and bloom. It savors of the picturesque having a marked indi- viduality. In the same class will be found Camellia Japonica, so prized for its large perfect ﬂowers, and Azalea Indica, whose wondrous display of lovely blossoms of an inﬁnite variety of shadings and col- ors is a marked feature of northern Eas- tertide. Magnolia fuscata and some va- rieties of Magnolia from China and Ja— pan which are 'deciduous, and whose ﬂow- ers are richly colored with rose and pur- ple, are very desirable. Olea fragrans or sweet olive mus-t be included. for the unctuous perfume of its small clustered        white bloom is unique and delicious, and it will group well with Judas tree or red bud and Gardenia fragrans both single and double. The trees and shrubs which I have chosen are perfectly hardy and will give entire satisfaction. Among some tropical shrubs which grow again after frosts, are Pleroma pur- purea. Tabernamontana, night bloom- ing jasmine and the charming group of Hibiscus. We associate palms with the tropics. The following species, however, have been thoroughly tested and! ,we can safely plant them; Cocos Australis, S'abal palmetto, our own cabbage palm, and also another hand-some variety from Cuba, Chamoerops Excelsa, Chamoerops humilis, Phoenix Canariensis and Phoe- nix sylvest'ris. Lamnia Borbonica, and Phoenix dactylifera, our date of com- merce, are sometimes nipped by severe freezing but we must risk something for their beauty and in the latter for its fruit. These palms will make trees; some of them growing to a height of 40 feet or more. They, with many others, are now growing in the grounds of the late E. H. Hart at Federal Point. We must not overlook some very charming acaulescent palms and their kindred. Chamoerops hystrix or needle palm growing wild in many parts of Florida and also near Savannah, Ga., must be planted in the shade of tall palms, and it will then send out a host of glossy leaves with long slender stems. admirable for cutting. Cycas revoluta cannot be sur- passed when well grown. Cycas circin- alis, a more tender variety, is exquisitely beautiful. ' Some fourteen years ago, in June, we 107 made a trip .on the St. Johns river on the steamer “City of Jacksonville.” As we went into the brilliant light from the out- side darkness, we were dazzled by a vision of color and} beauty. On a table in the cen- ter of the salon, where the light fell upon them from above, was placed a wonder- fully beautiful arrangement of aquatics. In the center was a large bowl of great glowing blood red water lilies, wide open and in bud—Nymphea Zanzibarensis, the large night blooming water lily from Zanzibar. On either side, and around, were bowls ﬁlled with smaller blos- soms; pale blue, white, yellow and blush, all with foliage. A stand, near by, was devoted to a single specimen. It was ﬂoating in a large bowl. Its abundant, shining, dark green leaves and spikes of buds and open ﬂowers, lilac shaded with purple and a dash of yellow. attracted universal attention. Mr. Fuller, who was taking this charm- ing collection from his home, Edgewater on the St. Johns, to his summer home in New York. told us that this interesting plant which he viewed with pride, was Eichornia crassipes, a new, rare aquatic, and that he had paid $10.00 for a small plant some time before. It had, however, increased so enormously that he had thrown several cart loads of it into the St. Johns river, and he wondered if it would grow there. You doubtless recog- nize that plant, which so greatly admired by some, is heartily detested by others— the water hyacinth. The most fascinating of all garden beds, our water lily pond, is made by dig— ging out the earth to a depth of 2 or 3 feet and cementing the excavation. Put a layer of muck and sand at the bottom and ﬁll with water.     8   Our rose garden, to which we turn when wishing to express regard or sympa- thy with others, by sprays, or a basket perhaps of fragrant roses, must be care~ fully planned. Mrs. McCarty has given us in her report for 1905, most complete and valuable directions for planting and caring for roses. My list will include Bride and Bridesmaid, American Belle, Richmond, Andre Schwartz, Kaiserin Augusta Victoria, Madam Lambard, Pa- pa Gontier, Madam Cochet, La France both pink and white, Cecil Bruner, Duch- ess de Brabant and Magna Charta. Climb- ers Devoniensis, Gloire de Dijon, Chrome- tela or cloth of gold, Reve d’or, Madam Peary or climbing Kaiserin, Adlelia Prae- del and climbing Meteor. These roses are well adapted to our cli- mate and conditions. M'adam Lambard is “unsurpassed as a general utility rose. ' During the entire year this rose with Ce- cil Bruner and Duchess de Brabant will continue to give us ﬁne buds and ﬂowers. Even the thrip, that inveterate rose pest, has little taste for these three varieties. In our planting and arrangement we must give due attention, not only to detail but also to general and harmonious effect. From the lists which I have given, com- binations and groupings can be made of inﬁnite variety. I will close with mention of that won- drous vine, so dear to tourists and so faith- ful in its efforts to adorn the waste places as well as the gardens. The native ﬂora of Florida would lack its crowning glory in the absence of the Yellow Jessamine.",,
"Report .of Committee on Peaches, Plums and Pears.",Aubrey Frink.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have not prepared any paper on peach- es. pears and plums, for the reason that I could not get, prior to coming here, just the information that I wanted. I under- stand that Mr. Shooter is now in Europe, and] today I talked to Mr. Klemm and he has no report to make. This season has been a hard one on peaches as well as oranges. In fact, for a year they have suffered. Last year being wet, was 'hard; then coming that severe cold at Christmas time which alone would not have done so much damage, but com- bined with wet weather and succeeding dry weather, together with the April cold, has done a great deal of damage to peach- es. From information th-at I can get, it seems that the crop is very short. Some people claim that their crop will not “be more than twenty-ﬁve per cent. At some places around Lake Helen and DeLand the per cent is a little better. The trees, also suffered 'a great many offsets on ac— count of the cold, wet and drought. However. I do not think that they are in any worse shape than the oranges, which suffered by drought and cold.        Now, as far as varieties are concerned, there are four or ﬁve varieties that do well and are a good market kind. Perhaps the one entitled to ﬁrst place is the Jewel. That is planted more largely, perhaps, than all others combined. Following that is the Waldo. Those two peaches are very similar; in fact I doubt if you could tell much, if any, difference either in size, quality or appearance, except that the Jewel is a triﬂe larger and is also from ten days to two weeks earlier. This is one of the arliest varieties we have, making it on that account a desirable market variety. It is also a free stone. Then come the varieties of the Bidwell- Peento type; Bidwell Early, Maggie, Su- ber and} Yum Yum, which are very similar in appearance, character and tree growth and time of ripening, being right along with the Jewel. These are cling stones. The Peento and Honey types are far preferable, in fact, the only ones that give us our market peaches. Those of mixed strain like the Jewel and Waldo, also seem to be preferable. The Peento seems to be a more vigorous grower, making a longer lived tree than the honey. They are on a par with our native seedling trees in vigor. As far as pears go, I do not think that I have anything new to say. Pear growing is all right if you can keep out the blight, but I do not know of any remedy or any preventive. About the best thing seems to be non-cultivation. The two varieties grown most generally are the LeConte and the Keiﬂer. As far as plums are concerned, there is a general opinion that they do not do well in Florida; but this is a mistake for there are several varieties of plums that do well. The Excelsior was the original one intro- 109 duced some twelve years ago. This is a cross between some variety of the Japan— ese type and the Southern Chicksaw type and bears very well. There is also the Terrell plum. This is very similar to the Excelsior; a triﬂe larger and I think of a little better ﬂavor. Then there is a yel- low variety, the Queen; also the Howe, very similar to Excelsior; and a new va- riety called Miller, which is later than any of the others, but which is one that I think will succeed very well in Florida. The Excelsior has been tried and proven very satisfactory. The others are comparative- ly new, but being similar in tree growth and of the same type, I think they will do well throughout the whole state. Mr. Hampton—“That about the Rival peach? Mr. Frink—I am not so well acquainted with that. I understand it is very similar to the Hall’s Yellow. Hall’s Yellow has not been a success commercially. It was planted a good deal a few years ago, but for some reason or other it has not made a demand. The demand for that class of peaches has fallen off very considerably. At one time we could not furnish near enough trees to supply the demand, but now we have to be careful not to over- stock ourselves. Mr. Gibbs—What is the matter with the Dorothy, or the Angel? Mr. Frink—The Dorothy is good, but for market purposes I think it is a little too late. The Angel peach is a good peach, and a pretty one—a little acid for some tastes, and perhaps a little late for the best market. It comes a little too near the season of the Georgia peach. Mr. Gibbs—What time would you think an early peach would begin to ripen? Mr. Frink—That is a little hard to      IIO   answer. The different seasons makes them ripen at different times. Mr. Gibbs—VV hen I left home on Saturday, the Angel peach was almost in full, brilliant coloring. I think that is a little early. Mr. Hart—The Suber, how about that? Mr. Frink—That is one of the best and should have been included in the list of the Bidwell varieties. Mr. Penny—I would like to ask about what time would be the best to plant the Excelsior plum. Mr. Frink—That question might cover a good many different kinds of trees-— generally, the late fall or early winter. I consider December the best month. Member—I have an Excelsior plum tree in my yard which has borne well for four successive years, but for the last two years it 'has been rather shy. I have ex- cused this, though, on account of the ex- treme weather conditions. I have some other trees of different varieties of plums that have not given me a quart of plums in twenty years. The Excelsior is the one that has always given the best satis- faction, in my experience. Mr. Longwood—Do you know any- thing about the Satsuma plum? Mr. Frink—It is very erratic. Some report great satisfaction while with others the results are unfavorable. Around Tampa, I understand they do fairly well. It is something like the Kelsey. I would not advise planting it generally. Mr. Penny—I would like to ask the gentleman who said! his Excelsior plum did well, what kind of land he has. Member—It runs about four feet of yellow sand. After that, clay phosphate below, and water on an average of ﬁfteen feet. Mr. Penny—D0 you think they would do well on low land? Member—I have tried all kinds of land, but I don’t know that I can tell you exactly what the solution is for the plum problem. It seems to be a very erratic kind of a tree, and they sometimes do well or ill for no apparent reason at all. Some graft pears on the wild! haw and say they do well. Mr. Neil—A man in my county told me to spray with the Bordeaux mixture and I would always have a good crop. Mr. VVaite—I have succeeded in bold- ing the fruit better this year than before, and I spraved with the Bordeaux. Mr. Frink—Now, if you take a peach, for instance, that is a native of a different country and bring it down here, it is al- most impossible to make it bear. Occa- sionally you can get a few fruit, but as a general proposition, it never is very suc- cessful. I think the Kelsey plum is out of its proper environment. Mr. Hudson—lHow can you get a peach that will mature later in the season, say in August? Mr. Frink—There are varieties that will do that, largely of the native Spanish type. There are several of those peaches; just now I do not recall any of the names. It is hard to get them to bear so well when budded as when they are seedlings; that is, speaking of the Spanish type. Probably one of the best here is the Estel- la, which is very late and, under favorable conditions, bears well.",,
III Strawberry Culture.,I. M. Brownlee.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The soil furnishes anchorage for the roots of the plants, and a reservoir for food and moisture. It makes almost no difference to the plant whether the soil be light or heavy, sandy or clay, so long as these objects are accomplished. The plant lives on the food it ﬁnds in the soil and not on the soil itself. It is true that the strawberry—like any other crop—must generally thrive best on rich sandy loam. But is this not the ideal soil for any crop? It holds fertilizer and moisture, but is not easily puddled. It becomes sufﬁciently compact without getting hard or lumpy and it admits air. These qualities are es- sential and they can usually be had with less labor and care in sandy loam than in any other soil. Here in Bradford county you may see all kindls of soils planted to strawberries, from low stiff, to high sandy loam. and with little difference in the yield. I don’t believe there is any crop grown that is less particular than the strawberry about the kind of soil on which it is grown, not even grass. KIND OF BERRIES GROWN. There is very little discussion to be had on the berry most grown here, as the Klondyke is grown almost exclusively throughout Florida. There may be a few Lady Thompsons grown here, but very few indeed. The Klondyke was origi- nated in Louisiana some years ago. It has a very vigorous bush, free from rust or blight, and a very dark green foliage. The fruit is simply perfection, being large and exceedingly high colored, and very ﬁrm, which makes it a good shipper. This berry was introduced here about six years ago, and has held its own better than any other variety ever planted here. The Klondyke is a very proliﬁc berry. When we have anything like a good sea- son you may expect anywhere from nine- ty to one hundred and ten bushels per acre. PREPARATION OF LAND AND METHOD OF CULTIVATION. In preparing land for strawberries, it is very essential to have your ground free from grass and well pulverized, for when you make your ground up you do not want any cavities underneath the plant. It makes it difﬁcult in getting plants to live, and even if they should live over a cavity, the plant will be a shy bearer. I usually plant berries after oats; plow in the oat stubbles before the grass comes through and then keep it thoroughly disk- ed until ready to bed, which may be from july 15th to September Ist, just as you may choose. In bedding my ground, I use eight and one-half feet for bed, and put four rows of berries to the bed, make the two center rows 18 inches apart and outside rows 22 inches from center rows. The cultivating is done with a hoe and hand cultivator. Run the hand cultivator about once a week if the ground is wet. This keeps the ground loose and prevents grass from coming through. I use a horse cultivator to plow out my water furrows.     2   It is very essential to keep the ground well pulverised to prevent it from forming a crust on top and thus drying out too easily . BEST METHOD OF MARKETING. Marketing the berry crop is a very difﬁ- cult matter. Almost anyone can grow them, but when it comes to marketing them it takes one who has studied the con— ditions for several years. My method is to select one good reliable commission house in each city that I expect to ship to (I use New York, Philadelphia and Boston for my markets) and ship to him regularly. It is well to have berries on the market every day if you possibly can. Put up your berries in good honest pack- ages and mark your name on the crate and it will not take your commission man long to secure a good tracile on your fruit; one that the trade will call for. Or, if you expect to sell to buyers at your own town, it is best to put up honest packages and you will never have any trouble in selling. The buyers soon learn who puts up good berries and are always ready to buy that kind. GROWTH AND EXTENT OF INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. The strawberry industry has grown wonderfully in this state in the last few years. Ten or twelve years ago the ship- ments from this county on the heaviest days were no more than from three to four hundred bushels, while last year its heaviest day would reach ﬁve or six thousand bushels. Last year there were $9,000.00 worth of berries sold at Starke on the wharf in a single day, besides several hundred bushels shipped on con- signment. The net sales to the growers of this county last season were between $350,000 and $400,000, and there seems to be no limit to the industry. Several years ago, I thought that the market would be glutted if we grew too many berries, but last season, with our large supply of berries, there was a continued cry for more berries. DIFFICULTIES AND DRAVVBACKS OF STRAW- BERRY INDUSTRY. The principal diﬁiculty in the straw- berry industry is the drought in the sum- mer in the setting season. The plant is very delicate, and unless we have plenty of rain during the setting season it is very diﬁicult to get a stand, and in order to get a good yield we must have a good stand of nice large bushes, as a small bush can never produce the fruit a large one will. We sometimes have a drought dur- ing the picking season that also hurts us very much as it makes the fruit small and of an inferior quality. The blight gener- ally strikes us during the dry season. An insect (commonly known as the thrip) often sucks the bloom and kills it and then they work on the small berries. I have seen them ‘dlestroy an entire fruit crop. We sometimes have a late freeze that destroys a great quantity of fruit, but we can’t call this a drawback as it is most generally to our advantage as it keeps berries back nonth of here.",,
Report From Pinellas Fruit Growers’ Association.,"Mr. I. G. Julian, President.","Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: This association started here among the pineapple and then the orange growers took it up here, forming the Orange Growers’ Association some four or ﬁve years ago. We have the meetings quar- terly the ﬁrst Saturday of each month of March, June, September and December, which have proved very interesting to some sixty or eighty. Every now and then we say we must take all the orange growers in, but all of them can’t get in at the same time. I think we are on a per- manent basis and at least 50 or 75 of the orange growers would say_pmitively that we are. We ﬁnd our quarterly meetings very interesting. We generally have two sessions on the days we meet; one in the forenoon and one in the afternoon. Then, if there is any special point that we want to know more about, we call on the Ex- periment Station for that speciﬁc point and one of Prof. Rolf’s assistants comes down. I believe the Prof. himself was down here once and started to give us a 30 minute talk, but we were all so inter- ested that when he ﬁnally did look at his watch, he found he had barely time to catch his train. We meet at different points, Largo, Ozona, Clearwater, St. Petersburg, so that if it is impossible for some of the members to leave their homes, the meetings are brought to them, and it does not work a hardship on anybody. We think it is a good organization for the betterment and general diffusion of ideas. New members are coming in all the time, and I think it is now on a ﬁrmer footing than it has been for the last four or ﬁve years. We hope to make it a great good and beneﬁt. Prof. Rolfs—I can assure the meeting that this Association is a wide-awake body and as intelligent a lot of people as any- one would want to see.",,
Report From Pasadena Farmers' Club.,B. W. MeLain.,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: In response to the courteous notice from your president that the Programme Com- mittee had reserved a date for a report from the Pasadena Farmers’ Club, I now have the honor to introduce the Pasco County Fledgling. This 3—year-old Agricultural Society was born September 24th, 1904, at the residence of Mr. C. F. Gardner, on the shores of Lake Pasadena. Actuated by a common impulse of co- operation and an earnest desire to master the problems involved in agricultural pursuits, twelve gentlemen and nine la- dies organized the Pasadena Farmers’ 8       Club and elected Mr. A. Roberts, Presi- dent...\'Irs. C. F. Gardner, Secretary, and Mr. Stephen Soar, Treasurer. Monthly meetings have been held and the ofﬁcers proven so satisfactory that they have been annually re-elected; while the membership has increased from 21 to 68, with an average attendance of 30. The distinguishing feature of this club is its combinatitm of home and social in- ﬂuences with the practical and scientiﬁc discussion of the problems incident to ag- ricultural life. The ladies and children contribute most effectively to the general entertainment as evidenced by Master Butts, a sturdy 3- year-old, who at our last meeting made a happy hit of “My Country ’Tis of Thee” and “I belong to the Band, boom! boom!” The social relations are further pro- - moted by meeting in turn at the homes of members, each family bringing a basket of lunch, which is assembled by the hos- tess and spread in a home brewed dinner, which is thoroughly discussed before the purely practical and scientiﬁc subjects are introduced. “Well”, I hear you ask, “What has been accomplished P” I answer,—First, a method has been found to bind together in a coherent group those interested in the products of the soil so that their indi- vidual development reacts one upon the other, and the experience of the unit mem- ber becomes the property and knowledge of all. Second, the animated discussions and interchanges of practical experience have already developed a strength and conﬁ- denCe which will be eﬁ‘icient in originating and shaping the new projects of irrigation and culture. which must be perfected be— fore general and liberal results can be ob- tained by Florida farmers. Third, a power has been organized and a spirit developed which enables the farm- er to get into closer touch with other or- ganized workers and thinkers; and the practical and personal assistance already accorded us by members of the Agricul- tural Station has had a marked inﬂuence in awakening the interest and encourag- ing perseverence in the work. I believe that the ensuing three years will witness an unprecedented development in Pasco county. It is eminently proper, in this connec- tion, to note the intelligent, unwearying and genial spirit of its President, Mr. A. Roberts, who from its inception to the present moment has studied its interests and presided over its deliberations. This brief sketch of the origin and poli- cy of the club does not contemplate details of the practical work done or a view of the scientiﬁc and technical grounds cov- ered. I assume that the ofﬁce of presenting it has come to me because of my very ear- nest interest in all such matters rather than any practical knowledge or exper- ience of the subjects involved; and there- fore, in bringing to you this greeting from the Pasadena Farnir'rs’ Club I have at once the honor and pleasure of introduc- ing to you my associate delegates,—gen- tlemen who are not unknown to you and who. by long residence and practical ex- perience, are eminently qualiﬁed to in- form you upon every point of interest con- cerning agricultural and horticultural mat- ters in Pasco county: Dr. J. F. Corrigan, St. Leo; W. J. Ells- worth, jessamine; J. C. Carter, Dade City; J. W. Hudson, Dade City. I regret my inability to be present in person.        115 Legislative Help. Prof. Bartlett—I 'had not expected to bring this matter up at the present time. It is a matter of so much importance that several of our people have desired me to bring it before you, possibly through a committee. I have spoken to some of the older members in regard to this, and have also spoken to some of the younger mem- bers. There are three things I wish you to consider. One of the things is in re- gard to the experiment station. \Ve have an experiment station here, but we get very little beneﬁt from it, compared with what we ought to get. \Ve would like help along the line of irrigation, es- pecially the truck men and fruit growers, better than what we are getting now. We have to go up to the experiment sta- tion and bring the men dow-n, paying their expenses, and then when they have just opened a little vista to our eyes, they are gone. The people in the experiment station are dloing all they can, but they have a_lim-ited amount of money to do it with. $15,000 is all that they get. Flor- ida has never given them a dollar. Every State in the Union is allowed $15,000 through the Hatch Bill for an experiment station. I suppose our state gets $15,000 because every state is entitled to that. All through the west they are giving many dollars. In Illinois, in Wisconsin, in Nebraska. and in Kansas, they are doing great things for their agricultural experi- ment stations. \N here they put out thou- sands of dollars, they have been taking in millions. We are doing very little, and I think a sentiment should be stirred up in the state so that the matter would be taken up by our Legislature and! that it would give us for this purpose at least as much as the Government gives. I understand there is a bill before the Legislature now to give $5,000 for the Farmers’ Institute and $30,000 for build- ings needed by the Experiment Station, and I think it is the duty of every agri- culturist to see that it does not fail. Our State has great prospects in agricultural and horticultural lines, and I think we should use every means in our power to realize these prospects. The Interstate Com-merce Commission is doing a great deal for the whole coun-_ try. California has done a great dleal for itself because of its compact organization. we want to do the same. We want to go before the Interstate Commission and get them to co-operate with us. We should have a committee appointed to go before them and see that we get what we want. \Ne ought to have half the ship- ping rate we are getting now. \Ve had an appropriation from Con- gress for $5,000 last year with which to ﬁght the white ﬂy, and $10,000 this year. The State has not been doing enough. Congressman Sibley has done all that one man could do and our Congressmen Mr. Sparkman and Mr. Clark, have co-oper- ated with him and they have been able to get this $10,000. The United! States Government comes in and helps us, and we do nothing. Now, our Legislature should do something to eradicate this curse of orange culture. Let us show that we are interested ourselves and give      n6   our legislators no peace until we get some help from them: These are the three things, and I ask that you have a committee of ﬁve appoint- ed to look into these several propositions and report on them and the advisability of presenting and handling them. I put it in the form of a motion. Motion secondedt Mr. Painter—A good many members will probably remember that Mr. Hart at two different meetings put in a resolu- tion somewhat to the effect that we want- ed to get aid from the Government to help ﬁght the blight. I went to \Vash- ing’ton and presented it to Secretary Wil- son myself. He said he wanted to do all he could, but just then the appropriation was all taken up and he said “What are you doing yourselves ?” You can count on his helping you and meeting you more than half way on anything you will un— dertake that will be of beneﬁt. He also said, “If you will get your people to- gether and] show that you mean some- thing, then we will help you.” Dr. Richardson—There are some things that nobody can ﬁnd out. Mr. Painter knows that. You know that this Society has gone to the trouble time and again of preparing bills to be presented to the Legislature. Have they ever gone through? No. I do not know what be- came of them. Nobody else, it seems, can ﬁnd out. We simply have apathetic members, an apathetic society and an apa- thetic political party. By that I mean the men who are in control of the Legislature of our state. I know of no better way to wake them up than to wake up ourselves. I think every member of this organiza- tion should take it upon himself to see that the legislature is ﬁxed. I don’t mean ﬁxed in the political sense, because I do not think that the horticulturists of this state are in a position, ﬁnancially, to ﬁx anybody. I do not think we should ﬁx them as it is ordinarily understood, in the underhanded way, but in a way that will serve our purpose perhaps, better. I mean by that in a way that will make them think they are going to be ﬁxed deﬁnitely and permanently and ﬁnally. Let us ﬁx them in their political graves if they do not do something for us. I do not think we should be discour- aged by our failures in the past but that we should try again. I know of no bet- ter time than right now, and I am heartily in sympathy with the motion offered by Mr. Bartlett, and hope that you will ap— point a committee that will do something. Let us get at the Legislature of the State so that we may be able to report. if we de- sire more help from the Government, that Florida has at least done something for herself. Let us ever bear in mind the old adage that “the Lord helps those who help themselves.” Let us help our- selves ﬁrst and then apply to the Govern- ment. Prof. Bartlett—I think Dr. Richard- son’s remarks are well put, and I think we should get help from our own Legis- lature before applying to the Govern- ment. I was at a banquet where Mr. Sparkman was present, and he said, “What are you doing to help your- selves?” Of course, there was nothing that could be said. Prof. Rolfs—I would like to say a , word in explanation. We have slightly more funds than Mr. Bartlett spoke of, on account of the creation of the Adams Fund, but these are so circumscribed by law that we must use this fund for origin-        117 a1 investigation only, and the work that Mr. Bartlett wants done and that we all want to do, is classiﬁed as F‘armers’ In- stitute work and demonstration work; in other words, putting into practice well known principles, and where principles are well known, the money received from Congress cannot properly be used. How- ever, the experiment station staff once in a while, if it is possible to slip out to some of these farmers’ gatherings, are very glad to do so. When a body of local agriculturists get together and! say that they will pay our expenses, we are very willing to go out and give them our time. But we cannot justly charge ex- penses for work of this kind to the funds mentioned. The Federal Government is this year expending something like $60,- 000 for agricultural work in the State of Florida; that is, investigation work. You are perhaps surprised at the amount. There is the Hatch Fund, the Adams Fund, a Subtropical Laboratory Fund and the white ﬁy appropriation, in addi- tion to the local demonstrations and] ex- periments. You will see where Mr. Tenny and Mr. Powell and men of this stamp are costing the Federal Government a great deal, and you will see how much the Federal Gov- ernment does and how little the State does. Consequently, the federal oﬁicers have the right to feel a little discouraged. The people at Tallahassee are contem- plating an appropriation to give to the experiment station a home. I suppose there is nothing more important than a home. We have had none up to the present time. This bill proposes about $30,000 to be expended for the buildings and $5,000 annually for Farmers’ Insti— tutes. Mr. Skinner—I was at Tallahassee sev- eral years ago when one of t'he bills came up that the Society recommended. The difﬁculty seems to be that the Horticul- tural Society seems to be identiﬁed with the orange industry. The state of Flori- da is much larger than the orange indus- try. If you make the people in each part of the State think that they are to be beneﬁted by the passing of- a bill, it is pretty likely to go through. They are willing to pass any bill that does not call for money. Let them all see that it is a beneﬁt to the state, and I think there will be no trouble. Japanese Matting Industry for America. Prof. Rolfs—I understand that the ofﬁce of the Seed and Plant Introduction is now looking for a place to plant the Japanese matting rush, and we have their agent with us this morning. Probably you will be as interested as I am in this matter, and I will be glad if Mr. Tull will give us a few remarks. Mr. Tull—The matting industry in. America so far is very young; it is still in its infancy. This is an entirely new thing in America and the ofﬁce of Seed and] Plant Introduction under the Bureau of Plant Industry has recently taken it up. The growing of this grass was tried by private individuals but they made a fail- ure. They succeeded in getting machin- ery, but could not get raw material. They went to China and Japan and ﬁnally se- cured a number of plants and sent them     8   over here to be grown. Japan sent a representative over here and found we were trying to compete with them so they immediately stopped our supply of straw. The American Company sent a man to Japan again and] got a small supply of the Chinese straw and they are now making a very ﬁne grade of matting but the sup- ply of raw material is very limited. At this point, the Department of Agriculture took up the work of introducing these two grasses from China and Japan. Some experiments have been tried with our native grasses on the coast of South Carolina, principally in the abandoned rice lands. The rice industry along the Atlantic Coast, which at one time was so thriving, has within the last ten years, en- tirely died out on account of the rice in . Louisiana and Texas being grown by the use of machinery. The Department thought that by introducing the matting grass into North and South Carolina, they might bring back into cultivation the abandoned rice ﬁelds, but so far have proved unsuccessful with the native grass- es. Last year we got a special appropria— tion through to send a man to Japan to get the roots. as the plant is propagated in this way. I went to Japan last fall and ﬁnally succeeded in getting a great many roots of the two different kinds of Japan- ese and Chinese roots. These roots were ﬁnally landed at California but in very bad condition, so to save them we left them at Chico. Cal.. to grow for the summer. The plants are now doing very nicely. We are now planning to distribute those roots next fall, beginning at Texas and running along the Gulf into Florida and up into South Carolina. The plant requires al- most the same conditions that are re- quired in rice culture. It is planted in the winter and then water put on. The water, with plenty of fertilizer, forces the plant into a very long. slender growth. We have arranged now for an experiment with some Japanese in Texas who have put out about one and one-half acres of it. We wish to distribute the plants now at Chico in two or three different places in Florida as well as Texas. There is now a ready market for the straw at $80.00 per ton.‘ In Japan, the grass yields from four to Six tons per acre. The way the Chinese and Japanese grow it is much cheaper than the methods we would have to employ. The labor conditions there are nothing compared to what they are here. The plant is peren- nial and you can put it in the ground and leave it; with the_aid of water and the proper use of fertilizer you can continue to harvest year after year. Our object is to ﬁrst ﬁnd out if the grass will grow. Then we will have to work it out by practice and ﬁnd out the best methods of growing it. I will be glad to answer any questions or talk to anyone on the subject. Mr. Hart—W'hat is the price of grow- ing and preparing for market; putting it in shape? Mr. Tull—The two kinds of straw are cured entirely different. Two days of hot sunshine will cure it. The process of curing in Japan is very crude and very long compared to the way in which we would have to do it. The grass is cut and spread out in the ﬁeld. and after two days of hot sunshine, the farmer considers it cured.        119 Camphor for Florida. W. O. Reichtmann—I regret that I cannot make quite as explicit report as I would like. Probably the thing that most of you are interested in, is whether camphor can be produced commercially in the United States. The ﬁrst thing to be ascertained is as to whether the plant can be grown at all successfully or not. The natives of Florida can probably answer that question much better than I can, as they have it here with them, and have undoubtedly noticed the habits of its growth. From the trees which are present, it seems to me that there is but one answer to this question, and that is, that the tree can be grown, and grown successfully. The second point I would mention, is as to whether the camphor tree as grown in this country is producing camphor. You have already had two reports, one presented in 1896. by Henry Hubbard, stating that he had received as high as one and four-tenths per cent. of camphor from the fresh twig of the camphor tree. The second was from Dr. Walker, last year. in which he presented some of the work of the Department and the results of his own personal experiments. Our work has been conﬁned to Florida and in California. but at the present time we have not as yet found a single tree but that an appreciable quantity of cam- phor was contained in the leaves and twigs of the tree. The amount of the cam-phor does not compare with the amount reported as being found in the trees grown in its native condition. This may be due to several reasons. The chief reason is perhaps that we are work- ing only one side of the matter and the people of Formosa are working under entirely different conditions. They may be working on the basis of dry material, and we on fresh material, which would give a variation of sixty per cent. ' The last point to be mentioned, and perhaps the most important point in con- nection with the camphor work. is_the camphor as produced in the United States of a quality that it can be used commer— cially. Samples of the camphor that have been produced in Florida have been sub- mitted to the trade for their own demon- stration and observation. and the report sent to the Department from the ﬁrms who have been testing it, is, that they would have thought it was from Japan or Fomtosa if they had not known where it came from. Secondly, does it have all of the quali— ties, physical and chemical, that the For- mosa and Japanese camphor have? It has. . Lastly, I can only state that one ﬁrm- has taken the matter up, and has started planting a tract of three thousand acres with camphor in your own state. I regret that I cannot go into the de- tails of the work and give you a more detailed talk. This, I trust, may be done in the immediate future. Dr: Walker produces samples of cam- phor. Dr. W alker—I am not in a position to give you much further information about the matter. Mr. Reichtmann has taken charge of the camphor plant. I am doing my best to cultivate as much cam- phor as I can. Mr. Wood is now in charge of the work at Huntington. Dr.     0   Reichtmann has taken charge of the large establishment at Satsuma. I veriﬁed my own statement made last year, and ﬁnd that camphor can be grown more than successfully. The experiment as far as it has gone, is perfectly satis- factory. I'have written and advised peo- ple to go into this, and a great many have said that there could not be anything in it, because if it was as good as I said, I would want to keep it_all to myself. The sample just displayed was made from trees that I planted myself and had puri- ﬁed in Washington, and is of a most satisfactory nature. I can only say to any of my friends who are interested in ' camphor—I fancy the best thing they can do is to plant it. Mr. Sheppard—What degree of cold will a camphor tree stand? Member—In Marion county, I have not seen one that showed the slightest de- gree of being injured by the cold. Mr. Hart—Does the variety have any- thing to do with its power to withstand the cold? Dr. Walker—I think the condition of the tree at the time the frost comes has more to do with it than anything else. The leaves will stand a considerable amount of cold and when they fall, retain a considerable portion of their camphor. From the very small amount of opportu- nity we have had, we discovered that the camphor makes its growth as a rule pret- ty regularly. I have noticed a few that have made a very irregular growth. A peculiar advantage is that they will stand more cold than an average orange tree, and when cut down you can get your camphor from the dead wood.",,
Necrology.,"Report Submitted by G. L. Taber, W. S. Hart and Wm. C. Richardson.","Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: There are times in the lives of socie- ties, as of individuals, when we are called upon to cope, as best we may, with the feelings that overwhelm us, and to give expression, in some form, however inadequate, to the esteem and love and honor in which we hold our departed dead. This is one of those sad occasions and our lips falter and the words we grope for come haltingly and broken and seemingly powerless to convey the thoughts we would utter. We stand apalled at the calamity that has over- taken us. Since last we met our honored and beloved President, Charles Tobin McCarty and ﬁve others of our highly esteemed number, have passed into the Great Beyond. The sad record! in chronological order is as follows: L. J. Sawyer of Tibballs, Saint Lucie county, died at Oswego, N. 1., July 20th, 1906, aged sixty-eight years“ George Rainsford Fairbanks of Fer- nandina, Nassau County, died at Suwannee, Tennessee, August 3rd, 1906, aged eighty-six years. Denis Redmond of Saint Nicholas, Duval County, died at Jacksonville, September 24th, 1906, aged eighty-two years. Abner Atwood of Pawtucket, R. I., died at his home in Pawtucket, Novem- ber 23rd, 1906, aged eighty-two years. Charles Tobin McCarty of Eldred, Saint Lucie County, died at Fort Pierce, January 30th, 1907, aged ﬁfty years. Henry George Sartorious of Semi- nole, Hillsboro County, died at Las Vegas, New Mexico, March 30th, 1907, aged thirty-two years. Your committee on Necrology, to whom the sad duty was assigned, beg to report the following resolutions: Whereas, during the past year, death has removed our beloved chief execu- tive oFﬁcer and several of our most worthy members, and Whereas, it is due their honored memory that ﬁtting tribute be paid them and expression given to our deep sense of loss, therefore, Resolved, that in the death of Charles Tobin McCarty, our society has lost a President whom we loved, an executive ofﬁcer of high ability, a man, a brother and a friend who was in every sense one of “God’s noble- men;” that in the death of George R. Fairbanks we have lost a zealous work- er for the interests of our society, a historian of note and an honored Christian gentleman; that in the death of Denis Redmond we have lost one of our esteemed honorary members, who for many years was noted in literary work and zealous in horticultural pur- suits; that in the death of Abner At- wood, L. ]. Sawyer and H. G. Sartor- ious, we have lost three of our worthy and esteemed members. Resolved that we extend our sym-     2   pathies to relatives and friends of these deceased members. Resolved that these resolutions be spread upon our minutes; that suitable memorial notices be printed in the forthcoming Report of the Society; that the same report shall be dedicated to the memory of our deceased Presi- dent, Charles Tobin McCarty, and that this dedication so appear on the title page. CHARLES TOBIN McCARTY.  “Our self-made men are the glory of our institutions.”  Charles Tobin McCarty was born at Green Bay, Wisconsin, on February 24th, in the year 1857. He came of blood which had proved its staunchness amid the dangers and hardships of a new land; he owed his being to parents noted for energy of brain and brawn, in a community where each person must of necessity, have possessed something of the he- roic; he sprang from a race which could not be moulded into unchangeable austerity even by the exigencies of pioneer life. He was the son of a frontiersman and he early took upon his young shoulders his share of that father’s burdens. Here it was that his inheritance from his Celtic ancestry stood him in good stead. It made him cheerful in the midst of difﬁculties; it gave him the power to see poetical beauty as well as practical opportunity in the pine forests about him; it ﬁred him with ambition, and whispered to him continuously of great things to be done in the world, even though that world seemed an unconquerable wilder- ness. He was a boy in whose sturdy man- liness his father felt a just pride, upon whose gentleness his mother relied; whose courage won the respect of his brothers and whose courtesy made glad the hearts of his sisters. He gave of himself freely. of his warm sympathy, of his mental activity, and by this very generosity created for himself a little higher plane; opened up for himself the way along which he resolutely trod toward loftier ideals. He was, from his earliest years, con- sumed with a thirst for knowledge, for education, apparently realizing from the ﬁrst that without this he could not reach the heights on which he had ﬁxed his eyes. Only those who are acquainted with the limited education- al advantages of the “’est in those days, can appreciate the difﬁculties in his way. \Vhatever they were he surmounted them, and in 1878 entered Tilford Collegiate Academy at Vinton, Iowa, with so many credits that he graduated from that institution a year later. In the class with him was Miss Elizabeth Matter, whose record in school work was equal to his own. As he had been one marked and set apart, so had she been a leader, a forceful, independent spirit. Upon the stage from which these two delivered their addresses, they were made man and wife, on the day of their graduation. Life as they could see it ahead of them, was not a path of roses, but they enter- ed upon it conﬁdently, secure in the knowledge of their tried powers, ani- mated by kindred ambitions, and sure that the depth of their affections would        not only help them overcome all pos- sible diﬁ‘iculties, but would make the struggle together, a real happiness. Their faith was justiﬁed. The dark days came, but they were not cast down, for they had each other and that to them, always meant more than any- thing else. The happiness of their home life, the remarkable harmony of their union, deeply impressed all who were allowed the privilege of intimate association, and the desolation of such happiness weighs heavily on the hearts of their friends. In 1882 Mr. McCarty entered the Law Department of the Iowa State University, graduating with honor at the close of his course. After devoting I. year to the practice of his profession he was induced to accept a professor- ship at Tilford, where he remained un- til 1888. His work as a teacher was of a high order, adding markedly to the strength of the school and leaving an imperish- able impression upon the minds and hearts of the hundreds of young people who came under his inﬂuence. His power was felt outside as well as in- side the class-room. He was friend as well as instructor. He not only drilled his students in the acquisition of knowledge, but he interwove facts with a broad philosophy, which gave them warmth and vital signiﬁcance. On February 19th of this year the alumni of Tilford held a memorial service in honor of their beloved teacher. Hundreds attended and their sincere sorrow showed that the years had not lessened their regard for Mr. McCarty, nor their appreciation of his worth. Thus it is that fellow students 123 and pupils after an interval of twenty years, declare that Mr. McCarty, “en- riched and inspired their lives and generously helped to lead them out to broader and better ﬁelds.” In the year 1888, driven by ill health, he severed his connection with Tilford, left a state where friends were legion, and with his brave wife and three small sons, began his struggle with the wilderness of Southern Florida. In a tiny clearing at what was then Ankona, but is now Eldred, he built his humble dwelling. On its site there now stands a handsome residence, and the wilder- ness has given place to broad, highly improved acres. The mighty change stands as a monument to his unusual keenness of foresight. to his tireless industry and his inflexible determina- tion. He entered into the cultivation of his pineapples, not only with the shrewd practicality of the business man, but with the eagerness of the earnest student entering a new ﬁeld of knowledge. As it was with pineapples, so it was with the citrus fruits, or in fact, with anything which gave promise of becoming a valuable resource of his newly adopted state. He was always student and scientist as well as culti- vator. In 1895 the English Government was looking for a person competent to judge of the possibilities of the Baha- ma Islands and instruct the people living there, in the art of turning such possibilities into valuable facts. At that time Mr. McCarty had become so widely acknowledged as an au- thority on semi-tropical industries, that he was chosen to ﬁll this important and honorable position.     4   As a result of his labors in the is- lands, he published at Nassau in 1896, “The Farmer and Fruit Grower’s Al- manac for the Bahamas Colony.” This almanac had nothing to do with the calendar, but was a clear, concise and thoroughly valuable treatise on citrus fruits, vegetables and pine- apples, by C. T. McCarty, Agricultural - Instructor. It met with the hearty ap- proval of His Excellency Sir Wm. F. Haynes Smith, K. C. M. G., Governor of the Bahamas, and proved of incal- culable value to the people of the islands. His numerous addresses on subjects interesting and helpful to Floridians, have been widely copied and quoted. At the time of his death, January 30th, 1907, he owned and operated the largest pineapple plantation in the world. He had however, of late years, placed the active management of this vast acreage in the hands of his capable eldest son, Daniel T. McCarty. As the East Coast country develop- ed, Mr. McCarty’s abilities as a lawyer and as a well informed and intellectual citizen were in great demand, and he gave his entire time to affairs in the conducting of which he was eminently qualiﬁed to shine. He had as a lawyer a large and ever-increasing practice, serving at the same time on the legal force of the F. E. C. Ry Co. In part- nership with A. C. Dittmar, of Ft. Pierce, he was engaged in an extensive real estate business. He was a heavy stockholder in the bank of Ft. Pierce, and a member of its Board of Directors, president of the Florida State Horticultural Society, president of the Ft. Pierce Board of Trade, the animating spirit of the county good roads association and a Mason of highest rank. To quote the words of a fellow- townsman: “He was always found in the front ranks of those working for the improvement of Ft. Pierce, St. Lucie county, the East Coast and the State of Florida. Mr. McCarty was shot on the streets of Ft. Pierce, the morning of January 30th of the present year, and died the afternoon of the same day, leaving the entire community shocked at “the cruel cutting off of a noble life,” in deep gloom over the loss of such a friend and citizen, and with the ﬁrm belief that his place could never be ﬁlled. He was a quiet man, with quiet tastes, and he lived a quiet life, yet when he died there came expressions of sorrow and affection from hosts of friends scattered over sixteen states of this great union, and from almost every county of this beautiful state he loved so well. Some of these friends occupy posts of honor among their fellowmen; others are from the bum- bler walks of life; all are alike bereft and grieving. Comfort and sympathy, without stint, has been given to the heart- broken'wife and her three grief strick- en, but manly sons. Words are feeble; all we can do is to say: “Thy will be done.” “God calls our loved ones, but we lose not wholly What He has given; They live on earth in thought and deed, as truly As in His heaven.""        125 GEORGE RAINSIORD IAIRBANKS. To mention the name of George Rainsford Fairbanks is to bring to mind one of the leading characters in the history of this and adjoining states for the past sixty-four years, and one whose literary ability has contributed much to perpetuate that history. Major Fairbanks was born in Water- town, in northern New York, July 5th, 1820, and died at his summer home at the University of the South, Suwan- nee, Tennessee, August 3rd, 1906, in the eighty-seventh year of his age. Entering the Sophomore class of Union College, Schenectady, New York, at the age of sixteen, he gradu- ated with the class of 1839, at nineteen. He received the degree of M.A., both from his alma mata and from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. In 1842, he was admitted to the bar in New York State. In the same year he came south. This was three years before Florida was admitted to the Union, and he remained a citizen of the Territory and State for the next sixty— four years. He ﬁrst settled in historic St. Augus- tine, but later made his home in Fer- nandina. For four years (1842—46), during the territorial days, 'he was clerk of the United States Superior and District Court for the northern district of Florida; and the year after Florida’s admission to the Union in 1845 he was a member of the State Senate (1846- 48). He became Vice-President of the Florida Historical Society, honorary member of the New York Historical Society, and held other positions of trust and honor, but was best known to many of us as a fellow-horticulturist and the efﬁcient President of the Flori- da Fruit Exchange, from its ﬁrst real business meeting up to 1895 when the big freeze put the Exchange out of business. ' Throughout most of the period of its existence, he has been a valued member of this association, and records of the part he has taken in its discus- sions, and the papers contributed by -'him, form some of the most valuable portions of the Society’s annual re- ports. ' Over the inscription, “George R. Fairbanks, Historian of Florida,” his likeness will be found in the report of 1901. ~ “History and Antiquities of the City of St. Augustine, Florida;” “Fair- bank’s History of Florida,” “Florida Freezes” (the latter ’a short Sketch contributed to this society in 1895 and to be found in its annual report of that year), and the many other products of his fertile pen will be found helpful, instructive and entertaining, but the work nearest his heart was the estab- lishment and fostering of The Univer- sity of the South, Suwanee, Tennessee, of which institution he published a history in his eighty-ﬁfth year. At a convention of the Episcopal church, of which he was an ardent member, held on Lookout Mountain, July 4th, 1857, the plan of the institu- tion had been promulgated and formal organlization effected at a notable meeting of representatives of ten Southern states. At this meeting he was appointed delegate and trustee for Florida. _ From that time it became the leading     6   interest and aim of his life to which he devoted unceasing energy. Its re-founding and re-organization, and hence the actual existence of this noble seat of learning, after the war, was primarily due to his labors and those of Bishop Quintard, of Ten- nessee, and it was a point of honor that he had been present in session at every meeting of its Board for forty-nine years, including the one in 1906 before his death. A pamphlet issued from the press of the University of the South, in October last, plainly shows the high esteem in which he was held by the trustees and faculty of that institution. the last few sentences, of which are copied and read as follows: “As of everything that meets our eyes on this mountain, he was more than all the rest of us put together, the layer out and maker and keeper of it. “There is nothing here that did not know and own him in it. “There is nothing here that does not and will not feel and mourn his loss.” ' DENIS REDMONI). Mr. Denis Redmond, was born in the County of \Vicklow, Ireland, Feb. 3, 1824—the distinguished members of the Irish Party,-in the English Parlia- ment, John E. and William Redmond, are of the same family. In his youth Mr. Redmond lived for a time in Balti- more, Md. Later, he went to Augusta, Ga. There he was at ﬁrst connected with the leading paper, “The Augusta Chronicle,” afterwards with the “Southern Cultivator,” of which he be- came owner and editor, and which he conducted successfully for over twenty years. He founded the Fruitland Nurseries. now owned by P. J. Berckmans 8: Sons, and built many beautiful homes in the neighborhood of Augusta, that are still monuments to his good taste and love of trees and ﬂowers. ' He was a lover of books, owning a very rare and extensive library, and was considered an able literary critic "" and an authority on English poetry. He traveled widely in this country, and his love of nature was his religion. After the war he went further south, living at different times in New Or— leans, Pass Christian and Pascagoula, then to Florida, where he made his home for thirty years and was con- nected with fruit growing and journal- ism. He was twice married. He had two children by the ﬁrst marriage, who survive him, Mrs. Locke, of New York City, and Mrs. Mel Redmond Colquit, of Washington. D. C. Summed up, Mr. Redmond’s life was one of great usefulness and devo— tion to the good and beautiful. He was endeared to many by reason of his loving. magnanimous nature and his beautiful mental gifts and attainments. He was one of the three honorary. members of this society. He died on the 24th of September, [906, after a brief illness, in Jackson- ville, Fla. His wife followed him to the grave in three days. REV'L J. SAWYER. Rev. L. J. Sawyer, born at New Haven, Conn., Dec. 19th, 1837, died at Oswego, N. Y., July 20th, 1906.        127 Leicester J. Sawyer was graduated from Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y., class of 1859, graduated from Union Theological Seminary, New York City, 1862. October 8th, 1862 he enlisted in Co. H. 27th Conn. Vol. At the bat- tle of Fredericksburg was wounded three times in active service, and twice while lying on the battleﬁeld waiting for removal. In 1864, he was ordained to the min- istry at Menasha, \Vis., and for twelve years remained in the West preaching at Sheboygan, VVis., and Burlingame, Kansas. In 1876 he returned East, be- came pastor of the Presbyterian church at Oriskany, N. Y., and in 1877 took charge of the Presbyterian church at \Vhitesboro, N. Y. On March Ist. 1889 he accepted a call from Emmanuel church, Amsterdam, N. Y., which po- sition he resigned in 1898 to remove to Tibbals, Fla., and began regular serv- ices at Eden and Jensen in 1900. Later he accepted the pastorate of a Union church at Ankona and Eldred, which charges he held until ill health caused him to resign in April, 1906. Rev. Mr. Sawyer was a man of bril- liant intellect and one whose brain force seemed never to grow weary, a speaker who could hold an audience at will, a scholar of great attainments, speaking eight languages ﬂuently; al- ways ready to respond when called up- on, and using no manuscript, he made his services valuable at all times and places. He was a genial companion and earnest friend. Mr. Sawyer had been a member of this Society for sev- eral years, but much to our regret, his health did not permit him to attend our annual gatherings. ABNER ATWOOD. Mr. Abner Atwood was born at Carver, Mass, in a house that had sheltered three successive generations of his family. He came from good old New England stock, John Atwood, the common ancestor of the family in America, having settled at Plymouth, Mass, in 1633. The youth of Abner Atwood was passed in school and helping his father on the farm .until he attained his nine- teenth year. He then went to Taun- ton and entered the employ of William Mason & Company, then one of the largest cotton machinery builders in the country, to learn the trade of ma— chinist. After an experience of ﬁve years, he took charge of a section in the works of the Taunton Locomotive Company, remaining until 1858, when he formed a partnership with J. O. Draper in Bedford, Mass, for the manufacture of soap. In 1862 the ﬁrm of Draper &, Atwood removed to Pawtucket, R. I., and in 1866, upon the death of the junior partner of the ﬁrm of R. & G. Cushman, spool manufac- turers, Mr. Atwood was invited by the surviving partner to an interest in the ﬁrm and business. Until 1875 the style of the ﬁrm was Cushman, Phillips & Company. Mr. Cushman then with- drew, and the ﬁrm of Atwood, Craw— ford & Company was formed. The product of the ﬁrm is spools and fancy wood turning. In 1890 this company was incorporated under the name of the Atwood Crawford Company, and Mr. Atwood was elected president, which position he held to the time of his death. He was a prominent member of the Central Falls Congregational church,     8   and for the past 22 years one of its deacons. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Young Mens’ Christian Association, and a member of the building committee. As a member of the latter body, he manifested a deep interest in the build- ing of the association’s new home. Mr. Atwood purchased his place at Thonotosassa, Fla., a little over twenty years ago, and he and his wife had spent their winters there, with one or two exceptions, for over ﬁfteen years. He took much interest in his Florida place and in all things pertaining to orange growing and the welfare of this society. He died at his home at Pawtucket, R. I., after a shortillness, on November 23rd, I906. His wife had preceded him to the grave but a few weeks. He left no children. He was a man of sterling worth and character, and one that any community could ill afford to lose. HENRY GEORGE SARIORIOUS. Henry George Sartorious was born in Grundy County, Iowa, April 23rd, 1875, and came to Seminole, Fla., with his parents in the fall of 1890. His early education was obtained in the public schools; his close application and wide reading gave him a fund of knowledge on a wide range of subjects. On August 6th, 1896, he married Miss Lenora Whittle. Mrs. Sartorious died a year later, leaving him with a little ten-day-old daughter, who very shortly afterward followed her mother to the grave. After this, Mr. Sartorious taught the public school at Seminole for three terms, then took a course in the Tampa Business College, following which he worked as an express messenger on the A. C. L., running between Tampa and Jacksonville. Feeling that his aged parents needed him at home, he gave up his position and returned to Seminole, taking direct charge of his father’s grove properties. In March, 1906, he was married to Mrs. Eva Drew Lewis. During the spring of 1906 his health began to fail, tuberculosis having developed. He went to New Mexico hoping to regain his health, but died at Las Vegas, March 30th, 1907. Mr. Sartorious was a noble, upright Christian, a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, an earnest worker in the Christian En- deavor Society, and active in temper- ance reform.",,
Secretary’s Report.,,"M r. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: At the beginning of the year, the pros- pects for a large membership were not at all ﬂattering, and when the report of our president’s death was conﬁrmed, it seemed at the time that the shock to the Society would tend to dwarf it. But this calamity which has befallen us. seems to have awakened the interest of every one in the Society and to draw the members closer together and eFforts were made to in- crease our membership, so that at the be- ginning of our meeting we had nearly twice as many members as a year ago. At the beginning of the last meeting, on- ly 285 members enrolled, while at the be- ginning of this meeting 515, and during the meeting over 50 names have been ad- ded. .

Report of the Executive Committee.,,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : The Executive Committee met in Jack- sonville on July 29, 1906, to consider the publishing of the report, and the appoint- ment of the Standing Committee. This Committee instructed the Secretary to have the report published following the form of previous years. Owing to the lack of funds in the‘ treasury, however, all half tones and the catalogue of fruits- were omitted so as to bring the expense of publication as low as possible. The Committee then adjourned. On March 4th, the Executive Com- mittee met in the oﬁice of the secretary in Jacksonville, with the following members present: Prof. P. H. Rolfs, Gainesville; G. L. Taber, Glen St. Mary; E. S. Hub- bard, Federal Point; O. \V. Connor, Tangerine and E. O. Painter, Jackson- ville. It was moved and! seconded that the date of the next meeting be placed at May 14th. ISE'h, 16th and 17th, commencing on the evening of the 14th. It was also moved and seconded that Mr. J. D. Bell. of St. Petersburg, be ap- pointed Chairman of the Local Com- mittee with power to choose his associates and report the names and rates of the different hotels there. Report of Committee Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Your committee to whom was referred the matter of nursery inspection ﬁnd that the question is a very annoying one and that the only report we can make, much It was moved and seconded that the secretary write to Mr. Jos. Richardson and secure the best rates possible for the Association. The following committee on Necrology was appointed: G. L. Taber, Glen St. Mary, chairman; W. S. Hart, Hawks Park, and Dr. \V. C. Richardson, Tampa. The secretary was authorized to get out advertising matter for business houses to send out. The meeting was adjourned. In St. Petersburg, May 16th, the Ex- ecutive Committee met with the following members present: Mr. E. S. Hubbard, chairman; G. L. Taber, P. H. Rolfs, E. O. Painter, and W. S. Hart. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. It was moved by Mr. Taber that the report and bills of the secretary be approved It was moved by ‘ Mr. Taber that the report of the Treas- urer, W. S. Hart. be accepted, as same was examined and found correct. Bills ' presented by the secretary were audited and ordered paid. E. S. HUBBARD, Chairman, G. L. TABER, O. W. CONNER. on Nursery Inspection. as we deplore it, is a rather negative one. We have had the subject under careful consideration for two days and beg leave to report as follows: - We ﬁnd the inspection as now conduct-        ed is done by the entomologist attached to the State Experiment Station and is pure- ly a voluntary matter on his part, made at the request of, and to accommodate the nurserymen, and is not required as a regular duty or in any way provided for by statute or other law. ' The present Experiment Station Ento- mologist states that he has only made eleven inspections during the past year, and that his methods and practice, in- cluding form of certiﬁcate, are and have been in accordance with the customs and rules established by his predecessors in ofﬁce. The fee charged for an inspection is $5.00, which is turned into the Experi- ment Station treasury. In adldition to his fee the Entomologist is paid his traveling expenses by the parties requesting the in- spection, thus making him substantially their agent. It seems that the certiﬁcate of inspection is desired by the nursery- men to enable them to market their pro- 131 ducts in other states and foreign countries which require inspection, and is, there- fore, unfortunately so far as home pur- chasers are concerned, more in the inter— est of the nurserymen than the planter. \V e feel that this is all wrong and that this society should take such action as may lead to a more extended. legally authorized, well regulated and beneﬁcial system which will properly safeguard the purchaser rather than the seller, and! at the same time be reliable and equable for all. We therefore recommend that the Legislative and Executive Committees be and are hereby instructed to do all that may be in their power to secure the adop- tion by the legislature of requisite and speciﬁc laws for a proper, reliable and systematic method of inspection. Respectfully submitted, WM. C. RICHARDSON, F. G. SAMPSON, H. B. STEVENS.",,
Statistics of Orange and Grapefruit Crops.,,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: We, the undersigned committee, recom mend that the State Horticultural Society take in hand the plan suggested by Dr. P. Phillips, of Orlandlo, to obtain statistics from all the orange growing counties of the state, the approximate number of box- es of oranges and grapefruit that will be raised during the year. This we feel will be a beneﬁt to the grower as well as pack- er, and the country at large in order that the railroad companies, packing houses and box factories may make due preparations for the coming crop to han- dle it properly. It will also give the grower an additional advantage that he might know what price to Put upon his fruit, and not be governed by haphazard and ‘unreliable estimates that are being madle, which mean considerable loss to the State of Florida annually. We, there- fore, recommend the following plan: let the society appoint in each County not less than three members of this Society, or more, according to size of county. These members should be carefully select- ed as being conservative and responsible growers, and each one shall report to the        132 Association direct, how much fruit there will be in his own section and also in the county. These reports shall be carefully considered and} published; only those that are considered the most conservative esti- mates, or prorated by the Secretary from each county as he may think will be the best. The beginning of the estimates shall not be earlier than the latter part of July, and! the publication of same shall not be later than the latter part of August, usless conditions of the growing crop may be required to do otherwise, and said re- ports shall be published in all the leading papers of our State and all the leading fruit journals of the country, giving the returns by counties. \Ve further recommend that the Society shall request of the railroad companies carrying such fruit in the state. to fur- nish the Society tabulated report from each shipping point at the end of each season, that we may compare with the statistics and estimate made by the So— ciety.‘ By doing so, we will readily see at the end of each season whether or not the Society is doing efﬁcient work. ' \Ve further recommend that should such Railroad Companies refuse the So- ciety the above reports, that the Society should apply to the Railroad Commission of the State of Florida and compel them to do so. (Signed) P. PHILLIPS, Chairman. A. H. BROWN, WM. C. RICHARDSON, Report of Committee on Legislation. M 1'. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : Your Committee on Legislation recom- mends that our state legislation now in session be urged to adopt the bill now be- fore it providing for the erection of a building for the experiment station, and the appropriation of funds for institute work. They also recommend that active steps be taken to bring our transportation facil- ities and rates for fruits and vegetables to the attention of the Interstate Com- merce Commission, with a view to their equitable and speedy adjustment, and that this society, individually and collectively, cooperate with any and all other organi- zations in the State in their efforts to se- cure these results. To carry out above recommendations, we suggest that a permanent committee on legislation be appointed who shall be authorized to raise funds and use all pro- per means in their power to accomplish these ends.

WHEREAS: The Florida State Horti- cultural Society during its regular an- nual meeting, has been so royally enter- tained by the citizens and Board of Trade, it is ﬁt and proper that we give some ex- pression of our appreciation of the courte- sies extended; therefore, be it Resolved, That we wish to thank the Tampa Bay Transportation Company for the use of their beautiful steamer, “The Favorite,” for a free trip up the Manatee River, the ladies of the Town Improve- ment Association for the elegant lunch so generously served, and the citizens of St. Petersburg as a whole, for their uni- form courtesy andl hospitality during our stay, and also we wish to thank all of the transportation companies for the special rate given us. W. N. WILSON, GEO. KERR, J. F. FARLEY, P. J. WESTER, J. B. CURTIS, Committee. Question Box. No. I—W'hat is the best method to de- foliate? Member—It is to take your thumb and ﬁnger and pull the leaves off. Mr. Hart—I would like to ask if you think it is practicable to defoliate, say, ' four square miles of trees in this way? Mr. Painter—A large per cent. of trees or shrubs can be defoliated by spraying with a strong solution of Bordeaux mix- ture. By a strong solution I mean one in which the copper has not all been neu- tralized by the lime. Thrip juice in the proportion of 1 to 500 will also defoliate trees and shrubbery. No. 2—Which is the best time to plant cabbage palms; can they be transplanted any time in the year? Prof. Rolfs—I have seen them live when transplanted during any one of the. twelve months. The best time to trans- plant is after a long dry spell and before that dry spell has been broken. Mr. Sperry—I contemplated setting out a large quantity of palms. Before doing so I talked with a man who had a large experience in planting palms, and he stat- ed the best time is during the wet season in the summer. Mr. Chilton—From my experience, I would say February or March. We have our wet times during those months. I have been informed that in digging them up it is well to trim off the small roots and plant them deeper than when they came out of the ground. Trim them close to the ground and! plant them one foot deeper than they were originally.  No. 3—I understand that this society frowns down any attempt made by ad-     4   vertisers to call attention to their goods at its annual meetings. Would it not be well to let them exhibit in the hall, inas- much as some of the improved machinery would, if shown by salesmen who under- stand it, prove interesting to us and we would have a chance to compare the va- rious styles in such a way as is not often our privilege. They might even grant a discount to us in return for the adver- tising privilege. Mr. Hart—I think our constitution bars out anything of this kind. I do not see how we could grant the room to any; one to exhibit their goods even though it would be of beneﬁt to us. They are at perfect liberty to exhibit their goods out- side the place of meeting. I do not. think it would be policy to grant anyone this privilege because it would unavoidably disturb our meetings. ~ Mr. McCarty—I met two or three men yesterday who are interested in irriga- tion. It seems to me that with as much space as we have here, it would be a goodl idea to allow them to exhibit where we could all get the beneﬁt of it. This space could all be ﬁlled up with goods of the fertilizer men, machinery men, nursery men, etc., without detriment to the meet- ing. It seems to me it would be a great addition. Mr. Painter—I think the gentleman has a wrong idea of the proposition. He thinks that the society does not want an exhibit of fruit trees, machinery, etc. We do want it. but we don't want it on the ﬂoor where the meeting is held. By the ﬂoor, I do not mean literally speaking. I mean any particular wares should] not be advertised during our sessions. Any per- son or ﬁrm can bring or send anything they wish to display or advertise to the place where the meeting is held and make any arrangements they choose outside the place of meeting. The society itself can- not take the position of endorsing or ad- vertising any commodities.  No. 4—Do hard wood ashes actually destroy or check the mildew on the to- mato? Prof. Rolfs—It is not likely that they would have any effect.  No. 5—Is the 'white fungus of the t0- mato transmitted through the tomato seed? Is it continued from year to year through the same soil? Prof. Rolfs—It is transmitted from plant to plant.  N0. 6—At what stage of the tomato growth should the Bordeaux be applied to check or destroy the white fungus or mildew? Prof. Rolfs—Three of these questions appear to be asked by the same person. The tomato in. Florida is rarely attacked by mildew and it is probable that the author of theSe questions had in mind the condition that is produced by a small spid- er mite. They should be fought by dry sulphur. sulphur spray or sulphur com- pound. They are easily killed and usual- ly disappear by the use of potassium sul- phi-te or soda sulphite.  No. 7—Orange and grapefruit trees to plant; which are the best and most proﬁt- able for planting with normal conditions. large, small or medium size trees. all presumably healthy? Mr. Taber—Medium are the best. Mr. Hubbard—Conditions make a dif-        135 ference. I think the more vigorous grow- ing the tree is, the better it is.  No. 8—\'V'hat is the best month in the year to plant an orange tree? Mr. W aite—November. Mr. McLain—I should say, December. Mr. Hart—May, if wet, is a pretty good month. Member—.You would not approve of May unless the rainy season had started in, would you? Mr. Hart-_In my part of the country, it is sure to start about that time.  No. 9—1 would like to know if the So ciety approves of cutting the trees back at the time of setting out? Mr. HamptonTCut them back every time. And about that planting of trees; I would prefer to plant them in the month of December to any other month in the year. Some say November. Don’t you think that is a little too soon? They are likely to start to growing and the January or February cold snap will take them in. If you plant them in December they are not so apt to start to grow.  No. 10—1 would like to ask whether it is best to use the Stringfellow method for planting on low ground? Mr. Hart—I have not had experience in that, but if the ground is low, you can- not push the roots down far. They have to grow on the surface. If there is not room above permanent water line for the tap root, little can be made in that direc- tion. I would- prefer fairly high land for planting orange trees. ' Mr. Taber—In relation to that String- fellow method, I want to say that I don't think that the Stringfellow method is a good habit to get into unless one qualiﬁes every assertion that he makes. If you take a great big tree like Mr. Hubbard would recommend planting, you can’t suc- cessfully treat it that way. _I have set Out thousands of little nursery trees and taken off all the ﬁbrous roots. It is the proper way to plant them. Line up a row, open it with a spade and stick in nothing but little sticks. But you can't do that wit-h a ﬁve or six year old tree. Member—I think the success of a new- ly set tree depends as much on the weather following the time of setting, as the meth- od of setting. As to the Stringfellow method, I would say do not prune the roots quite so close. Mr. Hume—I have seen a few attempts at setting trees by the Stringfellow meth- od which were entirely successful. I have seen some that were a dismal failure. It requires careful study of the conditions-of the soil, of the weather and of the kind of tree you are planting before you de- termine whether you are going to plant by the Stringfellow method. He makes absolutely no exception to the kind, char- acter, or size of the tree, and I think any~ one 'who follows him implicitly is going to get into pretty deep Water. Mr. Hoard—Three years ago, I moved 600 bearing trees without losing a single tree. Some of them 'had had a box of oranges the year before, and I saved all the roots I could get. Mr. Hart—I am not advocating the Stringfellow method in all cases, or any- thing of the kind. I brought the subject up to see what experience others 'had had. I am interested in it. All my early ex- perience was much in that line in the planting of trees. \Vhen I came to the east coast all of our groves were set out     6   from big, wild trees that we got from the hammocks. Some of them had no tap root and where they did. we dug down and cut them off short. We cut the large trunks 05 not over a foot high and cut the roots off close up so that a tree with a six inch trunk would go in a hole eighteen inches to two feet across. and those trees made strong, healthy and rapid growth and were in proﬁtable bearing in three years. The nursery trees were budded when set, but these were allowed to sprout and then buds were inserted in these sprouts after the trees were set in grove form. I would tell you that it is best to set out big trees. “Big” may mean six or sixty years old. You can get a ﬁne bear- ing tree very quickly if you put such out when the conditions are favorable, w‘hile small trees suffer seriously from every adverse condition and it may take several years to get them to a fair. bearing con- dition. Mr. Skinner—During the discussion, Mr. Mason sat alongside of me, and he says there is no question but that cutting off the roots will make them grow deeper. Mr. Taber—I do not think you can ap- ply the same ruling to trees of all sizes. Mr. Hart mentions citrus trees as being transplanted at any size, but there are few other trees that can be treated like a cit— rus tree, and live. I claim that a citrus root is one of the hardest things in the world to kill. Take a peach or pecan tree. for instance. Regardless of the age or size of the tree. regardless of the season it is put out—Stringfellow just makes the sweeping assertion that it should be close- ly root pruned, which I do not believe is always proper or advantageous: and that is the reason why I say that one should be careful to designate what he is talking about. If you put out trees at the begin- ning of the dormant season, you can suc- cessfully transplant a larger tree and you can prune the roots harder than you can at the time when growth should com- mence. lHe makes no exceptions at all. Mr. Hollingsworth—Mr. Hart, were not those trees you spoke of transplanted on very damp soil? Mr. Hart—They were transplanted in any kind of soil. In some places it was eleven feet to water. and in others the ground was covered with water a good deal of the time.  No. II-q-Can anyone advise concern- ing the soap tree. how it is planted and what distance apart? WVhy does not the California Pepper tree fruit here? Mr. Stevens—I have seen a soap tree growing wild around Orange Lake. That is the only place I have ever seen one in Florida. Mr. Painter—The soap berry tree has been grown near Tallahassee for years.  No. 12—1 would like to ask why the olive tree grows ﬁnely here, but does not bear any crop? Prof. Rolfs— That is a question that is as yet unsolved. Mr. Wakelin—VVe have an olive tree on our place. It bloomed very heavily and when I left home for the North it had small green olives. When I came back they had all fallen off, except a few dried up specimens. This year it has had no bloom. Mr. Hampton—The olive tree has been talked over a long while, and some seem to think they won't bear, and some con-        I37 tend that they will. I have more or less olives every year. I believe I could raise plenty of olives, but whether I could raise enough to pay commercially or not I do not know, but I have plenty for my home consumption. Prof. Rolfs——There is a place near San- ford and one just east of Malabar and Drayton Island, I think, where they fruit quite heavily. I think that the probability of making it a commercial success is a small one. Member—Does Mr. Hampton use any- thing special in the way of fertilizer? Mr. Hampton—No, I don’t use any- thing special. Member—Last year I gave my olives slacked lime, and I think I am on the right track to getting enough olives for our- selves. Mr. Hart—This matter has been pretty carefully gone over by Mr. Rooks, one of our members, who is much interested in anything of the kind. I think the general opinion is that there is but one variety of olives that fruit well in Florida. I have seen some with trunks nearly two feet through, but they never bore what you might call a full crop. I think there is one variety that will produce a fairly good crop, but do not remember what it is. Member—I live close to Mr. Rooks and see his olives, but I have never seen any- thing like a full crop. Mr. Taber—I have fruited some four or ﬁve different varieties of olives, includ- ing which are the Queen, and they do not even get to maturity, but drop before they mature. I have gotten olives from several different varieties, but would not recom— mend them for anything more than home use. . Mr. Hampton—I never had any trouble with the fruit dropping. They stayed pretty well to maturity.",,
