# Florida State Horticultural Society Annual Meeting Proceedings
 This repository contains plain text files and fascimilies of FSHS Annual Meeting Proceedings.

 ## About the Project

 This repository contains several years of proceedings from the annual meetings of the Florida State Horticultural Society (FSHS) from 1894 to 1922. This project seeks to understand the changing interests of the FSHS at the beginning of the twentieth century.

 ### Research Question

 How do the Florida State Horticultural Society's interests change over time? Do the titles of committee presentations, discussions, and special presentations reflect the changing priorities and interests of the Society in the early twentieth century?

## Change Log
-Uploaded proceedings txt files (01/25/2021)
-Uploaded index (01/26/2021)
-Struggling to find citable sources for Wikipedia page on FSHS. Fear draft may be deleted! :( (01/26/2021)
-Split Proceedings files into Prefaces &  Addresses and Papers & Presentations sections for easier searching. (02/08/2021)
-Added 1922 to Proceedings (02/08/2021)
-Really struggled with finding suitable regex to isolate sections of text at the midpoint of the Proceedings. Used Atom's Select to Top and Select to Bottom features to work around this problem for the time being, however this only worked for single year documents and is not scalable. Will have to find a solution for the multiyear documents. (02/08/2021)
