"In fighting insect and fungus pests it is first necessary that we know something of their life history, growth, transforÂ¬ mations, habits, etc., that we may more intelligently combat them. The Sooty Mould is a saprophytic fungus, deriving its nourÂ¬ ishment, not directly from the orange, as is sometimes supÂ¬ posed, but from sugary excretions exuded by certain insects, which it always follows. In Florida Sooty Mould only becomes serious when it folÂ¬ lows the White Fly, aleyrodes citric and it is with its treatÂ¬ ment in this connection that we are concerned The logical way, and apparently the only effective way to treat this disease is to destroy the insect pest which the funÂ¬ gus follows. As soon as the insects are removed and the sup- ply of honeydew. upon which the Sooty Mould lives, is* stopped, the mould will disappear without other special treatÂ¬ ment. The White Fly passes the winter in the mature larval or pupa stage, and begins to hatch out into the mature stage (Imago) about the middle of March. This year, 1894, I first, noticed them beginning to appear on the 13th of March. The eggs from the fall br. od of flies hatch about the middle or last of October. So from the middle of November till March, is. one of the long periods when the disease may best be treated. Each fly lays from twenty to twenty-five eggs. These reÂ¬ quire about three weeks for their development before they hatch out into the larval stage. Thus the eggs from the March and April brood do not begin to hatch until the middle of April, and continue, hatching till the middle ot May. The larvae from thes^ eggs continue their development till about the middle of June or first of July, when the mature flies hatch out again, and begin laving eggs for the next broody which hatches out from the middle of September to the first of October. This September brood of flies, the third brood, is the last of the season; the eggs they lay hatch out into the larval stage about the middle or last of October, and this stage continues, through the winter as described above. Considerable question yet remains as to the effect of the vaÂ¬ rious insecticides on the eggs, and while this doubt exisis it is best to arrange the times of spraying so that we do not. spray till the eggs are all, or almost all hatched out into the larval stage. As there are three periods in ihe year when the insects are in this stage, there are thus three periods when one may profitably spray for the pest. One must judge when to spray by the condition of the insect, being sure they are in the larval or pupa stages. In general, this condition is reached about three weeks or a month after the mature fl es are noÂ¬ ticed to be most abundant. While many remedies have been tried and experimented with for this pest, none have been found up to the beginning of this year which had pioved satisfactory. In our experiÂ¬ ments with this pest this season, we have tried every spray which promised success, applied in various ways. We have? tried to make our tests thorough, and believe we have sucÂ¬ ceeded in demonstrating the effectiveness of certain standard spra} T s, beyond question. In California, fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas is beÂ¬ ing used with great success against various scale insects. So successful is it, indeed, that some claim it to mark a new era in the treatment o;f sueh. diseases.. We^for this reason, made quite thorough fumigation tests on the White Fly with very excellent results. The treatment was made about the middle of February of this year (1894) and was so successful that it was only by careful search (in treatments with certain strengths of material) that one could find a living insect. Fumigation is accomplished b} 7- passing over the tree a tent of some closely woven material (eight-ounce ducking, lor inÂ¬ stance) which has been oiled and painted black, if the treatÂ¬ ment is to be made by daylight. After the tent has been placed over the tree the edges are held down by a few shovelÂ¬ fuls of earth thrown on here and there. The operator now places under the tent in an earthen or glass jar, the material for generating the gas. For this purpose crude potassium cyÂ¬ anide, commercial sulphuric acid and water are used in varyÂ¬ ing quantities, according to the size of the tree. A tree sixÂ¬ teen feet high, and having a spread of twelve feet will require about eight ounces of potassium cyanide, eight fluid ounces of sulphuric acid and sixteen fluid ounces of water. The water and sulphuric acid are placed together in the earthen vessel and placed by the operator under the tent. The potassium C} 7 anide is then dropped in, and the operator quickly withÂ¬ draws from the tent, closes the opening, and allows the treatÂ¬ ment to continue for thirty to forty minutes. The tent is then removed and the operation is complete. To work this method economical!} 7- , from four to six tents must be used in order to keep the laborers busy during the delay, while the gas is acting. Careful descriptions of the methods for fumigation are given in the various bulletins and reports of the Division of EntomÂ¬ ology of the United States Department of Agriculture. The latest of these are: The Gas Treatment for Red Scale, BulÂ¬ letin 23, Division of Entomology; Hydrocyanic Acid Gas as an Insecticide, Insect life, volume VI., (1893) page 176; and A Hew Fumigator for Scale Insects, Insect Life, valume V., page 328. The above articles were prepared by Dr. W. D Co- quillette, the originator of the gas method of treating insects. Prof. A. H. Morgan, of the Louisiana Agricultural ExperiÂ¬ ment Station, Baton Rouge, has given a plain account of the methods of fumigation in a special bulletin: On the Orange and other Citrus Fruits. The details of application would require too much time for their explanation, to consider further here. We can say posÂ¬ itively, however, that this method of treatment is veiy effectÂ¬ ive. All of you have sprayed trees and know how hard it is to reach all portions of the tree, and in treating such a pest as this, every insect must be covered by the spray to be killed. Many thus escape, no matter how thorough we spray. After putting twenty-five gallons of spray On a tree twenty-five feet high, I have yet found hundreds of leaves un wet on the under surface of the leaves where, in this case, they must be wet if the spray is to be effective, as the larva and pupa of the fly limit themselves almost exclusively to the under surface. The gas treatment, however, overcomes this difficulty, as the gas will penetrate to all portions where the air can reach, to every leaf under overhanging portions of bark, etc. Itis the nature of this method which makes it so effective in a single treatÂ¬ ment. In fumigation, some care must be exercised, as the potasÂ¬ sium cyanide and hydrocyanic cas fumes are poisonous. In actual work, however, there is almost no danger if judgment is exercised. 0 Of the various sprays experimented with, kerosene emulsion is the one which has been most widely recommended as an effective spray for this pest. Our experiments show kerosene emuMon to be fairly effective, killing a large number of the insects, but that is by no means so effective as the so-called rosin washes. The rosin washes are also much cheaper than the kerosene emulsion, and are easier prepared if one follows the method we now use in its preparation. Rosin wash, according to the formula usually given, is preÂ¬ pared by using 70 per cent, caustic soda, and requires several hours (from two to three), boiling. This long boiling has been a feature against the wash, preventing use. I have found that by using the 98 per cent, caustic soda one may shorten the time of boiling with apparently as good results. Our formÂ¬ ula and method oi preparation is as follows: Rosin.20 lbs. Caustic, soda, 98 per cent.4f lbs. Fisli oil.8 pints, Water to ma<e.150 gals. Directions for preparing washâ€”Place rosin, caustic soda and fiffi oil in a large kettle and pour over them about fifteen gallons of water. Boil this mixture till the rosin is thorÂ¬ oughly dissolved. Pour into spray tank and dilute to 150 gallons (this requires adding about 135 gallons more water). Apply on plants in rather a coarse spray. The material after boiling may be diluted while warm as well as after it cools, but if allowed to cool, a fine precipitate of soap forms, and this must be stirred up on diluting it, so as to be thorougly disÂ¬ solved. This spray may be preserved in a concentrated form for some time before using if desired. When the material is removed from the fire after boiling, pour in sufficient water to make up for that which has evapo- rated in the boiling, making exactly fifteen gallons. This is now preserved in this strength. As it cools a copious fine precipitate forms which gradually settles to the bottom of the receptacle which contains the preparation. When it is deÂ¬ sired to use the spray, stir the preparation thoroughly to uniÂ¬ formly mix this precipitate, then measure out and dilute in the proportions of one part of the preparation to nine parts of water. The secret of the failures that have resulted from using the rosin wash spray, have been from using poor materials. I would recommend that the 98 per cent, caustic soda be used in preparing the wash, as â€¢ by so doing we may, as shown above, very much shorten the lime necessary to prepare the wash, and thus cheapen it. This rosin wash would more properly be called a rosin soap, as a double soap is formed in its preparation, a rosin soap andf a fish oil soap. If we reduce the amount of water which we add in boiling the material, we have a nearly solid soap formed of about the consistency of the common soft soap manufactÂ¬ ured by housewives. The material could be used in this form* but requires rather too much stirring to dissolve it, to render this method of preparation practical. Rosin can be purchased in Jacksonville at from $1 to $1.50 per barrel of 275 pounds. Crude fish oil can be purchased in New York or PhiladelÂ¬ phia for from thirty to forty cents per gallon. Ninety-eight per cent, caustic soda can be purchased in New York or Philadelphia for from to 5^ cents per pound. The cost of making the wash would thus be as follows: 20 pounds rosin, at per pound.10c. 3 pints fish oil at 5c (40c per gallon).15 4 | lbs. 98per cent, caustic soda, at 5jc.. ..22 Cos' for 50 gal ons... 47c. The wash as prepared to put on the trees would thus cost approximately one-third cents per gallon. The wash is easily handled, runs through the pump easy,, spreads on the leaves well and is very effective. An equivalent amount of caustic potash could probably be used in place of the caustic soda, but I have not yet had an opportunity to try this. If it should prove successful, howÂ¬ ever, as I mistrust it will, even considering the value of the- fertilizer thus added to- the field, the spray will not be mateÂ¬ rially lessened in cost. Discussion on Citrus Insects and Insecticides. C. F. A. Bielby â€”I would like to ask Prof. Weber if he has given the whole formula for the rosin wash? Prof. Webber â€”Yes, I have given the whole formula which in our tests with different strengths we found could be reÂ¬ duced to 150 gallons and yet be very effective for the White fly, and will probably also prove effective for the six-spotted mite, scale insects and plant lice. Lyman Phelps â€”Have you tried it on the Black scale? Prof. Webber â€”It has been tried on the Black scale in CalÂ¬ ifornia, I believe, but I have had no opportunity to make such tests. Mr. Phelps â€”I would say that Prof. Mead and I tried it last year on the Black scale and it did not work. Prof. Webber â€”I was not aware that the Black scale ocÂ¬ curred in Florida. Mr. Phelps â€”We have had it at Orlando and Oviedo. Prof. Webber â€”I have not observed it in Florida yei. Mr. Bielby â€”I would like to ask the Professor if I have the formula correct, as follows: Twenty pounds of rosin, 4 2-7 pounds of caustic soda (98 per cent.), and 3 pinis of fish oil. Put in a kettle with 15 gallons of water and boil until the rosin is thoroughly dissolved; then dilute with cold water. Is this com ci? Prof. Webberâ€” Yes, that is correct. I would like to add further that- the Red scale ( Aspidiotus Ficus), which is probÂ¬ ably the worst, scale pest ot the orange in Florida, other than the White fly, may probably be controlled by the rosin washes. The soap or wash when made will keep for an indefÂ¬ inite period. The samples exhibited here today were preÂ¬ pared last Saturday, and are as good now as then, and will be as good a year hence. A. L. Duncan â€”I wish to say that I have us. d i his rosin and fish oil wash for about three years extensively. The formÂ¬ ula came to me from California, and I have tried it at all seaÂ¬ sons of the year. I have been preparing it just the way the Professor gives, excepting that I use pounds of rosin and 6 '80 2J pounds of soda. I also use the Starr Ball Potash, or the Sterling Ball Potash, from which I get equally as good reÂ¬ sults. It takes a little longer to boil it. I always put it in the tank hot. I use a 150-gallon tank. It is the most effectÂ¬ ive remedy we ever had for scale. I tried it on the ladj^-bug, immersing the bug in the solution, and it would afterward fly away. I tried it on the grasshopper, also, but they were not injured by it. The effect on the Round scale is that it turns black and drops off in a few days. It is better than kerosene emulsion. It covers the tree over, but the rain finally washes it off. It takes me quite a liule time, however, to prepare this wash. Prof. Webber â€”What did you dilute it with; warm water? Mr. Duncan â€”> es, sir. Prof. Webber â€”Afier you have the material mixed up, what is the proportion of dilution that you use? Mr. Duncan â€”The same as yours. I use a little less of the rosin. Prof. Webber â€”Do you merely dilute one part to one part, as in the formula generally given? Mr. Duncan â€”I put in about five gallons of the preparation to make fifty gallons of spray. Prof. Webber â€”One of the points I make in regard to my method of preparing the wash is that in using 98 per cent, caustic soda one can prepare it with so short a boiling and then dilute it more times than in the usual formula, that is, one part to nine. Mr. Duncan â€”There is one thing y3u all ought to know. It would not be well to apply the spray when the fruit is young, as it will neutralize tne acid. I once had an experiÂ¬ ence of this kind. I followed the advice of a California writer. The acid of the fruit was completely neutralized. We did not know until the fruit was matured what was the matter, or what caused it. We found out that it was this spray. Do not put the spray on at this time of the year, and not until the fruit is of considerable size. About June is the proper time, I think. Prof. Webber â€”In spraying for the White fly } 7 ou would necessarily make the first applications before the fruit comes on. You should make your first applications probably in January or February. The second period of spraying comes from about the middle of May to the middle of June. This spraying could be delayed until the fruit had become quite large. In treating other scale insects you can change the time. I was not, however, aware that any injury of this sort was produced by the rosin washes. C. A. Bacon â€”Would it not be more effective to spray imÂ¬ mediately afier the flies disappear when the scale is more tender? Would they not be more tender after the laying of the egg? Prof. Webber â€”I would wait until the eggs are hatched. The eggs are protected by a coating which it is hard to penÂ¬ etrate. Mr. Bielby â€”I would like to ask the Professor if he has any reason to suppose that the injury to the quality of the fruit which Mr. Duncan speaks of was due to this wash? Prof. Webber â€” I have not before heard of such injury bp- in g produced by washes of this kind. Mr. Bielby â€”Have you ever heard that they hurt the qualÂ¬ ity of the orange? Prof. Webberâ€”I have not, but such things do not always get into print. One of the main reasons for which the rosin wash is recommended is that it will kill scales much better when they are attached to the fruits than other insecticides, especially kerosene emulsion. This would indicate that they are at least not known to produce injury to the fruits. H. VV. Marsh â€”I would like to say r that Mr. J. E. Wilbur, of South Lake Weir, and Mr. Tilson, of Orange Bend, have told me that they are using Thrip juice, and that they hnve shipped their fruit a month earlier than usual, which they atÂ¬ tribute to the effects of Thrip juicÂ«. This was reported by two different men, who had no connection with each other at all. Some one asked Prof. Webber what effect Thrip juice had on the scale. Prof. Webber â€” I have not tried it on any scale insect exÂ¬ cept the White fly. Here it did not give satisfactory results, and cannot be recommended. A. D. Moore â€”I met a gentleman on the train who told me that he had eradicated the White fly with Thrip juice. Mr. Warren â€”I tried Thrip juice three years ago and found that it killed the White fly. Last year they came in great numbers a second time. I tried Thrip juice again and the first application finished them all. L. Montgomery â€”When the oranges matured were they full of acid? Mr. Warren â€”Yes, every one that tasted them said they were exceedingly nice and sweet. Mr. Duncan â€”I have a word to say about bi-sulphate of soda. I know two men that used this stuff on their trees and their oranges were worthless. One of them, Mr. Hoyt, gave me a sample of his oranges, and there was no acid in them at all. 1 take the position that bi-sulphate of soda will neutralÂ¬ ize the acid in the fruit. Edward Winterâ€” The spreading of diseases and insects- of the citrus is a matter of such serious importance that it seems to me we should make some effort to prevent it. I have recently seen nursery stock badly infested, if we can take steps to prevent such pests being disseminated I think we should do it. Mr. Bacon â€”It cannot be done. It is impracticable. These- troubles are spread in many ways we cannot reach or control. Take the smut for instance; it thrives anywhere, it will even- grow on potatoes. Five years ago I discovered it < n the palmetto trees about my place. It spread quite rapidly, but for a year I did not see any on my bearing orange trees,. Then I began to see a little on my large trees, and the third year 1 began to get worried. The tiees bloomed well, but dropped their fruit, dead limbs began to appear, a great many leaves dropped off; in the fall you coul 1 see through Mandarin trees that formerly you could not thrust your arm into. The fourth year I got a spraying outfit and went to 1 work. I used a lime and sulphur solution, the recipe can be obtained from the Farmer and Fruit Grower. Mr. Duncan â€”A good deal of the smut found upon orange and other trees is not produced by, or rather does not follow the White fly. We had smut on orange trees before we ever heard of the White fly. This smut is easily destroyed by the rosin wash. G. P. Healy â€”Some time since I supposed I had the White fly. I was discouraged. The grove seemed in a bad fix, and the fruit was getting very black. Ab >ut that time Prof. Webber arrived. We examined the trees and in my case the sooty mould was found to be following the wax srale instead of the White fly. It was a bad case, but I used Thrip juice and cleaned almost all the smut off the trees. The owner of one grove we visited while Prof. Webber was at my place said he had had the smut (but not following the White fly) and had gotten rid of it by the use of tobacco juice. At another place we found the sooty mould following the White fly* and the owner assured us that he had not succeeded in finding anything that was effective in destroying it. Prof. Webber â€”In reg trd to tobacco juice: The trees Maj. Healy and I saw did seem to be effected by the tobacco juice, but to what extent it had been effective as a remedy for the sooty mould could not be determined. I tried tobacco- juice in Tour different strengths on the White fly, in my experiments at Gainesville. The solution is apparently imÂ¬ practicable, as it kills only about 15 per cent, of the larvae or pupa of the fly. Continuing in reply to the question of a member: I consider the rosin wash or rosin soap, discussed in my remarks on the subject, as probably the best remedy for the White fly. I learn from inquiry that this pest appar- vently first became serious at Panasoffkee. It appeared there ^some seventeen or eighteen years ago. H. B. Stephens â€”I have a grove at Panasoflkee, started about five years ago. Shortly afterward the White fly apÂ¬ peared. I did not know what it was at first, but found later That it was the White fly, and that it was the worst enemy we thad. They spread very easily ; the trains undoubtedly carry Them from one section to another. Last year we commenced operations against the White fly. We burned tobacco, sulÂ¬ phur and Dalmation powder under the trees, confining the fumes by a tnnt over the trees, but did not find this effective, rand confined ourselves to tobacco juice and sulphur solution. In the fall there was no smut on the fruit, and I felt that I had accomplished something. This spring Prof. Webber came through and examined the trees and he said he did not find any living insects on them. Mr. Duncan â€”How to destroy the White fly is what we all want to know. This rosin wash acts like a varnish and will be more lasting than anything else. Sulphur solution will dry and wash ofi the tree, but the rosin wash will last two or three weeks unless t he rains are very heavy. I think the rosin wash is the best for the White fly. Mr. Bacon â€”I think, myself, that the rosin wash is the most effective of the two ; but the sulphur and lime solution does not wash off immediately. You can smell the sulphur Tor months after an application. Geo. R. Fairbanks â€”I wish to say something about insect pests. 1 came to Florida fifty years ago. The orange trees had been previously cut to the ground by the cold. They had grown up rapidly from the roots and about the time they came into bearing again I was at St. Augustine. At this time the scale insect appeared. It was said to have been brought in upon trees imported from Italy. In the course of five years it had attacked every tree at St. Augustine and along the St. Johns river. The trees looked as if a fire had gone through them, and everybody said there was no use tryÂ¬ ing to do anything with them. They left them alone. In a â– few years, from some cause or other, the insects disappeared .and orange culture revived. It was said that the insect had been introduced from Nice. Application was made though the State Department for information regarding it. It was found that they did not know anything about it in Italy. Finally an old man was found who had some knowledge of it; and an old book was also found (which l>ook I have) which treated of this pest as it had appeared in the neighborhood of Nice, and went on to say that all the oranges were blighted and going to destruction and proposed certain remedies. The fact I wish to call attention to is that this pest once so much feared at Nice is no longer known as a serious enemy there. This pest, so prevalent here fifty years ago, which we have had since 1842 and which we know now in a modified degree, has not proved a serious obsticle to the development of our orange industry. In view of these facts, I do not think we need fear that our orange industry is going to perish, or even suffer serious injury from the ravages of these enemies of more recent introduction which have been referred to."
