"For several years I have given considerable time and thought to study of the derivation of the citrus, and compar¬ ison of varieties of the different species both bv field study and analysis of qualities by a scale of points. At the DeLand meeting of the society I informally brought to its notice a chart that gives a bird’s eye view of the derivation and devel¬ opment of the four primary species and their crosses or vari¬ eties. These primary species, like the thornapple of temper¬ ate climates, still grow wild in the East Indies, the native home of all the citrus, being all unedible, and are the fingered citron, the wild lime, the citrus trifoliata, and limonia or cit¬ rus acidijsima.           The sour orange, familiar to all, is a representative of the lime family, though a hybrid many degrees improved over its original parent.  Most orange growers are acquainted with the fruit of the deciduous citrus trifoliata, which gives the musky flavor of fruit and hardy habit ot' the mandarin family, but as few have seen the fruit of the red limonia, which is the parent of the shaddocks, Tangerines and blood oranges, and the fingered citron, which has given the sweet edible character to all the citrus fruits, I took special pains while attending the Colum¬ bian Exposition, to find specimens in the East Indian exhibit, and was so fortunate as to secure the citron and limonia of of the Siamese Royal Commissioner, and I take pleasure in showing these specimens to the society, for fortunately they are preserved in syrup, and retain perfectly their form and much of their color. The fingered citron, you will observe, is composed of loosely adhering lobes or segments without any central core, and these segments are almost entirely covered with peel and contain no edible juice. They are only used in the east like a boquet of flowers, for the sweet odor they exhale.  This citron hybridizing with, and breeding up from the lime has developed two strains of fruit. The first are oranges, which retain the form of the lime but the sweetness of the cit¬ ron. The highest bred examples we have are the navel and early oblong oranges, which you will observe in a general way have the same form as this citron. The second strain is the commercial lime and lemon family, which retains the modified acid of the wild lime, but the color and oblong form of the cit- son. This citron, progressively crossing with the citrus tri¬ foliata, has developed ilie loose segmented mandarin orange. And, again, the citron and limonia crosses have produced the shaddocks and Malta blood oranges, which latter especially, closely copies the form of the limonia. It must not be under¬ stood that I suppose any of the hybrids we have to-day as being primary crosses, or even as resembling the fruit that would result from an equal blending of the qualities of any of these wild primary species, for the tendency of hybrids is to produce unedible monstrosities, and it is only the careful se¬ lection and cultivation by man through ages of time of the gradual improving varieties which have crossed and inter¬ crossed with each other, that has given us the well nigh per¬ fect fruit we possess to-day. Therefore, in listing oranges, I follow nanure’s grand divisions and make but four varieties: The citron or sweet China, the lime or Portugal, the shaddock or Malta blood, and the trifoliata or mandarin oranges.  As preliminary to the work of the Cataloguing Committee      I have, un^er these four varieties, listed some fifty-five sub¬ varieties of oranges of those in general cultivation having commercial merit, for many of the so-called varieties so nearly resemble each other that an expert can not possibly tell them apart. I append these lists, the names being set as nearly as possible in the ordinary sequence of edible maturity.

After the reading of the above Prof. J. H. Webber said: I notice Mr. Hubbard gives possessive names of the different varieties. One of the rules of the American Pomological So¬ ciety is that we should not use possessive names in naming fruits, and according to that rule Mr. Boone has changed the name of his variety to Boone. 1 merely make this as a sug¬ gestion.  Replying, Mr. Hubbard said: In listing these names I have given them as they are listed by the nurserymen. In cataloguing these fruits the society can take any action it chooses."
