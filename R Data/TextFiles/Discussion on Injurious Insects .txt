"v ' i G. P. Healy â€”I would like to ask Prof. Rolfs if there is danger of importation of Gypsy moths on apples and potaÂ¬ toes? Prof. Rolfs â€”There is not a great deal of danger of imÂ¬ portation on the fruit. They secrete their eggs on bark and trees. There is more danger of importing it with packed fruit. They will lay their eggs in straw. In potatoes there is very little danger at all, but we should be very careful of this moth because it is a destructive enemy. . Mr. Healy â€”I understand, then, there would be danger in buying seed from Gypsy moth districts. Prof. Rolfs â€”Yes, sir; in the packing there would be danÂ¬ ger. G. W. Mellish, Vice-President (presiding)â€”I would like to hear from some of the other members. Prof. Rolfsâ€” I would like to say that our chairman is fa- imiliar with a very serious pest in his district, that is, the ,San Jose scale, and I am sure the Horticultural Society <would like to hear what is being done to exterminate the scale. . Mr. Mellishâ€”I am not very familiar with the scale menÂ¬ tioned. I was not aware that such a scale was in existence .until Prof. Rolfs came into my neighborhood. We knew ithat some trees were dying, and it was a year or two before . â– *. . â€¢â€¢â€¢ - .-w . â€¢ f* .'V ~ we knew what was the matter. I do not know much about it; all I do know is that it is a very destructive pest. I dp pot know that I can give any information on the subject. I reÂ¬ ceived notice a short time since that the Department of Agri~ culture would issue a bulletin on that subject, and it would be well for anyone interested in fruits of any kind to secure that bulletin so that they might know the pest when they saw it. The sooner it is killed the better. Prof. Rolfs â€”When the scale is abundant it causes the tree to look whiter than usual, though you would not notice it ten feet away. A badly infested tree may be recognized at a considerable distance; appearances are like that of a starved tree, often only a branch or half of the tree is atÂ¬ tacked, then the appearance is quite striking. If the tree is only slightly infested it is quite difficult to discover. When the scale is abundant the bark is completely covered with it. Some one has said that they pile on six deep, and this seems almost literally true in bad cases. There are a number of scale insects that resemble this one, but this is the most deÂ¬ structive one on our deciduous fruits. It is so small that it requires close looking to make it out. When full grown, it is circular in outline with a dark prominence in the center. These points may be seen by the use of a hand lens, or ordiÂ¬ nary magnifying glass. It breeds continuously throughout the warm weather. The females being wingless prevents it from spreading except in the larval state. Birds, horses or mules while plowing, or the owner himself while working his orchard may carry the young insects from tree to tree. The young, or active, insects are scarcely discernible with the unÂ¬ aided eye. Their color is a honey yellow. We should do all we could to stamp out this scale, for it is very destructive and will soon spread to other portions of our state. Mr. Healy â€” I would like to have a description of the scale from Prof. Rolfs. Prof. Rolfs â€”When the scale is abundant it causes the tree to look whiter. You would not notice it ten feet away,, but when you get close and hold it up by the end you will notice it is a little, round, whitish scale. You will find that it is nearly circular, and on the top it has a little prominence, a very peculiar form that belongs to that class of scales. There are two or three scales that resemble it, but the little prominence is peculiar to it. They pile right on top of the tree right over one another. The leaves are starved to death. They simply look as if the tree did not have fertilizer enough. You will say that it got struck by the cold or that you had not enough fertilizei; pf the right kind. It is hard to> tell what is the matter with the tree. It is very readily over- looked. It has no particular season for breeding. You will find young and half-grown ones all the year round as long as the weather is warm enough. They may be dormant for a few weeks in cold weather. We should try to stamp it out, for it is very destructive and it will spread. Mr. Healy â€”Does it attack the leaves ? Prof. Rolfs â€”I have never seen it on the leaves. It usually attacks the young branches. My work with it has been just after the leaves have come on the tree. I would not say that it does not attack the leaves, but the especial damage is done to the limbs of the peach, the pear and the various forms of plum it attacks. It has not been known to hurt a citrus tree. It does not like the citrus. Mr. Healy â€”Have you ever seen it on the pecan or JapanÂ¬ ese chestnut? Prof. Rolfs â€”I know of no case that has been reported on those trees. I will say that on these trees there is a scale belonging to the same genus, but it is a larger insect. Mr. Healy â€”I heard a gentleman say to-day that he had Japanese chestnuts and that they made a perfect shell, but in the shell of the nut there was nothing but a little mould. That was all he could get. Now I got perfect fruit from my trees. Is there any insect that will cause that ? Prof. Rolfs â€”What are the conditions? Is it a tree stand* ing off by itself? Mr. Healy â€”Mr. Brown will tell us about this. A. H. Brownâ€”I have a row of these trees. I think there are ten or a dozen in a row. They are set in the center of a young grove, and receive the same cultivation that the orÂ¬ anges do. Prof. Rolfs â€”I asked this question because, as is well known to horticulturists, the pistilate and stamenate flower* of the chestnut are borne on separate trees, and if you happen to get a grove of trees that produce only pistilate flowers, there will be burrs without fruit. I have seen this happen with the wild chestnut. Mr. Brown â€”Where is the stock secured from which the Japanese chestnuts are grown ? Mr. Rolfs â€”I am not familiar with this. Mr. Taber may be able to tell us. G. L. Taber â€”The Japanese chestnut is generally sent out as a seedling. There have been a good many grafting trees sent out and they were good, but the seedlings generally proÂ¬ duce nothing. The nuts are generally about the same. As 102 to the stock upon which we have grafted the horse chestnut, the American horse chestnut will grow upon the chincopin, but I think the horse chestnut is most generally used as a stock when the chestnuts are grafted, but any chestnut can be used as a stock. As to whether Mr. Brownâ€™s trees are grafted or seedlings, I do not know that that w ould make any differÂ¬ ence. If the trees were grafted it would depend on the kind of trees from which they were grafted. I have some seedÂ¬ lings that have produced well. For the first year or two there were a good many nuts, like Mr. Brown mentions. There was no kernel in the nut. For the last few years we have had good fruit. Mr. Brown â€”Did they not form a perfect shell ? Mr. Taber â€”They did. J. T. Stubbsâ€” I would like to make a motion for the apÂ¬ pointment of a committee on legislation. I would ask that a, -committee be appointed to look into the legislation against the importation of vegetable insects. This morning we have heard a good deal about trouble with diseases and insects, a,nd the evidence is that most of them have been imported into the United States. Some states have a quarantine law against the importation of these insects. It may be necessary that we have legislation on that subject to make us safer. I would ask that a committee on legislation be appointed. Mr. Healy â€”If I understand you, it is a committee to inÂ¬ vestigate and report upon legislation for the purpose of reÂ¬ stricting the importation of diseases and insects. Mr. Stubbs â€”Yes, sir. Mr. Mellishâ€”W ould it not be well to limit the duties of that committee ? Mr. Stubbs â€”Their duties would be limited, being confined to the investigation of legislation on the importation of disÂ¬ ease and insects. Prof. Rolfs â€”In the paper that I presented to the society I mentioned the fact that we have a number of states in this country that have passed such laws. Some of those laws are good and some are not good. The idea I had in mind in preÂ¬ senting this report was that we might appoint a committ e to ascertain what laws on this subject are in force elsewhere and what effect they had; to consider the advisability of the adopÂ¬ tion of restrictive laws in this state; possibly to recommend something of this kind in this state; at least to bring the subÂ¬ ject belore the society in shape to be discussed intelligently. Motion carried."
