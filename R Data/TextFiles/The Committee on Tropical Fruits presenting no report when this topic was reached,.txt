"This afternoon I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Thomas E. Richards of Eden, called the â€œPineapple King of Florida.â€ No doubt the society would lik*? to hear from him. Mr. Richards â€”I suppose 1 am appointed to represent the poor â€œking.â€ 1 was not brought up to make speeches. FourÂ¬ teen years ago I came from Little Jersey to the Indian River country and went to growing pines. I have made considerÂ¬ able success at it. Unlike tiie Niagara grape growers we do get some returns from our fruit. I have been growing pineÂ¬ apples for fourteen years, and I think it is a better industry to-day than it was fourteen years ago, and the prospects are that it will continue to be better. We have been handicapped by lack of proper transportation. Our fruit would break down in transit, but at the present time we have very good facilities for shipping, and we can let our fruit get thorÂ¬ oughly ripe before shipping to New York and the eastern markets. We get better prices than formerly. I think there is room for others in the industry. If } r ou are going to give up grapes come down and try pineapples. The President â€”There are a good many of us who want pineapples, not particularly to compete with your market, but for home market. Mr. Richards â€”In that case I think the best way would be to send down our way for them. It is quite a story to tell the whole mode of cultivation of the pine. I do not think I would like to take up that much time. C. F. A. Bielby â€”Mr. Richards, this is just what we all want to know. Mr. Richards â€”You will find that you cannot plant the pineapple where there is any frost, yet we do not claim to be below the frost line. Poor scrub land with plenty of spruce pine on it is good enough for pineapple growing. That is the kind of land our fruit is planted upon principally. H. S. Williamsâ€” Tell us something about the varieties you are growing. Mr. Richardsâ€” We plant the Spanish pine, the Strawberry pine and the Egyptian Queen. These are the best and most successful. The other varieties are troubled by the red spiÂ¬ der and are not so successful. We plant from ten to sixteen thousand plants to the acre. It costs in the neighborhood of $300 to grub the land and get it in condition, set out the plants, pay for them, take care of them and fertilize them until they fruit, which takes about two years. I refer to the Strawberry and Spanish pines. The first year about 90 per cent, of the plants fruit, and the second year we get about two pines for each plant set. If the fruit is well fertilized and cared for it will average about sixty to the crate. Last year I realized about $4.50 per crate, net. If you want to go into the business come down into our country. A. H. Martin â€”Something has been said about the grape being planted in the swamps and I know that pineapples are planted in the swamps. What kind of land should pines have, Mr. Richards ? Mr. Richards â€”Pretty good sand. They will not grow in swamp land and they do not want any water. The pineapple is built for a dry country, and if you will notice the plant you will see the peculiar formation of the leaves or stems, which seem to be made to catch and absorb moisture from the atÂ¬ mosphere. They get plenty of dew and do not need much rain. If you wiil examine a growing pineapple early in the morning vou will find that the leaves are full of water. Mr. Williams â€”I remember as far back as 1814, when the first pineapple in our section bloomed, it was a great curiosity; people came for fifty miles to see that pineapple growing;, that was the first effort to grow the fruit in that section, and it is wonderful what strides have been made. I took a trip to Lake Worth last summer and stopped at Mr. Richardsâ€™ place. The varieties I grew vvere the Red Spanish, and up to 1886 I made quite a success of growing pines. I had a home market for all I could grow, and I had a compliment, paid me by a lady who said that my fruit was the first she had ever eat without sugar. The freeze of 1886 gave pineapple culture at Rockledge a black eye from which it has not reÂ¬ covered, but the lands about Jensen, Eden and St. Lucie are to-day as valuable as any lands in the state of Florida, and as Mr. Richards says, the lands there that produce the spruce pine have been found the best for pineapples. The pineapples growing around Jensen were a picture to look at. On level ground you could see acre a'ter acre, and I consider that that, industry is going to be the most profitable of auy industry in the state. There is one objection to the Indian River counÂ¬ try ; there are too many mosquitoes. Mr. Phelps â€”Mr. Richards, does the Abakka pine grow in your section successfully ? Mr, Richards â€”It does very well. We grow plenty of them, but we never try to ship them to Northern markets. Mr. Phelpsâ€” I never got so much off a small space as I did off pineapples, but in 1886 I went to pieces on pineapples and have never tried them since. There is no question that a heavy frost will play havoc with and will ruin a pineapple plantation. There is another quality of the pineapple and a very important one, which should not be lost sight of. Years ago I used the pine as part of my food. I thrived on it. It is readily and easily assimilated. One of the best known chemical companies in the United States to-day has begun to put up a plant in Mexico which will cost thousands of dollars to grow pines simply for the use that can be made of them in medicine and to produce a free- digesting food that can be taken up into the blood without any action of the stomach. I investigated thoroughly the properties of the pineapple some years ago, aud I can say that this fruit is next to fresh beef in nutritive qualities. This chemical company has selected Mexico for its plant as being more of an even climate. They are going to put up food that will make lean people fat in a very short time. It is easily digested and is preferable to fresh meat. It is in the form of a syrup. The industry is in its infancy. I look forward to more results from the pine in that direction than I do to the pine being consumed at the table. 0. P. Rooks â€” I have a neighbor who claims that he has had dyspepsia for twenty years, and there is no food or fruit that he c^n eat with as much relish as the pineapple. He states that when the pineapple season is on he has no disturbances from his complaint because he then eats the pine, I have been raising pines for fifteen years. Even t v, e freeze of 1886 did not break me up. My place is four miles from Leesburg. I gathered two elegant pines this morning We h*ve twenty varieties and they all seem to be doing fairly well. The large varieties do not seem to do as well as the Queen. We plant under protection. We put up a rough shed and cover that with pine straw as a protection against frost. Pine stiaw that is used during the wimer can be put round fruit trees. Wherever the pineapples have been planted out trees are doÂ¬ ing much better than elsewhere. I have doubled the crop of fruit where the pineapples have been planted. There is one idea that Mr. Richards advances and that is that sand is absoÂ¬ lutely necessary. My land has a clay sub soil from two to six feet down and the pines do well. I have raised pineapples weighing ten pounds, and this fruit has been as profitable as anything I have ever raised on my place, I believe that in our section of the country (Lake county) every farmer and grower should have a patch of pineapples for his own use. When it is thoroughly ripe it is a delicious fruit, as much so â– Sis any that can be had. These pineapples that we pick green and ship are not of a very fine flavor when they do ripen. People do not like the taste of them. People are going into pines extensively and there seems to be a great deal of trouble in getting slips. A gentleman told me to day that he had 150 acres under cultivation, and he was thinking of putting out all of it in pineapples. The matter of transportation facilities is also a troublesome question. Mr. Plant has opened up a a st eamship line to the tropical regions, Jamaica and the south, and in view of the competition from the West Indies, I do not know where we will be after awhile. Unless transportation matters improve I am afraid we will be run out of the busiÂ¬ ness. Mr. Phelps â€”It is not well to cross bridges before we get to them. I have great faith in what Mr. Flagler says and he says he is going to build further down into the state. ReÂ¬ ferring again to the medicinal qualities of the pineapple: I think the time has come for us to realize that there is nothing so eloquent as the truth, and the simple truth should be told of the climate of Florida. I came to this state as an invalid. I respect the state. I have been sick in the last eighteen months, and I have been told again and again that I would not live long, but I am living and strong to-day. There are plants that grow in Florida that will cure almost any disease. You should all understand what your systems need. After going through a very trying year and not knowing what made me sick, I am up again and on my feet and ready to work, almost. I say to you that the pineapple and the fig are preÂ¬ eminently the food for this climate. Those two things are worth more as food than anything else, but they want to be ripe fruit, not green. Unripe fruit is not good for the stomÂ¬ ach and the acid of such fruit is irritating. The acid of ripe fruits is all healthful. Yo food or fruit is equal to the pineÂ¬ apple. I do not think we can raise pines where there is frost in the air to compete with the lower part of the state. I have kept a record for forty years and it is very interesting to me to studv the records of the barometer and the thermometer, and I have learned a great many things from this systematic study. The question of Orlando has been brought up. I have resided in Orange county twenty years. There are .places near that town where pineapples have been planted and grow so luxuriously that in going through the country in my buggy I have had to stand on the seat. I have never advised any man to invest one dollar in Florida until he came to look at it and get advice from the men in the community in which he desired to locate. I say that I have more than made a living in the state by my efforts, and I propose to stick to it. Mr. Richards â€”I have been asked how long a pineapple plantation would stand. I must say I have not been in the business long enough to know. I haye been at it fourteen years and I have plants growing yet and they do better to-day than they did five years ago. All that is necessary is attenÂ¬ tion and plenty of fertilizer to make them last an indefinite period. Use phosphate (Florida soft phosphate ground and dried,) potash (derived from kanit and cotton seed meal); that makes a cymplcte fertilizer. My pineapple plants bear all the year. â€ž I have shipped a good many in the winter. The new ones come on in the summer. We plant about 16,000 to the acre. When the plants are two years old we get from 200 to 300 per cent, and we get less after t hat. Speaking of the pineapple being a good medicine for indiÂ¬ gestion, I found out long ago that the pineapple was a good medicine, and when I came to Florida I was a dyspeptic, but I am not now. When I can get a good ripe pineapple to eat I do not have indigestion. Mr. Rooks â€”If I understand correctly the captain states he plants 16,000 pineapple plants to the acre; the first year they will average 60 per cent, in fruit; the second year from 200 to 300 per cent. Do I understand that in the second year they will produce from thirty to forty thousand apples to the acre ? Mr. Richards â€”The first year they produce 90 per cent, and the second year they will produce 300 per cent. Mr. Rooks â€”You plant 16,000 plants to the acre? Mr. Richards â€”Yes, sir. Mr. Rooks â€”That is 45,000 apples the second year. I canÂ¬ not raise it on my ground. Mr. Richards â€”Some of myr plants have five to six apples on them. Mr. Rooks â€”I could never do that. I would like to ask Mr. Martin if he is acquainted with the character of the land that Mr. Russell has. Mr. Martin â€”It is dry land. Mr. Rooks â€”I remember visiting his place once, but it apÂ¬ peared to me that the land was swampy. Mr. Martin â€”His place was on wet land. It has been thoroughly drained. It is rich, good land. Mr. Rooks â€”I would like to know the best kind of fertilÂ¬ izer to use. I have used fertilizers that are prepared for the orange trees on my pineapples. It has a wonderful effect on my orange trees and on the oranges. My pines are planted about two to three feet apart. All the plants I got from the Indian River country had the mealy bugs. Something deÂ¬ stroyed them; I do not know what. I have none now. I do not know what the cure was. Mr. Richards â€”The fertilizer I mentioned is the best. I do not know what killed out your mealybugs. We are not troubled by them. Gf. P. Healy â€”I would like to ask Mr. Richards if he has any difficulty with the stem rot in his pines. Mr. Richards â€”The stem rot is caused by the red spider. The spider works round the root of the plant and causes them to rot off. I do not know what the remedy is. I have no red spiders because I do not plant the varieties they infest."
