"In approaching, and making the attempt to handle this subject, I feel rather timid, coming as I do before the veterÂ¬ ans of citriculture. But I hope that my piper may be the means of provoking a discussion that will result in good. In treating the subject before us, I shall call to my aid a special bulletin of the Louisiana State Experiment Station, which treats of insects injurious and beneficial that infest the citrus in that state, Florida and California. Every grower should have this work, which I presume may be obtained by addressing H. C. Newsom, Commissioner of Agriculture, Baton Rouge. INSECTS. One of the most troublesome of which is the Florida red scale (Aspdiotus Ficus Ashmead). It is round, ol a chocoÂ¬ late color with a red spot in the center, a little less than a sixteenth of an inch in diameter They breed with wonderÂ¬ ful rapidity and spread over a grove in a very short space of time. It has been aptly described as â€œthe most devilish of all scale insects,â€ and it seems to come in a night. I believe it the most difficult to destroy. The adult red scale seems almost invulnerable, and the best time to fight them is when hatching, almost anything in the way of an insecticide will kill them at this time. They seem to be most active about the first of April and the latter part of August. The oyster shell scale (Mytilaspis Pomorum Bouche) seems to be the most common in Florida, and the least destructive. I have found that they could generally be disposed of by giving the tree some fertilizer. Another, the barnacle scale ( Ceroplas - tes Floridensis ), as his name implies, has the appearance of a barnacle, is white with a slight pinkish tinge, and when crushed exudes a liquid that has the appearance of blood. This scale is most otten seen on young trees, and may be easily destroyed by a few applications of soapsuds. This insect is about three thirty seconds of an inch in diameter. Aley- rodes Citrifolii is a scale frequently seen on the leaves and stems of our trees, and appears as little white dots, someÂ¬ times almost completely covering the leaves and small twigs. This insect finally hatches into a small white fly or miller, its wings having a delicate purplish tinge. It is often very troublesome, and wherever smut fungus is found this scale generally accompanies it. Smut fungus has the appe irance of soot, and a tree affected looks as though it had been liberÂ¬ ally dusted with soot. No doubt many of you have noticed numbers of your .oranges, otherwise good, with a little hole eaten through the oil cells to the white portion of the peel. I found the little villain that does the work. There will be seen a little pointed ,cocoon, yery ragged in appearance, attached to the orange, and has for its inhabitant a small black worm. What form ..of miller or fly it hatches into I do not know. The cocoons may be seen sticking to the leaves, and even to the sides of buildings and fences in the fall. Now is the time when we are most troubled with the orange aphis. This little insect varies in color from light green to black. They live on the juices of the young leaves, but do not occur in sufficient numbers to do any great damage. One of the worst enemies of the orange is the â€œorange dog,â€ an ugly, disgusting, hairless caterpillar, which, when touched, protrudes two red horns and emits a terrible odor. They feed on the young leaves, and it is wonderful the amount of foliage one of them will consume. They do great injury to young trees. The butterfly of this ugly larva is very beautiful, the wings above are crossed with yellow spots, while below they are yellow with black veins. On the tail-like projection of each hind wing is an eye-like spot of yellow, while near the inner angle of the same wing is another spot of red and blue. The female deposits her eggs on the most tender leaves of the tree- these hatch in a few days. The larval condition is passed in from ten to fifteen days,, when the pupa state is entered, where it remains during the summer months. Six or seven broods may be hatched in one season, so it is well f <r the orange grower to look to his young trees. THE RUST-MITE. This minute insect, which is invisible to the naked eye, is a great source of annoyance to the orange grower, and causes a loss of thousands of dollars each year to the growers. The rust-mite is only 1,200th part of an inch long. The eggs are deposited singly or in clusters over the leaves and hatch in four or five days. In about ten days they shed their skins, and reach the adult condition, which differs from the young in being a little darker. It is during the hot, moist weather in summer when they become most abundant; cool or dry weather checks them. On examination of a single leaf inÂ¬ fested with them Mr. Hubbard estimates the number of mites and eggs at 75,000. These little creatures are able to travel about twelve feet per hour, so they are able to cover a good deal of space in a short time. The result of the little fellowsâ€™ work is not altogether bad, for our rusty fruit will carry a good deal better than the bright, and late in the season there is not much difference in price. The russet fruit holds its juices better than the bright. Almost any of the insecticides now in use will destroy the rust-mite, but the trees must have several applications for they work the year round, as their food is the oil in the rind of the orange and other citrus. In some portions of the state the white fly is causing a great deal of trouble this spring. These are some of our enÂ¬ emies, but we have some friends in the insect world. One, I would like to find the name for; it looks like a little tuft of down on legs, and is very active in destroying scale. Then there is the little beetle, known as the lady-bird; the one most common is black with a red dot on each wing; anÂ¬ other, not so common, is orange colored or red. The larva of these insects may be seen on dead twigs, or pine straw that has become lodged in the orange trees, and may be seen crawling about over the leaves. It looks like a little black or yellowish hairy worm, furnished with legs, and is often killed hy persons who do not know them, thinking they are an inÂ¬ jurious insect of some sort. These little friends destroy great numbers of scale insects. One bad thing about our spraying- is that we destroy these friends along with our enemies, and it is a question if we do not lose in the end. DISEASES. Mai di goma , or foot-rot is a disease of the orange that ha& and is causing more destruction in seedling groves than any disease known to the orange. It seems to be almost as much a mystery as ever, and no one that I know of has yet ventured to say what the cause of it is. I have noticed that it seems to be most prevalent after a freeze. After the freeze of 1886 there was a regular epidemic of foot-rot. That would seem to indicate a defective circulation of sap, would it not ? We all have our theories in regard to it, and mine is this: That at the time of a freeze the sap vessels or veins are contracted or dried down, and when the warm weather comes after the cold the roots commence forcing sap into the trees again* and the vessels not being able to receive the amount furnished them, burst through the bark in boils or sores. These sores often appear six feet from the ground, and even more, although the trees are most generally affected at the collar, and the main root just below the surface. The best means for stopping it seems to be by cutting away the diseased portions of t he bark and exposing roots for a distance of two feet around the trunk. That would indicate that in setting a grove or replacÂ¬ ing trees it would be a good idea to plant on slight ridges or mounds, as the soil tends to work to the trees all the time, and if we do not set them in this manner, in a few years we are apt to find our trees in slight hollows. I should think the best way to avoid the trouble would be to use sour or bitter-sweet stock. The sour stock rarely has foot-rot, while the bitterÂ¬ sweet has the reputation of having never had a case of it. I have seen trees budded on sour stock standing with every sweet tree around affected, and yet the trees budded on sour were perfectly healthy. The disease may be readily distin- guished by a novice; where the gum exudes the bark comÂ¬ mences to die. Sometimes the discharge has a frothy appearÂ¬ ance and a disagreeable odor. Die-back is another disease that causes a good deal of loss to the orange grower; it is most noticeable in the fall when the wood is ripening. It appears in hard brown scabs or blisÂ¬ ters on the smaller limbs and twigs; the scabs also are seen on the fruit. The disease spreads to the larger limbs and finally kills the tree unless measures are taken to stop it. It is â– caused by (well now I tremble for my reputation) too much plow and harrow for the most part, and can be caused by too much ammonia, but ammonia has to take the cussing for the whole family. If you do not â€œworry the soilâ€ too much, it will take a tremendous amount of ammonia to give a tree the â€¢die-back. I tried it. I took a small tree for my experiment. The tree was about eight feet high and six feet through the top. I gave the tree two wheelbarrow loads of fresh stable manure, twenty-eight pounds of bright C. S. meal and eight pounds of blood and bone, all within one year, and I succeeded in giving the tree the die-back, but only slightly. It all passed away the next season, and has never shown since. The trees were only plowed once, and I hoed once during the year. I would suggest to those troubled with die-back, that they use the mowing machine more and the plow less, but do not stop fertilizing entirely, as some do. No cast-iron rule can be laid down, as there are hardly two groves on the same kind of soil. I think that the growers as a general thing cultivate too much and feed too little. * I have just received a letter from a friend in the southern part of the state, complaining that the white-fly is working sad havoc with their groves, some nearly ruiued by it. I would suggest that from two to four pounds of sulphur be scattered around the tree or thrown into the branches, as you please; leave on the surface. The fumes will kill the fly, young scale and rust-mite; at least, that has been my experience. Hoping that I have not proved too tedious, and my effort not altogether in vain, I am, yours for the advancement of our â– society and all it implies. Sulphur Solutionâ€”Blightâ€”Lemon Scab. fveport by Prof. W. T. Swingle, of Sub-Tropical Laboratory, Division of Vegetable Pathology, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Eustis, Fla., Chairman Standing Committee on Diseases and Insects of Citrus. Prof. Swingle â€”I have been too much engaged in field work to present to you to-day a written report. Of course, the subÂ¬ ject is a broad one. I will proceed for the first part to conÂ¬ sider insects. I am not especially occupied with this subject at Eustis, nor is Prof. Webber. I have, however, something of interest to report regarding the insect enemies of citrus plants, that is, in regard to the solution which is used to kill the rust mite and the red spider. I found yesterday afternoon, after quite a number of tests, a new method of preparing a sulphur spray. I wish to show you how to make this sulphur compound. I take it for granted that the members underÂ¬ stand what sulphur spray is used for. It is a cure for rust mite and is very valuable in fighting spotted mite (red spider). The following is the recipe for making this solution: Thirty pounds of pulverized sulphur (good quality), twelve ^quarts of water, then mix; add twenty to thirty-two pounds of caustic soda (twenty pounds of ninety-eight per cent, or thirty-three pounds of sixty per cent.), then mix. After mixing the sulphur and water the caustic soda is placed in the same vessel and the whole mixed well. A reÂ¬ action takes place, the mixture becoming hot, turning brown and finally becoming liquid. This liquid should be diluted to twenty gallons of water and kept in tight barrels ready to dilute for u^e. Caustic soda can be obtained from Eimer & Amend, 207 to 211 Third avenue, or Geo. B. Forrester, 169 Front street, New York City. I simply give these names because I happen to know that they sell the caustic soda. They do not sell less than 700 pounds. Seventy per cent, potash costs about $3.95 per hundred; ninety-eight per cent, about $5.30 to $5.50. It is cheaper to buy the ninety- eight per cent, soda at these prices. It is in powder form, like flour. A great many dealers have a low grade on hand. It would not be advisable to use this. PROCEEDS TO MIX THE SOLUTION. You will notice that a small quantity of water is used When you first make the solution it will seem incredible that such a small quantity of water would suffice. It makes a very stiff paste, and it must be a stiff paste or it will not work. It is also essential that the flour of sulphur be stirred well with the water. The caustic soda can now be stirred in with this sulphur paste. This can be done in wooden vessels. It is not necessary to have metallic vessel? ; in tact it is better not to use metals since they are attacked by the sulphides formed. This solution can be made up in the field in a barrel. The right quantity of caustic soda can be weighed out and put in a glass jar, with a tight fitting cork, and you can make the solution as you wish to use it. It will keep if protected from the air. This is a concentrated sulphur solution. I will state that the cost of sulphur is about 1-J cents f. o. b. New York City. I cannot state exactly though, but this is about the figure. It can probably be obtained of some good dealer in Jacksonville at 2 cents f. o. b. L. Montgomery â€”I beg to state that it can be bought for $22 a ton f. o. b. New York City. Prof. Swingle â€”After the reaction has taken place, dilute the liquid to twenty gallons. The cost per gallon of this made up solution will be about 5 to 7 cents. The same thing can, of course, be made with potash if it is so desired. CausÂ¬ tic soda will do the same as potash. It might pay to use potash instead of caustic soda, but at present the cheapest sulphur spray that can be made is with the caustic soda. The same proportion of caustic potash is to be used as of caustic soda. I will experiment further with this and will publish the results in full in all Florida papers. The sulphur soluÂ¬ tion will be of great benefit in fighting the enemies of the orange. I would not advise the use of more than one gallon to filty gallons of water for anything. It is probable that from one to two quarts to fifty gallons will be required to kill the rust mite. For the red spider I would use from two to four quarts to fifty gallons. E. Beanâ€”I have a copy of Miller & McMasterâ€™s patent covering this property of dissolving sulphur by the use of caustic soda. The Professor can read that portion relating tO' the sulphur solution. (Prof. Swingle then read paper submitted by Mr. Bean which was on the subject of Miller & McMasterâ€™s patent). Prof. Swingle â€”From the part of the patent that I have read I cannot see that there is any infringement on Miller & McMasterâ€™s patent. I prepared my solution a few days ago and I am sure I have never before seen a copy of the patent I have just read. I doubt if my solution can be patented. It T3 is really not a sulphur solution, but a solution of sodium sulÂ¬ phide, but I hope to work on it further and give the members of the Society the advantage of whatever discoveries I may make. There are a few other points I wish to report on relating to the work in progress at the Sub-Tropical Laboratory, on the diseases of citrus fruits. BLIGHT. Firstâ€”In regard to the orange blight: I have been before the Society for three years telling a continued story about blight and I am sorry to say that the discussion will have to be continued longer. Prof. Webber and myself have been exÂ¬ perimenting at the Sub-Tropical Laboratory at Eustis in a number ol different ways, but we are surprised at the extreme slowness in which these experiments show results. Having made for two years careful examination of the blight of the orange, we have been unable as yet to find any cause which could produce this disease, but every experiment we make strengthens the view that the disease is contagious. It has been found almost uniformly that extirpation of the first few cases in the grove is the best way to prevent the spread of the malady. We have in progress experiments to prove whether this disease is contagious. The blight very often spreads from adjacent trees. It is still unsettled whether the disease can be conveyed from the top of one tree to another. We have taken buds from blighted trees and inserted these buds into healthy treesâ€”into the top and into the roots and we will watch with interest the progress ot this experiment. We will report on all of these experiments later. I would urge all those who have only a few affected trees to take them out and burn them. There is little doubt in my mind but that trees contract blight from one another. To growers who have large numbers of trees affected, such a measure might seem to be severe and I would suggest to such that some of the more vigorous trees might be grafted to quick bearing varieties. This, however, I would only urge in cases of long standing. Those trees that are burned should be burned on the spot and not dragged through the grove. Mr. Peck â€”Over what region of the state does blight exÂ¬ tend ? Prof. Swingleâ€”I have seen it all over the state. FOOT ROT. Upon the foot rot we have done so far only a limited amount of work, but we have at last found a region where we can try remedies and we hope to report the result of these exÂ¬ periments later. LEMON SCAB. â€ I have since the 1st of February given my almost undivided attention to this disease, and wish to thank Mr. Sampson and Mr. Buffum for their efforts to aid me. I have found the disease to be caused by a very minute fungus. The disease proves to be exceedingly difficult to combat since the young fruits can be infected for at least two months. I have no doubt we will finally be able to overcome the disease. We have found the copper sprays to be the best remedies. I have found the Bordeaux Mixture very good. I expect to get out a bulletin from Washington on this Bordeaux Mixture and a copy will be forwarded to each member, and also the report on treating the lemon scab when it is published. Prof. WebÂ¬ ber will report later on his experiments with die-back. J. H. Wright â€”It has been my experience in using BorÂ¬ deaux Mixture that it is a preventive more than a cure."
