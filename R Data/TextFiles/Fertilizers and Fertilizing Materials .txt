"The question of proper fertilization is one of great imporÂ¬ tance to the orange grower and truck raiser of Florida, for in no state of the Union is there more need of it. There is but a very small area within our borders but that requires artificial fertilizing of some kind or other, it therefore behooves the farmer and fruit grower to study well this question of fertiliÂ¬ zation so that he can apply his manures in a manner that will give him an abundant crop and at the same time have none, if any, to go to waste. It has not been many years since comÂ¬ mercial fertilizers were unknown to the majority of the tillers, of the soil. They had no need to study agricultural chemistry for they had but to prepare the land, plant the seed and an abundant crop could be harvested without the application of artificial fertilizers in any way. This practice has, as you all know,, impoverished the most fertile fields and where once the vegetable life would spring up and reach out its branches and hold out its leaves to be kissed by the sun and be washed by the dews and rain from heaven, now refuse to grow unless properly fed by the hand of man. A continuÂ¬ ous draught, so to speak, has been made on the bank of plant food and unless liberal deposits are returned it will not be long before bankruptcy and starvation will not only stare the plants in the face ,but the â€œtillerâ€ will have to seek other vocations or succumb to the inevitable. â€œNecessity is the mother of invention. â€ So when the soils began to fail to give lorth abundant crops, man began to study the laws of nature and he soon discovered wherein the trouble lay and began at once to supply the needed plant foods. Thus commercial fertilizers were invented and placed on the market. They were received with a good deal of incredulity by the husbandman who in his ignorance of chemistry could not understand how an inorganic substance could be converted into living matter. Necessity, however, compelled him to try it and to-day there are thousands and thousands of tons of chemicals annually used to increase the productiveness of the soil, and the increase is going to be just in that proportion to which the farmers and fruit growers are educated to their proper use. I do not mean that they should study to be chemists but they should understand the sources of .various plant foods and their effects upon different plant life. I have tried to study it from this standpoint as it is the practical work that finally tells. The chemist can tell us that an orange tree contains certain per cents, of water, sugar, potash* phosphoric acid, etc., and we may have all of these at our hand, but without the aid of dame nature we could not proÂ¬ duce a single fruit, but we can, with the aid of the chemist and the help of dame nature, grow trees that will give an abundant yield by supplying the necessary plant food which can be worked over by the trees and given back in the shape of â€œgolden apples.â€ I hope you will not think that I atn a chemist, for what I know about chemistry is so small alongside of what I do not know, that a â€œdrop in the bucketâ€ would be no comparison. As stated aboye, I have tried to study this question from a practical standpoint, and if any of the information given proves of value to even one person I shall feel repaid for my trouble. I do hope, however, that it may be the means of food lor thought which will lead the growers to better understand the the use of agricultural chemicals. One of the most plentiful elements of plant food is nitrogen, yet it is the most costly, owing to manâ€™s inability to trap it and get it into shape to handle without great expense. It comÂ¬ poses about four-fifths of the air we breathe and enters into the formation of all animal and plant life. Without ammonia it would be impossible to grow anything. Your soil might contain an abundance of potash in the most available form, the phosphoric acid might be there served up in the most apÂ¬ petizing form for plants, yet without ammonia there to start and to stimulate, the plants would never unfold a leaf. SULPHATE OF AMMONIA is one of the best forms of ammonia, and one which contains the greatest per cent, of nitrogen of any substance we use as a fertilizer. It is a by-product from the manufacture of gas and coke, also from burning bones. The ammonia is liberated from the coal or bones by combustion, but before it reaches the outside atmosphere it is caught with the aid of sulphuric acid and held in the form of a salt. Thus an acid and an alÂ¬ kali, either of which would take the skin from your hands, are rendered a neutral substance and can be handled and stored with impunity. When applied to the soil in a limited quantity its effect can be quickly seen, as it is ready to be taken up by the plant as soon as it comes in contact with the moist earth or is wet by rain or dews. Some chemists contend thst it changes to nitric acid before the plants use it, while others claim that it is taken up as it is. I do not claim to understand how naÂ¬ ture effects these changes, but I do know that there is nothing that will kill vegetable life more quickly than an overdose of sulphate ammonia, or one that will put more life and vigor into a plant in a quicker time if properly applied than this same â€œsalt,â€ yielding about 25 per cent, of ammonia. Nitrate of soda is the next in order. This is also a salt and is obtained from the west coast of South America. It is in a section where rain is almost unknown, so that the accumulaÂ¬ tions have remained unchanged. It is found in the form of rock and is generally near the surface. The overburden or fop soil is removed and the nitre rocks dug out and loaded on to cars which are taken to a nitre works where the rock is crushed and put in large vats containing boiling water. The nitrate of soda soon dissolves, and in this way is separated from impurities. From the boiling pan the liquor is drawn off into evaporating vats. In that arid climate the water soon evaporates and leaves the nitrate of soda in crystals in the bottom and on the sides of the vat. It is then put in heavy sacks and shipped to all parts of the world. The action of nitrate of soda on plant life is very stimulating and quick, and for this reason is very valuable to gardeners whose crops are behind on account of late planting, cold or other causes. It is said to be very slippery, and if more is put on the soil than the plants require the rains will dissolve and carry it away. It does not adhere nor unite with the soil but remains dissolved unÂ¬ til the moisture is evaporated from it. Sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda are the best forms of ammonia in a dry or partially dry season, owing to the fact that they require very little moisture to dissolve themselves. In fact, in Florida FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL- SOCIETY. 107' they will condense enough moisture from the air to dissolve* themselves. I know of a grower of oranges in Florida who ordered a sack of nitrate of soda, and when it reached his deÂ¬ pot he refused to take it, claiming that it had been allowed to get wet and consequently ruined. He at once wrote the shipÂ¬ per that the wet sack of nitrate of soda was at the depot subÂ¬ ject to his order. That if he could not ship him dry nitrate of soda he did not want him to ship any at all. This grower simply showed his ignorance of the nature of nitrate of soda. The high price of nitrate of soda has led some unscrupulous people to adulterating it, thus enabling them to double their profits. Common coarse salt is the agent used most freÂ¬ quently for this purpose, also kainit and sometimes sand. The salt and kainit can be readily detected by taking a small parÂ¬ ticle in the mouth. If it dissolves readily, leaving a cooling sensation, it is apt to be all rignt, but if it gives a salty flavor it would be well to have it analyzed before buying. Nitrate of potash is sometimes used as a fertilizer, but its expensivene>s keeps it from coming into general use. Guano was one of the first forms of commercial fertilizers offered to the public?. Its effect on the soil was wonderful. It is accounted for by the high per cent, of ammonia which it contained, together with phosphoric acid, the soil then conÂ¬ taining plenty of potash. Repeated applications of guano r however, did not give the same results, and it was soon looked upon as a â€œstimulantâ€™' only, when in reality the cause was that it was a â€œone-sidedâ€ fertilizer. It is used to some extent yet as a source of ammonia in manipulated fertilizers, but the use of it is decreasing, owing to the guano beds becoming exhausted. Besides ammonia it contains phosphoric acid and a small pet cent, of potash. DRIED BLOOD is also extensively used as a source- of ammonia, and is obtained from the great slaughter houses where it is pressed, dried and ground and shipped to various parts of the country. It is one of the best sources of ammonia among the organic substances. TANKAGE is the refuse of slaughter houses that has been cooked and put under pressure to extract the particles of fat that it might contain, and is then dried and ground. In Florida it is known as blood and bone, and in other sections of the country it is sold as animal guano, but it is all tankage. There are several grades of tankage which are sold on the percentage of ammoÂ¬ nia and phosphoric acid or bone phosphate lhatthey contain. It is generally the low grade that is sold to the growers, as the concentrated tankage is almost always bought by manuÂ¬ facturers and used in making their special brands. This,like guano, is a one-sided fertilizer, and its continued use without the application of potash would lead to unprofitable crops, if not disastrous results. It is so with all one-sided fertilizers. AZOTINE AND AMMONITE are animal waste from which grease has been extracted by being exposed to the vapor of naptha. These, like tankage, are bought up by manufacturers. COTTON SEED MEAL, Linseed meal and castor pomace are all the result of the manufacture of the different oils and are usually termed oil cake before it is ground. Every one in this country is familiar with the two kinds of cotton seed meal. One from the short staple and the other from the long staple cotton. That from the former being known as â€œbrightâ€ and the other â€œdarkâ€ meal. The bright is a little richer in ammonia than the dark, owing to the fact ihat it is freer from the hull. The hull ol the long staple cotton is so soft that it is imposÂ¬ sible to grind and bolt it all from the meal, thus giving it the dark appearance. The former is used a good deal for feed and consequently there is a larger demand for it, usually selling about $4 per ton more than the dark, while in reÂ¬ ality there is only about $1.25 difference in their manurial value. Castor pomace should be used with care and should be kept away from stock. Linseed meal is used extenÂ¬ sively as a feed for horses and consequently its selling price is usually considerable above its manurial value. HOOF MEAL AND HORN SHAVINGS are frequently used in manipulated, fertilizers and they conÂ¬ tain a large percentage of ammonia which the chemist can find, but which the plants have a hard time to unlock. For this reason it is rated as one of the poorest sources of ammonia for plant food. In fact I doubt if it would pay the growers of Florida to pay freight on it and apply it to their soils. This will account to some why it is that a fertilizer which has a guaranteed analysis of ammonia that seems high and that the chemist says is there gives such poor results whpn applied. FISH SCRAP is probably used more largely by eastern fertilizer manufacture era as & source of ammonia than any other organic matter. All along the coast fisheries exist which annually turn out thousands of tons of â€œfish pomaceâ€ or â€œchum.â€ The fish are caught, steamed and the oil extracted and the waste or pomÂ¬ ace is dried and sold. Floridaâ€™s coast is teaming with fish that could be utilized to help furnish fertilizer for the acres of vegetables within her borders. They could be composted with muck. The chief objection to handling them, however, is the smell and the army of buzaards that would have to be looked after. There are other sources of ammonia than those we have mentioned, but they do not generally enter into comÂ¬ mercial fertilizers and are used but very little. All those named except the sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda are organic manures and have to undergo fermentation and decomposition before the plant food they contain is liberated, hence it takes considerable longer for their effects to show and in a dry season there is no show at all owing to the soil being thoroughly dried deeper than they have been applied. In the above we have not mentioned any of the domestic or stable manures as we take it for granted that everyone knows their value. Next in order in expensiveness to the agriculturist comes POTASH. Until recent years the only known source of potash was from ashes, which were limited, and as a great many of these were used in the manufacture of soap, the supply was inad- aquate for the demand. It was not until the discovery of the potash mines in Germany that a supply of potash could be had in sufficient quantities to meet the increasing demand. As to the origin and description of this plant food we cannot do better than to copy a few paragraphs from one of the GerÂ¬ man Kali Woiksâ€™ pamphlet: â€œThe Stassfurt salt and potash deposits had their origin, thousands of years ago, in a sea or ocean, the waters of which gradually receded, leaving near the coast, lakes which still retain communication with the great ocean by means of small channels. In that part of Europe the climate was then tropÂ¬ ical, and the waters of these lakes rapidly evaporated, but were constantly replenished through these small channels connecting them with the main body. Decade after decade of this continued, until by evaporation and crystallization the various salts present in the sea water were deposited in solid form. The less soluble material, such as sulphate of lime or â€œanhydrit,â€ solidified first and formed the lower stratum. Then came common rock-salt with a slowly thickening layer which ultimately reached 3,000 feet, and is estimated to have been 13,000 years in formation. This rock-salt deposit is in*- terspevsed with lamellar deposits of â€œanhydrit,â€ which grad-' ually diminished toward the top and are finally replaced by mineral â€œpolyhalitâ€ which was composed of sulphate of lime,, sulphate of potash, and sulphate of magnesia. The situation in which this polyhalit predominates is denominated the â€œpolyhalit regionâ€™â€™ and after it comes the â€œkiese rit regionâ€ in which, between the rock-salt strata, kieserit (sulphate of' magnesia), is imbedded. Above the kieserit lies the â€œpotash region,â€ consisting mainly of deposits of carnallit, a mineral compound of muriate of potash and chloride of magnesia. The carnallit deposit is from 50 to 130 feet thick and yields the most important of the crude potash salts and that from.; which are manufactured most of the concentrated articles, inÂ¬ cluding muriate of potash. â€œOverlying this potash region is a layer of impervious clay which acts as a water-tight roof to protect and preserve the very soluble potash and magnesia salts, whichâ€”had it not been for the very protection of this overlying stratumâ€”would have been long ages ago washed away and lost by the action of the water percolating from above. After this clay roof is a stratum, of varying thickness of anhydrit, (sulphate of lime), and still above this a second salt deposit, probably formed under more recent climatic and atmospheric influences or possibly by chemical changes in dissolving and subsequent precipitation. This salt deposit contains 98 per cent, (often more) of pure saltâ€”a degree of purity rarely elsewhere found. Finally above this are strata of gypsum, tenacious clay, sand and limestone, which crop out at the surface. â€œThe perpendicular distance from the lowest to the upper surface of the Stassfurt salt deposits is about 5,000 feet (a litÂ¬ tle less than a mile), while the horizontal extent of the bed is* from the Harz Mountains to the Elbe in one direction, and from the city of Madgeburg to the town of Bernburg in another. â€œIt must not be inferred from what has been said that the various strata succeed one another in regular order. To be sure, they occur according to certain well-marke<i physical and chemical laws, which together with local conditions and and geological disturbances, have fixed their relative posiÂ¬ tions, but as the order of formative influences has varied so have the results succeeded one another in interchanging strata, and one deposit is found here higher, there deeper, than another. At some few places, through refts or fissures, surface water has entered, and either entirely carried away the potash deposits or changed them into secondary products. Resuiting from this latter action are beds of kainit, sylvinit and other less important compounds, which from their very causation are only found in the upper strata. â€œFrom what has heretofore been said, it follows that Stass- furt possesses a comparatively inexhaustible supply of potash salt. Further geological exploration may discover deposits similar to these at Stassfurt, but none such are now known to exist, and hence it may be said that practically â€˜Stassfurt 5 \" supplies the world with potash.â€ There are nine different potash mines, but they are all under the control of one syndicate, and to such an extent has- the potash become in use that to-day these mines employ over 4,000 miners, and it takes nearly 6,000 laborers to manu* facture the different grades of goods that come from the mines. The product that we are most interested in is high grade sulphate of potash analyzing from 90 to 96 per cent.. Double manure salt, or as it lis generally known, low grade- potash, analyzing about 48 to 50 per cent, and kainit 22 to 24c per cent, sulphate potash, also muriate of potash, which shows about 50 per cent, of actual potash. Which of these four is the best for the grower depends on what he is growing and' what kind of soil he is expecting to apply it. If he is in the garden business raising cabbages, leituce, celery, etc., muriÂ¬ ate of potash or kainit would be his best source of potash,, the muriate being by far the cheapest form. I could not recÂ¬ ommend it for application to fruit trees, although I know of it being u*ed in a small way on b aring orange trees without any apparent damage. I have also known ot the leaves and fruit being taken off an orange tree by an ex ra large dose of kainit. I am frequently asked which is the best potash to use, the high or low grade, to which I reply that if the place of consumption is not too far away from the seaport, I believe the low grade will give the best results for the same amount of money. The cost of potash per unit in both grades is practically the same ex-vessel at any seaport, but from that instance the cost per unit commences to increase in the lower grade. Where the freight doe* not exceed $5 I should always reeommend the low grade, for in my mind the magnesia that it contains is worth more than it costs. Repeated analyses of our soils show a deficiency of potash,, and if one will but stop and think a few minutes it will not be hard to account for it. Take an orange grove, and in nine cases out of ten where it has been fertilized at all it has had ammoniated goods to produce a rank growth and the tree has done it. The majority of these fertilizers have no potash in them at all; the tree uses every particle it can get hold of, at the same time there is an abundance of phosphoric acid. With ammo^- 8 Mia and phosphoric acid being continually applied without any potash, it does not take long for one to be in excess of the other. The young tree can stand the deficiency tor some time, for it is continually returning to the soil through its dropÂ¬ ping leaves all the potash it has gathered, except the amount contained in the body and limbs of the tree. A different thing happens, however, when the tree begins to bear, for every orange that is carried away takes with it a certain amount of plant food, a large proportion ol the ash of which is potash. A tree cannot continue to bear five to twenty boxes per annum unless there is a return made in some way. Recently I visited groves in difierent parts of the state that were old enough and large enough to bear irom ten to twenty boxes each, yet the average crop was not three boxes. These trees were cow- penned, and had nevt j r received an application of potash exÂ¬ cept what little was left by the cow chips and decaying weeds. The fruit was not what would be called first-class in flavor and soon got soft and spongy. In contrast to this, I have been in a grove of four acres from which 2,500 boxes of fruit were gathered and shipped; another of five acres, twelve years old, containing 216 trees, which yielded over 1,600 boxes; still another of forty acres which yielded the handsome crop of over 17,000 boxes. All these groves were fertilized with a fertilizer containing a large percentage of potash. I might also add that to my knowledge these groves have borne heavy crops ever since this plan of liberal fertilizing with strong potash manures has been folÂ¬ lowed, and the trees are now set with another large crop. PotÂ¬ ash not only increases the productiveness of the tree, but it makes the fruit firmer, enables it to hold on longer, and imÂ¬ proves the quality of the fruit, giving to it that delicate bouÂ¬ quet which leaves a pleasant farewell taste in the mouth that is strongly suggestive of more. Putash, however, like all the rest, can be overdone, and instead of tending to early ripening of the fruit it will retard it so much that â€™he fruit will be very acid quite late. Tests have been made the past season with just this result. It should be the study of the orange grower to know what amount of potash can be usi d with profit and for the best results in the way of fruit. Ail of the forms of potash are insecticides to a considerable extent, and in our garden, where potash was used liberally, the vegetables were not troubled with root knot. Kainit is an absorbent of ammonia, and is useful on this account to use about stables, out-houses, and in compost heaps, where the compost is for garden purposes. There is as much difference in well fertilized fruit and that which has to shift for itself, as there is between well fed stock and the scrubs which have to shift for themselves. PHOSPHATE. To one the mention of this word brings a smile, for he at one time owned phosphate lands, but sold at the right time. To another it means broad acres of pine forest unÂ¬ derlaid with supposed wealth, but a poor bank account. They either did not get the â€œpaying take,â€ or they have not the means to develop this wealth and are too short-sighted to let some one else develop it. When phosphate was first discovered in Florida, many thought that the cost of ferÂ¬ tilizing materials was going to drop way down, and many believed that all they had to do was to pile on the phosÂ¬ phate. How bitter the disappointment. Ignorance and a one-sided fertilizer again worked havoc with the pocketbook of the grower. To-day you can ride through the piney woods, and I will guarantee that you can find men that would not ha~e the â€œdurned stuff on this grove if you would put it on for nothing.â€ Notwithstanding all this, phosÂ¬ phoric acid has its place, and must be used to properly deÂ¬ velop and maintain plant life; for it is the connecting link that holds all vegetable and animal life together. You can not destroy it in any way. The best source of phosphoric acid is still an unsettled quesÂ¬ tion. We have a large list to select from. First, bones of all kinds, refuse matter of different kinds which also yields amÂ¬ monia and potash. Canada, South Carolina and Florida have vast beds of phosphatic rock which can be mined very cheaply, especially the two latter states, so there is very little possibility of this element of plant food becoming scarce. Chemists claim that phosphoric acid is phosphoric acid wherever found, whether from bone or rock; but these same chemists will tell you that ammonia from one source is much better than from another. If this is so, why not phosphoric acid. All plants do not have the same absorption power auy more than the animal kingdom. A goat will thrive and fatten where a bullock would starve. A blackjack oak would grow and extend its branches in all directions, while an ornge tree would soon die. This is all owing to their foraging powers and their ability to digest the food that comes in their way. From what I have seen, I believe the best source of phosphoÂ¬ ric acid for the average Florida soil is from bone, and one of the best and cheapest forms being dissolved bone black. Acid phosphates give excellent results on heavy soils, hence their great demand in Europe and elsewhere. I am now watching the results of the use of Florida acid phosphate on orange trees, and hope in the course of three or four years to know a little more about its value than at present. TOBACCO STEMS. During the last few years there have been thousands of tons of tobacco stems used in Florida with, 1 believe, general satisÂ¬ faction when applied occasionally. A continuous use of them tends to make coarse fruit and soft wood. The}' seem to be an excellent tonic for the soil. GYPSUM. While it contains no plant food of itself, it is valuable. It has the power to catch the ammonia that comes down with the rain or is freed from decaying vegetable matter and hold it till wanted by the plant. Sometimes it has given as good results as a complete fertilizer on this account. But it will not do to depend on its doing this. GAS LIME. We hear of gas lime being spoken of as a splendid fertilÂ¬ izer. On this subject I will read what Prof. Caldwell, of CorÂ¬ nell University, says about it: â€œGas lime is composed chiefly of carbonate of lime and varyÂ¬ ing quantities of sulphate of lime (or ordinary land plaster)* sulphite of lime, sulphide of lime, and more or less unchanged lime. The sulphite and sulphide are harmful to vegetation* especially the latter; but on exposure of the gas lime for a considerable time they become changed to the useful sulphate- The carbonate is of little value, and only the sulphate and the unchanged lime can be counted on as of any use. â€œI do not consider the material as of much value for fertilÂ¬ izing purposes; for after due exposure to the air, to render the sulphide and sulphite harmless, the unchanged lime will also,, in this time, be converted to carbonate, so that only the sulÂ¬ phate is left to be useful; and if I were going to use land plasÂ¬ ter, I would prefer to buy it outright and know what I have. â€œAs an insecticide its use would be dangerous, because of its effect on the plant itself, unless it has been well aired, and for its usefulness in this respect, after having been thus aired, it would be the same as a mixture of plaster and chalk.â€ As gas lime can be had for 2 cents per bushel at the gas works at Baltimore, I should think that the farmers there would use it all up if there was the virtue m it claimed. HOW TO COMPOUND FERTILIZER. The compounding of fertilizers lias been held up as a deep mystery; which has taken years to find out, etc., while the Elortda state horticultural society. 115 acts are, that any one capable of working in fractions can compound their own fertilizer if they know the analysis of their goods. The delicate point is to get the right proporÂ¬ tions to suit the crop on which it is applied. I have prepared a chart, not for its accuracy or beauty, but to help you to better understand me.

The first column gives the number of the different kinds of plant foods contained in the named material. You will notice that half of them contain only one element; eight, two, and -only two contain the three elements of plant food. Now, if you wish to compound a certain mixture, you first ascertain the analysis of your goods. Then you find out how many pounds of any material it takes to give you one per cent. For instance we take sul. ammonia analyzing 25 per cent. By diÂ¬ viding 2,000 by 25 we find that it takes 80 pounds to give one per cent. Now, if you want 3 per cent, of ammonia in your fertilizer you multiply 80 by three and you have 240 pounds. In the same way you follow with the potash and phosphoric acid. You may have a given amount of fertilizing materials and wish to know what it will analyze if mixed. For instance we will take. Ammonia. Potash. PhosphV acid. Avalable phosÂ¬ phoric acid. 500 pounds low grade potash . 6.75 500 â€œ blood and bone. 500 â€œ fish, dried, ground. 500 â€œ dissolved bone black. 1.50 1.62 3.25 2. \"a 3.12 9.75 5.25 A I do not give this as a model formula, but to show how it can be done.

Cheap and cheat should go together, for if the grower is get* ting cheap goods, either the seller or buyer is getting cheated, and which do you think it is likely to be ? Fertilizing mateÂ¬ rials have a certain value, governed by supply and demand, and I would advise a grower to go slow in buying cheap goods; always buy on the unit of plant food, taking into acÂ¬ count its source, and you will be more apt to get full value. No one ever said anything truer than our friend, Rev. Mr. Phelps, when he said that the time was coming when the growÂ¬ ers would feed their fruit trees to make flavor and quality,, and this can only be done by judiciously using high grade goods."
