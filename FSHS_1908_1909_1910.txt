Jacksonville, Florida, September 15, 1908 

To the Members of The Florida Horticultural Society: 

desire to call your attention to the discussion commencing on 
page 108 and the resolution on page 110. If you were at the meeting I 
do not need to urge you to take up the matter with your Congressmen and 
Senators. if you were not in attendance, please read carefully. I 
hope you v.ill take up the matter at once and lend your influence towards 
getting the necessary help. You may have no blight in your grove now, 
but it may appear. It is better to help keep blight and other diseases 
out of your grove than to have to fight it after it has appeared. 

Also do not forget that at the next meeting of the Legislature the 
Society expects to ask for aid to print our minutes. You can help very 
much by a word to your representative if you meet him, or a letter if 
you do not know him personally. if either of the above fail, it will be 
because you waited for someone else to act instead of yourself. 

Hoping you will not drop the matter from your mind with the read¬ 
ing, but be up and doing, I am 


Yours respectfully, 

E. 0. PAINTER, 

Secretary Florida State Horticultural Society.

PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 

( 

Twenty-First Annual Meeting 

OF THE 


Florida State Horticultural Society 


The Florida State Horticultural 
Society celebrated its twenty-first an¬ 
nual meeting in the beautiful and his¬ 
toric city of Gainesville. It can be said 
of this meeting that it opened with 
the largest attendance of any meeting 
in the history of the Society. There 
have been other meetings when* the 
total number in attendance was larger, 
but at no time was the hall so filled 
with horticulturists from all over the 
state, and with townspeople, as greeted 
the fall of the President's gavel at the 
opening session of this meeting. The 
attendance through the entire session 
was large and the whole time allotted 
for the program was taken up. None 
of the sessions were cut out or cur¬ 
tailed, but the full time put in. 

The members enjoyed the afternoon 
session at the State University and 
Experimental Grounds. They spent 
the time very profitably in going over 
the field and seeing what was being 
done and at the same time seeing what 
was needed to carry on the State work. 
Many a member went home deter¬ 


mined to appeal to his member of the 
Legislature to give the Experiment 
Station more consideration and a 
larger appropriation for its work, at 
the next meeting of the Legislature. 

One address we are not able to give 
in our report was the lecture by Prof. 
PI. Harold Hume on “Adorning the 
Home Place,” which was given com¬ 
plimentary to the people of Gainesville. 
This was a stereopticon lecture illus¬ 
trating the good and bad effects of 
different planting of shrubs and trees. 
The printing of the address without 
the illustrations would take away half 
of its value. As we are unable to print 
these this year, the members who did 
not attend will have to lose the pleas¬ 
ure and profit of Prof. Hume’s lecture. 

When the time for the next place of 
meeting was brought up, Daytona, De- 
Land, Orlando and Jacksonville were 
in the race. On the first ballot it was 
left to DeLand and Daytona, and the 
latter won out by a few votes, con¬ 
sequently the next annual meeting will 
be held at one of the prettiest towns

in the State of Florida. The members 
who attend will be able to see, not 
only a beautiful and well laid-out 
town, but enjoy the privilege of surf¬ 


bathing and the other pleasures that 
are invariably to be found in towns 
that are laid on a river or a sea.

Address of Welcome. 


By Col. Horatio Davis. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

As mayor of this city, it gives me great 
pleasure to welcome you to Gainesville, 
and in the words of Shakespeare’s charac¬ 
ter, “I say to thee and to thy company, 
I bid a hearty welcome.” Horticulture, 
as the dictionaries say, is that department 
of agriculture which relates to the culti¬ 
vation of flowers, fruits and vegetables, 
and where can such cultivation be more 
important than in a state with twelve 
hundred miles of sea coast, over seven 
hundred miles long, and every acre of 
land within that state tempered by sea 
breezes ? 

The Bible tells us that one of the first 
commands given by God after He had 
created the earth, was for it to bring 
forth fruit, every tree after its own kind. 
As soon as He had created man, He said 
to him, “I give you the fruit from these 
trees for your food.” It is to be sup¬ 
posed that when the trees came forth 
from the hand of God, it and its fruit 
were perfect, but as time passed, neglect 
worked its inevitable result, and the tree 
with its fruit deteriorated. As I under¬ 
stand it, one of the endeavors of this so- 
cietv is to learn how to bring back to 
that tree and its fruit, its pristine per¬ 
fection. 

It has been said that Florida has eight 


months summer and four months warm 
weather. We who live in Florida know 
that this is not so. We know that we 
have four months summer and eight 
months pleasant weather, and there are 
but few days in which the horticulturist 
or agriculturist cannot work. Where else 
in the world have you such a field for 
your labor? Where else are such flow¬ 
ers, fruits and vegetables awaiting scien¬ 
tific research facing him as in Florida? 
It is a public benefactor who causes two 
blades of grass to grow where one grew 
before. Is he not a public benefactor 
who tells us how to make our fruit and 
vegetables perfect, and how to adorn our 
homes with beautiful flowers, and that, 
I understand, is one of the objects of 
your association, and here, during this 
meeting, we will be told by a number of 
gentlemen how that object is to be ac¬ 
complished. 

With such objects in view by your 
society, is it surprising that there is no 
city that is not proud to entertain you and 
feel honored by your presence? 

It is customary on occasions of this 
kind for the speaker to present to the 
guests, the key of the city, but as Gaines¬ 
ville is hospitable, she keeps no keys. Our 
doors are wide open, and I say to you as 
mayor of the city, “Walk in and take pos¬ 
session.” 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

THE RELATION OF THE UNIVERSITY TO THE HORTICUL¬ 
TURAL SOCIETY. 


Dr. Andrew Sledd. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I wish respectfully to endorse and sec¬ 
ond the words of welcome which the 
Mayor has extended to your body, in 
behalf of your State University. We 
are very glad indeed to have you in our 
city, and esteem it a privilege and honor, 
and trust you will feel that whatever we 
have out there; whatever of buildings, 
or faculty, or service, is entirely at your 
disposal. We hope to have the privi¬ 
lege of having you out an afternoon and 
evening. On that occasion we wish you 
to take possession of the buildings and 
grounds, and we would like for you to go 
to and fro and see what is there so that 
you may know what we are trying to do 
in the cause of education. 

I shall probably not be able to enjoy 
the Association on that occasion, by rea¬ 
son of the fact that I have had an en¬ 
gagement out of the city for some months, 
but Prof. Rolfs will show you every cour¬ 
tesy and more than take my place, I am 
sure. 

Now, like the Irishman who wanted to 
make a few remarks before he said any¬ 
thing, I address myself directly to the 
matter of The Relation of the University 
to the Horticultural Society. I will not 
presume in the presence of these experts 
who are versed in technical knowledge, 
to enter into any arguments or discus¬ 
sions of a technical nature. I know very 
little about technical horticulture; but I 
address myself to you as citizens of the 


State, feeling that you are citizens before 
you are horticulturists. I feel that you 
are horticulturists as an incident, but that 
your citizenship is your chief work and 
one of the highest interests in your life. 
Therefore, I think I can speak to you as 
citizens first and then horticulturists. 

Agricultural interests, including in 
them horticultural interests, are the great¬ 
est single interests in the nation. Re¬ 
cently I have been looking over some of 
our agricultural statistics, and find that 
the amount of money that we get out of 
the ground through crops and fruits will 
amount to the amazing sum of over $6,- 
500,000,000.00; that our corn crop for 
one year would more than pay the na¬ 
tional debt, and would sustain the na¬ 
tional government for two years or more, 
paying all of its expenses. The vast ma¬ 
jority of our people are directly or indi¬ 
rectly dependent upon agricultural inter¬ 
ests. Not counting the non-productive 
elements of the population, such as chil¬ 
dren under ten years of age and matrons 
in the home, there are 30,000,000 of peo¬ 
ple in the United States engaged in gain¬ 
ful occupations. Of that number, nearly 
forty per cent, are engaged in horticul¬ 
tural and agricultural pursuits. This 
does not include their dependents. In our 
own state, forty-four per cent, of our 
working population is engaged in agricul¬ 
tural pursuits; by far the largest propor¬ 
tion engaged in any one line or calling 
in the state. 

Gigantic as are the interests involved,

enormous as are the numbers engaged in 
those interests, but little attention has 
been paid to reducing these interests to 
a scieiitific basis, or equipping those en¬ 
gaged in this occupation for perfection in 
their work. 

You will find that the first agricultural 
society was started in Philadelphia in 
1785, and had the names of George Wash¬ 
ington, Benjamin Franklin and others as 
prominent on its lists. The first profes¬ 
sorship of agriculture was established at 
Columbia University at about the same 
time, in 1795. George Washington, 
Benjamin Franklin/ and the others of 
whom I might speak took an active inter¬ 
est in scientific learning in this line. The 
present interest, however, can be dated 
from about the time of the Civil War. 
The passage of the Land Grant Act in ’62, 
may be said to institute the first concrete 
movement which still bears fruit for those 
people engaged in this tremendous and 
important work. It seems surprising 
that school men should have so long neg¬ 
lected the practical application of the 
principles of education in this field and 
that thi* mass of our population should 
not have had the benefit of scientific study 
and research. The schools did, however, 
under the attractions of the Rennaissance, 
devote the main part of their time to the 
study of the classics, especially Latin, and 
to the development of a type of educa¬ 
tion which is known even today as “cul¬ 
tural”—a part of which is a certain dis¬ 
regard, amounting almost to contempt, 
for the practical. For a long time there 
has been, and is today in many commun¬ 
ities a feeling that it is unworthy to 
spend one’s time in the study of practi¬ 
cal things, and a corresponding respect 
for the man who is educated and trained 
along the lines of so-called “culture, don't 
you know.” This movement has not vet 

J 


expended itself, and there are more pu¬ 
pils in the schools of the United States 
today studying Latin than any other one 
subject, with the possible exception of al¬ 
gebra. Fifty per cent, of the pupils of 
the United States still study Latin, and 
Latin is required in nearly all college en¬ 
trance examinations and in most curricula 
of the colleges throughout the Union. I 
cannot quite appreciate the necessity for 
a superficial knowledge of Latin, when 
a man’s life work is to be the growing of 
tobacco or corn or cotton; and it seems to 
me it would be far more beneficial to the 
individual and to society at large if such 
a student would spend the time which he 
devotes to “culture” in the scientific 
study of the growing and curing of to¬ 
bacco, or corn, or cotton; the prevention 
of diseases and the cure for same, and 
the wonders of germination and growth 
and maturity. 

My education has been a classical one, 
if you will pardon a personal allusion, 
so that it represents a mighty revolution 
for me to say that in my judgment our 
educational ideas are fundamentally 
wrong, and whereas the majority devote 
themselves to the study of the classics 
and the small minority to the agricultural 
studies, the majority should devote 
themselves to a practical education, leav¬ 
ing to the minority the dilettante pur¬ 
suits of the so-called “culture.” 

Since 1862, there has grown up a num¬ 
ber of institutions based upon that act of 
Mr. Morrill whose duty it is to instruct 
the mass of people in the practical affairs 
of life. These institutions now number 
50, one of which is your own State Uni¬ 
versity. There are fifty institutions act¬ 
ing under the Morrill Act, the Land 
Grant Act, and other Acts supplementarv 
thereto. Of the students attending these 
colleges, a large per cent, is women, and

there are altogether 44,000 men, a little 
over 10,000 being engaged in non-tech¬ 
nical, non-agricultural work. There is 
a very large proportion, about 25 
per cent. who are not engaged 
in the strict lines of work for which 
these institutions were established. 
5,500 are engaged in some other course, 
now and then taking a course in animal 
husbandry or some such branch. 6,000 
are in the preparatory department, 21,000 
only are engaged in the practical agrfi 
cultural and mechanical pursuits for 
which the institutions are intended. Now, 
let us go a little further into the matter 
and take this 21,000 engaged in the prac¬ 
tical agricultural and mechanical pursuits. 
Out of this number we find less than 3,000 
engaged in the special work of agri¬ 
culture and horticulture at this time, after 
forty years of effort in that direction. I 
mention this to show the persistent tenac¬ 
ity of the old academic ideas, the per¬ 
sistence of the notion that the only edu¬ 
cation worth having involved the study 
of literature, especially the study of the 
classics. It is a very hard matter to con¬ 
vince the school men in the first place and 
the population at large, after the school 
men have been convinced, of the advis¬ 
ability of a change in any educational sys¬ 
tem. 

Now, as I said, the bulk of the popula¬ 
tion is engaged in agricultural and hor¬ 
ticultural pursuits. It seems to me that 
the educational system should be laid out 
upon those lines in which the bulk of the 
population is interested. Less than four 
per cent, are engaged in professional pur¬ 
suits, and yet our school system in the 
State of Florida, with the exception of 
the State University, is designed with 
reference to the four per cent., with al¬ 
most total disregard of the remaining 
population. In other words, in none of 


the schools of the State, except the State 
University, will you find any instruction 
in horticultural and agricultural pursuits. 

I wish to bring it to your attention that 
it is high time some action is taken with 
reference to changing this situation. The 
State University, your University, is the 
only institution offering instruction along 
these lines, but there should be many oth¬ 
ers. The main part of our current ex¬ 
penses is provided by the Federal Gov¬ 
ernment, and provided with reference to 
the practical instruction of the young 
men of the State, the vast forty-four 
per cent, of the young men of the 
State, who will be interested in agri¬ 
cultural pursuits. 

Our ideal out here is to serve the peo¬ 
ple according to the people’s needs; and 
these needs are not, as we understand it, 
to be found mainly in the realm of cul¬ 
ture, but the people’s needs begin with the 
need to eat. We begin with this funda¬ 
mental need, and go up, up with the needs 
of the people, up and up to the needs of the 
intellect and into the needs of the spirit 
manifested in right living. But first and 
foremost is the all-dominant need, the' 
need to eat. I hold that it is a proper- 
function of the schools to raise the stand¬ 
ard of living; and to do this, it is neces¬ 
sary to improve the workman. Your in¬ 
stitution is organized on that basis. The 
farmer must be equipped with knowledge 
of the whys and wherefores, he must 
know the principles of causes and effects 
and have a certain amount of scientific 
knowledge with which to combat the evils 
which are the enemies to successful agri¬ 
culture or horticulture. Of the 15 of 
this faculty, 11 are engaged under this 
general head; to equip the worker with 
the proper knowledge. I include the 
Professor of Physics, the Professor of 
Botany, and except only the Professors 


24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


of Modern Languages, History, Philos¬ 
ophy, and Ancient Languages. We offer 
four year courses in Horticulture, Agri¬ 
culture, Mechanical, Civil and Electrical 
Engineering in addition to four year 
courses in General Science and four year 
course in Literature, Philosophy, and 
Pedagogy, which do not belong under 
this head. We also offer a two year 
course in Agriculture, and a two year 
course in the Mechanical Arts. 

Under the Buckman Bill we are re 
quired to maintain certain entrance re¬ 
quirements which may be modified by 
the Board of Control. They have been 
so modified, and we now admit studenfs 
who have completed the eleventh grade of 
the public schools. We accept actual 
farmer boys in the department of Agri¬ 
culture without their coming up to those 
requirements. The young farmer boys 
throughout the State who really want to 
learn the scientific elements of agricul¬ 
ture and horticulture and the elements of 
mechanical arts have an open door and a 
hearty welcome into the institution. 

We hold, with the possible exception 
of a few of our men who are still joined 
to their idols of “culture,” that our first 
duty is to the largest body of our citizens, 
and the last duty to the smallest body, 
and we have done all that we can to ac¬ 
complish that result. 

Now I want to tell you some of the 
results. I said it was a hard matter to 
convince the people after you convince 
school men. We are convinced that the 
methods of education which we represent 
are the proper methods; we are howling 
dervishes in our conviction. You can 
hear us howl. If you listen you can 
hear Prof. Rolfs and myself howl clear 
down on the Gulf Coast and on the East 
Coast and down in the Everglades. We 
are convinced. The next proposition is 


to convince the people that this proposi¬ 
tion is true and that we are prepared to 
serve them. Let me give you a few 
facts and figures. Before I give you 
these, let me illustrate from the situation 
in the State of Missouri. There are 555 
high schools in that State which are re¬ 
quired to give instruction in agriculture. 
In these schools, how many do you think 
were taking Latin and how many do you 
think were taking the course in agricul¬ 
ture? Out of the students in 555 high 
schools which were required by the law 
to have a course in agriculture, 28,000 
students, who had the opportunity 
brought to them in the schools to take 
agriculture and at the same time the op¬ 
portunity to take Latin, 14,000 were tak¬ 
ing Latin and 1,180 taking agriculture! 
Now, in our own State Institution, we 
have an enrollment under the Agricul¬ 
tural and Mechanical College Acts, of 
college students amounting to fifty-two. 
That does not count two or three grad¬ 
uate students or some 25 or 26 students 
who are taking the literary course. The 
total enrollment for the year just closed 
has been 103—very small, but still the 
largest college enrollment in the State. 
We include in this 31 preparatory and 
some graduate students, but of those tak¬ 
ing the regular Agricultural and Mechan¬ 
ical College courses, there were 52. 

Now, gentlemen, the doors are open 
for a scientific education along the lines 
in which you are most interested. Prof. 
Rolfs and myself are going up and down 
the State trying to convince the people 
that what they want and need is educa¬ 
tion along the practical lines of agricul¬ 
ture and horticulture. There is no tui¬ 
tion fee, no laboratory fee; board, fuel 
and lights at $15.00 per month; and yet 
we have under the agriculture college 
professors, 52 students in agriculture and

25 


the kindred subjects. This state of af¬ 
fairs ought not to be. 

It seems to me there are three reasons 
for this condition. In the first place, the 
farmers of the State do not realize the 
necessity for a technical education. They 
do not realize that agriculture is a science 
and that horticulture is a science. They 
think if their grandfather plowed with i 
rope line over a lop-eared mule they 
should not show disrespect to his mem¬ 
ory bv endeavoring to improve on his 
methods. His antiquated methods were 
agriculture, and agriculture is just simply 
agriculture. Another difficulty is that 
the rural population does not realize the 
possibility of technical education in those 
lines. It is a new idea. Agriculture used 
to be regarded as a business which did 
not need much, if any, apprenticeship. 
It was simply a matter of “being brung 
up to it.” The average farmer or fruit¬ 
grower thought the “book-farmer” a fool, 
—and perhaps they were sometimes right. 
There is a general prejudice against the 
“book treatment” of the subject. You 
have undoubtedly observed this in your 
own community. The average farmer 
will say, “Oh, he is just a book farmer 
and can’t teach me nothing.” Of course, 
“the book farmer” in the early stages of 
his career made mistakes, and is still mak¬ 
ing them, perhaps; but, as a whole, the 
fair-minded man is willing to concede 
that he has more than made good. The 
third difficulty that is observed is that 
there is no movement in the State except 
this one struggling enterprise looking to 
this end. There is no high school in the 
State representing this idea. There is no 
school in the State teaching these things. 
As a consequence, there is no stimulus 
towards the University, and it is really 
remarkable that we get- more than five 
or six to come up here to study. 


This Society, in my judgment, might 
be extremely effective in facilitating a 
general movement in the State for carry¬ 
ing horticultural and agricultural educa¬ 
tion down into the graded schools. I do 
not know anything more pitiful than to 
see a little country boy going up to read 
“Gallia est divisa in partes tres,” or some¬ 
thing like that, and learning nothing and 
caring nothing about the wonderful 
branch of industry which he is to make 
the work of his future life, knowing noth¬ 
ing and caring nothing about the planting 
and germinating and growth of a grain of 
corn or wheat,—devoting a quarter of 
his precious time to a study which will 
not do him the remotest good which had 
far better be spent in studying the science 
of plant and vegetable life. Now, he 
could at least learn that it is a science and 
that it is to his interest and is his bus¬ 
iness to study that science; and if he be¬ 
gins the study he will follow it up through 
the University. 

Now, as I have before said, tffi run¬ 
ning expenses of the University are met 
mainly through the Federal Government. 
In nearly sixty per cent, of the states in 
the Union, the State is appropriating 
more for its agricultural and mechanical 
colleges than the Federal Government. 
In some states they have practically as¬ 
sumed the entire support of these institu¬ 
tions. In our own State, the State gives 
about one-third of the current income. 
The institution could not be run three 
months on the State appropriation for 
current expenses. We are anxious to 
serve the farmer bov. We are convinced, 
and we want to convince the people and 
we trust that this meeting of the Horti- 
cultural Society may contribute to that 
end. We believe that sooner or later we 
will succeed; we know we must succeed, 
because practical training is the only 



26 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


training for a practical man living a prac¬ 
tical life in a practical age. I do not 
mean to depreciate true culture, but what 
we need first in this and every other State, 
is an education which gets right down to 
the practical phases of everyday life; and 
the gentlemen of this distinguished So¬ 
ciety can be of the utmost service in car¬ 
rying forward that idea. - We need more 
practical education introduced into our 


common schools, into our high schools; 
and this University, your University, 
gentlemen, needs and should receive the 
co-operation and liberal support of the 
State, in its campaign for the practical 
education of the masses of the people, 
and in its earnest efforts to serve all the 
people of our common State according 
to their needs. 


RESPONSE. 


Dr. W. C. Richardson, Tampa. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I certainly esteem it a privilege and 
an honor to address an audience in this 
great educational centre of the state. I 
am afraid, however, that what may be a 
source of pride to me may be an inflic¬ 
tion to you before we get through with 
it. If it is in the nature of an infliction, 
no one will be to blame but your Presi¬ 
dent. When I got his notification that 
I was expected to respond to these ad¬ 
dresses, I was on the eve of going to my 
groves. I returned home last Friday 
morning, but with my usual habit of pro¬ 
crastination, had put off writing my ad¬ 
dress. When I got home Friday morn¬ 
ing, the good Lord had seen fit to send 
a little grandchild to my daughter’s home 
and that upset me, naturally. So, in the 
whirl of events, I did not have any time 
to prepare my address. Then I thought 
the best thing to do was to look over the 
records of the proceedings of the last few 
years and see what had been said and 
patch up something extemporaneous from 
that. Well, when I tell you what I 


found, you will know what I was up 
against there. We had, at the last meet¬ 
ing, an address from our respected friend, 
Dr. Kerr. The meeting before that we 
had an address from our beloved friend, 
Mr. Taber, and the meeting before that 
we had an address from our revered and 
lamented Mr. McCarty. No one can 
compete in eloquence, style, fluency and 
interest with the addresses of these men. 

But I am here; it is up to me, and 
I am somewhat in the position of the hero 
in one of Bret Hart’s little poems. He 
was a preacher and a miner, and the bur¬ 
den of the refrain was “He always did 
his level best,” and that is what I am here 
to do. 

I want to say that I am particularly 
proud to come here to that which is es¬ 
sentially ours; to our University and our 
faculty. I am particularly delighted to 
have heard the head of that University 
speak as he has done. I have thought for 
years, in my conceit, that I was one 
of a few men who thought and talked 
that the only kind of an education that 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


27 


was worth having, is an education along 
practical lines, but to hear it from the 
President of a University is a surprise 
and a pleasure. 

I realize, as he realizes, that a techni¬ 
cal education along technical lines is far 
better, far more useful and far more ben¬ 
eficial in every way than a so-called clas¬ 
sical education. I think it was Oliver 
Wendell Holmes who wrote: 

“There is many a one, though highly skilled 
in hie, hac, hoc, 

In arts and knowledge still a block.” 

When my children had grown up and 
were in school, they laughed at this quo¬ 
tation, saying that my Latin pronuncia¬ 
tion was old style and wrong and that 
it should be heek, hyke, hoke.. I said, 
“Let it go at that even, and it will still 
be applicable as 

‘There is many a one though highly skilled in 
heek, hyke, hoke, 

In arts and knowledge still a bloke!’ 

I am delighted to know that we have 
this kind of an institution. I am delighted 
to know that we have this kind of men 
at its head. As has been said, “It is 
ours,” and I am glad that we have come 
to our own at last. 

Now, Mr. Mayor, I want to thank you 
for your courteous invitation to your hos¬ 
pitalities, for your courteous welcome to 
what you have here, and they are no 
small things. We appreciate this city 
with its paved streets, with its great Uni¬ 
versity, with its great men, and we es¬ 
teem it a privilege to be here. We are 
glad, and we realize that you understand 
that Horticulture is more and higher than 
a human institution. We may come up 
here with hard hands and hard beads, 
perhaps, as sons of toil, but nevertheless 
we are horticulturists, and horticulturists 
are men who have something to be proud 


of. The calling of horticulture is, as 
you have intimated, of Diyine origin. The 
first horticulturist was the Creator Him¬ 
self. He prepared the garden, put fruits 
and flowers into it, and finally put man 
into it. Man, in his usual manner, dis¬ 
tinguished himself by getting into trouble 
the first thing, and then blamed it onto the 
woman. Unfortunately for us, the Crea¬ 
tor did the same thing that we are doing. 
He put a tree of evil in there, and that 
caused the trouble. 

There was another reference made by 
your Honor, about anyone being a bene¬ 
factor who caused two blades of grass to 
grow where one grew before. I want to 
say that we are, on that proposition, mul¬ 
tiple benefactors. There isn’t one of us 
who has not beat that all to pieces. If 
you don’t believe it, try to dig up a blade 
of Bermuda grass and see what follows. 

These gentlemen who have preceded 
me have not taken up all the time allotted 
to them, and unlike the omnipresent poli¬ 
tician, I have been “elected,” for the 
evening at least, consequently I don’t 
have to quit. 

Isn't it a wonderful thing that the Bi¬ 
ble speaks so often of fruits and flowers? 
It refers to the rose, the lily, the pome¬ 
granate, the olive and the fig, but never 
a word about the grosser productions 
such as potatoes, carrots, cabbage, etc. 
The most wonderful thing that has ever 
happened, the greatest event that was 
ever enacted in the world’s history, took 
place in an olive grove ; I mean that won¬ 
derful scene that was enacted in the gar¬ 
den of Gethsamene. I was in that gar¬ 
den about two years ago, therefore it 
may not be amiss for me to say a word 
in regard to it. _I can understand why 
the people of Palestine take to horticul¬ 
ture instead of agriculture. They would 
not enjoy plowing with a lop-eared mule. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


28 

or plowing at all for that matter. And, 
by the way, they have no lop-eared mules 
in Palestine, and no plows, but you see 
them scratching along with a forked stick 
drawn by a cow, or occasionally an un¬ 
dersized donkey; that is the nearest ap¬ 
proach to a lop-eared mule in Palestine. 

It is the finest country for good or¬ 
anges in the world. -The Jaffa orange is 
the best orange I have ever seen. It 
has been my privilege to eat those oranges 
right from the trees, but delicious as they 
are, give me Florida every time. I would 
not give a cpiarter section of Florida sand 
for a township in Palestine. When I 
stood in the hill country of Judea looking 
out over the valley of the Jordan and 
saw the mountains of Moab and Nebo’s 
lonely peak in all its glory, the idea oc¬ 
curred to me that the Lord was certainly 
good to Moses to let him die before he 
got into the land of Palestine. Perhaps 
it is not today what it was in the day 
of Moses. Today, it is a land of dirt, 
filth, ignorance and Turkish misrule, and 
nothing to commend it. Give me Florida 
every time. 

There is one other thing I want to 
bring before you. I think we too fre¬ 
quently neglect to live up to our oppor¬ 
tunities and to make the most of our 
immediate surroundings. We come up 
here to these meetings, resolving to do 
and be done. We come together, hop¬ 
ing to do ourselves and our occupation 
good, and we talk beautifully and make 
plans, and resolute—and then we go 
home and in a few weeks fall back into 
our lethargic, indifferent, indolent meth¬ 
ods, and our good resolutions are all for-. 
gotten. Now, if we could carry some of 
our enthusiasm home with us, if we 


would carry some of our resolutions home 
and act upon them, it would be better for 
us, it would be better for the business in 
which we are engaged, it would be bet¬ 
ter for the institution of which you, Mr. 
President, have spoken. Let us try to 
do it; let us realize that here in Florida 
we have opportunities such as are found 
in few countries of the world, certainly 
in very few states of the Union. Let us 
work with the determination to make the 
most of our opportunities. Let us do 
the best we can to further the interests 
of our Society and our great educational 
institution. 

I remember reading some time ago of 
a ship in the days of sailing vessels. The 
ship had met with contrary weather, and 
had been partly dismantled, driven from 
its course, and finally the water had given 
out. At last, when the crew was about 
to perish from thirst, a vessel was seen 
approaching. The captain of the dam¬ 
aged ship called through the trumpet, 
“Give us water,” and the answer came 
back, “Drop your buckets where you 
are!” They thought it a strange answer 
and repeated again, “Water! We per¬ 
ish ! Give 14s water.” Again the answer 
came back, “Drop your buckets where 
you are!” The third time they begged 
for water, and the third time the answer 
came back, “Drop your buckets where 
you are!” They finally thought there 
must be some reason for such an answer 
and dropped their buckets which came 
up filled and brimming with fresh, sweet 
water. They had been driven into the 
hundred-mile-wide mouth of the Amazon 
and did not know that they were sur¬ 
rounded with fresh water. 

Now, when we are perishing with a 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


29 


diversity of trials, when we are disman¬ 
tled by freezes, droughts, white flies, po¬ 
litical champaigns, etc., we should drop 
our buckets where we are, and bring them 
up filled with the reviving water of re¬ 
newed courage, prosperity and success. 


In conclusion, let me say that 

“This world is full of beauty like other worlds, 
above; 

And if we do but our duty, it will be full of 
love.” 


President’s Annual Address. 


By Prof. P. H. Rolfs. 


Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We are here to hold our twenty-first 
annual meeting. The hand of fate has 
guided us during these twenty years into 
the most distant portions of the state; 
from Pensacola on the west, to St. Au¬ 
gustine on the east and Miami on the 
south. It is quite probable that when 
Key West shall be made the most south¬ 
ern railway station in Florida we will 
stretch out a hand of welcome to our 
lusty young neighbor, the Cuban Horti¬ 
cultural Society. 

During our devious wanderings and 
in the course of these two decades, our 
membership has gradually increased. 
Even the terrible freezes could not chill 
the ardor for information. The meet¬ 
ing of 1895, following the most disas¬ 
trous catastrophe the state has known, 
was characterized by the most earnest 
attention to the program. While the at¬ 
tendance was smaller than at some of the 
previous ones, the membership was suf¬ 
ficient to enable us to print the annual 
proceedings. 

Of the members who took part in the 
organization at Ocala, only four of the 
original eighteen remain to us. Our 
worthy and distinguished ex-president 
was then a lusty youngster. You would 
not know that he is a year older today, 
if it were not for a slight intimation of 
gray, and his dignity when in the execu¬ 
tive chair. 


CHANGES IN VARIETIES. 

Twenty years ago the list of varieties 
of oranges was probably as long as the 
list of today. Many that were at that 
time thought to be the best have since 
been discarded, and six varieties not then 
recognized are ranked as among the best 
today. The list of those that have ofig- 
inatecl in Florida is increasing, and it is 
quite probable that in the course of time^ 
the leading varieties will be those that 
have originated in our state. 

In our first catalog of Florida fruits 
only one variety of grapefruit was recog¬ 
nized. There are now at least a score, 
nine of which are catalogued by this So¬ 
ciety. The old many-seecled, first-known 
grapefruit is rapidly being displaced by 
newer and less seedy varieties. 

The progressive changes in the citrus 
fruits are however no greater than in the 
deciduous fruits. 

In the case of vegetables we have a 
much more radical change. The old va¬ 
rieties have been almost entirely replaced. 
In fact, vegetables were grown only to 
a limited extent twenty years ago. Even 
celery was spoken of as an experiment 
as late as the report of our fifth meet¬ 
ing. 

CHANGES IN RAILROADING. 

At the time of the founding of this 
Society (1888) a large part of the state 
was horticulturally unknown. Such rail¬ 
roads as occurred in the state were poorly

equipped, and many were disjointed frag¬ 
ments beginning in a hammock and end¬ 
ing somewhere in the piney woods. How 
horticulturists ever succeeded in making 
a living under those conditions of trans¬ 
portation is impossible for us of a later 
day to understand. The following inci¬ 
dent, which occurred in the spring of 
1892, illustrates the indifferent way in 
which business was done 011 some of the 
plug lines then in operation. Some co¬ 
operative experiments were being car¬ 
ried on at Grand Island, and it was de¬ 
sirable for me to make my way from Eus- 
tis to a point on the Sanford & St. P. R. 
R. By driving to Tavares one would be 
able to take the T. & G. then popularly 
known as the “Tag,” which left at about 
sunrise. On the morning in question, 
the train, probably the only one on the 
road, was composed of a few box cars 
and a coach for accommodating passen¬ 
gers. The train started about a half hour 
late, but still early enough to prevent 
the passengers from obtaining breakfast. 
After running for an hour or an hour 
and a half the train stopped suddenly in 
the woods. The whole crew, from fire¬ 
man to conductor, abandoned the train 
and started directly for a nearby water¬ 
melon field. We passengers discussed 
among ourselves whether to follow or to 
remain. To our surprise, the train men 
went leisurely about to find the choicest 
melons, carried them to a fence, sat down 
and ate until satisfied, and then each car¬ 
ried back to the train one or two melons. 
Well, to cut the story short, we got to 
Clermont just in time to see the train we 
wished to take pull out from the other 
station. One train a day. Passengers 
and perishable fruit left at a junction 
point without any reasonable cause. 
While we do not live under ideal condi¬ 
tions at present, the passenger and freight 


traffic is fairly good compared with a 
decade and a half ago. 

THE PRACTICAL HORTICULTURIST AN AR¬ 
TIST. 

The progress made in the production 
of fine fruit is fully as great, or possibly 
greater, than that in transportation. We 
all recognize the fact, however, that we 
still have much to learn. If it were not 
for the strong desire to improve on our 
present condition we would not be as¬ 
sembled here. 

The best horticulturists of today in 
Florida are artists in their special lines. 
It takes as much careful thought, and 
as much application of this thought, to 
produce an ideal tomato, or an ideal or¬ 
ange or grapefruit, as it does to produce 
a fine picture on canvas, or to build an 
engine. As there are only a few master 
hands that can command a talent suffi¬ 
cient to produce a really first-class paint¬ 
ing, so there are only a few who produce 
a really superior horticultural product; 
and still fewer who have the commer¬ 
cial instinct sufficiently developed to get 
the highest price for their product. 

The pioneer fruit and vegetable grower 
lives under conditions that enable him to 
extract a mere existence in exchange for 
his toil and thought. It is quite natural 
that he should become more or less dis¬ 
satisfied with his lot in life. His sur¬ 
roundings cause him to lose interest in 
his work and home; he either sinks into 
a careless and indifferent existence, or 
drifts to a populous center where he be¬ 
comes a mere atom in human existence, 
and tosses about from one engagement to 
another. 

MIGRATION TO BUSINESS CENTERS. 

Under our old routine rule-of-thumb 
method of horticulture, the farmer and 
his children were mere machines, which 


32 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


did a certain amount of work at the ex¬ 
pense of a certain amount of energy. The 
thinking-mechanism was scarcely called 
into action. Under such conditions it 
is no wonder that our young men and 
young women sought relief by migrat¬ 
ing to the business centers. The evidence 
from history is that our foremost states¬ 
men, our foremost men and women in 
literary pursuits, as well as our foremost 
business men, were in the majority of 
cases raised in the country. This migra¬ 
tion to the business centers still continues. 
It is not surprising to those who have 
studied the matter, and who perceive 
somewhat clearly the cause. You cannot 
blame a young woman for hesitating to 
accept the position of a wife in the coun¬ 
try, when laborious drudgery, from early 
morning until late at night, is the only 
prospect in view. You cannot blame the 
young man for shrinking from a life of 
six days constant toil, and a Sunday of 
only half rest. Under such conditions 
we find even the fathers ancl xiiothers, 
who have spent possibly a half century 
of constant vigil on the farm, moving to 
the town or city to retire and spend the 
rest of their lives in comfort. This 
move to the city would never have been 
contemplated if they had been perfectly 
contented on the farm; or if the farm 
were the ideal place it ought to be. They 
move to town because their money will 
there buy them the comforts that were 
not obtainable in the country. 

MIGRATION TO THE FARM AT PRESENT 

IMPOSSIBLE. 

I have called attention to the fact of 
history that a larger percentage of our 
leading men and women were raised on 
farms than was due to the rural popula¬ 
tion. There must therefore be some vir¬ 


tue in the country as such for producing 
superior intellects, sturdy manhood and 
womanhood. Let us for a moment look 
at the extreme negative of this question. 
In the tenement district of New York 
City, which is the most populous center 
in America, there hangs a diagram show¬ 
ing the number of people to the acre of 
ground. It is calculated that at the same 
rate of crowding the world's population 
could be placed in the State of Delaware. 
An accompanying diagram shows that 
the average boy and girl in this crowded 
section is far below the normal size. 

These facts are so well known to my 
hearers that it is useless for me to en¬ 
large upon them. My speech has recalled 
to you the well known fact that we have 
a constant stream of migration from the 
country to the town, and no counter-cur¬ 
rent to the farm. It speaks volumes for 
the thrift and strength of those who re¬ 
main that this condition could have gone 
on for decades. The stream has been all 
one way—toward the town. It should 
not be understood that I would raise an 
argument against migration to the city. 
It very often happens that a very poor 
farmer would have made a first-class mer¬ 
chant, lawyer, preacher, or doctor. No 
two of us are endowed with the same 
talents and tastes combined in the same 
manner. We cannot readjust the ele¬ 
ments that make up our talents and intel¬ 
lects, but it is our divinely-appointed duty 
to seek and find the vocation for which 
we have been best endowed. 

BACK TO THE FARM. 

Thousands of people, possibly hun¬ 
dreds of thousands, in the United States 
find out when too late to change, that 
they have taken up the wrong vocation. 
The following is a composite of scores 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


33 


of pathetic letters that have come to my 
office for a reply: 

Dear Sir:—I have twelve hundred dol¬ 
lars that I have saved in the last ten 
years and wish to start in farming or 
fruit growing, as my health has been 
pretty badly broken by hard office work. 
There are three children in our family 
who ought to be brought up on a farm. 
I want to get away from town so that I 
can enjoy the companionship of my 
family. 

Where in your state can I invest and 
make a living from the start? 

Tours truly, 

Can there be anything more pathetic? 
After ten years of hard, unrelenting toil, 
with health broken, and disappointed in 
his highest ambition of providing for his 
family. Ten years of .the best of his life 
spent in following the wrong vocation. 
Ready, like the drowning man, to grasp 
at a straw, he risks his future on the ad¬ 
vice of a man to him unknown and in a 
distant state. I must confess to you, 
ladies and gentlemen, that when that prop¬ 
osition is placed before me to answer, my 
courage fails. It is too serious a mat¬ 
ter. 

These letters, of which the above is a 
composite, would not have made so deep 
an impression on my mind; nor would 
I have realized the magnitude of the un¬ 
rest in the city population, but for one 
incident that came to my attention rather 
accidentally. 

Mr. A. D. Shamel, a young friend of 
mine, was asked to award the prizes in 
the corn exhibit of the North-west. In 
an interview with a Chicago newspaper 
reporter he made mention of the fact that 
many young men wanted to go back to 
the farm. In less than ten hours letters 
began to pour in, and for two days three 

3 


stenographers were unable to complete 
the work of replying to the inquiries. 
This happened just before the money 
panic. The burden of all these inquiries 
was, How to get back to the farm ? 

I do not contend that all of these men 
would make a success of farm work. It 
had been clearly demonstrated to them, 
however, that they were misfits in the 
city. They were eagerly seeking for an 
opportunity to get away from the city, 
but the way was securely blocked. 

I have drawn out these illustrations at 
length to show fully the present condi¬ 
tion. (No one can say that he is not in¬ 
terested, for it is our own children who 
are swelling and will swell the throngs 
in the over-crowded cities.) 

Dr. Sledd, in his address tonight, has 
shown most clearly that our public schools 
teach our boys and girls away from the 
farm and from the grove. Nowhere in 
our common school system do we find 
anything that will make the boy more 
efficient on the farm or grove, or the girl 
more efficient in the house. 

AGRICULTURE IN OUR COMMON SCHOOLS. 

In discussing the matter of agricul¬ 
tural education in various parts of the 
state this year, a number of people have 
told me that they could teach their boy 
more agriculture and better agriculture 
on the farm than he could learn in any 
school. My natural retort is: “But do 
you do it?" The candid answer must be. 
No. Every mother here is able to teach 
her girls and boys arithmetic, spelling, 
and geography; but she does not do it, 
simply because it is much cheaper to hire 
it done, and at the same time the teach¬ 
ing will be much more efficient. Let me 
ask again: How many of us send our 


i 



34 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


children to hear the reminiscences and 
war stories told from grocery boxes, and 
call that history? The agriculture that 
is taught in the field while driving a mule 
or “cussing” a laborer bears about the 
same relation to agriculture that the gro¬ 
cery-box reminiscences do to history. It 
is not because the subject is too intricate 
or difficult, but no parent can afford to 
take the time from his busy day of labor 
to assume the role of a teacher, and give 
his son a systematic and rounded course 
in agriculture, any more than he can af¬ 
ford to give his son a course in arithme¬ 
tic or bookkeeping. It takes no longei 
to teach a dozen students in the same 
class than one; consequently, it is much 
cheaper to hire some one to teach a whole 
class than it is to spend all the time on one 
student. 

Probably the most potent reason why 
agriculture is at present so imperfectly 
developed in that adequate systematic 
effort for its advancement has not been 
made. Organized and concerted ef¬ 
forts for its advancement have been 
practically unknown until very re¬ 
cently ; and at present even higher edu¬ 
cation in agriculture cannot be said to 
be well organized, excepting in those 
states that are most advanced. 

We are entering a period where or¬ 
ganized and systematic effort will be re¬ 
quired to accomplish anything even of 
moderate proportion. Agriculture, the 
newest of the sciences, is being rounded 
out and brought into tangible shape. 
Our sister states, Georgia and Alabama, 
have made provision for district high 
schools in which are taught agriculture 
and domestic science. 

This is well enough so far as it goes, 
but it stops too high up. The very pu¬ 
pils who need the education most are the 


ones that are denied the privilege of at¬ 
tending the high schools. It is only a 
small percentage of our Florida boys and 
girls that receive any training above the 
eighth grade. These young people need 
to get some insight into the plants and an¬ 
imals they see and handle every day. 
Books have been, and are being, pub¬ 
lished bringing our knowledge into a 
concrete and teachable form. What if 
they don’t learn quite so much about the 
number of planets, or recite fewer defini¬ 
tions from a so-called grammar! 

It is not necessary to over-burden the 
course of study with agriculture in order 
that we may have pupils to study it. 
There are many thousands of children 
that do not receive any instruction at all, 
who would gladly avail themselves of a 
chance to learn something that appeals 
to them as being worth the while. 

Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I wish 
to say that we have left our homes and 
labors at no small sacrifice. We are here 
not for the mere pleasure we get out of 
the trip—that is a mere incident to the 
annual pilgrims; nor are we here that we 
may accumulate a few more dollars by 
some sordid method; but we expect to 
go back better men and better women; 
better equipped mentally and morally for 
the unceasing struggle of life. We ex¬ 
pect to return home with newer and bet¬ 
ter ideas of how to equip and beautify 
the home; and above all, we expect to 
be better women and men for having 
met our distant friends and neighbors on 
common ground for argument and dis¬ 
cussion. 

As your presiding officer, I hope that 
the arguments will be strong and force¬ 
ful, and the discussions vigorous and to 
the point, sparing neither colleague nor 
adversary; for it is the heated furnace 
that separates the g'old from the dross. 






Climatology of the Citrus. 


By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson. 


Mr. President 3 Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The subject of climate has in all ages 
and all countries furnished a vast and 
highly important field for the considera¬ 
tion of the horticulturist. 

This is especially true of those engaged 
in citrus fruit culture, for it is a thor¬ 
oughly demonstrated fact that the orange 
is limited in its profitable commercial 
production to certain well defined climatic 
zones. 

The study of airs, waters, places and 
soils may fairly be said to embrace chiefly 
chat which is included in the climatology 
of a locality or territory. On the north¬ 
ern hemisphere the isothermal line of 
seventy may perhaps be said to be the 
centre of * the orange growing districts, 
and the isotherms of sixty and eighty 
practically, though not exclusively, the 
limits. The isotherm of seventy is not 
confined to latitude but extends, in belt¬ 
ing the earth, north and south more than 
ten degrees and may be said to range be¬ 
tween the twenty-fifth and thirty-fifth 
parallels. Within this belt are found the 
orange-growing districts of California, 
Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, Spain, Mo¬ 
rocco, Algiers, Italy, Egypt and Asia 
Minor. 

These are not the only countries in 
which the orange thrives, as there are 
many other places in the transitional 
zones, both north and south, in which it 
may be found doing fairly well, but they 
include nearly all the districts that are 


chief factors in the commercial produc¬ 
tion of this fruit. 

The orange does not attain its great¬ 
est perfection or productiveness in tropic 
heat and can stand little or no freezing 
cold, hence any place where the tempera¬ 
ture ranges for any length of time below 
twenty or above one hundred is not a 
suitable climate for its culture. In South¬ 
ern Europe, Northern Africa, Western 
Asia and in California the cold is greater 
than in Florida, but is more evenly dis¬ 
tributed and continuous. In Spain, 
Southern France and Northern Italy or¬ 
ange groves are often covered with snow. 
In these countries, and in California as 
well, temperatures ranging as low as 
seventeen or eighteen degrees Fahrenheit 
are not infrequent and result in no seri¬ 
ous harm to orange trees. In Florida, 
owing to more warm davs. such extremes 
would be disastrous. Continuous cold 
weather hardens the tr^es, but alternate 
warm and cold periods do great damage. 

Under the head of water in relation 
to orange culture ■.{ may be said that it 
is a necessity in liberal quantities. 

As to location, it is a fact worthy of 
note that the most thriving districts are 
clustered around large bodies of water, 
as the Pacific, Mexican Gulf and Medi¬ 
terranean Coasts. 

The most extensive orange districts of 
Mexico are perhaps an exception to this 
and are found on the table lands, at ele¬ 
vations of from three to five thousand 












36

ieet; but even here they are rarely more 
than seventy-five or one hundred miles 
from the Gulf or Pacific Coasts. 

I saw no large or thrifty looking trees 
in Mexico, and in fact I have never seen 
trees anywhere as large and vigorous 
looking as we have in Florida, 

Oranges grown to maturity in the 
tropics are frequently wormy and us¬ 
ually sweet, almost to insipidity; hence 
they are generally harvested when 
intended for shipping before ripe. The 
delicious, snappy subacid flavor that 
makes the orange so attractive requires 
some cool weather. 

Long, continuous heat without cold 
snaps which we, perhaps wrongly, dread 
so much, has a tendency to encourage 
all kinds of predatory insects, described 
and indescribable and some others be¬ 
sides. 

If there is a deficiency in precipitation, 
mean or relative humidity, to get the 
best results it must be made up by irri¬ 
gation. In those places, as Florida and 
Mexico, where there is a summer rainy 
season, the ripening of the fruit is some¬ 
what accelerated and it reaches maturity 
shortly after the close of the wet season. 
On the other hand, a dry summer and 
rainy season in the winter, as in Cali¬ 
fornia, has a tendency to retard the time 
of ripening. 

As to soil, it may be said that a littoral 
alluvium rich in sand is the best. The 
writer’s observations lead him to say that 
he has seldom seen a profitable orange¬ 
growing district in which there was not 
a rich supply of sand in the soil. 

There have been so many scares re¬ 
cently that it may be worth while to say 
a few words as to change of climate, 
about which of late vears we have been 
talking so much, but perhaps no more 


than people have feared and discussed 
for the past five or six thousand years. 
There is a probability susceptible of 
proof that within the period of recorded 
history there has been absolutely no 
change of climate, with the exception of 
slight local changes due to destruction 
or planting of forests, cultivation of * 
crops, irrigation, etc. 

In the marvelously storied land of 
Egypt the same cereals, fruits and veg¬ 
etables are planted and harvested at the 
same time of the year they were thou¬ 
sands of years before the time of the 
Pharaohs. In Palestine, if not since the 
antedeluvian period, certainly and posi¬ 
tively since the time of Moses there has 
been no change. The seed time and the 
harvest time of the same staples, includ¬ 
ing seasonal festivals of the Syrians are 
still on the same dates. The same is true 
of Europe, and the brief history of Amer¬ 
ica offers no other kind of evidence. 

Meteorologists have from time to time 
advanced many plausible theories as to 
the causes that operate to produce sudden 
changes and extremes of weather. Solar 
heat is thought to be the main, if not the 
only source of warmth. Planetary in¬ 
fluences as disturbing causes have had 
many advocates and a Frenchman has 
recently suggested that the earth revolv¬ 
ing in its orbit has a motion like a spin¬ 
ning top, and from time to time wobbles 
nearer to or farther from the sun, with¬ 
out any possible regularity; hence the 
absence of periodicity as time in the oc¬ 
currence of severe changes. All theories 
so far advanced, it seems, are almost 
purely speculative, and probably extremes 
of temperature are caused largely, if not 
solely, by local disturbances and move¬ 
ments of the atmosphere. It is scarcely 
two hundred years since accurate instru-

ments, careful observations and detailed 
records have been in use, but these show 
no change. Speaking from a geological 
standpoint, the climate is indeed grow¬ 
ing warmer. There is evidence of glacial 
drift with Arctic weather as far south 
as Ohio, and the same is true of Central 
Europe. These geological changes, how¬ 
ever require thousands of years for their 
manifestation and we need not suffer 
any fear that our citrus isotherm will 
move far enough north to make it too 
tropical for any orange groves that may 


be planted near it within the limits of 
our present civilization. 


DISCUSSION. 

Prof. Rolfs—We have cords of sta¬ 
tistics on records of weather and cli¬ 
mate, but we have not a single man 
who can interpret them or make any 
use of them. We are now getting our 
climatological records in a little more 
accessible shape than they were twelve 
or thirteen years ago. 






Methods of Shipping and Packing. 


By W. S. Hart. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It has been wittily said, “To train a 
child, commence with his grandfather.” 
So to market fruit easily and profitably, 
one should commence by so cultivating, 
fertilizing and handling the grove as to 
produce good fruit, i. e., fruit of desira¬ 
ble sizes, good color, fine appearance, 
heavy weight, leathery rind and with 
juice qualities of the highest type; but, 
as all this has been and will continue to 
be discussed in these meetings by other 
committees, I will pass on to the time 
the fruit is taken from the tree. 

By a careful study of Prof. G. Harold 
Powell's very valuable report, “The De¬ 
cay of Oranges While in Transit From 
California” (Bureau of Plant Industry, 
Bulletin No. 123), and the report of 
Prof. Tenny before this society last year, 
all orange growers should become con¬ 
vinced of the important part that careful 
and proper handling of the fruit bears 
on the matter of successful marketing. 
With the best product of its kind, put on 
the market in the best possible shape there 
remains little in the way of “marketing 
problem” that need tax the ability of any 
able business man. 

Every handler of fruit wants the out¬ 
put of him who furnishes the best. To 
the dealer it means high prices, the most 
profit, the best trade and the finest kind 
of advertising at no cost whatever; for 
every grower wants to get in where high 


prices are being steadily realized, no mat¬ 
ter what the quality of his own fruit may 
be, and the consumer able to pay for the 
best goes to the high-priced merchant, 
feeling assured that there is where he 
will find it. 

I propose in this paper to give special 
attention to that branch of the subject 
covering the preparation of oranges so 
that they may command the attention of 
the best trade on arrival in market, leav¬ 
ing the broader but not more important 
phases otf marketing to other members 
of this committee, whose experiences 
especially fit them for the work. 

Hire all help by the hour, except, pos¬ 
sibly, the foreman and box-maker. When 
sending the pickers to the grove they 
should be well equipped with plenty of 
the best tools for their work that the 
market, or the employer, can provide. 

A strong draft animal, with nose cov¬ 
ered so that he cannot browse even a leaf 
from the trees, a good, three-reach plat¬ 
form wagon so made that the hind wheels 
will follow the tracks of the front ones, 
plenty of good field boxes made to rest 
one on top of the other in a way that 
will not allow of slipping, and with sides 
lower by three inches than the tops of 
the end heads, with openings at the sides 
near the bottom to allow of the free cir¬ 
culation of air and easy cleaning, with 
sides not too thick or heavy, and the box 
to hold no more or less than from one-

half to a full packed box of oranges 
according to the system of handling, and 
provided with good hand holds at the 
ends. Never use bags for picking. Either 
baskets, tin or galvanized iron receptacles 
are the only ones on the market that are 
safe. The latest make of basket leaves 
little to be desired in that line. 

Send a light but strongly made step- 
ladder for every picker and a good ex¬ 
tension ladder to about every three men, 
if the trees are of good size. Most im¬ 
portant of all, send clippers that are 
strong and durable so that each picker 
can afford to own and care for the one 
he uses, and so made as to render it as 
near to an impossibility to clipper-cut or 
puncture an orange as possible and yet 
allow of cutting the stem snug to the 
calyx, or even slice a part of it from the 
fruit. 

Until within a very short time, there 
has been no really good orange clipper 
on the market. Now the need is fully 
met. It is best always to send an extra 
pair of clippers along, and also a jug of 
water, that time may not be wasted in 
trips back to the packing house in case 
either is needed. No man should be al¬ 
lowed to use a pair of clippers that is not 
in perfect order so as to do good work 
rapidly. 

With the foregoing equipment and a 
piece of chalk for putting their number 
on each box they pick, the pickers should 
start their work at the bottom branches 
and work up as high as they can easily 
reach; then take the step ladders and, 
without leaning them against the tree, 
clean it of its fruit to fourteen or fifteen 
feet from the ground. Above this, long 
ladders will have to be used; but the 
utmost care should be exercised not to 
jam the limbs and fruit out of place more 


than can be avoided; as where that 
is done much fruit is injured by thorn- 
ing, crushing, scratching, or being shaken 
from the tree. Do not allow pickers to 
pull on an orange to get it within reach 
of the clippers. Every orange should be 
so clipped that if the stem end should be 
firmly pressed against another orange, it 
could not injure it. 

The picker should be trained to clip 
three or four oranges, where hanging 
handily, before putting them in the bas¬ 
ket; which must be done carefully and 
without a drop of over a half-dozen inches 
at most. Don’t leave scattering fruit, 
but pick clean as far as you go, unless 
selecting for size or ripeness. Turn the 
fruit into the field boxes with care, keep 
all dead twigs and trash out of all 
receptacles and keep the fruit shaded 
from the hot sun while waiting to be 
hauled. In loading, see that no box is 
so full as to permit of injuring the fruit 
by placing another on top of it, or that 
any may roll off. 

If oranges drop so that injury is pos¬ 
sible, lay them out as culls. There are 
many methods of handling fruit at the 
packing-house. They should be studied 
and the one best suited to the individual 
needs adopted ; but there are some gen¬ 
eral directions that may apply to all cases. 
The packing-house should be arranged 
for the careful and economical handling 
of fruit, as little carrying from place to 
place as possible; as little lifting of heavy 
weights as need be and above and over 
all, plenty of light. The house, bins and 
runways should be kept reasonably clean 
and no rotting fruit be allowed to remain 
in them or in out-of-the-way corners to 
fill the air with blue mold germs. Every¬ 
thing that fruit comes in contact with— 
receptacles, runways, spouts or finger

nails—should be often inspected to see 
that no rotten fruit, slivers, nail heads, 
rough trash or sharp edges can, by any 
possibility, come in contact with it. If 
oranges could squeal like a pig when hurt, 
there would be noisy times in some pack¬ 
ing-houses and about some pickers. 

The markets have had washed fruit 
and like it, if washed without injury. 
No washer will do good and safe work 
in the hands of careless workers; but 
there are some now on the market that, 
properly handled, will rather add to than 
injure the keeping qualities of our fruit 
while doing nice work. I wash all my 
fruit, though it is as clean and bright as 
that of any grove probably, and I could 
hardly be hired to give up the practice. 
After washing the fruit should be dried, 
being but one layer deep before being put 
into bins or crowded together in any 
way. A wet skin does not hurt sound 
citrus fruits if all parts are wet. Drying 
on one side and soaking on another is 
not recommended. My own packing¬ 
house is so arranged that if fruit has to 
be taken in wet from the outside drying 
rack, it will dry evenly in the trays where 
it is graded. 

All citrus fruits should be carefully 
graded into at least two grades. My 
own practice is to make three grades: 
Fancy, No. i Bright and No. 2 Bright. 
I have few russets. While grading, I 
have the scale insects, where there are 
any, removed by scraping with a light 
spatula of hard pine. Any orange that 
is even doubtful as to soundness is put 
in the cull box. 

I prefer to pack after the fruit has been 
off the trees at least twenty to thirty 
hours and has lost its rigidity. 

Tf the system of handling is in deep 
masses of fruit, then the quicker they are 


packed and shipped the better their con¬ 
dition on arrival in market. If the nights 
are cool and the days warm, it is ad¬ 
visable to close the packing-house tightly 
before the air warms up much, as 
otherwise it will deposit its moisture on 
the cold fruit so that they become drip¬ 
ping wet and unfit to be handled for the 
time being. With this exception a good 
current of pure air through the packing¬ 
house is always desirable. 

From the grading trays, the fruit goes 
to the large hopper holding many boxes, 
and from there to the sizer and through 
the spouts to the packing-bins. The slope 
of the hopper should be a little greater, 
but for drying rack and spouting, three- 
fourths inch to the foot is about right. 
There are many sizers on the market and 
several do good work. I should choose 
one that by no possibility could injure the 
fruit, that would size by the largest 
diameter, would be lasting, simple in con¬ 
struction and easy to' run. 

The bins from which the fruit is packed 
should be of good size; those likely to 
receive the greatest quantity should be 
the largest; those taking the largest and 
smallest sizes can be of less capacity. 
They should be so constructed as to avoid 
the necessity of pulling the fruit about 
with the hands and should have either 
canvas bottoms or be well cushioned 
where the oranges are to drop more than 
four inches. 

Use strong but not heavy tissue paper 
for wraps. The so-called Japanese is 
good, but a little too transparent. Paper 
that will give a reddish tinge to the fruit 
is best, if not too tender. Have your 
private brand printed on each wrap, 
and not so large but that the whole of 
it will show plainly on a 200-size orange. 
Wrap with brand opposite the stem and

pack as closely as possible without injury 
to the fruit. If the pack runs too high 
or too low, don’t pass the box until it is 
made just right by changing some of the 
fruit. The sizer must be set according 
to the shape of the fruit and will occa¬ 
sionally require re-adjusting where the 
average shape changes, as it will do when 
running on different varieties or fruit 
from different soils. 

Close packs will not stand to pack as 
high as the looser ones. From half to 
three-quarters of an inch above the heads 
of the box, necessitating considerable 
pressure in putting on the cover, is about 
right if packed properly in the layers. If 
the boxes are trimmed with lace paper, 
it is best to paste it at the bottom of the 
box and pack the first two or three layers 
with the brand next to it, then stencil 
so that in opening, that side will be the 
cover. If an attractive display card for 
the retailer to hang in his store is put 
in, it helps the marketing. Everything 
that tends to give the impression of care 
and neatness about a packed box and its 
contents adds to the price the fruit will 
bring and increases the demand. I have 
my material gotten out to orders sent in 
May for fall delivery. Bead the edges of 
every side, use a handsome strap thick 
enough to allow air to circulate between 
the boxes, and a neat and tasty stencil 
or printer. Don’t hesitate to put time 
and labor into preparing your fruit for 
market, for there is where a good portion 
of the profit lies. Every large city con¬ 
tains one, two or three, seldom more, 
fruit dealers who handle only fancy stock 
and they have customers who care little 
for the price they pay but are only satis¬ 
fied with the very best fruits obtainable. 
These are the houses that purchase from 
the man who puts intelligent work into 


his products; they are the ones that pay 
a dollar, two dollars or even more above 
the top quotations and never find more 
than they want of the kind that pleases 
them. There are only about three houses 
of this kind in New York, our largest 
city. The others pay the prices quoted, 
but they will pay more for the second 
grade or for the poorer sizes of the man 
who supplies the best trade than they will 
for the best fruit of the careless shipper. 

The shipper who caters to the best 
trade is not apt to be the one who ships 
one, two or more cars a day, but he may 
employ as many hands as one who does 
and give them work four months each 
season, help his town as much and net 
as much profit as his neighbor who has 
several times hTs acreage and crop. The 
man who makes and markets his crop at 
a cost of $1.25 and gets $1.50 for it makes 
a clear profit of 25 cents. He who sells 
for $3.00 makes five times as much net 
gain, if we allow 25 cents for added com¬ 
mission and cost of preparation, and there 
will be a short time almost every season 
when he will gross six or seven dollars 
per box for his best grades and sizes. 
At these prices, the small grower of only 
a few thousand boxes, and groves not 
so large but that he can handle them prop¬ 
erly and protect them in case of danger, 
may have quite a satisfactory income, 
while he escapes much of the anxiety and 
loss of the large grove owner who can¬ 
not give the close personal supervision 
necessary to the very best work. I am 
a believer in small groves, but there are 
individuals who are built for big things 
and can carry them on successfully, 
though they seldom reach the top of the 
market. 

The matter of agencies through which 
to market is one that I will leave mostly

to other members of this committee to 
present; but I wish to say this much: 
if you put your fruit in the hands of com¬ 
mission houses, look them up carefully 
before doing so, both as to reliability and 
courage in naming prices. To put hun¬ 
dreds, or thousands, of dollars’ worth of 
your products into the hands of strangers 
at a distance, with no security or guaran¬ 
tee of a square deal, is one of the stran¬ 
gest customs of our business system. You 
would not loan money to them without 
careful consideration and ample security. 
Why should we throw such fearful 
temptation in the way of our fellow, man 
and give him so many chances for fraud¬ 
ulent gain with little chance of punish¬ 
ment until, whether honest or not, he gets 
blamed when results fall short of our ex¬ 
pectations? If we must do this, let us at 
least take every means possible of elim¬ 
inating temptation and assure ourselves of 
the integrity of those who sell our pro¬ 
ducts. Some salesmen have little trouble 
in asking 25 cents above the market for 
something extra nice; but for the shipper 
of the choicest oranges there must be 
salesmen who know a good thing when 
they see it and who can ask fifty cents, 
a dollar or two dollars above the market 
with absolute assurance that it is not an 
over-charge. 

Much condemnation has been heaped 
on the heads of those who make early 
shipments of green fruit. It is often 
claimed that such shippers get meagre re¬ 
turns and ruin the orange market for 
others for the season; that it should be 
frowned upon by every citrus grower or 
handler and stopped by law, if possible. 
The first claim is seldom true, for the 
worst of these sinners. It is those who 
compromise with their conscience and fol¬ 
low the bolder ones, who take the low 


prices. For instance, a neighbor with 
groves alongside of mine shipped his tan¬ 
gerines in early November and got, gross, 
$6.00 and $7.00 for them. I commenced 
November 20th, and they sold for $5.00 
and even lower later in the season. I am 
no lawyer, but I don’t believe that the 
law can touch the matter, except it be 
through Boards of Health at the north¬ 
ern end; nor would I advocate it if I 
could, for I believe there is and always 
will be legitimate demand for a small 
quantity of early green fruit at good 
prices, and just so long as this is the case, 
just so long as growers are hungry for 
money in the fall, just so long as the fear 
of loss through drought, cold or other 
disaster is upon him who has a crop for 
sale—just so long will there be a rush 
of green oranges to market early in the 
season, a few condemned by health au¬ 
thority, a few high prices realized and 
then a slump and disappointment for the 
laggards. As these things will continue, 
why rant over them? Let the early ship¬ 
pers have their experiences. They cannot 
all be happy ones, and the more there are 
the sooner will every consumer get to 
know the true conditions, and the lover 
of sweet oranges will be taught to wait 
for them until Nature has had time to 
ripen their sugars and temper their raw 
acids. 

Though oranges grow in size through¬ 
out the shipping season and very high 
prices are often realized in March and 
early April, the danger from cold to 
the fruit of unprotected groves, the great 
dropping that commences when growth 
starts in the tree, the tendency to crease, 
to get puffy, to dry out and lose flavor 
late in the season, make it questionable 
whether it is best to hold even a part of 
the mid-season varieties later than the 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


first week in March. After this, the 
later varieties may be shipped at good 
prices and fair profit from groves well 
south in the state or farther north if the 
groves are protected from injury from 
cold. 

Load your own fruit into cars wher¬ 
ever possible, even though there be but 
a few boxes in the shipment, and see 
that the ventilators are all open. 

As between express and freight, for 
sound fruit I prefer the latter, believing 
that the rougher handling and stealage 
by express more than compensate for the 
difference in time of delivery, to say no¬ 
thing of the greater difficulty in collecting 
just claims. 

The lesson, then, that I would teach 
is carefulness that should run, like the 
red strand in the cordage of the English 
navy, through all our operations and re¬ 
lations with our fruit. This, coupled 
with honesty and loyalty to ourselves and 
the handlers of our products, will allow 
of our shipping our fruit to the north 
in ventilated cars and there hold more 
than our own against the pre-cooled and 
iced fruit of our worthy rival, California; 
but the lack of it during the past season 
has cost us dearly in both money and the 
reputation of our fruit. 

I also have some rules posted in my 
packing-house, and if you would care to 
hear them I will read them to you. They 
are for the guidance of help, and No. 18 
is for casual visitors as well. 

1. 

Care must be taken when picking or¬ 
anges not to clipper-cut, bruise or thorn 
them. 

2 . 

Every picker must put his number on 
the boxes he picks. 


43 

3 - 

Do not let oranges remain in the hot 
sun when waiting to be hauled, or for 
long when on the drying rack. 

4 - 

Every orange must be washed, and 
sponges used regularly when washing. 

5 - 

Keep plenty of water in the washer 
to hold weight of fruit so as to wash 
clean. 

6 . 

All oranges must be examined for long 
stems and all found must be closely clip¬ 
ped before the fruit goes into the washer. 

7 - 

When curing, oranges should not be 
over two layers deep. 

8 . 

Keep a constant and careful lookout 
for anything that will injure the fruit, 
such as nails, slivers, sharp edges or long- 
finger nails. All persons handling fruit 
for shipment (should keep their finger 
nails closely cut. 

9 - 

Be careful to have cushions in place 
when pouring oranges into bins or hop¬ 
per, and see that no injury is done to any 
that may be already there. 

io. 

Look out for blue mold about bins or 
boxes and for rotten oranges in the pack¬ 
ing-house. These should be removed at 
once. 






44 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


11. 

Care in picking, washing, grading, 
packing and all work connected with pre¬ 
paring fruit for market is of greater im¬ 
portance than speed. 

12 . 

Every doubtful orange is a cull. 

13 - 

Citrus fruits should remain in this 
packing-house to cure at least thirty-six 
hours. 

14 - 

Pack true to grade, size and equality, 
and so that when the cover is put on the 
fruit will be tight in the box. 

15- 

Each packer must put his initials or 
number on every box he packs; also grade 
and number of fruit in the box. Cus¬ 
tomers will be requested to send us the 
packer's mark on every box badly packed, 


so that the packer can be held responsi¬ 
ble. 

16. 

The W. S. Hart brand must be known 
as an honest brand. 

17 - 

No excuse is a good one for careless¬ 
ness or waste of time. 

18. 

All persons, both casual visitors and 
help, must bear in mind that this is a 
place of business and not for loafing, long 
stories or gossip; nor must visitors divert 
the attention of the help from their work 
for long at any time. 

No one but the undersigned has au¬ 
thority to change these rules. 

W. S. Hart. 

He who knows it all and resents in¬ 
struction, is hopelessly ignorant, a dis¬ 
appointment to himself and vexing to 
others, the last to be employed when help 
is scarce, and the first to go when it be¬ 
comes plenty. 


By F. G. Sampson. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

When I learned of my appointment on 
your Citrus Packing and Shipping Com¬ 
mittee, I wondered what I could say at 
all worth while, but from shape of mar¬ 
ket the past season, it does seem as if 
the time were right now when we should 
take counsel together for the bettering of 
conditions. We can start with the fact 
that if we are calculating to hold any 
position worth while in the markets, we 
shall be obliged to adopt the most im¬ 
proved methods all the way through from 


growing to marketing our fruit. The 
citrus plantings in California, Porto Rico, 
Cuba, Arizona, and Mexico are enormous 
and add to that the yearly planting in 
Florida makes an increasing supply that 
leaves no possible room for profit, for 
anything but the best work of which we 
are capable. The production of all other 
kinds of fruit is year by year being 
brought to greater perfection in quality 
and attractiveness, and any orange to get 
preference over other kinds of fruits must 
be both good to look at and to eat. Flor¬ 
ida does produce such fruits; but those

45 


very qualities (thin skin and full to burst¬ 
ing with delicious juice) calls for extra 
care all the way through, and in that, I 
am afraid, most of us are not doing our 
best at all. The past season was opened 
with shipments of fruit as green as the 
leaves on the trees; it is no trouble at all 
to color an orange, but it is impossible 
to make an unripe fruit fit to eat, and 
pretty nearly so to get a buyer for second 
lot after sampling first. Some early or¬ 
anges are ripe enough inside before the 
rind is fully colored and should be ship¬ 
ped and so prolong the season; but until 
you yourself enjoy eating them they 
should be left on the trees. 

Then, unless you have been in the mar¬ 
kets and actually seen condition on arrival 
of many of the shipments, you have no 
idea of the amount of decay. The per¬ 
centage of shipments arriving in bad or¬ 
der is responsible for continual lowering 
of the markets; for you can bet your last 
dollar that if the buyer sees any decay 
at all ( and he will see it if it is there) , he 
will buy at a price allowing for double 
what he suspects is there. 

Now, it is not enough for oranges to 
arrive sound; they must stay so until the 
retailer can sell them and the consumer 
eat them. Our fruit not standing up is 
responsible for the tremendous margin 
the retailer exacts. 

Then, again, no orange that has been 
in contact with a decaying orange has 
the fresh, inviting flavor that we must 
furnish our customers in order to secure 
consumption at good prices for the size 
of crops in sight. 

The wide range of prices the past sea¬ 
son shows that the buyers are ready to 
pay well for what they want. For in¬ 
stance, auction market sales New York 
February 26th Florida 1.20 to 3.25, Feb¬ 


ruary 27th 1.25 to 5.20, and 29th Florida 
1.25 to 5.65, California 1.65 to 3.10, 
Porto Rico 1.10 to 1.55 for oranges and 
grapefruit, these date from 1.12^4 to 
8.62^2. The growers getting 3.10 to 5.65 
for oranges and 8.62for grapefruit 
were getting rich; the others, I guess not. 

Part of our marketing troubles the past 
season were from causes beyond our con¬ 
trol, national financial troubles and 
drought causing summer-bloom fruit of 
different ages; but this trouble was in¬ 
creased by many shipping all ages to¬ 
gether, which, with decay, soon brought 
our markets too low for any profit. 

The Agricultural Department, in bul¬ 
letin 123, clearly shows the cause and the 
practical —not theoretical, mind you, but 
entirely practical remedy for most of the 
decay and we had best be getting busy 
studying and following. 

Putting me on this committee means, 
I suppose, that I am to give my own 
packing methods and SO' help start the 
discussion. We use the cloth-lined, rattan 
picking baskets, strap that goes over 
shoulder, of wide webbing, hung low 
enough so the elbow just clears the bas¬ 
ket, which is then where the forearm 
reaches the bottom of the basket; the 
fruit is placed in basket, not dropped. We 
round off ends of bent-blade scissors 
blunt, and pick all bottom fruit before 
using ladders. The picking “boss” sees 
that a picker slips his basket off his shoul¬ 
der, laying a dozen or so oranges in bot¬ 
tom of box and then tipping basket with 
one hand eases fruit into box with the 
other, and he puts his ticket in box as 
filled. Hand holes in field boxes are not 
cut clear through and so avoid finger-nail 
cuts, and boxes set down, not dropped at 
all. At the packing-house the fruit goes 
to grading bench, cloth-lined, and with 







46 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


heavy duck apron at the ends, with one 
side nailed down. The box is placed on 
a shelf four inches lower than the table, 
and the grading boss gathers end of 
apron in each hand and holds tight over 
box of fruit while he upsets the box and 
then lifts box off. As the fruit spreads 
out, if it shows long stems, they are cut 
and word is sent to the grove to 
straighten up that picker. 

Have short side benches that hold boxes 
for two grades bright and one russets, 
and cull box under bench and try, and do 
not forget to use cull box. Trucks hold- 
twenty-eight boxes carry graded fruit to 
different piles to cure a couple of days. 
Sizer-hopper has shelf and apron. We 
use sizer made by Alfred Ayer, Ocala, 
that sizes, and is set so that in packing, 
each tier has to have pressure to get last 
row in, and so the box will stand tipping 
at quite an angle before the fruit would 
roll out. 

We use Warner wrapping machines that 
twist paper tight and get box packed tight 
all the way up, and so avoid so much 
pressure on top as box is nailed up. As 
boxes are nailed up they are stood on 
end, two high, and have trucks with n- 
inch axle and wheels inside, so the two 
boxes are put right in place in car without 
further handling. 

We hire by the day, for I fully believe 
that piece-work is responsible for very 
much of the decay; at any rate it is cer¬ 
tainly easier to get the extra care from 
a hand when you are paying him for the 
extra time that may be required; but 
really when once the habit is formed, it 
requires very little more time to handle 
right, but it is certainly a day's work to 


make our hands understand we will have 
careful handling. 

My paper is too long already, but I 
want to say that I think our marketing 
methods must be improved, or our in¬ 
creasing crops will bring us no profit. The 
buyer and packer who did not lose money 
the past season was exceptionally for¬ 
tunate, and, naturally, all will contract 
very carefully this fall. I believe we must 
have a central distributing headquarters 
at Jacksonville, so the crop can be handled 
so as not to have each packer competing 
for every sale in each and every market. 

To handle the present crop in sight, the 
packers ought to get together for thor¬ 
oughly systematic distribution. We ought 
to have very much lower freight rates to 
nearby states. We could then sell fruit 
very good to eat but not quite up to stan¬ 
dard—cheap, and still get more than with 
distant freightage and so relieve the large 
markets of so much off-grade fruit. It 
is the accumulation of off-grade fruit that 
breaks our markets. Our Southland is 
prospering and will take lots of our fruit 
if we could deliver at reasonable freight 
rates. Unless our shippers organize and 
use quite a little judgment, we are likely 
to see our markets go to smash in a hurry 
this fall. The early markets paid so much 
better than the later, the past season, that 
the last one of us will probably think it 
smart to work all night and Sunday, too, 
to swindle someone with our unripe fruit. 

I believe the situation a very serious 
one, needing the most intelligent handl¬ 
ing. If we continue our present policy 
of “each one for himself and the Devil 
take the hindmost,” my judgment goes on 
record right here, that he will get a good 
big bunch of us this fall.

By O. W. Sadler, Jamestown, Pa. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I want to call the attention of the 
society to the extreme importance of a 
most thorough study and discussion of 
means and methods for the sale of our 
products of Florida. The extremely low 
prices obtained for everything this year, 
should have touched every grozver in his 
tenderest point—his pocketbook—severely 
enough to make him think and act. 

Since the collapse of the panic 
before Christmas, except a few cases 
of especially fancy stock, oranges 
have not netted, on the trees, over 
25 to 50 cents when consigned; at 
least that has been my experience with 
several cars to various markets reported 
as the best; $1.25 to $2.00 being the av¬ 
erage limit for good oranges. The 
causes preached to us were the “panic,” 
and the “large crop.” By investigation 
on my trip north, and since I have been 
here, has given another cause,— green 
fruit early in the season. The green-fruit 
proposition is brought about by two main 
facts or conditions. The first is, on ac¬ 
count of the comparatively few Florida 
oranges since the big freeze, the great 
mass of orange eaters have not learned 
what a good ripe Florida orange is, and 
do not know a Florida from appearance, or 
where it comes from, so have not sufficient 
knowledge to judge by. When there are 
few, if any, other oranges, the green stuff 
is offered for sale. They make a first pur¬ 
chase of “fine sweet Florida oranges,” 
and Oh! the awakening; and straightway 
their opinion of Florida oranges is de¬ 
cidedly expressed in—“Well, if that is a 
s-weet Florida orange , I never want 
any more.” By the time they get 
over that disappointment, they venture 


to try some other kind, and they find 
a colored green California and try it. ft 
is not real sweet, but as a Florida green 
colored orange is always very much more 
sour and rank than a California of the 
same stage of development, without fur¬ 
ther trial, remembering how awfully sour 
the Florida was, he remains a California 
chooser. 

This experience was told me by sev¬ 
eral people from several states and mar¬ 
kets, and positively asserted that the sale 
of green fruit had injured Florida’s repu¬ 
tation for good oranges to an enormous 
extent. 

As speculators were the chief cause of 
the shipment of green fruit the past year, 
and as the majority got left to the tune 
of 50 cents to $1.00 per box, after the dis¬ 
tribution of the first car in a commun¬ 
ity, they cannot work the “early sweet 
Florida’’ game in the same places again, 
at least to the consumer , it is to be hoped 
the state may redeem its name in part the 
next crop. Until this season I have al¬ 
ways been able to sell my Florida oranges 
in competition with Californias at an av¬ 
erage advance of 50 cts. over Californias. 
This year the reverse is the case, except 
with people who know the difference. Our 
greatly increased foreign population who 
have not yet had the opportunity to learn 
the difference, make up a majority who 
buy through ignorance and looks— bright 
Californias. 

The dealers have proclaimed loud and 
long that “the poor, the laboring class 
eat the oranges, and they are out of work 
and can not buy.” 

Is it true they can not, and do not buy? 
We are all aware the crop has been sold , 
and consumed—somebody ate the or-

anges. Did the consumer get any advan¬ 
tage of the low prices paid the grower? 

A few figures from my own sales on 
consignment of about 1,500 boxes, mostly 
car lots, will give one example of the very 
small returns to the grower. The average 
sales returned was $1.78. The average 
freight, cartage and commission, was 89 
cents, leaving 89 cents f. o. b. at packing¬ 
house. Taking from this the usual pick¬ 
ing, packing and shipping 50 cents, leaves 
39 cents on the trees. This was during 
January f February and March. Those 
sold f. o. b. at home did better, bringing 
$1.30 to $1.40, showing considerable ad¬ 
vantage of f. o. b. at home, over consign¬ 
ment. But this year there were very few 
f. o. b. buyers, and not all could be relied 
on to carry out their contract. 

Now, let us see if these low prices were 
necessary to the retailing of the fruit with 
a reasonable profit. 

I have inquired carefully as to many 
places, from Georgia, North, East and 
West, and in my own town, and find that 
retail sales were 15 cents to 20 cents for 
the smaller sizes, progressively upward to 
25, 35, 40, 50 and 60 cents as to size, 
and one gentleman living in New York 
said he paid 75 cents per dozen for 150- 
size. Averaging all prices would give 37 
cents per dozen. If oranges run all sizes 
in equal quantity, the average dozens in 
a box would be 15J4, giving an average 
retail sales price of $5.73 per box. If we 
only include 250s, 216s, 175s, 150s and 
126s, we get an average of 18^4 dozens, 
and averaging per-dozen prices at 15 
cents, 20, 30 cents, 35 cents, 40 cents and 
50 cents, we get an average of 31 2-3 
cents per dozen, 31 2-3x18^4—$5.85 per 
box, average all sizes and prices. 

If we grant a loss of i 6 j 4 per cent, 
for decay, there is still left $4.90 as the 


retail price per box. The above average 
commission house return price of $1.78 
leaves a net profit of $3.12, while the 
grower has received the generous sum of 
39 cents, including his investment, and 
profit?—where is the profit? 

Suppose we add one dollar more to the 
cost to the small and interior town retail¬ 
ers, he still has $2.12, or over five times 
more for selling than the grower for pro¬ 
ducing. 

Fruit-growers of Florida, are you will¬ 
ing to continue this unequal division of 
the products of your labor and expense, 
without an effort to change ? 

Let us take another example in the veg¬ 
etable line—cukes. The first week in May 
cukes selling in the chief markets at $1.00 
to $1.25. The average express charges 
in less than car lots not less than 75 cents, 
commission 11 cents, hamper, picking and 
packing 30 cts.—$1.16, average consign¬ 
ment sale $1.25; loss, 3 J4 cts. for grower. 
Consequently none but those who can ship 
in car lots have any chance of coming out 
even. 

Investigation as to retail prices, by per¬ 
sonal inquiry at large and small stores 
and fruit stands, I am told cukes average 
—small, medium and large—6 dozen per 
basket ; averaging the prices 30, 40 and 
60 cents per dozen—43 1-3 cents or $2.60 
per basket, or $1.38 net profit for selling, 
against nothing or a loss for growing. 

What is the use discussing how best to 
grow our products if we can get nothing 
for them ? The few commission men I 
have talked with about the matter, who 
should be the grower's agent to see that 
he got his share of what the consumer 
pays, say they do not see how they can 
change conditions. Although they have 
a society, they make no concerted effort 
to get our equal share, but, on the other 










t

hand, compete with each other in selling 
our products, thus favoring the retailer, 
practically giving us over into his power, 
as the foregoing figures demonstrate. 

Is there no way to remedy this con¬ 
dition? This is the great problem for our 
society to solve. Can we do it? Can the 
growers come directly to the consumer 
and cut out the middlemen who now are 
only agents for our undoing? 

The consumer pays enough for our pro¬ 
ducts, but we get very little of it. 

The result of my study of the question 
is, ORGANIZATION OF GROWERS SELLING 
DIRECT TO CONSUMER. 

That there will be many difficulties in 
its accomplishment, goes without saying. 
But that there are business men in our 
society to devise a plan and work out the 
details, I am certain; and when done, 
taking present conditions as a basis, I am 
sure there will be much more profit in the 
selling than in the raising. 

As I cannot be present at the meeting 
to discuss the matter with -you, I will give 
you a few of my thoughts as to a plan. 

Let every district or section organize 
and establish a common packing-house at 
the most convenient shipping point, so as 
to ship in car lots. A packing-house im¬ 
plies a competent picking and packing 
crew. 

Elect a competent man as grader and 
inspector of the fruit, either on the trees 
or as delivered at the packing-house, and 
each grower be given a credit certificate 


49 

for the number of boxes of different 
grades, or a more exact way, the number 
of pounds, and then let his fruit lose its 
identity as his special lot. 

A manager for each packing house or 
board of managers representing several 
or all, are then ready to sell f. o. b. at 
packing house. Or, having organized and 
opened a sales house or houses in places 
capable of taking—consuming a car load 
a week and upward, keep these sales 
houses supplied through telegraphic com¬ 
munication with a general head as they 
need. The details of retail distributing 
houses can certainly be worked out by 
successful business men. Each grower, 
each manager of packing-house, and of 
sales store, should be a stock owner, or 
interested financially, and partake of the 
profits. The organization could by vote 
fix starting price for fruit on the trees, 
or the proportionate percentage of the net 
proceeds at stated times. 

As it is nozv J the grower must pay the 
cost of shipment before they leave, and 
gets no money until the consignee gets 
ready to remit—from ten days to three 
months, and by drawing no money from 
the organization for the same average 
time the capital need not be large. 

I have not the time nor the capacity 
to go into all the details, but hope I have 
suggested enough to introduce the sub¬ 
ject, and certain that together, a success¬ 
ful way of benefiting ourselves and the 
consumer can be devised.

By W. E. Bryan. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Starting at the beginning of the sea¬ 
son the first problem is the packing of 
fruit that is not thoroughly mature; this 
fruit requires to be kept in the packing¬ 
house several days until the water in the 
rind has sweated out. If this is not done 
before the fruit is packed it will sweat 
in the box and undoubtedly cause decay, 
which will not develop until after it has 
left the packing house, and the grower 
will often be astounded when he gets a 
letter from his commission merchant in¬ 
forming him 'that his fruit, 'which he 
knows left his packing-house in good or¬ 
der and condition, has arrived in bad or¬ 
der, and has had to be sold at a sacrifice. 

The grower often thinks the commis¬ 
sion merchant is deceiving him and try¬ 
ing to cheat him when the true reason 
is found in the fact that the fruit having 
sweated in the box, has caused the wrap¬ 
ping paper to become thoroughly wet and 
the whole contents of the box are in a 
very moist state, which is a condition 
highly conducive to very rapid decay. 

Let us beware, then, of shipping or¬ 
anges with moisture in the rind. 

SIZING AND GRADING ORANGES. 

When packing fruit it is well to re¬ 
member that most of our fruit is packed 
to be sold to some stranger, who in turn 
will probably sell to somebody else; there¬ 
fore it is necessary that he should have 
some idea of how many oranges he is 
getting in each box and of what quality 
they are. The number and grade, then, 
should be put on each box plainly and 
the contents should be strictly accord¬ 
ing to stenciling both in number and in 
grade. Any irregularity in this respect 


will make the buyer suspicious of the 
fruit not being equal to the markings 
and in future buying lie will feel unwill¬ 
ing to pay full market prices, and hold a 
general distrust of orange packers. It 
is necessary, if each person concerned in 
marketing oranges is to' get their full 
quota of profit, that each and every one 
does his share of the work and that all 
should be in sympathy. When all can 
be trusted there is an economy in the 
marketing that should be an extra profit 
to all concerned. I have known of well- 
known brands of fruit fetching higher 
prices because it was known to be exactly 
as represented by the markings on the 
box. Such fruit often passes through the 
hands of the middlemen without the de¬ 
lay and cost of inspection. 

Let us, then, be careful to mark and 
grade our fruit correctly. 

PROPER PACKING. 

One of the worst features of poor or¬ 
ange packing is the putting of too much 
fruit in the box; in some instances so 
much is put in as to cause the top and 
sides to bulge out. This is done to such 
an extent that the top of the box cannot 
be nailed in the middle; the fruit in such 
a packed box is nearly sure to be very 
much bruised by pressure from other 
packages in transit and from handling. 
If dealers find much damaged fruit 
in their purchases, they have to sell the 
good fruit at .very advanced prices to 
make their purchase profitable, and thus 
materially restrict the consumption of or¬ 
anges, which restriction results in glut¬ 
ted markets and poor returns to the 
grower, whilst the consumer is complain¬ 
ing of the high price of retail oranges. 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


51 


These results are brought about by loss 
of damaged fruit caused by putting too 
many oranges, or too large oranges, m 
too small a space and them subjecting 
the box to outside pressure from other 
freight, both in the railway car and on 
the transfer trucks. 

SIZE OF ORANGE BOX. 

What size should an orange box be? 
The size should be regulated by economy 
for the grower and availability (to the 
consumer. The packing will be most eco¬ 
nomically done by having a box large 
enough and not too large for one man 
to handle and lift without other aid than 
his own physical strength, and large 
enough to keep a man of ordinary 
strength in good exercise, thus handling 
a good many oranges at one time and at 
the same time keeping up a high degree of 
manhood amongst the orange fraternity. 

The size of the box from the seller's 
point of view should be that which is most 
available to dispose of in the market. 
The present size of the box, viz.: I2xi2x 
24 inches, would seem to be large enough 
and not too large for one man to handle ; 
and if the commission merchants do not 
complain of the size as being awkward to 
dispose of, I do not think we should 
change. We should pay no attention 
whatever to any size of box that some 
other orange section may produce, know¬ 
ing fully well that the orange buyers will 
pay just so much, that the fruit will bring 
them a profit and that their price will be 
regulated by their ability to make their 
profit out of the contents of the box. 

The unit of economy in the size of the 
box is that it should be large enough to 
tax the strength of an ordinary man, and 
not larger, and if the present size of the 
box fulfils this condition, any other size 


would make the cost of handling greater, 
which extra cost would have to to be paid 
by the grower when the fruit was in 
abundance and low in price, and by the 
consumer when the fruit is scarce and 
high and always means money paid to the 
middleman either by the producer or con¬ 
sumer. 

Some sections may find it advisable to 
have a very small box, as possibly not 
much of their fruit is wanted; but if 
Florida fruit is classed as being equal to 
the best, let us send it out in abundance, 
and not try to restrict our output by 
contracting the size of our box. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Hart—Now, there is a great 
deal of difference in white papers. 
Some white papers will give you the 
proper color. The mandarine orange 
is of much better quality than the tan¬ 
gerine, but the latter brings nearly 
double the price of the other. The 
Japanese paper does not give that 
pretty tint and it is so transparent that 
it shows up the blemishes badly, but 
it is tough and does not break or tear 
easily. I also think the print is of much 
importance. Your private b r a 11 d 
should not be too large. I have seen 
some so large that on a 200 orange you 
could only see some confused printing 
in the middle. A good print can be 
made small, yet plenty large and plain 
enough to show the whole of it on a 
200 orange. 

Before the fruit goes into the washer 
the thumb, finger or the eye comes in 
contact with every calyx, and if any 
stem is left on them they are carefully 
clipped off. It would be almost im- 








52 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


possible for a long stem to get by my 
men as far as the washer. 

Mr. Skinner—I have heard it said 
that Mr. Sampson puts up the best 
pack in the state, not excepting any. 
I think it will do us a great deal of 
good to listen to these men and learn 
what they have learned by experience. 
The great trouble with me is labor. 
We have to import from ioo to 200 
hands every year and we have to get 
green hands and when you have to deal 
with these fellows and get them to pare 
their finger nails, etc., we are up 
against it. I have one thing in my 
packing house that is of great help to 
me, and that is truck boards. When 
the boxes are nailed up they are set 
on this truck board and we have a 
special truck that is slipped under it, 
and the boxes are moved right into the 
car and are not touched at all. The 
truck board protects the fruit entirely. 

I was struck by a little article I saw 
in the paper not long ago. The writer 
said he set his fruit over some steam 
pipes so that it could not get cold and 
attract outside moisture. He also said 
he washed his fruit with a little sali¬ 
cylic acid, and he said the wounds that 
it had received dried over. I have been 
thinking of that. I use a washer with 
a great deal of satisfaction except 
when the burlap breaks loose, then I 
have a good deal of trouble in getting 
it fixed. I think my washer is the best 
washer there is, but it is necessary to 
have good burlap. 

Mr. Hart—I would like to ask Mr. 
Skinner what becomes of the boards 
he speaks of? 

Mr. Skinner—The fellows that are 
trucking run the truck to the end of 
the car where the man is loading*, and 


he lifts the boxes off and sets them in 
place. The truck boards are thrown 
to the side of the car and a man sets 
his truck under them when a pile ac¬ 
cumulates and carries them back into 
the packing house. 

Mr. Hart—I saw them in California 
used for plums and I thought they 
would be fine for oranges. The point 
I mean to bring out is that you would 
have to handle your oranges once more 
than you would without them. 

Mr. Skinner—We use them when 
the fruit is brought into the packing 
house, in fact, we use them every¬ 
where. You see, our station and pack¬ 
ing house are together. 

Mr. Hart—Most of the trucks that 
are used are so made that the arms are 
so high that it comes right in the mid¬ 
dle of the section where it can do the 
most harm. I think them very bad, 
indeed, to handle fruit. I once put an 
iron bar across them to prevent that, 
but if these boards can be used, I think 
it wise to do so. Do you use one board 
to three boxes? 

Mr. Skinner—Yes. You see, you 
have to have two cleats underneath 
the boards. These cleats fit right over 
the prongs on the truck, and you can 
lift them up and carry them without 
the least difficulty or danger. 

I might speak of another thing. 
Perhaps you are familiar with the Cali¬ 
fornia load. In refrigerator cars espe¬ 
cially it is a fine thing. You put six 
boxes across the car, standing them up 
on end, and there is a space of about 
four inches between each box in an 
ordinary car and six inches in a vent. 
Then two strips are nailed across, 
leaving a vent clear through, each box 
by itself. There is a straight line of 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


53 


boxes from one end of the car to the 
other. The cost of the stripping 
never exceeds $1.25. To show you 
how well it holds, I had a car handled 
by the Atlantic Coast Line in its 
usual careful way. They were going 
about forty miles an hour when a 
wreck occurred. That car turned over 
on its side and rolled down a hill. How¬ 
ever, each layer of boxes settled down 
against the next one, and only about 
six boxes in the car were broken. 

I think Dr. Inman might be able to 
tell us a good deal along this line, if he 
will. 

Mr. Inman—Mr. President, Ladies 
and Gentlemen: Had I known that I 
would be called upon, I might have 
formulated some ideas which would be 
of interest to my fellow fruit growers. 
I am not a good talker, and if I had 
any ideas, I fear that I cannot present 
them in a very interesting way. But 
I can probably tell the story as it ap¬ 
pears to me. . 

First, let us cast about and take an 
inventory of what we are doing in the 
way of growing and harvesting citrus 
fruits in Florida. Are we producing 
as much or of as good quality of fruit 
as we should do? And after it is 
grown, are our methods of harvesting 
in keeping with the spirit and pro¬ 
gress of the times? I am free to say 
that we are growing but little over 
one-half of the fruit that the groves of 
the state are capable of producing un¬ 
der a more through system of care and 
cultivation. But, upon this subject I 
do not propose to dwell, as it, within 
itself, would require a volume. How¬ 
ever, I will say right here that I have 
visited a good part of the world where 
citrus fruits are grown, and have come 


to the conclusion that, so far as I have 
seen or acquired knowledge of, there 
is no country or region which affords 
the advantages for the growing of or¬ 
anges, tangerines and grapefruit that 
we possess right here in Florida; no 
place where fruit grows to such perfec¬ 
tion or the groves produce so abun¬ 
dantly, and no place where an enter¬ 
prising man can engage in the busi¬ 
ness with the same certainty of being 
well compensated for his labors. 

Harvesting.—This is one of the all- 
absorbing subjects of the day, and the 
one demanding the most thorough in¬ 
vestigation and thought, followed by 
energetic action upon the part of every 
one engaged in the fruit-growing in¬ 
dustry. Our careless and rough hand¬ 
ling is costing the state thousands, yes, 
hundreds of thousands, of dollars every 
year. I make the assertion that fully 
ninety per cent, of the Florida fruit 
which arrives in market in bad order 
is attributable to careless clipping and 
careless handling. All of us flatter 
ourselves that we are taking extra 
pains and doing better than our neigh¬ 
bors, and that if our fruit does not reach 
its destination sound, the fault lies with 
the transportation companies and not 
with us; when, if the truth were 
known, fully one-fourth of the oranges 
were either punctured by the clippers, 
scratched by the finger nails or bruised 
by dropping, jamming against the lad¬ 
ders, pouring into the field boxes, 
rought treatment by teamsters, empty¬ 
ing and piling up in the hoppers, or 
falling from the sizers into packing 
bins. All of these matters seem to be 
of small moment until they are care¬ 
fully looked into. When that is done, 
the result is simply astounding. We 




54 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


must awaken to the importance of 
these little details, and bear in mind 
that fruit should be handled with the 
same care that we would give eggs, 
and will actually stand no more rough¬ 
ness without great damage. Stop and 
consider. Is there one of the abuses 
mentioned that we cannot coriect and 

entirely eradicate? 

I am not making these statements 
at random, nor without abundant evi¬ 
dence to substantiate every word or 
assertion. They have all been con¬ 
firmed by actual tests, made by gov¬ 
ernment experts, both in this state ana 
California, during the past season. Re¬ 
member that the slightest scratch upon 
the rind of the fruit is just as surely 
fatal as a deep puncture or severe 
bruise, provided the fruit is exposed to 
the rot spores, which are never want¬ 
ing in every one of our packing houses. 
Every small inch of atmosphere con¬ 
tains thousands of them. 

Marketing.—Here comes the business 
part of all of our undertaking, the one 
that must be revolutionized very soon, or 
the business of the growing of citrus 
fruits in our fair state will soon fall into a 
more chaotic and helpless state than 
it is at the present time. Who is to 
blame? No one but our dear selves, 
and no one but the growers can ever 
correct the existing evils. We can and 
must do it. 

Let us take the state of Florida as a 
whole, and make it a business proposi¬ 
tion, applying to each one of us singly; 
for what concerns any one of us, ap¬ 
plies to every one in Florida engaged 
in the growing of fruit. 

Let us see if we are acting as busi¬ 
ness men should—are adopting good 
business methods. What are we 


doing, and what are our methods, and 
what must we do? If you will bear 
with me, I will enumerate some of our 
follies. To begin with, we are sup¬ 
porting about one thousand solicitors 
and drummers, representing commis¬ 
sion houses from almost every city in 
the North, South, East and West. Add 
to these one thousand men about 
five hundred livery rigs and drivers. 
These are all high-priced men, and ex¬ 
pensive livers. This army of itself 
costs us hundreds of thousands of dol¬ 
lars annually. But this is but the be¬ 
ginning of our extravagant manage¬ 
ment, for we are supporting, in a good 
part, an equal number of commission 
houses in nearly every city in the 
Union. I do not wish to be under¬ 
stood as casting any reflection upon 
these men, nor upon the fruit houses; 
for I acknowledge that the great ma¬ 
jority of these men, also the houses 
which they represent, are doing a legi¬ 
timate business, and at the same time 
doing the very best they can for our 
interests. But, is our way or system 
of marketing correct and in keeping 
with good business principles? I would 
answer, most emphatically, No! No! 
You will ask, “Is there any remedy 
within our reach, any system of econ¬ 
omical marketing upon which we can 
all unite, one which shall be just to all, 
one by which the widow and the small 
grower with a badly assorted grove, 
producing a little of all varieties and 
kinds of citrus fruits, will fare as well 
and receive the same price (quality the 
same), as the most shrewd and com¬ 
petent business man?” To this I an¬ 
swer, with the same emphasis and con¬ 
fidence, Yes! 

You inquire by what authority and 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


55 


ways I have arrived at these positive 
conclusions, and how I am able to talk 
as though these were established facts. 
To answer and prove that I am not 
dreaming or theorizing, I will tell the 
whole story as I know it. 

I have been in Florida twenty-two 
years, and during all of that time have 
been engaged in the growing of fruit, 
and that, too, with very good success 
and results, which I do not complain 
of. But, for the past two or three sea¬ 
sons, I have been convinced that our 
methods were not the best, and that 
the orange growers of California were 
outdoing us, both as to harvesting and 
marketing of their crops. 

On April fourth I decided to go to 
the Pacific coast and investigate, not 
alone for myself, but with the hope of 
benefiting my neighbors as well. By 
appointment with Prof. Tenny, a gov¬ 
ernment employe, I was met at River¬ 
side by Professor Powell, who has 
been engaged, through the Horticul¬ 
tural Department at Washington, for 
the past five years in making a thor¬ 
ough study of conditions existing 
there, and teaching, by a vast number 
of experiments, the growers how to 
correct the evils and errors, which he 
discovered existing there, which were 
many, yes, even more and worse than 
are besetting us at the present time. 
The growing and marketing of their 
oranges was affording almost no profit 
and, in many cases, an actual loss 
to the producer. Their methods of 
harvesting were very crude, and when 
it came to selling their fruit and get¬ 
ting it to market, the results were such 
that a great many of the orange groves 
were abandoned, or cut down and the 
land planted to other crops. It seemed 


impossible for them to get their or¬ 
anges to the Eastern markets without 
their arriving rotten. How to remedy 
matters was the task undertaken by 
Professor Powell, and that, too, almost 
single-handed, for he was supported 
with an appropriation of only $3,500 
annually, out of which he had to meet 
all of his personal expenses, as well as 
to pay his assistants (when he had 
any). This season the appropriation 
is $6,700.00 and he has seven men to 
aid him. It seemed a Herculean task, 
and one almost without hope. But, 
what has been the result, what has this 
one man achieved? How plainly has 
he demonstrated that men, not money, 
are the powers which are moving the 
world at the present time. 

In the first place, he demonstrated 
that the harvesters, and not the trans¬ 
portation companies, were at faidt for 
the rotting of the fruit. Pie showed 
the growers, by actual experiments, 
that in some cases over fifty per cent, 
of their fruit was hopelessly damaged 
before it was delivered to the railroad 
company. This was his first key to% 
the solution of the problem, and. with 
all of his experiments before the grow¬ 
ers, the remedies were easily found, 
and all enterprising growers set about 
jointly to correct and remedy every 
bad feature in the harvesting, until to¬ 
day oranges in California are handled 
with the same care as eggs. And 
claims upon the transportation have 
been reduced about seventy-five per 
cent. 

Next, as to the methods of market¬ 
ing, and the organization known as the 
California Fruit Exchange, which is 
today, I believe, the most thorough 
business organization in the United 


56 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


States, not excepting the Standard Oil 
Company or the United States Steel 
Company; and, more, it is one without 
graft or fraud, and to which I can see 
no probability of fraud creeping in. 
The California Fruit Exchange has 
only about or less than $20,000; If I 
remember correctly, it is $15,000 capi¬ 
tal, upon which it never pays a divi¬ 
dend. I will try to tell you something 
of the Fruit Exchange. This organ¬ 
ization consists of numerous packing 
houses, or associations. These asso¬ 
ciations are usually made up of neigh¬ 
bors, for whom it is convenient to do 
their packing at one packing house, 
and of these associations there are a 
great many, and each one of these as¬ 
sociations is entitled to one share of 
stock (no more) in the Fruit Ex¬ 
change. This share of stock entitles 
the association to one representative 
to or in the Fruit Exchange. The 
Exchange is made up and controlled 
entirely by these representatives from 
associations (who do not draw pay). 
These representatives elect the board 
of directors; the board of directors 
elect the officers, and the officers elect 
the President and employ the execu¬ 
tive force. The Fruit Exchange is al¬ 
most a complete duplicate of our Fed¬ 
eral Government. 

All business is transacted at head¬ 
quarters at Los Angeles, and it is sur¬ 
prising how much can be done by a 
few men when well systematized. For 
instance, and to illustrate some of their 
methods and their success, only five 
years ago the Fruit Exchange was or¬ 
ganized, with only a few associations. 
It then only controlled a small per¬ 
centage of the fruit. But, by thorough 
business methods and advantages 


which co-operation afforded. It has 
grown very rapidly, until this season 
The Exchange will handle fully sev¬ 
enty-five per cent, of all the citrus fruit 
grown in California, amounting to 
over thirty thousand (30,000) car¬ 
loads. And all of the sales are man¬ 
aged by two head salesmen, with only 
six traveling salesmen to help them. 
How does this compare with our force 
employed for the selling of our small 
crop? It is not five per cent, of our 
expense. I11 fact, the whole expense 
of managing associations, Fruit Ex¬ 
change, collections, buying and all, 
does not amount to five per cent. 
Losses, defalcations and non-payment 
of accounts, as shown by the books 
of the Exchange, which are open to 
all, amount to less than three hundred 
($300) dollars, and this, too, upon 
sales amounting to over thirty millions 
of dollars ($30,000,000.00). Payments 
for fruit to the growers are made in 
cash every thirty days, no losses, no 
zt'orries. You might inquire if there 
are any other benefits or advantages 
to be derived from such an organiza¬ 
tion as the California Fruit Exchange. 
Yes, very many. For instance, before 
this organization was effected, the 
growers were paying nineteen (19) 
cents each for orange boxes. Today 
they cost them 12 to 12^2 cents. 
Paper, machinery, the price of help, 
and the supply are managed by the 
Exchange. Freight rates are all man¬ 
aged by the offices of the Exchange, 
and the rates which they pay on fruit, 
considering the broad distribution 
which they enjoy, is very much less 
than we pay from Florida, notwith¬ 
standing that we are two thousand 
miles nearer to the markets.

A very small proportion of the Cali¬ 
fornia fruit is re-shipped from point to 
point, as the Florida fruit is. The Cali¬ 
fornia rates are all made to Denver, 
Colorado, and beyond. It costs no 
more for them to place a car in Boston 
than in Denver, freight the same to 
all points east of that city. 

Shall I tell you how the labor is 
done by the Californians ? This might 
be of interest and may be a help to 
you in getting down to a proper way 
of doing the work, with the object in 
view of correcting the present errors 
and abuses. 

To begin with, all labor is employed 
by the day, except the wrapping of 
the fruit. This work is nearly all done 
by women, and the price per box is 
two and one-half (2J4) to three cents. 
In all packing houses which I visited 
they were paying two and one-half 
cents per box. The picking is done 
by man, not expert pickers such as we 
employ, but Mexicans, Chinese, Japs, 
Indians or white men, under the eyes 
of a Superintendent, whom they must 
obey to the letter and in the proper 
spirit. This field superintendent is sup¬ 
plied by the association for which the 
work is being done, and all gathering 
must be done under the supervision 
of their officers, and not according to 
the taste or ways of the growers, for 
here is the beginning of the careful 
work, and of very vital importance, 
for an error here is past remedying. 
We cannot patch up a damaged or¬ 
ange. 

Hauling.—This is all done upon 
spring wagons, and the field boxes are 
carefully set upon the wagon and when 
taken off are carefully set down, not 
shoved or thrown. They never use a 


field box larger than a common orange 
box, and they fill these boxes about 
two-thirds full and carry about sev¬ 
enty-five to ninety boxes upon each 
wagon. 

I am asked how it would be possible 
for us to form such an organization 
in Florida, where our matters are in 
such a state of confusion. You say 
that it would not be possible to get a 
sufficient number of growers to unite 
to control a majority of the fruit; too 
many firms and individuals with pri¬ 
vate interests would oppose and work 
against us. Yes, they would do their 
best; but we would not need any cer¬ 
tain percentage of the fruit. The prin¬ 
cipal object should be to do the work 
in such a manner and at such a saving, 
and show such results, that the ques¬ 
tion would be not as to who wished 
to join the associations, but as to who 
the associations would take in; for all 
who become members of the Exchange 
have to submit to the positive rules 
of the same. Remember, and do not 
confound the terms Exchange with 
that of associations. The latter is 
made up of an association of neigh¬ 
bors for the better gathering and 
packing of their crops. The Exchange 
is composed of representatives, one 
from each Association. Every grower 
is in reality a member of the Ex¬ 
change. How could we proceed to or¬ 
ganize an Exchange? What steps 
should we take? To this I will say 
that nearly all present are orange 
growers, and among us we have a 
large number of enterprising, loyal 
men who could be appointed by this 
Society for the purpose of forming an 
organization. They would proceed as 
follows: Say three be chosen to go

to California and fully familiarize 
themselves with the workings of their 
Exchanges and Associations. The 
Californians send you through me an 
invitation to come there, and they will 
warmly welcome and aid you. Get a 
copy of their Articles of Incorporation. 
The California Fruit Exchange is an 
open book, and they are with us and 
are very anxious that we organize, 
which would mean much to them, and 
do away with our glutting and ruin¬ 
ing every market within our reach. 
You never hear of a glut of California 
oranges. They were willing to give 
me a copy of their Articles of Incor¬ 
poration, which I have, also by-laws 
governing several of their associations. 
This Committee would return and re¬ 
port to their fellow members. The 
next step would be to secure a lec¬ 
turer and organizer—a teacher; the 
same one who did the work (or nearly 
all of it) for the Californians. (I was 
told by their President he thought he 
could be had.) Set him at work and 
as soon as half a dozen neighborhood 
organizations were effected, proceed 
to incorporate the Florida Fruit Ex¬ 
change. And, by the way, we have 
now in this state quite a number of 
these local organizations, which are 
ready and waiting to organize an Ex¬ 
change. This work would go on very 
rapidly and with a positiveness of suc¬ 
cess, as we would have all of the ex¬ 
perience of our California neighbors, 
the full benefits of their system, from 
beginning to end, which has cost them 
thousands of dollars and five years of 
hard work. 

After a great deal of study, I am 
in favor of an organization in Florida, 
with the California organization as 


our pattern. We must do this if we 
wish to remain in the fruit-growing 
business for profit; if we wish to avoid 
the greater calamity which confronts 
us. Conditions are becoming worse 
every season, and the coming season 
will experience worse gluts and rot- 
outs in the markets than ever before. 
Not that there is too much fruit; no. 
We cannot grow too much fruit. That 
is not the trouble, and is not a fault 
to be remedied. The faults are these: 
Too great an expense is allowed to ac¬ 
cumulate upon our fruit between the 
tree and the consumer. This is an 
old song, but we are going to remedy 
it. I speak again with positiveness, 
for where our pocketbooks are 
touched, the same thrust pierces our 
hearts also. 

We are going to organize and that, 
too, soon. The time is at hand, and 
within five years seventy-five per cent, 
of our crop will be handled in a busi¬ 
ness way, and the same per cent, of 
our expenses will be cut off. 

It may seem like a big undertaking 
to get us in line, but it would not 
be. But it must be done by men with 
an honest and pure motive, with no 
graft to be anticipated, for none can 
exist. If I were a young and strong 
man, I would be only too glad to do 
this work for the good of our state, 
and could do it with but very little 
money to start with. 

Dr. Richardson—I have been very 
much interested in these papers and 
the discussions. While they have all 
been instructive and beneficial, it does 
not seem to me that any suggestion 
has reached the bottom of the situa¬ 
tion. What the Harts and Sampsons 
and Inmans and the rest of the men

can do as individuals, does not benefit 
the average grower. These gentle¬ 
men have found out how to raise or¬ 
anges and how to contend with the 
natural and unnatural enemies of the 
industry and meet them successfully. 
They represent themselves and per¬ 
haps five per cent, of the orange grow¬ 
ers outside of themselves in the state 
of Florida. Let me tell you how the 
situation is in my own neighborhood, 
and I think it is a typical neighbor¬ 
hood. Seventy-five per cent, of the 
fruit grown in that neighborhood is 
neither picked nor packed nor mar¬ 
keted by the grower. The buyer 
comes in and he hires men to pick it 
and pack it and ship it. The men that 
we have to hire to do this work for 
us are a set of irresponsible men, and 
if they got their just deserts they would 
all be hung. I can’t stay to see my 
oranges packed. I have got reasona¬ 
bly fair prices for my oranges and the 
men who have bought them have suf¬ 
fered perhaps more than I have. Why 
do we sell our fruit this way, though? 
Why are we compelled to sell it to 
people who have no interest in his 
reputation as an honest grower, whose 
only idea is to sell the fruit at the best 
possible price? It is simply because 
of the lack of co-operation; simply 
from lack of willingness to exercise 
confidence in our neighbor and fellow 
man. When I talk to my neighbor 
about co-operation for our mutual 
good, he simply draws into his shell 
and says, “My business is my own, and 
your business is your own, and if you 
will leave mine alone, I won’t bother 
yours.” Now, we know what is 
the proper thing to do, but how are 
we going to get seventy-five per cent. 


of the growers to know what we know 
and what should be done for their 
own good ? It is bound to come after 
a while, as Dr. Inman says. It may 
not come in his time or in my time, 
as he has so unkindly intimated that 
he and his contemporaries are past the 
first flush of youth; but it is to the 
gentlemen who are on the platform— 
Prof. Rolfs, Dr. Sledd, and the others' 
—to whom we must look. It has to 
be done through education. It must 
be taught to the coming generation; 
not only horticultural and agricultural 
methods that will be successful, but 
they must be taught that intelligent 
co-operation is the only way to make 
a success of the orange or any other 
business. We expect you to teach the 
coming generation how to do this, but 
we know you can’t do it alone. We 
cannot get all the orange growers to 
come into this association, and how 
can we teach them to pack and ship 
oranges to get the best results ? 
Through education. That is the key¬ 
note, and until we educate them up to 
seeing their own interest and realizing 
the fact that “united we stand, and 
divided we fall,” we never can expect 
anything in the way of results. What 
does the man coming here from 
Cleveland or Baltimore or New York 
care about our success or our reputa¬ 
tion? He wants to get the most he 
can out of the crop. We have to pay 
his expenses and, in fact, everything 
comes back on the grower. The only 
way to restore Florida’s reputation as 
the best orange-growing country in 
the world, is to co-operate with that 
end in view. Send out men to organ¬ 
ize local organizations, and let the 
members of these local organizations 




60 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


obligate themselves to practice meth¬ 
ods that will protect us all. Let us 
bind ourselves together in organiza¬ 
tions that will hold, and then we will 
succeed. 

Dr. Inman—I also want to tell you 
that under the California organization 
the man who produces ten boxes and 
the man who produces a hundred 
boxes stand on a parity with the 
largest growers in the association. 
This organization is not incorporated 
for the purpose of making money for 
itself. It never pays dividends. The 
men who operate the California Fruit 
Exchange are salaried men. They are 
employed by the association. I would 
not advise our people to organize an 
association here in Florida except on 
this strictly and purely democratic 
basis. 

As Dr. Richardson has said, we are 
supporting too many men at too great 
an extravagance. 

Mr. Reaves—I just wanted to ask 
Mr. Inman to explain a little further. 
We had experience down at Sarasota 
some years ago. We had an Orange 
Growers’ Union in this state then and 
local unions were organized, one at 
Sarasota and one at Oneco. I was 
president of the one at Sarasota and 
felt so much interest I also attended 
the meetings at Oneco. The union 
saw the necessity of properly distrib¬ 
uting the fruit and for that reason 
they had adopted the fruit exchange 
as a medium through which to ship. 
In order to get the fruit properly dis¬ 
tributed we tried hard to get all the 
growers to ship through the exchange; 
we knew that fruit shipped to com¬ 
mission men was not properly distrib¬ 
uted. One prominent shipper at 


Oneco said that he had a good com¬ 
mission man and he was going to ship 
to him. Another shipper by the name 
of Marshall hesitated, but finally 
joined and shipped through the ex¬ 
change. When the returns came, the 
man who had shipped to his commis¬ 
sion man said, “Well, Marshall, how 
are your returns ? Ha, ha; mine are 
way ahead of yours.” Marshall looked 
at them and said, “Doggone the Fruit 
Exchange, the Orange Growers/ 
Union and the whole business; I am 
going to ship to commission men af¬ 
ter this.” Commission men are sharp 
enough, and if they see that things are 
going against them, they are willing 
to make a little concession. His com¬ 
mission man saw the point and he used 
his opportunity to do us up there. Of 
course, a lot of the men who were ship¬ 
ping through the Exchange could not 
see through the little scheme and said 
to themselves, “Well, if the commis¬ 
sion men give so much better returns, 
we will ship to them after this and let 
the Exchange go.” That one man 
broke up the whole thing; everybody 
went back to patronizing the commis¬ 
sion business. 

The time has been when commis¬ 
sion men were necessary, but I believe 
that time is past. We have rapid com¬ 
munication to all points to which we 
ship, which makes it possible for us 
to sell if the commission business were 
out of the way, and I believe if this 
Horticultural Society would co-op¬ 
erate with the Association in Califor¬ 
nia, we could get a United States law 
against the commission business. As 
it is, hundreds of growers may ship 
to some one point, the market may 
become glutted and prices correspond-

ingly low. In many cases, we all 
know it would be cheaper to let the 
crop stay in the field to make fertil¬ 
izer than to ship it. 

Dr. Inman—If you people would 
only be in earnest about forming this 
organization, we would not have as 
much to contend with as the Cali¬ 
fornians did. Prof. Powell, in two 
months, would organize the state of 
Florida into as solid an organization 
as that of California, if you would only 
co-operate with him. There is no 
question about the commission men buck¬ 
ing hard and trying all their methods and 
schemes, but they will be very easily 
overcome if you listen to the advice 
of men of ability and experience like 
those in California. They have driven 
the commission men out of busi¬ 
ness out there. There would be no 
trouble to get these men of ability; 
the trouble is to determine definitely 
and positively what we want. I don’t 
want you or ask you to take my in¬ 
vestigation of the matter. Send some 
men out there to see for themselves 
and make you a report. The fruit ex¬ 
change is composed of such men as 
Dr. Richardson, Mr. Boardman, Mr. 
Skinner, Mr. Hart and all you other 
gentlemen whose names I do not 
know. 

Mr. Sampson—Don't you think we 
need it particularly this year? What 
price do you expect the buyers are go¬ 
ing to offer for fruit if there is not 
some better methods of packing? I 
think one great need is to standardize 
the packing. 

Dr. Inman—So do I. I don’t think 
it would take very long to organize if 
we can strike while the iron is hot. 
We'ought to be able to know every 


year that we are going to have a good 
fruit market and that we are going to 
get our money for the crop with the 
least possible expense. 


AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Professor Rolfs—We had this morn¬ 
ing a little talk about packing and 
shipping oranges, and Dr. Inman and 
some others cited the methods that 
were employed in California in pre¬ 
paring the fruit for market and ship¬ 
ping the oranges. It was suggested 
that you, Mr. Tenny, be requested to 
give us a little talk about the organ¬ 
ization out there. 

Mr. Tenny—I will not talk long 
now, since the society asked me to 
give a paper this evening" on a some¬ 
what similar subject and as this will 
require nearly an hour I do not wish 
to weary you this afternoon. The 
Doctor has possibly given you an im¬ 
pression that the organization, that has 
been known up to a couple of years 
ago as the So. California Fruit Grow¬ 
ers’ Exchange, now known as the 
California Fruit Growers’ Exchange 
is a pretty large affair. This year they 
are shipping approximately sixty per 
cent, of all the oranges and. lemons 
from Southern California. This great 
organization did not come into being 
at a single stroke. It has been a 
growth. Its beginnings were back 
about 1895. The organization grew 
out of the fact that it was realized 
that the citrus growers were not in¬ 
dependent of each other, but depend¬ 
ent, especially as to marketing of their 
fruit, with regard both to a systematic 
distribution of the fruit over the ship- 








62 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ping season and to the geographical 
distribution. The Exchange has grown 
steadily from 1895 when it handled 
about one-third of the crop until the 
present time when its shipments 
amount to something like sixty per 
cent. No better account of the work¬ 
ings of the exchange can be given than 
is found in Bulletin 123, recently pub¬ 
lished by the Bureau of Plant Indus¬ 
try, Department of Agriculture, which 
says, “Among the co-operative organ¬ 
izations, the California Fruit Grow¬ 
ers’ Exchange packs and sells through 
its own district agents in the markets 
somewhat more than fifty per cent, of 
the entire citrus crop. This organiza¬ 
tion is formed to regulate the distrib¬ 
ution of citrus fruits throughout the 
country and to give to its members 
the benefits that arise from its co¬ 
operative efforts of various kinds. 
This Exchange represents about 4,000 
growers, who are organized into more 
than eighty local incorporated associa¬ 
tions, the primary function of which 
is to prepare the fruit for market. The 
associations in the different producing 
regions combine into one or more 
local incorporated district exchanges 
or selling agencies, which sell the fruit 
through the district agents or at pub¬ 
lic auction and receive the money 
therefor through the medium of the 
California Fruit Growers’ Exchange. 
There are thirteen of these district ex¬ 
changes. Each local district exchange 
selects a representative to act for it on 
the board of directors of the California 
Fruit Growers’ Exchange, which is an 
incorporated body acting as an agency 
or clearing house for the district ex¬ 
changes in the marketing of their 
fruit and which operates for the grow¬ 


ers without profit to itself. It takes 
the fruit of the district exchanges after 
it is packed, and with their co-opera¬ 
tion and advice places it in the differ¬ 
ent markets of the country, sells it, 
collects the proceeds, and turns them 
over to the district exchanges, which 
in turn pay the growers through the 
local associations. The California 
Fruit Growers’ Exchange is the 
agency through which the grower is 
able to control the larger business 
problems and the general policy of the 
handling and marketing of the citrus- 
fruit crop.” 

This description gives you a good 
idea of the management of the gen¬ 
eral exchange; but you may be inter¬ 
ested in a more detailed account of the 
relations of an individual grower to the 
Exchange and the way his fruit is 
handled. A group of men, possibly 
one hundred or it may be a much 
larger number, living in a certain lo¬ 
cality form an association. They build 
a packing house and elect a general 
manager, who has the running of the 
house. The shipping season is divided 
into periods varying in length from 
two to six weeks, and these periods 
are known as pools. As the fruit of 
the individual grower comes into the 
house it is usually weighed; at the 
time of packing, this fruft is put into 
the several grades and each grade is 
weighed automatically. A record is 
kept of the individual loads, and this 
gives the weight of fruit of each grade. 
At the end of the pool the total 
amount of each grade of fruit shipped 
from the house is determined and also 
the selling price of this fruit. In this 
way, the manager is able to determine 
what each pound of fruit of each grade 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


63 


for that pool is worth. He is then 
able to figure the amount clue to each 
grower contributing fruit for that 
pool. By this method of shipping fruit 
under brands selected for each grade, 
the individual grower loses his iden¬ 
tity as far as the market is concerned, 
when the fruit is graded. 

Mr.-What has been the result? 

Mr. Tenny—It has been satisfac¬ 
tory. The fact that the Exchange has 
grown from handling a small portion 
of the crop to sixty per cent, shows 
that it has been successful. 

Mr.-What per cent, of Californa 

is Southern California in the shipping 
of fruit? 

Mr. Tenny—This year the state of 
California is shipping somewhere in 
the neighborhood of 30,000 cars of or¬ 
anges and lemons. About 2,000 of 
these come from north of the Teha- 
chapi Range of the Sierra Madre 
Mountains. The largest plantings are 
in Tulare County, and these plantings 
are sufficient so that under favorable 
conditions 10,000 cars may be ex¬ 
pected. Some co-operative houses are 
in operation in this section. 

Mr. Skinner—Is the exchange still 
growing ? 

Mr. Tenny—Yes. 

Mr.-What is done with the 

other fruit not included in the sixty 
per cent? 

Mr. Tenny—There are several large 
co-operative houses that are not con¬ 
nected with the California Fruit Grow¬ 
ers’ Exchange. Then there are cer¬ 
tain individuals who ship direct to 
eastern markets. There is also con¬ 
siderable buying by eastern men who 
have their fruit packed in private 
houses. 


Mr.-About how much does the 

cost of maintaining this organization 
tax the grower? How much per box? 

Mr. Tenny—I can’t give you that 
figure, but the tax per box is not large. 

Dr. Inman—It is about five cents a 
box, if I remember correctly. 

Dr. Inman—Are you able to give 
the figures showing how much the or¬ 
ganization has been able to save its 
members by the purchase and trans¬ 
portation of supplies? 

Mr. Tenny—No, I cannot give these 
figures either, but I do know that the 
saving has been very large. They have 
been able to secure a rate on box ma¬ 
terial that is very satisfactory from 
the growers’ standpoint. 

Mr. Reaves—Do you think it would 
be possible to have the same organiza¬ 
tion run on the same principles in 
Florida ? 

Mr. Tenny—No, I doubt if an asso¬ 
ciation exactly similar to the Califor¬ 
nia exchange could be worked in Flor¬ 
ida. The scattered condition of the 
orange sections in Florida make it 
harder to co-operate. The industry in 
Florida appears to be more in the 
hands of the packer and the shipper 
rather than in the hands of the 
grower. I see no reason, however, 
why a co-operative body of ship¬ 
pers or shippers and growers could 
not be made successful in Flor¬ 
ida. The essential feature would 
be to have people that are will¬ 
ing to work together. The suc¬ 
cess of such an organization depends 
very largely on the character of the 
men who are selected to be at the 
head. These need to be high-class 
business men, who, of course, will 










64 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


have to be secured at a good big 
salary. 

Mr.-Does the association dis¬ 

courage the selling of oranges at the 
packing house, or do they do all the 
selling through agents in the east? 

Mr. Tenny—No oranges except the 
culls are really sold at the packing 
house. If a person wishes to buy fruit 
from any individual packing house, 
f. o. b., he can make this purchase 
through the agent of the exchange. 
Of course, in all these matters, the 
managers of the individual houses are 
consulted and, to a very large extent, 
they determine where their fruit shall 
be sold. 

Dr. Inman—When a person wants 
to come into the exchange, is it done 
for the life of a crop or for a series 
of years? For violating the rules it 
costs them a penalty of about fifty 
cents a box. It ceases to be boys’ play. 
A man might become dissatisfied, but 
it would make no difference about the 
marketing of his fruit. The associa¬ 
tion of packers come in, and take his 
fruit just the same. That is the better 
way; not to be bothered at all by the 
individual growers. 

Mr. Tenny—As I understand it, any 
grower may withdraw from the ex¬ 
change house at the end of any fruit 
season. I would not be sure about 
this matter, however. 

Mr. Griffing—Does the local as¬ 
sociation look after the picking or just 
the packing of the fruit? 

Mr. Tenny—The usual method has 
been for each individual grower to do 
his own picking. Recently, however, 
we have been doing a good deal of 
work on the methods of picking and 
we find it much easier to eliminate in¬ 


juries made in the picking when the 
association does the picking than when 
it is done by the individual growers. 
When the house picks the fruit, it is 
possible to obtain an efficient foreman, 
who properly superintends the pick¬ 
ing. 

Mr.-What is the output per day • 

from one of these packing houses ? 

Mr. Tenny—From one to ten cars. 
The average house ships four or five 
cars a day. 

Dr. Inman—The packing houses are 
run under perfect discipline. Each man 
has a certain work to do and pays 
strict attention to business. It is 
just like clock work. There is no 
racket at all. 

Mr. Griffing—Do they have much 
trouble with labor? 

Mr. Tenny—They have all sorts of 
labor. There are many Japanese, 
Chinese, Mexican Greasers and a good 
many hoboes. Women do a large por¬ 
tion of the packing. The Chinese are 
also used in the packing houses, but 
not much in the fields. The field work 
is done largely by the Japanese, Mexi¬ 
cans and whites. 

Dr. Inman—The wrappers were get¬ 
ting 2y 2 cents per box. Some were 
paying as high as 2^/4, and it was a 
rare instance where the limit of three 
cents was paid for the wrapping. 

Mr. Skinner—How many boxes per 
day will the average packer pack? 

Mr. Tenny—I have seen packers 
who would wrap and pack over 100 
boxes. A great many wrap and pack 
from seventy to seventy-five. 

Mr. Hart—My experience has been 
that the packers will only average 
about fifty boxes per day. I consider 
that good work for an average packer. 









FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


65 


That is about the limit of my pack. 
It costs me about four cents a box; 
that is an allowance of $2.00 per day 
for packing. If the packing went up 
to the average of the California packer 
it would cost me about $4.00 a day for 
packing. 

Mr. Von Engelken—Is the grower 
expected to clean his fruit when it is 
infected with scale or other diseases? 

Mr. Tenny—All washing and brush¬ 
ing of the fruit is done in the packing 
house. Practically all the fruit is run 
over brushes which clean it of dust. 
In case the fruit has to be washed in 
the packing house, this is charged up 
extra against that lot of fruit. 

Mr.-Did the Department have 

anything to do with the organization 
of the exchange? 

Mr. Tenny—We have had nothing 
whatever to do with the organization 
of the exchange and have done no co¬ 
operation with the exchange other 
than what we have done with in¬ 
dividuals. The fact that the Exchange 
handles its own fruit and handles 
such a large quantity of fruit has made 
it advisable for us to do a large part 
of our experimental work in their 
houses. We have shipped much fruit, 
however, in cars that have been 
packed by individual shippers, or in 
co-operative houses that are not con¬ 
nected with the Exchange. 

Dr. Inman—Through what agency 
was the fruit exchange organized and 
put into operation? 

Mr. Tenny—I cannot give you the 
details of the organization of the ex¬ 
change. 

Mr. Reaves—Does the Exchange 
use the commission men in any way? 

Mr. Tenny—All sales are made 


through their own agents or at auc¬ 
tion. 

Mr. C. L. Reaves—I located in Ma¬ 
natee county in the vegetable and fruit 
business in the spring of 1874. I have 
orange trees that are nearly forty 
years old from which I shipped the 
first fruit, and have been shipping 
fruit from them ever since. When I 
settled in Manatee county near the 
Sarasota Bay in the spring of '74, I 
had only $15.00 in money and no prop¬ 
erty at all. Now, I have an orange 
grove, a little stock farm coming on 
(about eighty acres) ; I have a store 
and the postoffice and my credit is 
good everywhere except with my wife. 
I must tell you about that. At the 
time I was married, I married a lady 
down here, there was nobody in the 
country except cattle men, and they 
were having very little work done and 
it was hard to get money in any way. 
I gave $11.00 for oranges to get the 
seed and managed somehow to get rid 
of the other four dollars, so that I did 
not have any money. I had a little 
muzzle loading rifle that was almost 
the only property I possessed. I 
pawned that to get money for the 
preacher. My wife had forty dollars 
and I borrowed money enough from 
her to pay for the license, and she de¬ 
clares to this day that I have never 
paid it back. I don't believe now she 
would lend me money to buy license 
to marry any women. 

Now, about the vegetable growing 
and shipping. I have had experience 
along this line as well as the fruit busi¬ 
ness. I don't expect to say very much 
about the growing of it; that would 
be enough to take up all the time. I 
would advise anybody who goes into 


5

the vegetable business to first try to 
learn the methods of doing it right. 

Now, the shipping is the main thing. 
I remember yesterday one gentleman 
said, in telling about the rules posted 
in his packing house, that one of them 
was that his brand must be an honest 
brand. If you can make your brand 
an honest brand, you can sell your 
fruit and vegetables and you don’t 
need commission men to sell it for 
you. Now, you know the commission 
men do not sell direct to the people 
very much. The commission houses 
I have seen sell only at wholesale. 
About the only good they do you, is 
to have you dump in your stuff and 
then they show it for you. 

One day I was in Bradentown in 
company with some of the best fruit 
and vegetable growers. They were 
talking about the shipping of to¬ 
matoes. One fellow said, “If I ship 
my tomatoes, I would like to put up 
good stock in good shape. If I were 
selling here, it would not make so 
much difference.” Another said, 
“Well, I don’t know so much about 
that. I think if I were selling here I 
would like to put in good stock, be¬ 
cause I would like to build up a good 
reputation at home.” I listened to 
these men and was amazed. Not an 
honest expression. It was simply a 
question of doing right because it was 
good policy. Not a single one said he 
was going to do right because it was 
right. That is what we should do; 
we should make our fruit and vegeta¬ 
bles something that can be depended 
upon; make it so that when anyone 
buys from us, they know they are go¬ 
ing to get their money’s worth and 


they are going to be done by as we 
would like to be done. 

I asked several questions yesterday 
while we were talking about the Cali¬ 
fornia Fruit Exchange, with a view of 
finding out their methods. I learned 
that sometimes this Fruit Exchange 
sells the fruit at auction where it is 
an auction town, but if not, they sent 
a man all the way from California to 
sell the fruit, which is expensive. Not 
only that, but when they send a man 
they have to trust that man to some 
extent, just as we have to trust com¬ 
mission men. I noticed some time ago 
that there was a man in the United 
States Treasury Department who had 
grown old in the service, having been 
there since he was a young man, and 
had established a reputation for hon¬ 
esty. In some way, he got into a little 
tight place and there was a $1,000.00 
bill missing out of the Treasury. One 
man came very near paying the 
amount back because the suspicion 
was directed to him. A lady learned 
the truth about it, and the guilty man 
finally acknowledged having taken it. 
What we need to do, is to arrange it 
some way so that we will not have to 
trust anybody only just as far as busi¬ 
ness methods go. It is asking too 
much to found an Exchange and put 
men in charge and find some among 
them who will not work to their own 
advantage. There is bound to be 
graft in any organization, and we will 
have to pay for it. 

In Manatee county we have men 
who for years have been buying, 
packing and shipping fruit and vegeta¬ 
bles. The rule in their packing 
houses is “Honesty.” They have built

up a reputation for honesty. They 
use the wires, which is less expensive 
than sending a man. They get a man 
to buy, and when the man sends an 
order they ship the car and send a 
sight .draft on the man’s bank, with 
the bill of lading attached. If the man 
who gave the order will honor that 
draft, the fruit is his, but if he won’t 
honor the draft, he can’t get the fruit. 
The shipper is notified by wire and he 
at once places the fruit with some 
other man. They sell it right from 
Manatee county, and they get their 
money, too. 

I have had considerable experience 
along that line. Some years I sold 
everything, some years have shipped 
to commission men, and the years I 
have sold are the years I made the 
money. I have known some men to 
get rich in a year sending to commis¬ 
sion men, but, as a rule, they have 
come out at the little end of the horn. 
In many cases, they use rented land, 
pay rent, pay for fertilizer and pay for 
labor ; then after they have a crop they 
ship it hundreds of miles away to a 
man they know nothing about and say 
to him, “Take my stuff and do just 
what you please with it. Send me 
some money if you can.” 

Last fall, one of the best tomato pro¬ 
ducing men in that part of the country, 
who had as good land as there is, de¬ 
cided to raise a little crop. The 
weather was dry, and we didn’t raise 
very much, fortunately. We got 
about 400 boxes and they were care¬ 
fully put up and carefully selected, 
and vegetables were quoted pretty 
high. We shipped to several commis¬ 
sion men and they all said, “Your fruit 
came in bad condition;” or this, that 


and the other; and after shipping 
about four hundred crates, we had to 
foot the bills, but the returns we re¬ 
ceived, were just a little more than 
enough to pay for the crate material. 
It would have been better for me to to 
have let those tomatoes rot in the 
field. 

The question with us is, whether the 
commission man is a necessity at the 
present time. I think the time has been 
when he was. One man said yester¬ 
day, “I think it is necessary to have 
the commission man to buy the fruit.” 
Now, if that is the commission busi¬ 
ness, I am in favor of it; but what I 
understand to be the commission busi¬ 
ness is for a man to sit up and ask the 
people to send him goods on the con¬ 
signment plan, and if you send them 
to him he shows them to the public, 
sells them if he can, takes his com¬ 
mission out, and sends you the rest, 
if there is any. If he does not sell it, 
he loses nothing, but you do. 

I believe the commission man hin¬ 
ders our business. For instance, you 
want to buy fruit in one of the cities 
and you invest in a car of it. You 
buy from a commission house and 
they don't know and you don't know- 
what is going to be dumped in within 
the next few hours. You pay your 
money and in a few hours perhaps a- 
dozen cars of fruit come in, and what 
are you going to do? You have spent 
your money and the fruit is on your 
hands and perhaps no market for it. 
The commission man is going to put 
you out of business if he can. 

We buy goods frequently from the 
manufacturer instead of the middle 
man, and why cannot the people buy 
direct from the grower instead of 




68

through a commission man, who is 
going to get a profit from both sides? 

Down where I am, there used to be 
a large number of alligators. All we 
knew how to do with the alligator 
skins was to buy them and ship them 
to commission men. Of course, freight 
would be so much, commission so 
much, available portions of the skin so 
much, and we never could tell just 
what we were going to get for them. 
Now we don't have to do this. I 
have here a letter from a certain firm 
who are getting alligator skins direct 
from the merchants. They guarantee 
us a certain price for a given length 
of skins. 

I think that nine-tenths of the fruit 
and vegetable growers patronize the 
commission business; perhaps even a 
larger percentage. The Bible says, 
“Lead us not into temptation.” This 
commission business will lead us to do 
wrong, and it certainly leads the com¬ 
mission man into temptation. I have 
known many a commission man who 
had enough consignments in one sea¬ 
son to set him up in business. And, 
as I have said all along, though the 
time may have been when the com¬ 
mission man was necessary, that time 
is past, and it is up to us to discover 
some way that we can get along with¬ 
out dealing with him. 

One man sent well-gotten-up letters 
and quotations to all the growers in 
South Florida and offered the ship¬ 
ping agent at Sarasota a large per¬ 


centage of his commission to solicit 
consignments for him. A lot of our 
most intelligent shippers sent oranges 
to him. He sent quick returns and 
large checks, which caused us to think 
that he was all right and we shipped 
him more oranges, but his checks 
proved to be of no value. Mr. Mont¬ 
gomery, of Palmetto, Fla., let one of 
his checks go to protest and employed 
a lawyer in the city where the com¬ 
mission man was located to try to col- 
lect something, but he failed. Then 
I reported him to the Post Office De¬ 
partment for using the mails for 
fraudulent purposes. His case was 
presented to the United States Court 
at Macon, Ga., but they neglected to 
subpoena the witnesses to go before 
the grand jury until the statute of 
limitation was nearly out and then 
they did not give us time enough. I 
was the only witness that got there 
in time and they said that one witness 
was not enough and that the time was 
too near out for them to subpoena us 
again on that complaint, but that he 
had been reported later by a man near 
Jacksonville, iwhjich wtould gave us an¬ 
other chance. The next time, my sub¬ 
poena got to my postoffice the day that 
I was to be in Macon. I sent them a 
telegram at once that I would be there 
and took the first train, but when I 
got there the grand jury had ad¬ 
journed, so the whole thing was lost 
and nothing accomplished. 



Is Decay of Oranges in Transit Necessary? 


* 

By Lloyd S. Tenny, 

(Pomologist, U. S Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.) 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The ultimate end of commercial fruit 
growing is to make money. With a very 
limited supply and a large demand for 
any particular fruit, no difficulty is found 
in realizing this end. This has been true 
in the citrus industry. But with the 
growth of refrigeration and the extension 
of the railroads, production has increased, 
and the tendency is for profits to dimin¬ 
ish. There comes a time finally when 
the minutest details must be looked after 
in order that the profits may be large 
enough to keep the industry alive. 

In 1894 when Florida reached high 
water mark in citrus production, South¬ 
ern California was shipping annually less 
than two million boxes of oranges and 
lemons. The Tulare district in Cali¬ 
fornia was then unplanted. Shipments 
from Cuba and Porto Rico were so few 
as to influence but little the market con¬ 
ditions. Then came the freeze and Flor¬ 
ida was practically eliminated for the 
time being as a large producing state. 
Fourteen years have passed and once 
again Florida looks forward to a rec¬ 
ord-breaking crop. During these years, 
however, great changes have been made 
in the orange producing sections. South¬ 
ern California is, this year, shipping 
nearly or quite 30 thousand cars or over 
11 million boxes of oranges and lemons. 
Tulare county has now an annual pro¬ 
duction of about two thousand cars; new 


plantings have been made which, under 
favorable condition, may increase the 
production in that section to 10 thousand 
cars, or about four million boxes. Cuba 
has been pushing forward in its planting, 
and while no reliable information is at 
hand, doubtless between 8 and 10 thou¬ 
sand acres have been planted. Porto 
Rico, also, has extensive plantings that 
run up into the thousands of acres. I do 
not wish to discourage you orange grow¬ 
ers, or to make you think there will be 
no market for your fruit. With the in¬ 
crease of production, there has come a 
large increase of demand. Hundreds of 
small towns over the country that now 
have oranges in their stores throughout 
the season scarcely saw a box of the fruit 
in 1894. The quantity eaten in. the large 
cities has also been very largely increased 
during these years. It is safe to say 
that with a proper distribution of the 
fruit, fair profits might be made by all 
growers, provided only the fruit could he 
placed on the market in a sound condi¬ 
tion, and with a feeling in the minds of 
the buyers that they could hold the fruit 
ten days or two weeks with only a rea¬ 
sonable amount of decay. 

This leads us to ask the question, “Is 
it necessary to have decay of oranges in 
transit ?” or “What is the length of time 
that oranges should be expected to keep 
after being packed ?” 

Two years ago the Department of Ag- 




70 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


riculture at Washington began the study 
of conditions in this State to see if these 
questions could be answered. Previous 
to that time considerable work had been 
done in California, and some very definite 
results obtained. These have recently 
been published in Bulletin 123, Bureau 
of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, entitled, The Decay of Or¬ 
anges While in Transit from California, 
by G. Harold Powell and several assist¬ 
ants. At the last annual meeting of this 
society held at St. Petersburg, I had the 
pleasure of outlining our experiments in 
Florida and giving the results we had 
secured up to that time. The investiga¬ 
tion has been continued during the past 
season and valuable additional data se¬ 
cured. 

Briefly stated, the losses from decay of 
oranges while in transit from Florida 
amount annually to one-half or three- 
quarter million dollars. The principal 
loss is due to a decay or rot which is pro¬ 
duced by the growth of a mold or fun¬ 
gus within the tissue of the orange. The 
most common fungus is a species of peni- 
cillimn. This trouble cannot be called a 
disease for sound, healthy fruit is not at¬ 
tacked by the fungus and seldom rots. It 
seems to be necessary first to puncture the 
rind of the fruit, or to bruise it in some 
way sufficient to kill the tissue. If now 
the seed of the fungus are present at this 
injured place, the first step toward decay 
has been taken and if the temperature 
and moisture conditions during the fol¬ 
lowing few days are suitable for the de¬ 
velopment of the fungus, the orange is 
sure to rot. On the other hand, large 
quantities of fruit have been held experi¬ 
mentally under weather conditions most 
favorable for the development of decay, 
yet when the fruit has been carefully 


handled and the skin of the orange has 
been uninjured, there has been practically 
no loss, even when the spores or seed of 
the fungus- have been purposely placed 
over the surface of the fruit. 

This belief is not a theory or a labora¬ 
tory scheme. In 1905, experiment work 
conducted in six packing houses in Cali¬ 
fornia, holding the fruit for two weeks 
under the most trying conditions, fre¬ 
quently in a lemon-curing room, so that 
often from 50 to 100 per cent, of the in¬ 
jured fruit decayed, yet the average de¬ 
cay for all the sound uninjured lots was 
only 4.9 per cent. Iu 1906, the experi¬ 
ments were in 15 houses and the average 
decay for the carefully handled fruit was 
1.5 per cent. In 1907, the number of 
houses where work was done was in¬ 
creased to 31 and the average decay for 
sound fruit was 2.Q per cent. In addi¬ 
tion to these experiments, where the 
fruit was held in the packing houses, last 
season 186 cars were shipped from Cal¬ 
ifornia in which there were placed exper¬ 
imental lots of oranges. Under ventila.- 
tion the sound fruit shipped immediately 
arrived in New York City with 1.4 per 
cent decay; under ice with 1.1 per cent, 
decay. 

While these figures are for California 
oranges, yet we are finding that the same 
principles hold true in Florida. A11 or¬ 
ange without a cut or scratch on the skin 
and which has not been bruised in pick¬ 
ing and packing, almost invariably keeps. 
Last season the carefully handled fruit 
held packed here in the Florida houses 
for two weeks, contained 2.9 per cent, 
decay. This present season the same lots 
showed 2.1 per cent, waste. This has 
been the first season for any shipping ex¬ 
periments from this State and the results 
show the very encouraging average of 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


71 


only 0.4 per cent, rot on arrival at mar¬ 
ket for carefully handled sound fruit. 

The work has now been carried far 
enough so that it seems safe to say that 
the Florida orange inherently is a good 
keeper. We can go even farther than 
this and say that it has been possible to 
pick, pack and ship the fruit in a way 
that has practically insured its safe ar¬ 
rival on the market. Judging from the 
past season’s shipping experiments, it 
seems safe to say that any large percent¬ 
age of decay in transit is not necessary. 

The question then does not seem to be, 
“Is it possible for the Florida Orange to 
carry to market?” but rather “Is it prac¬ 
ticable to handle the crop in such a way 
that the carrying quality has not been in¬ 
jured?” The first question seems to be 
well solved in our investigations and we 
have now turned our attention to the 
practicability of careful handling. 

THE HANDLING IN THE ORCHARD. 

Before there can be good carrying 
quality, there must be careful work in 
harvesting the fruit. Under the present 
conditions, a premium is placed on the 
amount of work done, rather than on the 
quality. In handling a tender perishable 
product, it is false economy to reduce the 
cost of an operation at the expense of the 
keeping quality. A laborer picking 75 
boxes of oranges per day at five cents a 
box and injuring a quarter or more of it, 
and dropping the oranges several feet 
into his picking bag or box, is far more 
expensive than the one who 1 picks 30 
boxes for $3.00 a day, but who does his 
work carefully. 

There are three points that need care¬ 
ful attention by the picker. (1) the 
oranges should not be cut or punctured 
by the clippers, (2) the stems should be 


cut short, (3) the fruit should be put in 
its place by hand and not thrown or 
dropped. 

CLIPPER CUTTING. 

The smooth round Florida orange can 
be cut from the tree with a short stem 
without injuring the fruit with the clip¬ 
pers more easily than can the California 
navel, which has a depression around the 
stem. Notwithstanding this, considerable 
damage is being done by clipper cutting. 
The amount of injury varies widely in 
different picking gangs.

Chart I shows the work of the in¬ 
dividual pickers in one gang in Florida. 
Of the nine pickers, not more than one 
or two were doing satisfactory work. 
The average for the nine was over 12 per 
cent, cut fruit. Not all of these injured 
oranges would decay under ordinary 
shipping conditions. With conditions fa¬ 
vorable for rot, however, a large percent- 
age would go down. As a matter of 
fact, several boxes of the fruit picked by 
the two men showing the high percent¬ 
ages of clipper cuts, after being packed 
fourteen days, contained 21 per cent, 
waste, and the beginning of the decay 
could almost invariably be traced to the 
injury made by the clippers. Another 
lot of fruit selected from the more care¬ 
ful pickers and packed and held the same 
length of time and under the same con¬ 
ditions had 3 per cent, decay. 

The clipper cutting indicated in Chart 
l iS above the average for Florida. In 


72 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


one small district counts were made at 
one time in four different orchards, with 
the following percentages of clipper cuts. 
1.4 per cent., 1.6 per cent., 3.8 per cent., 
and 10.4 per cent. It is rather sugges¬ 
tive that of these, the first gang was 
paid by the day, while the last one was 
on box work. In another orchard two 
men were working together. Two boxes 
of fruit from each were examined. The 
first picker had cut but four oranges, 
while his companion had literally slaugh¬ 
tered 65. 

In another place, the average injury 
done on a ranch, where the owner had 
everything under his direct control was 
slightly over 6 per cent. At a nearby 
packing house where the owner pur¬ 
chased all his fruit and had his picking 
done under the supervision of a fore¬ 
man, the total injury found at one in¬ 
spection was only 1.6 per cent. The dif¬ 
ference lay in that on the first place the 
pickers worked largely by themselves, 
without proper instruction and inspection. 
The second foreman had been trained by 
us to watch for injury and had person¬ 
ally instructed each picker and inspected 
his work, until almost uniformly good 
work was done. 

INJURIES OTHER THAN' THOSE MADE BY 

CLIPPERS. 

It is not necessary that the injury be 
made with the clippers in order to cause 
the fruit to decay. Any other abrasion 
through which the seed of the fungus 
can enter the fruit does the same dam¬ 
age. Frequently there are found or¬ 
anges in the box that have been thorn 
punctured, scratched on the branches of 
the tree, cut by nails or splinters in the 
box, or injured by the finger nails. Many 
of these are made through carelessness 


and haste on the part of the picker and 
therefore vary with individual pickers. 
The amount of thorn puncturing done 
while the fruit is still on the tree is sur¬ 
prisingly small or at least the decay 
which results from such puncturing is 
small. After a heavy wind decaying or¬ 
anges may frequently be seen hanging on 
the trees. If the fruit is picked soon after 
such a storm, some punctured oranges 
are found. But more damage is done 
by “thorning” as the pickers pull the 
fruit from among the branches. In the 
gang referred to a short time ago as hav¬ 
ing a careful foreman 3 per cent, of the 
fruit had body bruises. In the different 
boxes there were all the way from 2 to 
8 injured oranges. The fruit from four 
other pickers in another locality showed 
the following high percentages of body 
injuries. 7.6 per cent., 15 per cent., 22.4 
per cent., and 23.6 per cent. Add to 
these injuries two or three oranges per 
box cut by the finger nails, and another 
two or three and frequently more bruised 
by nails or splinters in the box. A large 
amount of damage is possible therefore, 
before the fruit has left the grove on its 
journey to the market. 

LONG STEMS. 

Considerable emphasis in the past has 
been placed by orchard men on having 
the fruit cut with the stems short. It 
has been realized that an orange with a 
long sharp stem was capable of doing 
much damage. The long stem in itself 
causes no trouble; it is only when the 
stem has been brought into contact with 
another fruit and the rind punctured that 
damage is done. The amount of injury, 
therefore, depends largely on the extent 
and the nature of the handling of the 
fruit after picking. More puncturing is 
done if the fruit is dropped 18 inches or

73 


two feet into the picking bag and then 
for an equal distance into the box, than 
would be if it were possible to lay the or¬ 
anges carefully into the bag and box. 
A long haul over a rough road with a 
considerable number of oranges with long 
stems in boxes will do plenty of damage. 
It is not necessary to have much shaking 
of the fruit in the box in order to do 
puncturing, for the field crate used almost 
universally in Florida is so large that the 
weight of the fruit in the box is sufficient 
to force a sharp stem through the peel¬ 
ing of an adjacent orange near the bot¬ 
tom of the crate. 

The number of long stems left by dif¬ 
ferent pickers varies largely. Some pick¬ 
ers work steadily without leaving scarcely 
a long stem. Others cut practically all 
the stems too long. The following fig¬ 
ures show the percentages left by differ¬ 
ent individuals. 5.9 per cent., 14 per cent., 
18.8 per cent., 8.7 per cent., 15 per 
cent., 7 per cent., 14.1 per cent., 0.7 per 

cent., and none. The following are av¬ 
erages for gangs: 2.9 per cent., 2.3 per 

cent., 16.1 per cent., 1 per cent., 9.7 per 

cent. 

As in the case with the clipper cutting, 
when the attention of the picker is called 
to the number of long stems he is leaving 
and when he knows his fruit is being 
inspected the number cut incorrectly gen¬ 
erally decreases 

CAREFUL HANDLING. 

The third point in connection with 
good picking has to do with careful 
handling. There is nothing in connec¬ 
tion with the citrus business of Florida 
that impresses a person accustomed to 
handling different fruits than the rough¬ 
ness with which the oranges are treated. 
To see the fruit dropped several feet into 


the picking bag or basket as the laborer 
holds the branches with his left hand and 
clips the fruit with his right, starting it 
toward the mouth of the basket at a lively 
speed with his clipper, one would think 
an imperishable product was being 
handled instead of a very delicate living 
fruit. When the picking basket is full, 
the fruit takes another severe fall into 
the field crate, and the usual method of 
locating the gang in the orchard is to lis¬ 
ten a moment for the rattle of the or¬ 
anges in the box. I need not call your at¬ 
tention to all the places in harvesting and 
packing the crop where rough handling is 
practiced. If anyone doubts the state¬ 
ment that a large percentage of the fruit 
falls somewhere at least 18 or 20 inches, 
a trip with this in mind through his own 
grove and packing house will probably 
satisfy him about the matter. At least 
such a trip through his neighbor’s grove 
will convince him. On his journey let 
him stop for a moment at the side of the 
hopper, one of those real large ones, 
holding fifty boxes or more, and watch 
the results. Let him place his hand on 
one of the fruit, and allow the other or¬ 
anges to hit against it. Just then have 
him forget that he is watching oranges 
and imagine that they are apples or per¬ 
haps Georgia peaches. I wonder how 
successful a shipper of such fruits would 
be if the handling was as rough as that 
to which the oranges are subjected. Yet 
the experiments last year indicated that 
with oranges dropped once 18 inches one 
out of every five would rot within a 
short time. This year the skin of the 
fruit seemed rather thicker and tougher 
and but ten per cent, rotted. But in test 
after test where the oranges were 
dropped 18 inches decay developed where 
it did not where the fruit was carefully

handled. Charts II and III show the 
amount of decay in two individual ex¬ 
periments made this past season, where 
the fruit was held packed in the houses.

The sound carefully handled lots were 
picked under our personal supervision 
and the fruit was not dropped in any 
way. It was drawn to the packing houses 
usually on spring wagons, and packed 
without any machine handling. The 
dropped fruit was handled in identically 
the same manner, except that just before 
packing each orange was dropped sep¬ 
arately 18 inches on to the floor of the 
packing house or into the empty field 
crate. The series indicated by the words 
“through machinery” were handled in 
the grove as the carefully handled lots, 
but before packing the oranges were 
poured into the empty hoppers and were 
then graded and sized in the usual man¬ 
ner, and generally by the labor in the 
packing house. In all cases, the hoppers 
and bins were empty so the maximum 
amount of injury from the machinery 
was obtained. For this reason it was not 
uncommon for our experiments to show 
greater decay in the fruit carefully picked 
but run through the empty machinery 
than we secured in the regular commer¬ 
cial pack which had been picked and 
packed without any attention on our 


part. The boxes that made up the “Com¬ 
mercial Pack” were selected after they 
had been packed and were taken from the 
fruit coming from the same orchard in 
which we had obtained the other experi¬ 
ment boxes. The “Mechanically In¬ 
jured” lots were those in which each 
orange showed some abrasion. Clipper 
cuts, box injuries, finger nail scratches 
and stem punctures were the most com¬ 
mon. 

Chart IV gives the summary of the 
decay for all of the experiments that were 
made this past season, with the fruit 
held two weeks in the packing houses.

MARKET STORAGE TESTS. 

Aside from the experiments, where the 
fruit has been held in the packing house, 
about fifteen shipping experiments have 
been made. These lots have gone by ex¬ 
press, freight, and water and have been 
shipped to Washington. The average 
length of time in transit has been about 
7 days. Upon arrival the fruit was ex¬ 
amined and the percentage of decay 
noted. The fruit was then repacked and 
held in a common storage room and re¬ 
examined at the end of one week and 
again at the end of two weeks. At that 
time most of the lots were discarded, yet 
some boxes of carefully handled fruit 
were held for some time longer. 

The results of these shipments showed 
that all the lots except the injured fruit 
arrived at market in a fair condition. 
Chart V gives the data in detail.

The boxes from which the injured 
fruit has been removed, although the or¬ 
anges may have been dropped just pre¬ 
vious to packing arrived in reasonably 
good condition. The trip was sufficiently 
short so that the bruised fruit apparently 
did not have time to decay and it reached 
the destination with but a slight amount 
of loss in excess of the carefuHy handled 
boxes. The commercial pack having 
some injured oranges showed more 
waste, yet not arriving in a bad condition. 
The injured boxes averaged 20 per cent, 
rotten. 

At the end of the first week the decay in 
the carefully handled lots has but slightly 
increased while that of the bruised fruit 
jumps up to over 5 or 6 per cent. The 
commercial pack has reached the high 
figure of over 10 per cent. The injured 
fruit shows 38 per cent loss. At the end 
of the second week the carefully handled 
series remain still practically sound. All 
other lots show heavy losses. The com¬ 
mercial pack at that time had nearly one- 
fifth waste while over one-half of the in¬ 
jured fruit has decayed. 

Among the results shown by this chart 
there is a confirmation of the belief held 
by the fruit trade in general that it is not 
a safe thing to handle Florida oranges 
for even if there is but little decay on 
arrival, the fruit will not hold sufficiently 
long for the retailer to sell his stock. 


There is probably no other one thing 
that has more to do with low prices or 
small demand for Florida fruit at any 
time than this. The quality of the fruit 
is such, and the texture and general ap¬ 
pearance so good, that there should be 
a healthy demand for your fruit through¬ 
out the season. But as long as the buyer 
must figure on losing perhaps one-quar¬ 
ter or even one-half of a box by decay, 
if it is necessary for him to hold it some 
days, he cannot afford to handle such 
fruit if there is on the market a brand 
which he is sure will hold an equally long 
time with but a slight amount of waste. 
The sound, carefully handled lots shipped 
this season answer all his requirements. 
Is it possible then, to handle your fruit 
in any better way than is being done at 
present? Chart VI gives the results of 
some educational work done among the 
pickers.

The first half of the chart gives the 
percentages of clipper-cuts in one gang at 
four different inspections, the first two 
at the time our Department representa¬ 
tive began his work. The last inspec¬ 
tions show what successful results he 
obtained. Within a month the average 
amount of clipper cutting was reduced 
to 1 per cent., a very fine record. The 
last part of the chart gives results on 
the total injuries made in the picking and 
in addition the number of long stems 
left. On the fourth and sixth of Decem¬ 
ber the average was 20 per cent; three

weeks later the total was reduced to 4 
per cent. This large reduction was made 
by a little quiet educational work by 
showing the different pickers where they 
were doing bad work, and by telling them 
of the damage this kind of work was do¬ 
ing. This particular lot of pickers was 
on day pay, so it was easier to work with 
them than it was with pickers paid by the 
box. Notwithstanding the better work 
clone, the quantity picked remained about 
the same and was perfectly satisfactory 
to the owners. This was in a community 
where I had been told less than a year be¬ 
fore that it was entirely out of the ques¬ 
tion to pay by the day. Decided improve¬ 
ment may be made, however, with men 
working by the box. One crowd under 
a good foreman after some help by us 
was averaging only about 2 per cent, in¬ 
jury at several inspections. 

Those who think it is impossible to 
handle the fruit with care should visit a 
large peach ranch in Georgia, where un¬ 
der one general foreman and with col¬ 
ored help, ten cars and more of peaches 
are shipped in one day, and the fruit is 
so delicate that a heavy pressure by the 
finger in picking damages the carrying 
quality. 

The outlook, then, is hopeful. Decay 
—at least damaging decay—is not neces¬ 
sary. Fruit, sound and carefully han¬ 
dled has been held in the packing houses 
two weeks with but slight decay. Other 
lots have been shipped and arrived on 
the market with almost no loss and have 
stood the market holding test remarka¬ 
bly well. On the other hand roughly 
handled and injured fruit should not be 
expected to keep, and it does not. The 
methods of harvesting and packing at 
present in operation are extremely rough 
and should be expected to produce a poor¬ 


carrying product. Experiments show 
that this is true. It is not impracticable 
on the other hand to change these meth¬ 
ods sufficiently so that a great improve¬ 
ment in keeping quality may be expected. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Skinner—I note in your paper 
you speak of the oranges going 
through machinery. To what do you 
refer? 

Mr. Tenny—All the machinery 
found in the average packing house: 
the hopper, the elevator (if there is 
one), the sizer and into the bins. 

Mr. McClung—How long after the 
fruit was picked before the dropping 
of it was done? 

Mr. Tenny—We tried it at various 
times. As a usual thing, within 
twenty-four hours; almost certainly 
within thirty-six hours after picking. 

Mr. McClung—And you found the 
same results after the fruit was wilted 
a little as when perfectly fresh? 

Mr. Tenny—Very much the same. 
The majority of the dropping that 
causes damage in the commercial 
handling is done at the time of pick¬ 
ing, hence most of our experiments 
were made with fruit that was drop¬ 
ped immediately after picking. 

Mr. Warner—I think it would be a 
good thing for Mr. Tenny to give us 
a lecture next year on the methods of 
packing and shipping oranges from 
California, using the stereopticon 
slides so that we can see for ourselves. 
I make a motion to that effect; that 
is, that Mr. Tenny give us an illus¬ 
trated lecture at our meeting next 
year showing just how these matters 
are handled by our California brethren. 

Motion seconded, put and carried. 








Controlling the White Fly by its Natural 
Enemies— Report of Progress, and 
Other Observations. 


By E. W. Berger, 

(Entomologist, Florida Agricultural Experiment Station.) 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The mills of the investigator grind 
slowly. Whoever makes a business of 
investigating nature (coaxing as best he 
can her secrets from her) is treading un¬ 
known ground, or ground in regard to 
which he has only suggestive evidence, 
or no evidence at all, as to what he may 
find. Then also, a great part of his work 
generally consists in developing new 
methods as he progresses, although he 
may be guided by certain general princi¬ 
ples. And then, at the best, his results 
are generally obtained point by point, 
and after long waiting. Thus it is with 
the whitefly investigations. This matter 
has been investigated before. Riley and 
Howard write : 1 “Our first acquaintance 
with the species was in June, 1878, when 
we found it occurring in profuse abun¬ 
dance on the leaves of the citrus trees in 
the orangery of this department. Some 
observations were made upon its life-his¬ 
tory during that summer, and all of its 
stages were observed. During the fol¬ 
lowing years we observed it in Florida, 
and it was studied by two of our agents, 

1. Insect Life, Volume V, No. 4, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture. 1893. 


Mr. H. G. Hubbard at Crescent City, and 
the late Jos. Voyle at Gainesville.” It 
was first referred to by its present scien¬ 
tific name (Aleyrodes citri ) by Mr. Ash- 
mead 2 in 1885. In 1893 Prof. H. A. 
Morgan 3 published a brief report of his 
observations upon this insect in Louis¬ 
iana. He states that orange growers be¬ 
lieve that it was brought into Louisiana 
on plants exhibited at the New Orleans 
Exposition in 1885. Later on Dr. H. J. 
Webber studied the pest in Florida, pub¬ 
lishing his bulletin on the Sooty Mold of 
the Orange in 1897. Next came A. L. 
Quaintance and H. A. Gossard. Finally 
Dr. A. W. Morrill and E. W. Berger are 
risking a lance, and woe unto the white 
fly when they have finished with it (we 
hope). 

WORK DONE UPON THE WHITEFLY. 

The writer’s investigations upon the 
whitefly have been continued chiefly 
with experiments for introducing the 
fungus parasites; together with some 
other observations and experiments

upon the ability of 'whitefly to survive 
on detached and partly dried leaves; the 
varieties or species of whitefly represented 
in the State which attack citrus seriously, 
the amount of honeydew excreted, and 
a few other points. 

METHODS OF INTRODUCING THE FUNGUS 

PARASITES. 

It has been repeatedly demonstrated 
that the red and yellow Aschersonias can 
be successfully introduced by spraying 
their spores (germs) suspended in water 
on to the under surface of white fly-in¬ 
fested leaves, or by pinning leaves hav¬ 
ing these fungi upon them to the under 
surface of the leaves of white fly-infested 
trees. Both methods are also applicable 
to the cinnamon and whitefringe fungi. 

The spraying method is probably not 
generally applicable for introducing the 
brown fungus, and pinning fungus-bear¬ 
ing leaves is therefore recommended. 
This fungus has, however, been several 
times successfully started by spraying a 
mixture of water and fungus, obtained 
by agitating fungus-bearing leaves with 
water. A better way would be to scour 
the fungus from the leaves with a little 
sand and water. Use one to several 
leaves to a quart of water and strain the 
liquid if necessary. 

EX PEI M ENTS FOR INTRODUCING THE 

FUNGUS PARASITES OF WHITEFLY 
LARVAE. 

Actual experiments and observations 
in the field have again demonstrated that 
the period of summer rains is a most fa¬ 
vorable time in which to introduce the 
several fungus parasites of whitefly lar¬ 
vae. Introductions of the red and yel¬ 
low fungi made during October and No¬ 


vember were successful only to the extent 
of getting a small start of fungus, but 
were sufficient to insure a good spread of 
the same during the following summer. 
Thus, sprayings with spores of the red 
fungus in the R. S. Sheldon Grove at 
New Smyrna, on October 3, 1906, de¬ 
veloped but a few pustules of the red by 
the first of December of the same year, 
and no more by the first week of May, 
1907. The fungus spread, however, dur¬ 
ing the summer of 1907, so that by the 
fall of that year the trees sprayed had 
the foliage of many small branches lit¬ 
erally dotted over with the red pustules, 
besides which the fungus had spread to 
perhaps all of the trees of the grove not 
sprayed with spores. This fungus will, 
no doubt, quite control the “fly” in this 
grove during the coming summer, and 
from there will spread over all the white- 
fly-infested citrus trees of New Smyrna. 
Why sprayings with spores of the red and 
yellow Aschersonias (fungi) made in 
the Ronnock groves at New Smyrna, at 
the same time (October 3, 1906), failed 
to produce a start of fungus can only 
be surmised; it may have been due to 
a more arid condition in these groves 
at that time, but more probably to poi¬ 
soning of the spores by the use of an old 
spraying outfit previously used for sprav- 
ing Bordeaux mixture. There being 
much less “fly” in these groves, of course, 
also lessened the chances of getting a 
start. 

Sprayings with fungus spores made in 
the F. W. Edison grove at New Smyrna, 
on November 29, 1907, have given a 
promising start of red Ascheronia [trees 
examined April 23, 1908] ; but other 
trees sprayed with spores at the same time 
in New Smyrna (some in the Ronnoc 
groves) show but a very poor start of

either the red or yellow Aschersonia after 
a period of five months (November 29, 
1907, to April 23, 1908). Again, spore¬ 
spraying operations in some trees of Mr. 
B. F. Hampton’s grove near Gainesville, 
made on October 6 and November 16, 
1907, resulted in promising starts of 
both the red and yellow Aschersonias. 

Spores of the red and yellow Ascher¬ 
sonias, together with some brown fun¬ 
gus material, scoured from the leaves 
with a little sand and water, were 
sprayed into some citrus trees at DeLand 
on January 17, 1908. Examination of 
the trees on April 20, 1908, revealed no 
certain growths of fungus. Introduc¬ 
tions of the red Aschersonia made into 
thirteen trees on April 21 and 22, 1908, 
at the same place, by the spore-spraying 
method have produced an excellent 
growth of this fungus [trees examined 
June 17, 1908 and paper revised to this 
date]. In two trees, Mr. H. B. Stevens 
and the writer estimated that from 30 
to 40 per cent, of the white fly larvae 
had become infected by the fungus and 
were dead. In two other trees the writer 
estimates [estimate was based on actual 
counts made upon leaves] that at least 
50 per cent, were dead. Fungus intro¬ 
duced into two other trees by the leaf- 
pinning method resulted in only very 
poor growths of fungus; the growths of 
fungus produced by the spore-spraying 
method are estimated at from several 
hundred to perhaps a thousand times as 
great as those produced by the leaf-pin¬ 
ning method in the two trees referred to. 
At the time of introducing the fungus 
the spring brood of adult “flies” had 
about disappeared and larvae of the first, 
second and third stages were in abun¬ 
dance beneath the leaves. These spray¬ 
ing and leaf-pinning operations at De- 


Land on April 21 and 2-2 are regarded as 
of great significance; because they indi¬ 
cate so clearly that the best time in 
which to introduce the red Aschersonia 
by the spore-spraying method is when 
young larvae are abundant. It appears 
that young larvae are more easily infected 
than the older ones of the fourth stage 
and pupae. The fact that rains immedi¬ 
ately followed or preceded the operations 
may also be of significance; the moisture 
favoring the germination of the spores. 
The comparatively very poor growths of 
fungus produced in the two trees into 
which leaves only had been pinned, are 
believed to indicate that the presence of 
an abundance of adult “flies” is necessary 
in order to obtain good growths of fun¬ 
gus by this method. [See: The Whitefly 
Spreads the Fungi.] What has been 
stated here for the red Aschersonia is 
also believed to hold good for the yellow 
Aschersonia; both are very similar in all 
their characters except color. The same 
principles, with one or two exceptions, 
probably apply to all the fungus parasites 
of the whitefly larvae. 

The experiments enumerated demon¬ 
strate quite clearly that the red and yel¬ 
low Aschersonias can be introduced in 
whitefly-infested trees during the fall 
months with fairly good success by the 
spore-spraying method, but leave us in 
doubt if we may ever be able to success¬ 
fully introduce them during the winter 
and early spring months. Some other 
sprayings made at Gainesville with the 
red and yellow Aschersonias and the 
brown fungus during January and 
March indicate more clearly, however, 
that this may be impossible since not a 
single growth of fungus has so far re¬ 
sulted from any of these sprayings. The 
absence of the easily infected young lar-

vae at this time is believed to be the ex¬ 
planation. If the absence of young lar¬ 
vae is the explanation for the failures 
during January and March, this barren 
period is believed to also include Decem¬ 
ber and February, since in neither one 
of those two months are there any but 
but a few [in December] young larvae. 
In other words, the barren period for 
introducing fungus will extend from De¬ 
cember through March or until the 
young larvae of the spring brood of 
adults become abundant either in lam 
March or in April. If larvae of the 
fourth stage and pupae are practically 
immune to the attacks of fungus as the 
January and March experiments indicate, 
then we may expect another barren period 
of a few weeks immediately preceding 
the appearance of: the second brood of 
adult “flies” sometime in June or some¬ 
times earlier. Preceding the appearance 
of the third brood of adults, there may 
also be a barren period, when the white- 
fly is in the fourth stage and pupae; but 
generally the separation of the second 
and third broods is not so well defined; 
larvae of all stages continuing to exist 
during the interval of the greatest abun¬ 
dance of adults. Some few trees in Mr. 
Wm. E. Heathcote’s grove at St. Peters¬ 
burg were sprayed on May 17, 1907, 
with spores of the red Aschersonia. A 
good growth of this fungus had devel¬ 
oped from this spraying by the end of 
last summer, although in the beginning 
only a few fungus pustules could be 
found. This experiment clearly indicates 
that we can begin operations in May; 
and earlier as the DeLand experiments of 
April 21 and 22 have shown us. Better 
stated, the time to begin to introduce 
fungus in spring is when the young lar¬ 
vae of the spring brood of adult “flies” 


are becoming abundant (that is by the 
dozen) beneath the leaves. 

Operations were begun last spring in 
Mr. Heathcote’s grove for the main pur¬ 
pose of demonstrating what can be done 
in one season with the spore-spraying 
and leaf-pinning methods of introducing 
the fungi. The frost of the previous 
December together with the prevailing 
drought having defoliated so many citrus 
trees in sections where fungus had been 
abundant, that only small quantities of 
fungus could be obtained. However, 
continued efforts on the part of Mr. 
Heathcote, together with some supplies 
of fungus and aid from the writer, re¬ 
sulted in giving a wholesome sprinkling 
of the fungi, especially the red i\scher- 
sonia, together with some yellow Ascher¬ 
sonia and brown fungus, by the end of 
1907. Mr. Heathcote has recently writ¬ 
ten, stating that the fungus does not ap¬ 
pear to be as abundant in his grove this 
spring as it was last winter. This is 
quite what I expected, since it spreads 
but little if at all during the winter, and 
of course what has previously developed 
becomes weathered; besides some leaves 
drop, thus reducing the amount of fun¬ 
gus present in the trees. 

It would be consuming an unnecessary 
amount of time were I to undertake to 
say something about all the experiments 
that I have started in different parts of 
the State. Suffice it to say that I have 
started spore-spraying and leaf-pinning 
operations for introducing fungus in the 
following places: Lake City, Leesburg, 
New Smyrna, Kissimmee, St. Petersburg, 
DeLand and Gainesville, in all seven lo¬ 
calities. Taking a single grove or yard 
in which trees were treated in these sev¬ 
eral localities as the unit and also count¬ 
ing as separate experiments the differ-

ent times at which operations were be¬ 
gun in the same grove or yard, we have 
in all something like forty or fifty exper¬ 
iments made by the writer for introduc¬ 
ing the fungi parasites of the white fly 
during the past two years. 

TWO OTHER FUNGUS PARASITES. 

Since appearing before you a year ago, 
two other fungus parasites of the white- 
fly larvae have been discovered in Flor¬ 
ida. These are described by Professor 
H. S. Fawcett in Press Bulletins 68 and 
76, Florida Agricultural Experiment 
Station, and are the whitefringe fungus 
(Microcera sp.) and the cinnamon fun¬ 
gus ( Verticillium . heterocladum) re¬ 
spectively. The whitefringe fungus has 
been observed mainly at Sutherland, but 
specimens have been sent in from other 
parts of the State; so that it appears to 
be quite widely distributed. The cinna¬ 
mon fungus has hitherto been mistaken 
for the brown fungus, and is probably 
as widely distributed as the latter, though 
not so abundantly. Both of these fungi 
being new discoveries, we are not pre¬ 
pared to make specific recommendations 
as to their efficiency in reducing the 
whitefly or as to the best methods for in¬ 
troducing them. Professor Fawcett, who 
has so far done about all of the work on 
the whitefringe and cinnamon fungi, suc¬ 
ceeded in starting both of these upon 
whitefly larvae by spraying the spores of 
the fungi suspended in water. The cin¬ 


namon fungus has also been started by 
pinning leaves, and this method, no 
doubt is applicable to the whitefringe 
fungus. 

SIX KNOWN' FUNGI PARASITES. 

Following is a list of the six known 
fungus parasites of whitefly larvae given 
in their order of discovery in Florida: 

Red Aschersonia ( Aschersonia aleyro- 
dis Webber) 1893. 

Brown Fungus (spores unknown) 
1896. 

Red-headed Scale Fungus ( Sphacros - 
tilbe coccophila Tul.) 1903 [ ?] 

Y e 11 o w Aschersonia ( Aschersonia 
davo-citrina P. Henn.) 1906. 

Whitefringe Fungus ( Microcera sp.) 
1907. 

Cinnamon Fungus (Verticillium hete¬ 
rocladum Pensig) 1907. 

The red-headed scale fungus has been 
observed upon white fly larvae only a few 
times and cannot be said to be of much 
significance in its relation to this insect. 
It is, however, a most efficient fungus 
parasite of scale insects in nearly every 
part of the State. 

The following table gives the present 
distribution in Florida of the six fungus 
parasites of white fly larvae: R, Red 
Aschersonia; Y, Yellow Aschersonia; B, 
Brown Fungus; W, Whitefringe Fun¬ 
gus; C, Cinnamon Fungus; S, Red¬ 
headed Scale Fungus:

THE WHITEFLY SPREADS THE FUNGI. 

Observations made during the past 
year indicate that the whitefly itself is 
instrumental in distributing the fungi 
after once they have been started in a 
tree or grove. The adults, as they walk 
over the leaves, no doubt get many of 
the fungus spores attached to their feet, 
and as they fly away to other trees de¬ 
posit them upon whitefly larvae; thus un¬ 


knowingly carrying disease with them. 
Other insects, such as ants, and ordinary 
flies and beetles, may also be instrumen¬ 
tal in disseminating the fungi. This 
probably accounts for the fact that pin¬ 
ning fungus-bearing leaves has not re¬ 
sulted in much success in starting the 
fungi during the cool and dry periods 
of the year, or when few or no adult 
whiteflies were about. It is therefore 
advised only to use the leaf-pinning

method for introducing the fungi during 
the period of summer rains or at other 
periods when abundant whiteflies are in 
the trees. Most excellent results have 
been obtained with the red and yellow 
Aschersonias by pinning fungus-bearing 
leaves during June, July and August. 
The spore-spraying method can be used 
at any time, but it will probably be diffi¬ 
cult to start fungus in winter and early 
spring by any method. There are indi¬ 
cations that larvae of the fourth stage 
and pupae (in which two stages the “fly” 
exists from about December until March 
and April) are not readily, if at all, in¬ 
fected with fungus. 

PLAN OF CAMPAIGN. 

The writer’s plan of campaign, based 
upon experiments in the field, is as fol¬ 
lows:—If a grove is thoroughly infested 
with whitefly, and sufficient “seed-fun¬ 
gus” is available, introduce fungus into 
all the trees; but if the supply of seed- 
fungus is limited, distribute it here and 
there throughout the grove, so that there 
will be a great many centers of infection 
from which the fungus can spread. It 
may be considered advisable to treat only 
a few trees in each row with fungus, and 
it may only be possible to treat some 
branches of each of these trees; but any 
scheme of distribution that will give the 
fungi a good chance to spread to all parts 
of a grove will suffice. Later on, when 
more seed-fungus is available, the trees 
or parts of trees not previously treated 
may be attended to. A second, and even 
a third or fourth treatment may be given 
to the trees in order to get the quickest 
possible dissemination of fungus. So 
long as only a few fungus pustules are 
visible on those leaves of a tree which 
bear the most fungus, it will be advisable 
to introduce more fungus, especially 


should an abundance of seed-fungus be 
readily available. The greater the 
amount of fungus growth which is 
successfully started in a grove by 
artificial means, the more rapid will 
be the destruction of the whitefly. White- 
flies have the habit of congregating on 
water-sprouts and other tender growth 
of citrus, consequently we should give 
particular attention to introducing the 
fungi into such parts of the trees. The 
work should be done methodically and 
not in a haphazard way. 

The plan of campaign for a grove just 
becoming infested with whitefly; or only 
infested in part, would be to introduce 
fungus into all those trees sufficiently in¬ 
fested (that is, whitefly by the dozen 
on the leaves), and later on into other 
trees as soon as they become sufficiently 
infested. Incidentally, the trees should 
be fertilized a little more heavily. 

“Seed-fungus” becomes abundant 
about midsummer and lasts until midwin¬ 
ter and later, although some can gener¬ 
ally be obtained somewhere at all times. 
The best weather conditions for intro¬ 
ducing fungus are met with from about 
June to the end of August. Since the 
period of summer rains is also the time 
when “seed-fungus” is abundant it is 
about the best time in which to introduce 
fungus. It is advisable, however, to in¬ 
troduce fungus at other times when “seed- 
fungus” is available, using onffi the spore¬ 
spraying method when young larvae are 
abundant and adults not ^ plentiful 
but employing either one of the 
two methods (spore-spraying or leaf- 
pinning) during the warmer months, or 
when adult “flies” are swarming abun¬ 
dantly about the trees. It will, of course, 
be evident from a perusal of the preced¬ 
ing pages that it would probably be use¬ 
less to try to introduce fungus from 


84

December to April, or until young lar¬ 
vae become abundant immediately follow¬ 
ing the first brood of adults in spring. 

It is best to use fresh fungus, although 
the writer has succeeded (during the 
rainy season) with fungus that had been 
collected and dried for a month

methods for introducing the fungi the 
reader is referred to Bulletin No. 88 and 
Press Bulletins 68, 76, 80, 82, and 88,

Fungus can probably be obtained at 
the following places:—Manatee, Braden- 
town, Palmetto, Sarasota, Fort Myers, 
Buckingham, Orlando, Oviedo, Apopka, 
and Titusville. 

OTHER OBSERVATIONS. 

Whitefly Matures on Dead Leaves .— 
On November 20 and 21, 1907, Mr. R. Y. 
Winters, Assistant in Botany, and the 
writer made a very careful inspection of 
some of the trees at DeLand that had 
been defoliated the previous February, 
but in which the whitefly had reappeared 
during the summer. Careful inspection 
of the vegetation in the neighborhood 
of the infested trees revealed no plants 
infested with whitefly which could have 
acted as carriers during the period of 
defoliation of the citrus. (It does not 
necessarily follow, however, that such 
carriers did not exist.) But whitefly in 
abundance existed in the citrus and Cape 
jasmine that had been defoliated the 
previous February. Where had it come 
from ? The writer finally decided to 
carefully examine the dead leaves accum¬ 
ulated under a certain Cape jasmine, es¬ 
pecially any that had collected in small 
hollows near the trunk. Something like 
several pecks of such leaves were exam¬ 
ined by Mr. Winters and the writer with 
the result that well matured larvae and 


pupae, apparently healthy and alive, 
were found on some leaves that were 
dead and brown, but had either retained 
or been supplied with enough moisture 
to keep them flexible. Finally, the writer 
found an adult specimen about half 
emerged from the pupa case on such a 
leaf. The specimen appeared fresh but 
inactive, and with a little effort was 
freed from its case and found to be un¬ 
doubtedly alive, since it could move its 
legs and feelers. 

In the afternoon Mr. Winters went to 
carefully inspect the fallen leaves of cer¬ 
tain citrus trees, with similar results. 
Seemingly live and healthy pupae were 
found upon dead and dried leaves gen¬ 
erally with enough moisture, however, to 
remain flexible. Some of these leaves 
were taken to the laboratory at the Ex¬ 
periment Station by Mr. Winters, and 
after a few days, live adults were found 
moving about under the bell jar. Two 
days later the writer found apparently 
live specimens of pupae on a few partly 
dried and curled leaves of citrus in an¬ 
other yard at DeLand. On January 17, 
some of the fallen leaves under the Cape 
jasmine above referred to were again ex¬ 
amined, when semi-dried leaves with 
plump, live larvae were found, also a 
pupa on a leaf that was dried and brown. 
It was further observed on the Cape jas¬ 
mine in question, and on two citrus trees 
(all of which had been defoliated in the 
preceding February) that the greater 
number of whitefly larvae were low down 
in the trees (about the lower third) and 
also that the empty pupae cases of pre¬ 
ceding brood were on the lower leaves 
of the trees, possibly indicating that the 
“fly” came up from the ground. 

When at DeLand on January 17 and 
18, 1908, I brought back to Gainesville

several small twigs (with leaves) of the 
Cape jasmine before referred to, and well 
infested with 'whitefly. A portion of 
this material was placed in a small cloth 
sack and slightly buried at the foot of 
a large magnolia tree near the Univer¬ 
sity. The magnolia was chosen because 
no citrus or jasmine was near at hand. 
On March 22 live adults were emerging 
and some of the leaves were still green. 

Another portion of this material was 
placed under a bell jar (with open top 
and covered with cheese-cloth) on sand 
in the greenhouse. Live adults were ob¬ 
tained as before at the end of two months 
and a few of the leaves were still green. 
In both experiments, however, the lar¬ 
vae on the leaves which had turned dark 
or dried, soon died. 

These observations leave no doubt in 
my mind that some whitefly can be car¬ 
ried through the winter on dead, partly 
dried and browned leaves, scattered un¬ 
der trees, especially when so placed that 
they do not dry sufficiently to crumble, 
although some of the leaves examined 
were quite dry. It was not possible to 
know how long these leaves had been in 
the condition in which we found them, 
and whether the larvae there could have 
matured; for when leaves are allowed to 
dry in the laboratory all larvae have been 
observed to die. In regard to the pupae 
there can be no doubt about their matur¬ 
ing, as one adult at least was caught in 
the act of emerging from its case while 
others developed into adults when taken 
to the laboratory, as previously stated. 
It is estimated that the leaves in question 
had fallen from the trees two weeks to 
two months previously, but they may 
have been older. The experiments with 
the fresh green jasmine leaves indicate 
furthermore, that it is possible for such 


leaves to become buried in the sand or 
otherwise protected, so that they remain 
green for at least two months, allowing 
whitefly larvae to mature upon them 
in time to infest the early new growth 
of the trees. 

Extermination by Defoliation .—The 
previous observations and experiments 
indicate pretty clearly why the attempts 
at exterminating the white fly at DeLand 
in February, 1907, by defoliating the 
trees have failed, notwithstanding that 
precautions were taken to burn all the 
leaves. Some of the trees had been 
banked with earth, and as the “fly’ 1 ap¬ 
peared in greatest abundance in these 
trees after the defoliation, this again in¬ 
dicates the possible source of the re-in¬ 
festation, since these banks of earth about 
the stems of the trees would be ideal 
places for preserving leaves, as the pre¬ 
viously stated experiments show. That 
the defoliation of all the trees at De- 
Land at the time referred to was never¬ 
theless useful can hardly be doubted, 
since it must have been at least equiva¬ 
lent to a season’s spraying or fumiga¬ 
tion in keeping the “fly” in check. The de¬ 
foliation was completed after the partial 
defoliation by the December freeze of 
1906, so that the burden of it was much 
less. I believe that defoliating whitefly- 
infested trees after a partial defoliation 
by a freeze may frequently be advisable, 
but doubt if the wholesale butchery of 
the trees at Marysville, California, of 
last year was advisable, and doubt, fur¬ 
thermore, if they will be successful in 
exterminating the white fly there unless 
they keep up the extreme vigilance now 
exercised for at least five or six years. 
No doubt the growers at Marysville, Cal¬ 
ifornia, would have done better to have 
checked the “fly” as best they could dur- 




86

ing last summer by spraying or fumigat¬ 
ing 1 and then in winter have undertaken 
to exterminate it by fumigation in the 
citrus trees, and by destroying all of its 
other food plants possible. The injury in 
winter caused by even large overdoses 
of hydrocyanic acid gas would have been 
trivial in comparison to the injury done 
to the trees by cutting off their large 
limbs in order to get rid of the leaves. 

Honey dew Excreted .—Leaves with an 
abundance of whitefly larvae were 
placed between glass plates, and it was 
found that the honeydew ejected by the 
insects was deposited in small drops on 
the glass above or below them, in some 
instances the liquid being precipitated up¬ 
ward a distance of 1-8 inch or more. Pu¬ 
pae ready to have the adult emerge se¬ 
crete honeydew as well as larvae of all 
stages. A lot of larvae of perhaps the 
third and fourth stages of growth ex¬ 
creted at the rate of .0005 gram each in 48 
hours. At this rate 1,000,000 larvae (in 
round numbers) could excrete one pound 
of honeydew in 48 hours, which would be 
at the rate of 15 pounds per month or 
180 pounds per year. Since no doubt a 
large percentage of this sweet excretion 
is sugar (let us assume 50 per cent., 
since we have not had an opportunity 
to test it or have it tested), at this rate 
100 trees of good size on an acre of 
ground would lose something like 50 
barrels of sugar per year, allowing 1,- 
000,000 whitefly larvae to a tree. These 
50 barrels are the equivalent of 10,000 
pounds, or 5 tons; at 5 cents per pound, 
this would amount to $500.00. Of 
course, this is not the actual loss per 
acre, since carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, 
the components of sugar, come from 
the air; but it does represent an unneces¬ 
sary amount of work that the trees are 


required to do, granting that they bear 
a full crop besides, which they probably 
never do. This great amount of loss of 
sugar and water, however, does account 
for the insipid and dry fruit of whitefly- 
infested trees, and suggests the necessity 
of giving the trees an extra allowance 
of fertilizer and, of course, sufficient wa¬ 
ter. 

Two Species .—Are there two species 
of white fly seriously affecting the citrus 
trees in Florida? The writer has several 
times observed that the eggs of the white¬ 
fly in certain localities in Florida had a 
different appearance from those in other 
localities. Last fall and winter, while 
Prof. H. S. Fawcett and Mr. R. Y. Win¬ 
ters were doing some work with the mi¬ 
croscope under the writer’s direction on 
the whitefly larvae and eggs, our atten¬ 
tion became further directed to a peculiar 
delicate net-like covering to certain eggs. 
After examining material from different 
localities, I found that only whitefly 
eggs from certain localities had this cov¬ 
ering, eggs from other localities being 
perfectly smooth and shiny. A like ex¬ 
amination of eggs of this spring’s brood 
from the same localities revealed the 
same differences, together with decided 
differences in the external structure of 
the larvae of the first stage. At the 
time of writing this no literature on the 
whitefly has been found which takes 
note of differences such as have just been 
stated. 

It is true that Professor H. A. Morgan 
in his bulletin (previously cited) figures 
the reticulated type of egg for the white¬ 
fly in Louisiana in 1893, and in his de¬ 
scription of the egg mentions “a film-like 
covering arranged in hexagons—;” but 
it is evident that he was not aware of the 
existence of two types of eggs represent-

ing two species of whitefiy seriously 
affecting citrus. Professor Morgan gives 
the name of the whitefiy observed by 
him in Louisiana (bulletin cited) as Aley- 
rodes citrifolii giving for his authority 
Riley (unpublished manuscript). This 
is presumably the manuscript which was 
later published in Insect Life (previously 
cited), the name of the insect in the 
meantime being changed to Aleyrodes 
citri. The description in the article in 
Insect Life clearly refers to the species 
with smooth eggs, since it is expressly 
stated that the eggs are perfectly smooth, 
although sometimes pruinose, while the 
description of the larvae of the first stage 
also agrees with the character of the lar¬ 
vae which hatch from the smooth eggs, 
and not with those hatched from the 
reticulated eggs. At first it was thought 
that either Aleyrodes aurantii Masked, A. 
Marlatti Quaintance, or A. spinifera 
Quaintance, reported on citrus from the 
N. W. Himalaya Mountains, Japan, and 
Java, respectively, might be the species 
in question. However, a careful compar¬ 
ison with the descriptions of these species 
has ruled them out, as well as many 
other species. The writer is therefore 
quite satisfied that the citrus whitefiy of 
Florida with the reticulated egg is a new 
species, distinct from the citrus whitefiy 
of Florida with the smooth egg ( Aley¬ 
rodes citri ) ; the differences in the eggs 
alone are considered sufficient to make 
the distinction. Careful comparisons 
have also revealed distinct differences be¬ 
tween the pupae and perhaps also be¬ 
tween the adults of the two species as 
well as between their eggs and newly- 
hatched larvae. 

What is the significance of this dis¬ 
covery? The species with the reticulated 
egg is found at Clearwater, Largo and 
Sutherland on the West Coast, and at 


Mims, Titusville and Geneva on the East 
Coast. It also occurs at Orlando and 
probably in other localities. The species 
with smooth eggs is at present known to 
occur at St. Petersburg, Largo, DeLand, 
New Smyrna, Gainesville, Manatee 
County, Apopka, Chipley, Leesburg, Bay 
Ridge, Daytona, Jacksonville and other 
places. One conclusion immediately fol¬ 
lows : that there have been at least two 
separate introductions of the whitefiy 
into Florida; assuming, which is proba¬ 
ble, that the whitefiy of Florida is not 
a native here. It indicates, also, that the 
whitefiy in the upper part of the Sub¬ 
peninsula is not altogether an introduc¬ 
tion from St. Petersburg as is generally 
believed, but has had its origin in part 
elsewhere, probably over at Safety Har¬ 
bor. Whence came the “fly” at Safety 
Harbor cannot at present be told, but it 
is believed to have infested citrus trees 
there for many years. On the other 
hand, the whitefiy at St. Petersburg, in 
all probability, has been brought from the 
Manatee Country. Further research may 
determine many important points of dif¬ 
ference in the life history, effectiveness 
of the fungus and other parasites, spray¬ 
ing or fumigation in the control of each 
species. 

[This paper was followed by a dem¬ 
onstration with stereopticon views illus¬ 
trating the eggs and first stage larvae of 
the two species of wMiite fly discussed, to¬ 
g-ether with views of the fungus, para¬ 
sites, lacewinged flies, and excretion of 
honeydew. ] 


DISCUSSION. 

Dr. Inman—I would like to ask how 
U'-h dama^e w e are likely to do this 
fungus by spraying with insecticides. 
Dr. Berger—That would depend 



88 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


upon the nature of the insecticide. 
Kerosene and soap solution would do 
very little injury unless you keep the 
trees sprayed all the time. Of course, 
very caustic insecticides and those con¬ 
taining fungicides may do very much 
harm. 

Dr. Inman—Thrip juice, which is a 
solution of arsenic—what about that? 

Dr. Berger—I do not know the in¬ 
gredients of thrip juice. I cannot an¬ 
swer definitely whether the arsenic 
will do harm or not, but probably not. 
I have never seen arsenic recom¬ 
mended as a fungicide. 

Mr. Mote—How about the sulphur 
solution ? 

Dr. Berger—It may be very injuri¬ 
ous to fungi if used too frequently. Of 
course, one spraying or dusting of the 
trees with sulphur will do very little 
damage, especially if the spraying is 
not too thorough and applied only to 
the parts of a tree affected. The Rex 
lime and sulphur solution is now re¬ 
commended and sold as fungicide. 

Mr.-How about the resin wash? 

Dr. Berger—I imagine it would be 
injurious, because it is generally quite 
caustic, but one or two sprayings in 
winter will probably do little harm to 
the fungi. 

Mr. Henderson—Do you know any¬ 
thing about the Gold Dust solution? 

Dr. Berger—If Gold Dust is nothing 
but powdered soap, as I believe it is, 
it will do very little, if any, injury to 
the fungi. 

Mr. Henderson—I also wish to say 
that I visited thirty or forty orchards 
in the state and in every one, but one, 
there was scale, somewhere. I intro¬ 
duced the fungus into all the orchards 
and so far as I know, the scale is dead 


in all of them. My experience has 
shown that the fungi is not only the 
cheapest but the best remedy for San 
Jose scale and orange scale. I believe 
that the black fungus is really more 
effective and stands more hardship 
and spreads more rapidly than the red. 
The application is very simple. You 
just tie a small piece of wood contain¬ 
ing' the fungi to about every tenth 
tree, and your work is done. It is 
much less trouble and expense to get 
the fungi and apply it than it is to 
spray one time. One man can go over 
about twenty acres in a day. 

Prof. Rolfs—I might say, in open¬ 
ing this discussion, that to use the 
fungi requires courage and intelli¬ 
gence. I know the results of Mr. 
Henderson’s experience must be espe¬ 
cially gratifying to Mr. Hart, since he 
has been harping on that for fifteen 
years. It must be gratifying to him 
to see that, a large number of citrus 
growers are coming around to see that 
the fungi are of invaluable assistance 
to them. 

Mr. Warner—I would like to ask 
whether it is better to combat the rust 
mite with a spray or dust. 

Mr. Skinner—The liquid spray just 
hits the outside of the tree, but the 
dust goes into the whole tree, and I 
think it is more effective. Besides, 
liquid spray is so unpleasant to use 
that ordinary labor will shirk their 
work to get through quicker. The 
lime is hard on their hands and faces 
and gets into their eyes and they don’t 
like to use it. 

Mr. Stevens—If you use the dust 
spray, try sulphur and no lime. It does 
not increase the scale at all. The liquid 
spray, in my judgment, injures the 











FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


89 


fungi working on the spray, while the 
dust does not. 

Mr. Painter—A good many com¬ 
plaints Jjave come in the same as Mr. 
Skinner’s, and one man told me he 
overcame that by giving his men olive 
oil with which to rub their faces and 
hands. 

Mr. Longley—I don’t think the sul¬ 
phur solution brings scale. I spray 
with a sulphur solution and have been 
for a number of years, and in my case 
it killed the scale. I never have a 
scale even on the grapefruit, and we 


all know that it is a great breeder of 
scale. 

Prof. Rolfs—I will say in connection 
with this subject that the lime in the 
dry spray is not necessary for it to be 
efficacious. It is pretty apt to kill the 
fungi and let the scale come out. 

Mr. Longley—In order to keep the 
scale down and the rust mite down, I 
have found that unless you spray thor¬ 
oughly you had better not spray at all. 
Consequently, it is necessary almost 
always to personally supervise it or do 
it yourself. 


THE WHITE FLY INVESTIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES 

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 


By Dr. A. W. Morrill. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I spoke to you last year on the subject 
of fumigation for the White Fly, describ¬ 
ing the methods of procedure and dis¬ 
cussing in a general way the results ob¬ 
tained up to that time. As most of you 
know, the present investigations of the 
Department of Agriculture have for their 
object a thoro study of all phases of the 
White Fly problem. Such work naturally 
divides itself into: first, studies of life 
history and habits; second, control by 
natural enemies, including parasitic in¬ 
sects and fungi, third, control by spraying 
or fumigation; fourth, studies of miscel¬ 
laneous factors in their relation to White 
Fly damage and control. 

The early history of the White Fly is 
rather obscure and its origin not 


positively known. The evidence at hand, 
however, seems to show the pest to have 
been an imported rather than a native 
species and much support has been given 
to this theory by its recent discovery in 
China. The first investigation of Citrus 
pests in Florida was by H. G. Hubbard, 
who was doubtless known to many of the 
present members of this society. As a 
special agent of the Division of Ento¬ 
mology of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture he published in 1885 a valua¬ 
ble report entitled “Insects Affecting the 
Orange,” based on three years’ work be¬ 
gun in August 1881. In connection with 
the White Fly, it is interesting to note 
that at the time of Mr. Hubbard’s in¬ 
vestigations this insect gave no promise 
of developing into a pest, although its

existence in Florida was not unknown to 
the author. The first investigations of 
the Orange White Fly were made by 
Riley and Howard, of the Division of 
Entomology, and the results published in 
1893. The scientific name A ley rodes 
citri was given the insect at this time, 
and its different stages—egg, larval, 
pupal, and adult—were described in de¬ 
tail The subjects of life history and re¬ 
medies were also considered in as thoro 
a manner as the opportunities for the in¬ 
vestigation permitted. The next in¬ 
vestigations of the Citrus White Fly were 
by Dr. H. J. Webber, who, as an agent 
of the Division of Vegetable Physiology 
and Pathology, studiecf the problem from 
the standpoint of the sooty mold which 
follows the attacks of various honey dew 
secreting insects. Of those insects the 
White Fly was recognized as the principal 
pest and in his bulletin published in 1897 
important experimental work with sprays 
was reported and the two most useful fun¬ 
gus diseases of the fly were carefully de¬ 
scribed and their importance discussed in 
some detail. Aside from the reports pub¬ 
lished by the Department of Agriculture, 
the Florida Experiment Station has pub¬ 
lished two valuable bulletins, in addition 
to the records of the observations on the 
White Fly published in annual reports. 
Bulletins on this subject have also' been 
published by the California and Louisiana 
Stations. 

The investigation of the White Fly by 
the United States Department of Agri¬ 
culture was again taken up in July 1906 
as a consequence of the urgent demands 
for such an investigation from Florida 
orange growers. Five thousand dollars 
was appropriated by Congress for this 
work for the first year, ending June 30, 
1907, and for the work of the present 


year $10,000.00 has been available. 
These provisions by Congress have per¬ 
mitted extensive experimental work and 
the detailed results will be published in 
bulletin form from time to time as con¬ 
clusions are reached concerning the vari¬ 
ous phases of the subject of White Fly 
control. My purpose at this time is to 
present a general outline of the scope of 
the investigations at present in progress, 
with a summary of some of the more im¬ 
portant results thus far obtained. 

The paper here presented is based on 
the entire work done in connection with 
the investigation, including that by the 
various men associated with the writer 
during the past two years, more especially 
Messrs. E. A. Back and W. W. Yothers. 

LIFE HISTORY. 

In working out any important problem 
in economic entomology a thoro knowl¬ 
edge of the insect concerned is of prime 
importance. Successful control must take 
advantage of the more vulnerable periods 
in the insect’s life history, while on the 
other hand a knowledge of the insect en¬ 
ables us to avoid useless efforts. Studies 
on the life history of the Citrus White 
Fly extending over a period of nearly two 
years, have reached a point where the 
most important features are well under¬ 
stood. 

During the summer months the eggs 
hatch in from nine to nineteen days, av¬ 
eraging about eleven or twelve days. 
This variation is quite remarkable, inas¬ 
much as eggs deposited upon the same 
day are subject to this wide range in the 
duration of the egg stage. The larval 
stages are even more remarkable in their 
range of variation. Dr. Back has found 
that the larvae hatching from eggs de¬ 
posited in July will reach the adult winged

stage in a period varying from a little 
over four weeks to a period of thirty-five 
weeks, the maximum period being more 
than eight times longer than the min¬ 
imum period. The total periods from the 
deposition of the egg to the appearance 
of the adult in these two cases are 41 
and 256 days respectively. In other 
words, eggs of the White Fly deposited 
by the adult on July 15 may result in a 
few adult flies as early as Aug. 25, while 
some of the larvae will winter over and 
produce adults the following spring as 
late as the 20th of March. Our observa¬ 
tions show that the adult life under nor¬ 
mal outdoor conditions is about ten or 
twelve days, altho occasionally an indi¬ 
vidual may live for more than three 
weeks. Egg-laying usually begins within 
a few hours after the adult females reach 
maturity and continues usually at the rate 
of ten or 11 eggs per day throughout 
life. As near as we can estimate the av¬ 
erage number of eggs deposited by each 
adult female under normal conditions is 
in the vicinity of 100. In exceptional 
cases, however, individuals have been 
known to deposit more than twice this 
number. Previous to these investigations 
it has been generally considered that 
adults deposit twenty-five eggs or less and 
usually die in the course of three or four 
days. If this were correct the destruc¬ 
tion of adults would be of slight con¬ 
sequence even tho accomplished incidental 
to remedial work directed , primarily 
against the larvae and pupae. As it ap¬ 
pears from our studies, however, the de¬ 
struction of an adult even tho it has been 
depositing eggs for five days previously 
will probably prevent the deposition of up¬ 
wards of fifty eggs. This statement 
should not be considered as advocating 
the giving of particular attention to the 


destruction of adults; but only as show¬ 
ing the value of this when it can be ac¬ 
complished in connection with spraying. 
The foregoing facts concerning the life 
history of the White Fly are simply a 
brief resume of our records on some of 
the more important features. A bulletin 
will soon be prepared, giving full details 
of these studies and showing their prac¬ 
tical bearing on remedial work. 

NATURAL CONTROL. 

The subject of natural control is one 
of more than usual interest in the case 
of the insect under consideration. Its 
exposed condition, apparent vulnerability 
to attack by natural enemies, and the 
high degree of humidity in the citrus¬ 
growing regions of the Gulf states, favor¬ 
ing the effectiveness of fungus and bac¬ 
terial diseases, all give basis for the hope 
that complete control by natural enemies 
will be the eventual conclusion of the 
White Fly problem. 

So far the fungus diseases of the fly 
have been the most useful of the natural 
enemies; in certain favored sections of 
Florida, offering assistance to the orange 
growers amounting in a series of years 
to about one-third of a complete remedy. 
The important problem in this connection 
is to develop methods whereby thru arti¬ 
ficial means these fungus diseases can be 
relied upon to give satisfactory control. 
The experiments of the agents of the 
Bureau of Entomology, while extensive, 
and useful as adding to our understand¬ 
ing of the nature of these White Fly 
enemies, have not thus far contributed 
anything of value as a satisfactory 
method of this kind. The introduction 
into groves of these parasitic fungi is a 
comparatively simple operation under fa¬ 
vorable climatic conditions, and is to be 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


92 

recommended in all cases where they do 
not already exist. It is a long step, how¬ 
ever, from the introduction of these fungi 
. into a grove to the propagation of them 
on an entirely satisfactory basis, and our 
records and experiments have not as yet 
led us to conclusions justifying complete 
reliance upon the fungus diseases in any 
section of the state. 

The subject of parasitic and predaceous 
insect enemies of the White Fly are be¬ 
ing given attention in connection with the 
present investigations. No true parasites 
have thus far been discovered, al- 
tho efforts have been made to test the 
parasites attacking other species of white 
flies, as to their ability to parasitize this 
species. The known species of White 
Flies in the United States number more 
than seventy; and many of these are 
kown to be held in check and prevented 
from developing into pests by these min¬ 
ute parasites. 

The recent discovery of the Citrus 
White Fly in China furnishes strong evi¬ 
dence concerning its probable origin, and 
opens up the possibility of discovering 
natural enemies in that region. Pre¬ 
datory insect enemies of the Citrus White 
Fly are not numerous and are of no con¬ 
sequence as far as observed. 

DIRECT REMEDIES. 

The success of direct remedial meas¬ 
ures against the White Fly is largely de¬ 
pendent upon concerted action among the 
Citrus growers. Frequently several 
groves form a natural group isolated 
from other infested territory in such a 
way that a local organization only is 
necessary. In other cases concerted ac¬ 
tion may be best obtained thru County 
Horticultural commissions. It is grati- 
fying to note that in several instances 


organizations of one kind or another have 
already been affected, or are planned, 
with the object in view of conducting a 
systematic campaign against the White 
Fly. 

Spraying is not practised by any large 
proportion of the owners of infested 
groves but as a remedial measure against 
the White Fly it is of considerable im¬ 
portance. Spraying is profitable when 
properly conducted, but it is in many 
cases impracticable on account of the diffi¬ 
culty of obtaining labor which can be re¬ 
lied upon to make the application with 
the necessary thoroness. When applied 
with care and in liberal quantities the 
best sprays give results considered suc¬ 
cessful by numerous orange growers. 
The observations of the agents connected 
with the present investigation and the ex¬ 
perience of numerous owners of infested 
orange groves show that spraying is 
especially useful in connection with 
the checking of the spread of the 
fly when it first becomes estab¬ 
lished in a grove or in a new local¬ 
ity. In such cases money and time 
spent in spraying will bring manifold re¬ 
turns. It is evidently profitable to spend 
$100.00 a year on a single acre, if neces¬ 
sary, in order to delay to the utmost the 
time when it may be necessary to expend 
$500.00 or an average of only $25.00 per 
acre in controlling the fly in a twenty- 
acre grove. From the outlook it seems 
probable that spraying for the White Fly 
will continue to be desirable under certain 
circumstances. The subject of spraying 
constitutes, at present, a minor phase of 
the investigations, inasmuch as it has al¬ 
ready been demonstrated by the experi¬ 
ence of numerous orange growers that 
this can be practiced with success; and 
inasmuch as other means of control are

either known to be more economical or 
are in greater need of investigation. The 
matter of discovering new spraying ma¬ 
terials is not an important one since there 
are several already in use, which are en¬ 
tirely effective in that, when properly 
mixed, all of the larvae and pupae hit by 
the spray will be destroyed. Ineffective¬ 
ness, in most cases, is due to poor 
methods of application and failure to ap¬ 
ply the spray in sufficient cpiantities. The 
report, soon to be prepared, to which I 
have previously referred, will give the 
results of experiments in spraying and 
will discuss fully those things which are 
concerned with obtaining the greatest ef¬ 
ficiency from the practice. 

Fumigation is far more economical 
than spraying and at present can be most 
strongly recommended for general use as 
a reliable method of controlling the White 
Fly. The principal advantages of fumi¬ 
gation over spraying are: first, greater 
thoroness; second, less expense; third, 
easier and less disagreeable labor. The 
work of the Bureau of Entomology has 
resulted in placing the process of fumiga¬ 
tion for the White Fly under Florida 'con¬ 
ditions on a basis such that Florida or- 
ange growers will be able to use this 
method more intelligently and with more 
uniform results than California growers 
have used it heretofore. The so-called 
expert fumigators, relied upon in Cali¬ 
fornia to estimate the dosage, are un¬ 
necessary in Florida. The experimental 
work conducted during January and Feb¬ 
ruary 1907 serves as the basis for a bul¬ 
letin on fumigation which will be ready 
for distribution in the course of a few 
weeks. 

During the past winter more than 
4,000 citrus trees have been fumigated 
under the direction of the writer and his 


1)3 

associates. The complete results of the 
past winter’s work cannot be obtained for 
several months; but it may be said that 
they have been most satisfactory, both 
from the standpoint of the experiments 
and from that of practical results in con¬ 
trolling the White Fly. In one small 
grove of two acres the results are already 
so striking that it is very evident that the 
treatment would have been very profita¬ 
ble even tho the expense were twice as 
great. The results obtained in destroy¬ 
ing citrus scale insect pests by fumiga¬ 
tion, conducted primarily as a measure 
against the fly, have fully justified the 
writer's assertion made at the last meet¬ 
ing of this society to the effect that the 
benefits derived from destroying the va¬ 
rious scales in most groves are of suf¬ 
ficient value to offset the entire cost of 
the fumigation, leaving as clear gain the 
benefits resulting from the destruction of 
the fly. The agents connected with the 
investigations have been making careful 
inquiry into the matter of damage in 
Florida due to scale insects. Without the 
aid of the fungus diseases and insect 
parasites of these scales, it seems 
evident that frequent spraying or regular 
fumigations would be necessary to pro¬ 
duce profitable citrus crops. With their 
aid the damage is reduced to an 
estimated averag'e of between five and 
ten per cent. In some cases, however, 
the damage is as high as fifteen or twenty 
per cent, of the value of the crop, while 
in others there is no appreciable damage. 
Usually the damage by the scale itself 
does not justify the expense of direct 
remedies, but the effect on them of fumi¬ 
gations for the White Fly is an extremely 
important consideration. 

In addition to the foregoing main sub¬ 
jects of investigation attention is being

given to numerous subjects of less im¬ 
portance, or narrower scope. Among 
these may be mentioned the study of the 
effect of food plants, other than citrus, 
on the efficacy of remedial measures; the 
study of the result of removing water 
shoots from citrus trees at advantageous 
times; the collection of data concerning 
the losses from the fly; and data con¬ 
cerning the distribution. The results of 
the investigation thus far indicate that 
conclusive results can be obtained from 
most lines of the experimental work in a 
shorter period of time than is usually re¬ 
quired for insects of a like prominence 
and destructiveness. At the present time, 
from the results we have obtained, we are 
unable to predict the results of the efforts 
to control the White Fly thru its natural 
enemies, but whatever the results obtained 
this line of work should be continued un¬ 
til every practicable effort has been made 
to substitute natural control for the more 
expensive direct means. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Skinner—Do you have different 
size tents, or the same tents? 

Dr. Morrill—Tents for the largest 
trees will do, if necessary, for the 
smaller trees, but if a grower has one 
grove of large seedling trees and an¬ 
other of medium-sized budded trees, 
it would be better for him to have two 
sizes of tents. 

Mr.-Do the tents have to be 

black ? 

Dr. Morrill—That is not necessary. 
Most of our work has been done at 
night and after a little experience this 
is not as objectionable as it would ap¬ 
pear. It is much cooler, and much 
pleasanter. 


Mr.-What effect does the fumi¬ 

gation have on fungi? 

Dr. Morrill—So far as I have ob¬ 
served, no effect whatever. It is gen- 
enerally considered by plant patholo¬ 
gists that hydrocyanic acid gas is not 
fungicidal. I believe Prof. Rolfs will 
agree with this. 

Prof. Rolfs—It has no effect on 
fungi. 

Mr.-At what stage is it best to 

fumigate ? 

Dr. Morrill—It is best to fumigate 
in the winter time, because at that 
time there are practically none of the 
flies on the wing. As Dr. Berger has 
said, there is no time when you can¬ 
not find a few adults, but there are 
comparatively few in the middle of the 
winter; too few to be taken into con¬ 
sideration. Occasionally, there is more 
or less shedding of leaves following 
fumigation, but of the four thousand or 
more trees fumigated under our super¬ 
vision during the past winter, in no 
case was the tree injured more than 
was offset by the benefits of destroy¬ 
ing the insects. In one case in Man¬ 
atee county we fumigated a tree that 
was shedding its leaves from some un¬ 
known cause, and I believe only five 
per cent, of the leaves were left on 
the tree, but there were trees near by 
which were not fumigated which shed 
their leaves to nearly the same extent. 

Mr.-How long does it take to 

fumigate a tree? 

Dr. Morrill—The tents are left on 
about forty minutes. 

I would like to say, in connection 
with the injury from fumigation, that 
there is some misunderstanding with 
regard to this, owing to injury some¬ 
times caused by emptying the contents 










FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


95 


of the jars known as “residue” on the 
roots of the trees after fumigating. 
Of course, this should not be charged 
to the fumigation of the trees any 
more than we would charge against 
the cost of spraying the injury that 
would result from emptying against 
the base of a tree a half barrel of spray 
mixture left over at the end of the 
day. Such carelessness must, however, 
be guarded against. 

Mr.-What is the cost of fumiga¬ 

tion ? 

Dr. Morrill—The cost of fumigation 
for the average size tree, is about 50 
cents. For large trees, the cost may 
go up to $1.00, or more. But, as I 
have said, it is better and cheaper to 
fumigate than to spray, and spraying 
will cost more in one year than a sin¬ 
gle fumigation that will last two years 
or more. The eggs of the insect will 
probably hatch out by the middle of 
December, and the best time for fumi¬ 
gating, I would say, would be from 
the first of January to the time of the 
appearance of new spring growth of 
the citrus trees in February. 

In connection with the scale insects 
question, I would say that in one case 
where we have made pretty careful 
observation, we have been unable to 
find a single live pupae or red scale 
in any of the trees in a fifty-acre grove, 
though in previous years they had 
caused much trouble and caused injury 
to the extent of several hundred dol¬ 
lars per year. 

Mr.-In your cost of fumigating, 

do you include labor, etc. ? 

Dr. Morrill—We include every¬ 
thing; the work, material, and the 
wear and tear on the tent as well. 


Mr.-It seems to me the tents 

should be mildew proof. 

Dr. Morrill—That should be done if 
it can be done without increasing the 
weight too greatly. However, I know 
one preparation that will do it. 

Mr.-Did you ever use sugar of 

lead and alum? 

Dr. Morrill—That is what I speak 
of. 

Mr.-How much would it add to 

the weight of the tent? 

Dr. Morrill—It would not add ap¬ 
preciably to the weight. 

Dr. Inman—What is the size of the 
tents you use? 

Dr. Morrill—The largest tents are 
about eighty feet in diameter, and 
octagonal in shape. These are large 
enough for seedling trees thirty-three 
or thirty-four feet in extreme height. 
Budded trees twelve feet high require 
tents about thirty-five feet in diameter. 

Mr. Mote—After you have thor¬ 
oughly and carefully fumigated a 
grove that is badly infected with 
white flies, do you consider that you 
have done away with the white flies 

for two seasons? 

_ 1 

Dr. Morrill—From our observation 
of the groves we have fumigated, we 
believe it will take at least two years 
before the fly will increase to the point 
of smutting the leaves or fruit. By 
fumigating it thoroughly every other 
year, I think you can keep your fruit 
entirely free from smut, unless sur¬ 
rounding conditions are unfavorable. 
I refer to neighboring groves where 
no attempt is made to control the fly. 

Mr.-Does it kill the rust mite? 

Dr. Morrill—It kills the adult, but 
not the eggs. 








FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


96 


Mr.-In spraying, how often dur¬ 

ing the season is it necessary to spray 
to get good results ? 

Dr. Morrill—Not less than three 
times a year. I would recommend two 
in the winter and one later on, about 
the middle of June. There are no two 
men who spray alike and good results 
are dependent upon thoroughness. 
The results from spraying would not 
be as satisfactory as by fumigation, 
but I believe, personally, that I could 
spray a grove three or four times 
a year and keep the white fly from 
smutting the fruit. The average or¬ 
ange grower has to depend on care¬ 
less hands to spray, and it is not done 
carefully and thoroughly, and half the 
good results are lost. . 

Mr. Mote—What do you think will 
control the rust mite? 

Dr. Morrill—To control the rust 
mite, you would have to add sulphur 
to the spray. 

Mr.-Did I understand you to say 


that one fumigation would equal the 
results of four sprayings ? 

Dr. Morrill—Yes, sir. The four 
sprayings in one season would not be 
as effective as one fumigation, and 
they would have to be repeated each 
year. Fumigation has been done so 
thoroughly that it was impossible to 
find a single white fly on more than 
two hundred trees, but absolute ex¬ 
termination should not be expected. 

Mr.—Can you fumigate during the 
summer months? 

Dr.Morrill—We fumigate very little 
in the summer time, but two or three 
weeks ago we fumigated some trees 
that were heavily laden with fruit, and 
while it seemed to cause quite a large 
percentage of the fruit to drop, we 
found that surrounding trees contin¬ 
ued to shed their fruit, and altogether 
the fumigated trees have not shed as 
much fruit as the unfumigated trees. 
However, it is not desirable to fumi¬ 
gate for scales or the fly while the 
fruit is green. 










Report on Plant Diseases. 


By Ernst A. Bessey. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Owing to lack of the necessary time 
in which to prepare a more extended pa¬ 
per I shall confine my remarks to two 
topics, viz.: withertip fungus and nema¬ 
todes. 

In taking up the first-named topic I 
realize that I am entering upon a field 
well worked by our respected President, 
but I am sure he will pardon me if I ap¬ 
pear to trespass upon his preserves. 

As Professor Rolfs demonstrated some 
years ago and made known in addresses 
before this society, as well as in Govern¬ 
ment publications, various citrus diseases 
including withertip, blossom blight and 
tear-staining of pomelo, lemon spot, and 
several other troubles are caused by the 
fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. 
Of course, not all cases of dying back of 
twigs, nor of the rotting of fruits are 
due to this cause, for other organisms as 
well are capable of causing these injuries, 
but in a large proportion of cases the 
fungus above named is responsible. 

Under Professor Rolf’s direction, be¬ 
fore he severed his connection with the 
Subtropical Laboratory, inoculation ex¬ 
periments were begun, which have been 
continued with some interruptions under 
my direction since I assumed charge of 
the Laboratory. These have demonstrated 
that this fungus is the same one that 
causes the blossom-blight, leaf-spot and 
fruit-rot of the mango and avocado, the 


tear-staining of the mango and leaf-spots 
and fruit-rots of various other plants. 
These investigations make it almost cer¬ 
tain, furthermore, that this fungus is, if 
not identical with, at least but a slight 
modification of the fungus that causes the 
bitter rot of apples. We see, therefore, 
that it is not a fungus confined to but 
one or two hosts in a limited area with 
which we have to contend, but one of 
wide distribution, and capable of attack¬ 
ing a great many kinds of plants. I have 
found apparently the same fungus on over 
fifty plants at Miami, some of them com¬ 
mon weeds. This explains why, when 
the weather conditions or other circum¬ 
stances are favorable, the disease springs 
up everywhere all at once, without any 
very apparent center of infection. Fur¬ 
ther complicating the matter is the fact 
that the fungus is not confined to living 
plants, but will grow with great readi¬ 
ness—I will not say equally well—on 
dead parts of the same or other plants. 
Often we find that citrus trees dying 
back from some other cause, e. g. die- 
back or blight, show this fungus in abun¬ 
dance on the dead branches, although in 
this case the fungus has appeared after 
the death or weakening of the tissues by 
the other disease. 

In view of the above mentioned facts, 
we see why it is so desirable to keep the 
grove clean, trimming off and burning 
all dead branches, and destroying all 


7 





98

trash near the trees. Even this will not 
prove sufficient to entirely prevent the dis¬ 
ease from gaining a foothold unless we 
take other factors into consideration also. 
One of the most favorable factors for 
the spread of the disease is moist 
weather, but since this is beyond our con¬ 
trol it will need no further consideration 
except to point out that by allowing the 
trees 'to be plajnted /too /closely and to 
branch too low, an artificial condition of 
extreme moisture may be maintained in 
the grove that is very favorable to the 
spread of the fungus. In such groves 
the disease can be combated only with 
difficulty and cannot be conquered. An¬ 
other factor that we can control to a large 
extent is the condition of health of the 
trees. My observations have shown me 
that anything that tends to weaken the 
tree makes it more susceptible to infec¬ 
tion by this fungus and so reduces the 
power of resistance that when it has once 
gained a foothold it progresses much fur¬ 
ther than is the case with a healthy tree. 
Among the causes of weakness may be 
mentioned excessive moisture, or ex¬ 
cessive drought, starvation or overfeed¬ 
ing with nitrogenous fertilizers so that 
the new growth is soft and flabby. In¬ 
jury from insecticides and even from 
fungicides may favor the entrance of the 
disease, while the presence of scale in¬ 
sects on leaves and twigs, or of lice and 
mites, is also very undesirable. Many 
of you have no doubt noticed the dead 
areas at the margins of the citrus leaves, 
sometimes occupying half or more of the 
leaf surface—marked with concentric 
lines of minute dots. These are mostly 
caused by this fungus and will in a great 
many cases be found to center in a group 
of scale insects that have weakened the 
tissue so that at that spot the fungus was 


able to gain an entrance—a thing that 
it does with difficulty in an uninjured ma¬ 
ture leaf. On the other hand, any treat¬ 
ment that keeps the tree growing vigor¬ 
ously with a firm, hard growth, reduces 
its susceptibility to the disease and en¬ 
ables it, in the majority of cases, to 
check the progress of the fungus before 
very much injury has been accomplished. 
One frequent source of entrance of the 
fungus is through wounds—especially if 
the tree be in a weak condition, so that 
it may often happen when one starts to 
prune withertip out of his grove he finds 
to his dismay in a few weeks that he has 
more of the disease than before, infec¬ 
tion having taken place at every cut sur¬ 
face and having followed down without 
any apparent check from the pruning. 
In a case like this, I would advise that 
a second man follow the pruner right up 
and spray the trees thoroughly with Bor¬ 
deaux mixture within a few hours after 
pruning. In this way the cut surfaces 
will be coated by a layer of Bordeaux 
mixture which will prevent the spores 
of the . fungus from germinating 
and reinfecting the plant. If the disease 
is not abundant in one’s trees and they 
are in vigorous condition, it may not be 
found necessary to spray. 

Recently there have come to my notice 
a number of cases where avocado trees 
have been very seriously injured by this 
disease. Three or four years ago a large 
grove of budded avocados was set out 
in the southern part of the state. The 
owner fertilized it with a great excess 
of phosphoric acid (18 to 25 per cent.) 
while but two or three per cent, of am¬ 
monia and three or four per cent, of 
potash were applied. The trees did not 
make any too vigorous growth and a year 
ago this spring, although not yet old

enough to blossom much, came out into 
excessively abundant bloom. The wither- 
tip fungus attacked the flowers and, the 
trees being in a weakened condition, fol¬ 
lowed down the flower clusters into the 
twigs, destroying a great many twigs, 
many of the larger branches and, in a 
good many cases, the whole tree, the fun¬ 
gus continuing down the trunk to the 
surface of the ground. In another case, 
more recently, several hundred budded 
trees were obtained from a nursery and 
kept for several weeks in a lath shed be¬ 
fore being set out. At the time they 
were set out the man in charge noticed 
brown spots near the bases of the cions 
on a good many of the trees. These rap¬ 
idly enlarged and finally girdled the trees, 
destroying quite a large percentage of 
those set out. In this case also the with- 
ertip fungus was to blame, having gained 
entrance either through some wound 
made at the time the top of the stock 
was lopped off, or through some of the 
little lateral shoots that started shortly 
above the bud on the cion, or through the 
wounds caused by their removal. An¬ 
other case was that of a little avocado 
tree growing in very poor, rocky soil, 
with no water except the scanty rainfall 
we had last year. No fertilizer of any 
kind was given to the tree and it made 
a very weak growth, losing its leaves this 
past winter before the new leaves came 
out. It blossomed quite abundantly and 
the fungus passed on into the twigs 
and is now entering into some of the 
large branches. 

I have contiued my work on nematodes, 
on which I made a report before the So- 
ciey two years ago, and have a few things 
that I would like to add. I have made 
several extensive trips to determine the 
distribution of the rootknot, and find that 


it is more widely distributed than any¬ 
body supposed, occurring as far north as 
New York, West Virginia, Michigan, In¬ 
diana, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah and 
California, thus being found in parts of 
the country where the winters are very 
cold, at times with the ground freezing to 
considerable depth. It also occurs in Eu¬ 
rope, Africa, Asia, East Indies, Australia^ 
New Zealand, Hawaii, West Indies, 
Mexico, Brazil and Argentina and 
doubtless elsewhere in South America. 
According to the reports of others 
and my own observations, it occurs on 
over 375 species of plants and if careful 
observations were made wherever it oc¬ 
curs, this number would doubtless be mul¬ 
tiplied many times. Nearly all of the 
large families of flowering plants are 
represented by plants that are subject to 
rootknot, while even the comptie, which 
is not a flowering plant, is not exempt. 
Of the cultivated plants, as I mentioned 
two years ago, beggarweed, peanuts, and 
velvet beans seem to be about the only 
important leguminous crops that are not 
injured, while among the grains, corn, 
sorghum, wheat and rye seem to be 
exempt. Oats, on the other hand, which 
in all my previous observations showed 
no signs of the disease, I have found to 
be subject in certain cases. I have tested 
further the effects of different fertilizers 
on the rootknot injury. Those fertilizers 
containing large amounts of potash I have 
found to be of value in that they reduce 
the ■ amount of injury and seem to act¬ 
ually reduce the amount of rootknot pres¬ 
ent, the plants not only having a more 
vigorous appearance, but actually show¬ 
ing smaller and less numerous knots. 
Kainit and Potassium magnesium carbon¬ 
ate are superior to sulphate of potash. 
Formalin treatment of the soil I have 




100 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


found to be of some benefit, using one 
part of commercial formalin to ioo parts 
of water; but it is necessary to apply sev¬ 
eral gallons of this solution to the square 
yard, and it is impossible to get the 
ground thoroughly and evenly soaked so 
that its use is entirely out of the question. 
Carbonbisulphide, about a teaspoonful 
poured into a hole six inches deep, at 
intervals of about 15 to 20 inches, the 
holes being immediately covered with soil, 
is very efficacious, but is entirely impac- 
ticable except for very small areas, on 
account of the expense which would 
would amount to $60 to $100 per acre 
for the. chemical alone, not including the 
cost of applying it. I do wish, how¬ 
ever, to report success with certain rota¬ 
tion experiments that were conducted at 
my suggestion in Denison, Texas. A 
gentleman was very much troubled by 
rootknot in his muskmelons, it becoming 
so abundant that he lost his whole crop 
in 1904. At my suggestion he planted 
his field that fall with winter grain. The 
following spring, 1905, he sowed Iron 
cow peas on the land, this variety, if pure 
seed is obtained, being absolutely immune 
to rootknot. In this connection, however, 
I must emphasize the fact that it is 
necessary to have pure seed, for I have 
observed, and so have others, rootknot 
in seed alleged to be Iron, though in the 
pure bred Iron cowpea I have never seen 
it. The owner of the land carefully de¬ 
stroyed all weeds that came up among 


the cowpeas until the latter covered the 
land so thoroughly that all weeds were 
smothered out. In the fall the land was 
again sown to grain and in the following 
summer Iron cowpeas were planted the 
second time; in the fall of 1906 the land 
was again put in grain and in the spring 
of 1907 was planted partly to melons and 
partly to other crops. All proved to be 
absolutely free from rootknot. Another 
piece of land in which he had Iron cow¬ 
peas but one year was found to have very 
many less nemadotes than before, but was 
not yet entirely free from the trouble. 

Regarding the methods of introduction 
and spread of this nematode, my observa¬ 
tions lead me to believe that to a large 
extent nursery stock has been responsible 
for the introduction. Once introduced in¬ 
to a man’s farm, the disease is easily 
spread by his tools or the dirt clinging 
to his feet or the feet of his animals, and 
even by washing rains. If the proper pre¬ 
cautions were taken on new land that 
had never been cultivated before to use 
only clean tools and to see that the horses, 
wagons and plows did not bring dirt with 
them, the disease would not prove serious. 
When once introduced, however, it does 
not take very long, if susceptible crops 
are grown, for it to become thoroughly 
established and injurious, for from the 
time that the egg is laid until the mature 
worm is laying eggs herself is only about 
four weeks, and one worm is able to' lay 
from 400 to 500 eggs.

SCALY BARK DISEASE OF CITRUS. 


By H. S. Fawcett. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Scaly bark, a recently discovered dis¬ 
ease of the orange tree, is becoming a 
serious menace to many growers in that 
part of Hillsboro county which is known 
as the Pinellas peninsula. The year be¬ 
fore last it was estimated that from 35 
to 75 per cent, of the fruit in many old 
groves was injured by the spotting due 
to this disease, and this was in addition 
to the injury to the limbs and trunks by 
the killing of the bark. Last year the 
disease was not so severe on the fruit. 
Scaly bark has been known to the Exper¬ 
iment Station for not more than three 
years, and the serious nature of the dis¬ 
ease has been recognized for scarcely 
more than a year and a half. According 
to the older growers in the Pinellas pen¬ 
insula, however, it has been known there 
to some extent for many years. Whether 
it occurs in any other part of Florida, or 
in any other part of the world, I have as 
yet been unable to determine. 

About a year and a half ago I was del¬ 
egated by the Experiment Station to 
take up, along with other plant disease 
work, the investigation of this trouble; 
in order to find the cause, if possible, 
and also a practical remedy. When I 
first took up the work the older growers 
told me that the disease was thought to 
have originated near Safety Harbor, on 
Old Tampa Bay, in what is known as the 
Phillippi hammock. In following up 
these reports I found that nearly all the 
older groves in which the disease was 
worst could be traced back as coming 
from trees that had first grown in a nurs¬ 


ery owned by Mr. Phillippi. It was in 
a large tree next to this nursery 
as reported by Mr. Phillippi’s grand¬ 
son, that the disease was first noticed 
at about the year i860. These trees had 
been planted about 1840, and were 
twenty years old when the disease was 
first noticed. Just how the disease got 
into the grove and where it came from, 
no one knows. 

As to the varieties affected, I find it is 
only serious on the sweet orange. Grape¬ 
fruit is very resistant. Tangerines are 
almost immune, as is also the Mandarin. 
I found Tangerine trees surrounded by 
diseased sweet orange trees, but could 
find no trace of the disease upon them. 

This disease has three fairly distinct 
appearances on the tree: 

(1) . On the bark of the trunk and 
larger limbs there appear roughened, 
ruptured areas, in which the old bark 
cracks and scales off with more or less 
gumming, and a new bark forms under 
the old; and this again cracks and scales 
off in the same way later on. This ap¬ 
pearance has suggested the name Scaly 
Bark. 

(2) . Another manifestation of the 
disease is apparent on the small branches 
and twigs. Small lemon-colored areas 
on the bark are first noticed. They turn 
reddish-brown, and the bark becomes 
brittle and cracks. They develop quite 
slowly, and scarcely ever appear on wood 
that is less than nine months to one year 
old. New spots form between the old 
ones, until in a year or two 1 the limb be¬ 
comes girdled at some point. As the 







102 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


limb weakens, the ever-present wither- 
tip fungus comes in and kills it back very 
rapidly. 

(3). A third manifestation of the 
disease is seen on the fruit, on which 
there appear, usually in July or August, 
faint rings. These rings slowly become 
colored and sunken, while in many cases 
the interior of the ring remains green 
and apparently uninjured. The fruits so 
attacked color prematurely, and many 
of them drop before picking time. 

About a year ago I began experiments 
on a grove near Bayview on about 175 
trees, with the view of getting some def¬ 
inite information that might lead to a 
remedy. It is too soon to report def¬ 
initely on these experiments, as they 
must be continued another year before 
any conclusions can be drawn; but I 
might say that experiments with Bor¬ 
deaux mixture were made every two 
months through the year, in addition to 
other experiments of a different nature. 

I found that the spraying diminished 
the amount of spotting on the fruit to 
some extent; but that where it was used 
every two months three times or more 
in all, the Purple Scale increased so rap¬ 
idly that it was a question whether these 
scale insects did not do more harm than 


the disease would have done if let alone. 

Considerable progress is being made in 
learning how the disease develops and 
spreads, and it is hoped that in time we 
shall have worked out a remedy for the 
trouble. Such scientific work is usually 
quite slow. As you know, the die-back 
of the orange was fifteen years under 
investigation before a practical way of 
controlling it was worked out. The Fed¬ 
eral Government has spent $30,000 to 
$40,000 in the investigation of the blight 
of citrus; and although considerable 
progress has been made in finding out 
the nature of this disease, no practical 
remedy has as yet been found. In most 
diseases it requires years for such investi¬ 
gations. In rare instances a remedy may 
be worked out in a short time. Profes¬ 
sor Rolfs worked out a remedy for the 
phytoptosis of potatoes in ten days, and 
this remedy has never been improved 
upon; but this is a rare case. It cannot 
be known in advance whether it will re¬ 
quire ten days or ten years to find a 
remedy for any given disease.

ORANGE TREE SCALE. 


By Cyrus W. Butler. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I was surprised to find myself upon our 
program for a paper upon Scale, for hav¬ 
ing sold my grove interest and even left, 
temporarily, at least, the land of the best 
orange, I had considered myself dis¬ 
charged from the army of those who bat¬ 
tle against the enemies of the citrus; 
but I feel pleased to be remembered by 
my companions of old and, being at pres¬ 
ent in the land of that best orange, will 
take one more shot at the enemy, even 
though it is a “hot air” one and along 
lines that have often been over before. 
In approaching the subject, I do so with 
a sense of incompleteness of knowledge; 
but when I recall one orange grower, 
whom I found killing lady birds, and who 
offered me one dollar apiece for every 
scale that I would find upon his badly 
infested trees, and again another who, 
in advocating a certain insecticide, stated 
that when applied to orange trees, the 
scale could at once be seen leaving the 
tree in clouds,—I reflect that there are 
degrees of lack of knowledge of this, as 
well as other subjects. 

By the word “scale,” the Florida or¬ 
ange grower usually means the purple 
or oyster shell scale (mytilaspis citri- 
cola), which is the only species that oc¬ 
curs throughout Florida in sufficient 
numbers to constitute an important fac¬ 
tor in the culture of the citrus, but is 
not now so dreaded a pest as it was be¬ 
fore its natural enemies had bec®me 
numerous, for we hear the oldest of 


growers tell of a time when orange 
groves were not only killed by them, but 
the entire business threatened. 

With its life history most of us are 
more or less acquainted, but all of us are 
most interested in methods of making 
their lives entirely historical, and I will 
mention such methods as are known to 
be of value. 

These methods come under three 
heads: first, Prevention; second, Natural 
Enemies; and third, Insecticides. 

PREVENTION. 

In the multiplication of scale, like that 
of all life, food is one of the great fac¬ 
tors, which the orange tree best furnishes 
these parasites when the bark is soft and 
juicy, with large pores, this condition is 
most often brought about by using an ex¬ 
cess of nitrogen, and most especially when 
of an organic nature, such as stable and 
hen manure. Even a moderate amount of 
nitrogen of this class is almost certain to 
cause an increase of scale, and quite cer¬ 
tain to do so if used in connection with 
clean culture, which by admitting the air 
to the soil, causes rapid nitrification of 
the ammonia present in the manure. 

Also we remember how, after the 
freezes of 94 and 95, the fast growing 
sprouts from the roots of the frozen- 
down trees were afflicted with scale 
throughout the State. 

As to the idea of this pest being in¬ 
creased by poverty of soil and neglect of 
cultivation, I must differ even with such 
authorities as our much respected Hub- 





104 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


barcl, as such conditions produce a close 
bark, not favorable to scale ; but what is 
better proof, is that I have never been 
able to find any neglected trees that 
showed any unusual amount of scale, 
unless around some old barn or hen 
house, where the ammonia may linger 
longer than one would expect. Of course 
cultivation will cause and increase scale 
by increasing the nitrification of any am- 
moniates that may be in the soil and thus 
causing a more sappy growth; provided 
the ammoniates are in the soil. 

Any covering, greatly increases scale, 
and this true, not only when immediate, 
as in the case of spider webs, birds’ nests, 
etc., but when the cover is much above 
the trees, as in the case of overhanging 
forest trees, and is well illustrated in 
shedded groves. Also, in shedded piner¬ 
ies scale abound in proportion to the 
amount of shade. 

In addition to the above causes, we 
must admit, that at times we have a gen¬ 
eral increase of scale, probably owing to 
climatic conditions. 

For instance, last year we had a long 
spring drouth, followed by a meager 
rainy season, thus seriously handicapping 
the fungoid enemies of the scale, which 
are now very numerous. 

But the worst of all attacks of scale is 
that following the white fly, the usual 
dead wood inside of whitefly trees, 
being less due to the whitefly than to 
the scale that follows them. 

NATURAL ENEMIES. 

Upon our Sub-peninsula, at least, I 
would give the first place to the black 
fungus ( myrangium duraci), which is 
well distributed with us; and, while it 
confines itself mainly to the trunk and 
larger limbs and does not become abun¬ 


dant until the scale are also in sufficient 
numbers to injure the trees, still I think 
it our best ally against the scale. I first 
saw this fungus some eighteen years ago, 
in the grove of Mr. Moffet McClung, of 
Dunedin, and scraping it from the trees, 
got a mixture of fungus, bark and scale. 
When my trees were still wet from a 
summer rain, I rubbed the above pow¬ 
dery mixture along the upper sides of 
such large limbs as showed scale, being 
careful to work high in the tree, so that 
the rains would wash the spores of the 
fungus down the limbs. All conditions 
must have been favorable, for every tree 
treated got a good start. 

While we have long heard of the white 
fungus (ophionectra coccicola), it did 
not appear in our vicinity until the last 
two years, and was first noticed in the 
grove of Mr. W. E. Heathcote, and is 
now spreading. It works upon smaller 
limbs than the black fungus, and will 
thus supplement the effect of the latter. 
Considering that it has been doing good 
work during the past dry year, it prom¬ 
ises well under more moist conditions. 

As Cuba has one or two species of fun¬ 
gus preying upon scale that I do not 
think that we have, it might pay to make 
some importations. 

Of lady birds, the only species numer¬ 
ous enough to be of value is our common 
twice stabed one, which, like our lady 
friends, are ever with us, and are ever 
busy, both in larvae and adult form, de¬ 
stroying what scale their stomachs will 
admit, but (again like our lady friends) 
are not quite equal to the occasion of ac- 
com/plis'hing all desired results for our 
good. Incidentally, I might say that in at 
least one shedded pinery I found this lady 
bird to be a specific for the pineapple 
scale. The covering of this scale being 








FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


105 


quite thin, the lady bird forces its man¬ 
dibles through the covering and into the 
scale, then drags it out through the roof 
of its house, eating at times as many as 
three scale per minute. Cuba has a small 
steel blue lady bird that might be of use 
to us. 

While we always find many micro¬ 
scopic, but predacious appearing mites 
running around among scale, I have 
never been able to detect them in prey¬ 
ing upon the latter. 

Also, if hymenopterous flies attack the 
purple scale, I have never noticed it, but 
have seen them clean up a tree badly in¬ 
fested with wax scale. 

INSECTICIDES. 

Where man interferes with the bal¬ 
ance established by Nature, he is quite 
apt to bring about a series of reactions, 
often unlooked for by him, and this is 
especially true in spraying orange trees, 
where the insecticide used not only often 
directly injures the tree, but usually de¬ 
stroys the natural enemies of the scale, 
and the grower thus places himself under 
obligations to do much work that Nature 
would otherwise do for him; but upon 
the other hand, where the grower is suffi¬ 
ciently informed, he can keep his trees 
clean of scale and rust mites by spraying, 
and without injury to the trees, but at 
a cost justified only by a fair price for 
oranges. 

Of the most effective insecticides for 
scale, we would first place either resin 
compound or resin wash, but the former 
is apt to gum the pump: this can, how¬ 
ever, be remedied by adding, say five per 
cent, of kerosene to the compound in 
making and thoroughly incorporating 
the same. Both of these washes, if used 
two or three times during one season, 


will show bad results upon the trees, 
probably by gumming up the pores of the 
leaves and bark. 

Second comes kerosene emulsion, 
which is rather less effective upon scale 
than the resin washes, and is quite varia¬ 
ble in its effect upon the trees, depending 
upon whether the weather be clear or 
cloudy and also whether the trees are 
thrifty or not. 

During clear weather the oil evaporates 
quicker, and thus affects the tree less, 
and a thrifty tree will withstand much 
more kerosene than a hardened up one. 
Besides, kerosene emulsion has killed 
many large trees by being carelessly 
made, the oil separating and being 
sprayed upon the trees unnoticed by the 
workman. 

Third, and safest of all our scale spray¬ 
ing compounds, comes the various pot¬ 
ash fish oil soaps, often called whale oil 
soaps. At the strength advisable to use 
these soaps are not as effective as the 
above resin washes; however, its non-in¬ 
jury to the tree enables the grower to 
use it so repeatedly as to thoroughly 
clean a tree of all insect enemies, except¬ 
ing rust mites, which for some reason 
seem proof against the soaps, perhaps 
because of their diet of oil; this can be 
remedied, however, by adding some sul¬ 
phur and caustic potash compound to the 
soap. Many of these soaps are made 
with caustic soda, which makes a hard 
soap, while caustic potash makes a soft 
one, which is to be preferred to that made 
from caustic soda, for its fertilizing prop¬ 
erties, if for no other reason, but again 
it mixes with water more readily than a 
caustic soda soap. 

Personally, we have not sprayed for 
scale but one season during the last 
twelve years of our orange growing, and 






106 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that one season was after using Bor¬ 
deaux mixture; but, needing bright or¬ 
anges, we did spray with a sulphur and 
caustic potash compound that not only 
was effective on rust mites, but was al¬ 
most equally so upon young scale, even 
after they were partially covered. 

Ever since we have been in Florida 
we have heard of using salt around trees, 
as a scale insecticide to be administered 
through the sap, but have made only one 
trial, and that on but six two-year-old 
trees, giving them from three-fourths of 
a pound to two and one-half pounds 
each, and for want of rain, soaking it 
in once per week with water from a hose. 
The salt did kill nearly all the scale; but 
it also hurt the trees so that they dropped 
most of their leaves, even when I used 
less than one pound of salt; and where 
I used the most salt, the small limbs died 
back for a few inches and the tree was 
a long time without foliage. 

To recapitulate: We would say, first, 


avoid conditions favorable to a multipli¬ 
cation of scale, by hardening up the 
bark by a maximum percentage of potash 
and a moderate amount of nitrogen 
from inorganic sources—preferably sul¬ 
phate of ammonia, and avoiding any un¬ 
necessary cultivation of trees. 

Second, encourage all natural enemies, 
such as scale destroying fungi and lady 
birds. 

Third, if justified in spraying and in¬ 
tending to do so but once during the sea¬ 
son, use one of the resin washes, but do 
not use it while the fruit is quite small. 
If continued spraying is intended, use one 
of the fish oil potash soaps; and where 
rust mites are also to be destroyed, add 
some potash sulphur compound. 

But preferably get the natural ene¬ 
mies of the scale to work, and do not ex¬ 
pect immediate results; for, while the 
mills of the gods grind exceedingly fine, 
they are unusually slow, in the time ideas 
of man. 


SAN JOSE SCALE. 


By F. P. Henderson, Gainesville. 


Mr. President, Ladies a-nd Gentlemen: 

The general subject of Diseases and 
Insects has been so thoroughly and ably 
discussed by persons more competent 
than myself that I think it more profitable 
to this body that I give very briefly my 
experience with the San Jose Scale. Per¬ 
haps no one in the State has had more 
loss by the San Jose Scale or succeeded 
better in its destruction than I have. 

In 1901 I planted at Arno, Fla., a 60- 
acre peach orchard. In 1903 nothing 
could look more promising, when the San 
Jose Scale appeared in two or three 


places. I immediately cut down and de¬ 
stroyed the first trees infected. But this 
failed, as by winter several hundred trees 
were affected. During the winter of 1903 
to 1904 I sprayed all the infected trees 
and all the trees around them with the 
Lime-Sulphur Salt solution. This seemed 
to destroy most of them, but during the 
summer and fall of 1904 they spread very 
rapidly. I again sprayed the whole or¬ 
chard very thoroughly during the winter 
of 1904 and 1905, with only temporary 
results, so that by the fall of 1905 al¬ 
most every tree in the orchard was in- 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


107 


fected so much that three-fourths of the 
trees died back to the trunk. 

I had read the bulletin written by our 
Honorable President about the destruc¬ 
tion of the San Jose Scale by the Sphae- 
rostilbe Coccophila or Red-head Fungus, 
but I did not know how or where to get 
it. But I succeeded in getting three or 
four small pieces of what was told me 
was black fungus. I put this on some 
of the worst infected trees early in 1905. 
I paid no .more attention to it. At this 
time I did not know the red or black fun¬ 
gus when I saw it. Early in the winter 
of 1905 I began spraying again and I 
kept seeing trees covered with the red 
fungus and I began to examine and I 
found where the trees looked red the scale 
was dead. I very carefully re-read the 
bulletin and found I had the red and black 
fungus both pretty well distributed over 
my orchard. I immediately quit spraying 
and wrote to Prof. Rolfs and stated the 
facts to him and asked him if I could 
safelv trust the orchard in the hands of 
the fungus, and he replied I could; and I 
have not used my spray pump since. By 
January iqo6 I could not find a live Scale 
in my orchard. 

Earlv in the spring of 1906 I cut al¬ 
most all the trees back to the trunk and 
by the fall of 1906 I had almost as good 
an orchard as ever. The Scale were so 
completely killed that I almost lost the 
fungus. 

During the fall of 1907, during a long 
spell of dry weather, the Scale appeared 
in large numbers, sufficient to do a little 
damage; but as soon as we had some rain 
the fungus verv soon appeared again and 
destroved the Scale. 

In May iqo6 I introduced both the Red 
and Black fungus into the 300-acre or¬ 
chard of the Gainesville Orchard Com¬ 


pany, near Archer, which at the time was 
very badly infected with the Scale. The 
fungus spread very rapidly and within a 
few months the Scale were all dead, and 
the trees put on a nice fall growth of 
healthy wood. 

In June 1906 I introduced both the 
Red-head and the Black fungi into the 
500-acre orchard of the Griffing Florida 
Orchard Company at Komoko, with the 
same results and the fungus has held the 
Scale down completely ever since. 

During the summer of 1907 I visited 
nearly all the peach orchards in the State 
and I only found one orchard that was 
not affected with the San Jose Scale. I 
introduced the fungus in nearly all, with 
the same results, so far as I have learned. 

My experience has shown conclusively 
that the fungus is not only by far the 
cheapest, but also the most effective re¬ 
medy for both the San Jose Scale as well 
as the orange Scale. 

After obtaining the genuine fungus, of 
either variety, the application is very sim¬ 
ple. Just tie a small piece of wood con¬ 
taining the fungus, in about every tenth 
tree, and your work is done not only for 
one year but as long as you have an or¬ 
chard. One man can make the applica¬ 
tion on about twenty acres per day. 

I very seriously doubt if spraying is 
the best means of fighting any of the in¬ 
jurious insects of Florida. What we need 
to do is to find out through our Experi¬ 
ment Station what the natural enemy of 
these insect pests is and then use it to 
exterminate it. 

And here permit me to say that I do 
not believe we, as horticulturists, appre¬ 
ciate the work our own Experiment 
Station is doing for our fair State. They 
have redeemed the peach, plum and Ja¬

plete destruction from the San Jose Scale, 
and I feel sure that the orange industry 
will be saved thousands of dollars from 
the ravages of the orange Scale as soon 
as it is learned that these same fungi will 
eradicate the orange Scale. Besides, 
they will yet deliver us from the ravages 
of the white fly. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Hart—I want to again call at¬ 
tention to what I consider the most 
serious matter of all. It seems to have 
been slighted and has been mentioned 
only once or twice in an incidental way 
in this convention. That is, blight of 
the orange trees. I consider that is 
the most serious disease we have to 
contend with, and it should be given 
first attention. This disease is so bad 
and so hard a problem that it seems 
our professional men shy around it 
and do not want to say anything about 
it. We wall have to hold them to it. 
It is to them that we look for relief, 
and without doubt they must give it 
to us, if we get it. But, as orange 
growers, we must help them. 

Professors Weber and Swingle came 
down here from Washington because 
of the action of this Society, and if it 
had not been for the freeze I think 
they would have accomplished valua¬ 
ble results. This disease never attacks 
a tree until it is seven years old, or 
older, and it requires expert study for 
years to work out the necessary ex¬ 
periments to locate the cause of the 
trouble. Our professional men must 
work the problem out for us. We, as 
individuals, cannot afford to put the 
time and study into it that it requires. 
Now. can’t we take some action right 


here and now that will bring about 
more effective work on that line ? 
Our president has worked on it, but 
he had a whole lot of other work to 
do that took up his time, and although 
he put good study into it, we have not 
got the results we hoped to have. We 
must do all we can to get hold of this 
question of blight, and find out what 
the remedy is. If it is going to take 
twenty years, let's begin this year and 
that will cut off one of the twenty. 
The government is ready to help us 
on anything that we need help on, but 
we must ask for it; we must make it 
known to those having these matters 
in charge that we need help, and then 
we will get it. 

It is perfectly astounding to me that 
year after year goes by, each season 
we dig out some of our most valuable 
trees spoiling the symmetry of our 
groves, yet little effort is made to find 
a remedy. It-certainly does a great 
amount of damage. The best trees 
we have will show blight, and then 
they are gone. All you can do is to 
dig them up, leaving great open spaces 
in your groves, and plant anew. It 
knocks off a third of the value of the 
grove if you wish to sell. The buyer 
won’t pay within a third of the value. 
Now, we have here those who have 
suffered with blight and those who are 
bound to suffer sooner or later. It 
seems to me that we should make an 
effort to get good work started on the 
matter, and we should begin where 
Weber and Swingle left off. 

Mr. Mote—I am not suffering with 
it very much, but I am interested in 
the subject. If Mr. Hart will offer a 
suggestion, I think this whole body 
will take it up.

Mr. Hart—I have been offering sug¬ 
gestions, and have got the matter so 
far along that the Society has en¬ 
dorsed it, passed the resolution I have 
offered each year for several years in 
succession, and that is about all we 
have heard of it, except that Mr. 
Painter conferred with Secretary Wil¬ 
son at one time concerning it. The 
thing for us to do is to press the mat¬ 
ter as individuals. If our Secretary 
writes to the Secretary of Agriculture 
and that is all that is done, it will re¬ 
main just as it is. We must pass a 
resolution that means business, and 
then we want to get right after it and 
stir up those in authority and get the 
matter before them and keep it before 
them so that they will say as the 
Southern Express agent at Savannah 
said of a man who had paid express 
at both ends of the line. The man 
found out what was being done and 
that express charges had been col¬ 
lected from him and from the people 
to whom he had shipped oranges as 
presents, and he grew tired of it. He 
started in and made such a noise with 
no cessation that after awhile the Ex¬ 
press superintendent said to the agent 
at this man’s station, “For the Lord’s 
sake, do something to stop that d— 
man’s mouth.” If we can talk to them 
like that, maybe we can get them to 
think we are in earnest. 

Mr. Mote—I move that a committee 
of five be appointed, and that Mr. Hart 
be made chairman. 

Mr. Painter—If you will refer to the 
report of last year, you will see where 
I made a report of this matter. I did 
not trust the mails, but saw the Sec¬ 
retary of Agriculture in person and 
presented our resolution to him. 


About the first question he asked was, 
“What are you people doing?” He 
said, “We are willing to help you if 
you help yourselves along any of those 
lines. Just now, however, all the ap¬ 
propriation is used up and we cannot 
do anything at present.” His intima¬ 
tion was that they were willing to help 
us, but they were not going to do it 
all. 

Mr. Rose—I would suggest that it is 
necessary for the whole body as a body 
to move in this matter. The depart¬ 
ments will receive with courtesy a let¬ 
ter from the secretary, but it is nec¬ 
essary for us to act together. If you 
will remember a little while ago, there 
was considerable agitation about the 
white fly, particularly in the Second 
Congressional District. Our Congress¬ 
man was talked to by a large number 
of growers and the necessity of action 
being shown to him, he exercised him¬ 
self and got an appropriation and sent 
a white-fly man to the state. Now, 
in this instance here we have repre¬ 
sentatives in Congress who are anx¬ 
ious to represent the people, and it is 
the duty of every member of the So¬ 
ciety to correspond with his Congress¬ 
man and the Secretary of Agriculture. 
When it is known that a people re¬ 
presenting the orange industry of 
Florida require assistance in scientific 
work, when it comes up in the proper 
shape, it will be attended to. There is 
no doubt but that after this meeting is 
over, we will lose all interest; we de¬ 
pend on the secretary or upon a com¬ 
mittee for effort to be made, and the 
body as a body does not support the 
men who should be supported. The 
thing to do is to show that you want 
these things, make it clear to your 













Ill) 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Congressman, and he will help you 
to get them. 

Mr. Gaitskill—I would suggest that 
Mr. Hart get up a resolution to be 
passed by this meeting, and the secre¬ 
tary do as he has done—present it to 
the Secretary of Agriculture. At the 
same time, we, each and every one, get 
our friends and neighbors and all to 
write a letter to the Secretary of Agri¬ 
culture and to both Senators and to 
the Congressmen, asking them to see 
that this thing is attended to. By that 
means there may be something done. 
It is the constant dropping of water 
that wears away a stone. If you can’t 
write a letter, write a postal card, but 
let's do something. 

I move that Mr. Hart prepare a re¬ 
solution and present it to the meet¬ 
ing, we pass it and put the matter be¬ 
fore the Congressmen and the Secre¬ 
tary of Agriculture in the regular way. 
Then each and every member of the 
Horticultural Society, and not stop¬ 
ping with the members, but get all our 
friends who are interested in the mat¬ 
ter, to write to the Secretary of Agri¬ 
culture, to the Senators, to the Con¬ 
gressman from his district, and see 
that this resolution is acted upon. 

Mr. Hart—I don’t think that I could 
formulate any better resolution than 
that which has been passed repeatedly 
by this Association, and I think most 
of you remember what is in it. It 
states our needs and states the effect 
of the disease; it states the conditions 
that make it difficult to combat in¬ 
dividually and without the organized 
effort, and I think to just readopt it 
would be all that is necessary. I could 
not, on such short time, undertake to 
write anything near so good. 


I think, Mr. President, that Mr. 
Gaitskill’s motion is a good one, and 
I second it heartily, only I am afraid 
that if we merely pass the resolution 
nobody will do anything. I would sug¬ 
gest that we have a show of hands of 
those who will act in the matter. 

Prof. Rolfs—You have all heard the 
resolution, and those of you who are 
in favor of the motion, and who will 
write to the Congressmen and the Sen¬ 
ators as suggested, please rise to your 
feet. 

(Nearly every member responded 
by rising to his feet, thereby promis¬ 
ing to urge it on our representatives 
in person or a letter.) 

Mr. Hart—Now I am sure we will 
get something done. 

Mr. Gaitskill—I know that our Con¬ 
gressmen are glad to help us in any 
way ; and if they are not, we can do 
a lot to keep them from being sent 
back. 

The resolutions were adopted and are 
as follows : 

Whereas, The orange growers of 
Florida are annually suffering the loss of 
many thousands of dollars in the reduc¬ 
tion of their fruit crop and still more in 
the market value of their groves through 
a disease known as orange tree blight, 
which usually selects the largest and most 
productive trees for the attack; and 

Whereas, Though the disease has 
been carefully studied for many years by 
very ’able Department experts, it is not 
yet well enough known to allow of its 
positive identification, in many cases, be¬ 
fore the second or third year after its 
appearance, while investigations pretty 
surely prove that the disease is con¬ 
tagious, which makes each diseased tree

a nucleus from which it is carried to 
others when caring for or working the 
grove; and 

Whereas, Progress has been made 
that encourages the belief that if addi¬ 
tional help with special fitness can be sent 
here and allowed to devote their whole 
time assisting in this select work, we 
have reason to hope that the cause may 
be found for it; therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Secretary of this 
society be instructed to correspond with 


the Florida Representatives in Washing¬ 
ton and earnestly request them to call 
upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon. 
Wilson, and urge upon him the import¬ 
ance of this work and the pressing need 
that we feel for further assistance from 
his Department. Be it further 

Resolved, That each member of this 
society exert his or her influence as an 
individual to secure increased appropria¬ 
tion for this work and its more vigorous 
prosecution. 


Report of Committee on Fertilizers. 


By E. O. Painter. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The most expensive form of plant food 
that the horticulturist and farmers have 
to buy is ammonia. Therefore I deem a 
little information as to the different kinds 
and sources of ammonia would not be out 
of place with the members of the Florida 
State Horticultural Society. 

Ammoniates should be divided into 
three different classes: Chemical, Animal 
and Vegetable. The chemical sources are 
the most expensive per ton but as a rule 
are the cheapest per unit. Being soluble 
they are the quickest available and can 
be used to great advantage where quick 
crops are grown. 

CHEMICAL AMMONIATES. 

There are some chemical ammoniates 
that are high in plant food but are very 
seldom used as a source in fertilizer 
mainly on account of the small quantity 
produced. 

NITRATE AMMONIA. 

Nitrate ammonia contains the highest 
percentage of ammonia of any material 
that is offered as it contains on an av¬ 
erage of 38 per cent. This nitrate am¬ 
monia is a byproduct in the manufacture 
of high explosives and for years has been 
thrown away as the manufacturers were 
not appraised of the value of it as a plant 
food. Recently 40 tons of these goods 
were sold for $100.00 per ton. This ni¬ 
trate ammonia is made by mixing and 
neutralizing nitric acid of a high grade 


with a good grade of aqua ammonia in 
the same manner that sulphate ammonia 
is manufactured. It is very high because 
it not only contains ammonia from sul¬ 
phate but also the nitrate from nitric acid. 
As stated above this article has been a 
waste product for years but is now bring¬ 
ing the manufactures a clear $100.00 a 
ton. It would be an excellent form for 
the farmers to use if it was to be had in 
sufficient quantities, but as the whole 
amount made in the entire United States 
is probably less than 100 tons there is 
not very much danger of the market be¬ 
ing stocked with this article. 

SULPHATE OF AMMONIA. 

Sulphate of ammonia is another one 
of the valuable byproducts in the manu¬ 
facturing interest of our country. For¬ 
merly the ammonia from the gas works 
and coke ovens was all allowed to escape 
into the open air but now it is caught and 
combined with sulphuric acid producing 
sulphate of ammonia, for the benefit of 
the farmer and mankind generally. In 
making gas, the coal undergoes a process 
of destructive distillation in the closed 
retort or oven. This liberates the am¬ 
monia which passes away with the gas 
and is absorbed by water through the 
scrubbing or cooling process. The liquid 
containing the ammonia is heated and the 
ammonia liberated by lime water which is 
led through a bath of sulphuric acid 
through a bath of sulphuric acid where 
where the ammonia combines with the

acid forming the white crystals, known 
as sulphate of ammonia. The crystals 
are then taken out and by means of cen¬ 
trifugal forces are dried and are then 
ready for the market. 

While a large amount of sulphate of 
ammonia is made from coal in the pro¬ 
cess of making coke there is a large quan¬ 
tity made from bone while making bone 
charcoal. The process is practically the 
same as when it is made from coke. 
The difference being that the bone is 
used in the retorts instead of the coal. 
After the bone is treated in this way it 
is used in the sugar refineries for puri¬ 
fying sugar. 

NITRATE OF POTASH. 

Nitrate of potash is another very high 
grade chemical and has the advantage 
of not only containing a large percent¬ 
age of ammonia but is very high in pot¬ 
ash and this makes it doubly beneficial to 
the grower. Nitrate of potash which is 
usually called salt peter is found in In¬ 
dia, Egypt, Persia and Spain where it 
frequently appears as a white incrusta¬ 
tion on the soil and is sometimes mixed 
with the soil to some depth. To extract 
the nitrate the earth is leached with water 
and the solution evaporated either by the 
sun or artificial heat. This develops the 
impure crystals which are exported as 
impure salt-petre. Nitrate of potash is 
formed wherever nitrogenized organic 
substances decompose in the presence of 
potassium hydrate. It is also manufac¬ 
tured artificially by exposing to the air 
a mixture of animal matter with wood 
ashes and lime moistened with stable 
drainings or stale urine. 

The greater part of the nitrate of pot¬ 
ash, however, is made from nitrate of 
soda. The recrystallized nitrate of soda 
is dissolved in water and an equivalent 


quantity of potassium chloride, is added 
to the mixture and the solution boiled 
down. While the water is hot the chlo¬ 
ride of sodium is deposited and separated 
from the nitrate of potash which crystal¬ 
lizes while cooling. 

Any one who has ever seen nitrate of 
potash can recognize it at once by the pe¬ 
culiar form in which it crystallizes. It 
forms into long six-sided prisms and 
when freed from impurities is nearly 
transparent and has a cool and slightly 
bitter taste. Nitrate of Potash is very 
soluble in water, the solvent power of 
water increasing as its temperature rises. 
While ioo parts of water at zero dis¬ 
solves only 13.33 parts, at 100 degrees it 
dissolves 246 parts. 

Nitrate of potash is used for a good 
many other things besides fertilizers. It 
is used in the manufacture of gunpowder, 
matches and as a preservative for meats. 
The pure nitrate of potash contains 13.87 
per cent, nitrogen which is equivalent to 
16.84 per cent, ammonia and 45.31 per 
cent, potash as K2O. 

Until within the last ten years all the 
nitrate of potash used in the United 
States was imported. It is however, 
manufactured in the United States now 
in limited quantities by the sheep dip 
manufacturers. It comes to them as a 
byproduct in the process of extracting the 
nicotine from the tobacco stems. For 
years the nitrate of potash would settle 
in the cans of sheep dip and became a 
source of' annoyance until a process for 
eliminating it was discovered. At first 
this deposit was considered to be a use¬ 
less product and a large quantity of it 
was offered to the writer at a very nom¬ 
inal price, which was quicklv accepted, 
but he was unable to renew the contract 
two years later when the true nature of 
the goods was known to the manufactur-

ers. Nitrate of potash manufactured 
from tobacco stems does not usually an¬ 
alyze as high as the imported article on 
account of the impurities in the shape of 
fine particles of tobacco that accompanies 
it. It could be made as pure as the im¬ 
ported goods by filtering and recrystalliz¬ 
ing but the increased price would not 
warrant the increased expense. The to¬ 
bacco contained in the nitrate of potash 
is not detrimental as a fertilizer conse¬ 
quently the manufacturers have no 
trouble in selling their entire output at 
a good price without going to the trouble 
of recrystallization. 

NITRATE OF SODA. 

Nitrate of soda is more largely used 
than any other form of commercial am- 
moniates because of the large quantity 
obtainable and the fact that the Chilian 
government several years ago instituted 
a nitrate of soda propaganda which has 
spread over the United States by adver¬ 
tising and otherwise, information in re¬ 
gard to the use of same. 

All the nitrate of soda used in fertiliz¬ 
ers and the arts comes from Chile al¬ 
though it has been reported at various 
times that nitrate has been found in other 
parts of the world. On the high elevated 
plateaus of Chile the nitrate of soda is 
found in beds varying from a few feet 
deep to 25 or 30 feet mixed with earth 
and other foreign material. The mining 
is a simple process of blasting the earth 
and sorting it out and hauling to the mills 
where it is run through the crusher and 
dissolved with boiling water in tanks. 
When the material reaches the desired 
temperature it is run off into huge vats 
where it crystallizes. It is then taken up 
from the evaporating pans and stored in 
immense piles where it is ready for sack¬ 


ing and shipment abroad. The nitrate of 
soda is left out uncovered and no ware¬ 
houses are built for its keeping. There 
is no fear from loss on account of rains 
or dews as it has never been known to 
rain on the plateaus and they are not 
troubled with dews. If the case had been 
the reverse Chile would not be giving us 
this valuable plant food because the rains 
would have dissolved it and carried it 
down and out to the sea. 

The use of nitrate of soda is increasing 
wonderfully and will continue to increase 
more and more as the people become fa¬ 
miliar with its value. In 1844 there was 
14,646 tons of nitrate of soda shipped 
from Chile and in the year 1903 there 
was 1,384,349 tons, the average increase 
being about 50,000 tons a year. 

There are two grades of nitrate of 
soda imported to the United States, one 
called the 95 per cent, goods and the 
other 96 per cent. The former is used 
more exclusively by the fertilizer trade 
while the latter is used in the arts and the 
manufacture of sulphuric acid. 

ANIMAL AMMONIATES. 

It was only a few years ago when the 
present forms of animal ammoniates were 
a waste product and it was a burden on 
the producer to get rid of same. Now it 
is a source of revenue that is adding not 
only wealth to the producer but aiding 
the farmer to add to his wealth. 

DRIED BLOOD. 

It is hardly necessary for me to go 
over the different stages that lead up to 
the separating and manufacture of dried 
blood, tankage, blood and bone, etc. 
The enormous amount of blood that 
comes from the slaughtered animals is 
now saved and is used as a source of 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


115 


ammonia in almost every section where 
fertilizer is used. The blood is run 
through presses which extract a large 
amount of the moisture and the residue 
is put through a drier and screened. The 
value of the blood depends on how care¬ 
fully the separation of other materials 
is made in the slaughter houses. Dried 
blood frequently analyzes as high as 17.75 
per cent, ammonia and it’s not unfre- 
quently as low as 14 per cent. Dried blood 
is one'of the best sources of animal am- 
moniates and is considered by chemists 
and agriculturists to be first on the list 
of value as an animal ammoniate. 

BLOOD AND BONE. 

The name blood and bone is familiar 
to the users of fertilizers but to the man¬ 
ufacturers and trade the name is tankage. 
All blood and bone is tankage but all 
tankage is not blood and bone. In the 
slaughter houses every scrap of meat, 
bone and blood that cannot be used for 
some other purpose is gathered together 
and put into a large tank and cooked. 
The cooking process is continued for 
some time or until all the matter is so 
broken up that the grease will float on 
top. The grease is then drawn off and 
the residue dumped into large hydraulic 
presses and the water squeezed out and 
the remaining material run through a 
drier, ground and screened. Then we 
have tankage or blood and bone. 

The value of the blood and bone de¬ 
pends of course on what goes into the 
tank. The more bone that goes into it 
the higher in phosphoric acid and the 
lower in ammonia and vice versa. The 
many uses to which bones can be put out¬ 
side of the use for fertilizer has made & 
valuable market for same consequently 
but a small proportion of the bone pro¬ 
duced at the slaughter houses goes into 


the fertilizer and the tankage now pro¬ 
duced usually runs high in ammonia and 
low phosphoric acid. The rnost popular 
kind on the market now is what is known 
as 10 and 10 tankage, that is 10 per cent, 
ammonia and 10 per cent bone phosphate 
of lime. 

The small slaughter houses, however, 
do not as a rule produce as high grade 
tankage because they do not have ma¬ 
terials enough to warrant close separa¬ 
tion, consequently their tankage contains 
more bone and less ammonia, usually 
running 6 to 61-2 per cent, ammonia and 
25 to 30 per cent, bone phosphate of 
lime. 

When the slaughter house managers 
found an outlet for their waste material 
they thought their troubles were at an 
end, but the enormous amount of water 
that was pressed out of the tankage found 
its way into the city sewers and polluted 
the streams, which soon called for a 
change. This was brought about bv put¬ 
ting in large evaporators and evaporating 
the water that comes from the presses. 
When this water is evaporated it leaves 
a thick substance in the pans which is al¬ 
most equal to dried blood in its value as 
an ammoniate. It has a very objection¬ 
able quality, however in not being “con¬ 
sistent.” It will not remain in a me¬ 
chanical condition any length of time 
after it is made up, without the addition 
of foreign material. From its stick na¬ 
ture and tendency to dissolve and become 
solid it has been called “Stick” or con¬ 
centrated tankage. In recent years, how¬ 
ever, methods have been discovered for 
handling this concentrated tankage so it 
is added to the other tankage and remains 
in a good mechanical condition and makes 
in every way a very desirable source of 
animal ammoniate.

STEAMED BONE. 

Notwithstanding every piece of bone 
in the animal that is large enough for 
buttons or knife handles is used for that 
purpose there is a large accumulation of 
knuckle bones and bones from the head 
that are put into tanks and thoroughly 
cooked to extract the grease and glue. 
This cooking not only puts the bone in 
a better condition for grinding but it 
also adds to its value as a fertilizer. The 
value of steamed bone depends entirely 
on how the material is graded when it 
goes into the tank. The average steamed 
bone will analyze 3 per cent, ammonia 
and 45 to 50 per cent bone phosphate of 
lime. Where the bone is carefully sep¬ 
arated the analysis will average 1 to 1 1-2 
per cent, ammonia and 60 per cent, bone 
phosphate of lime. The latter is usually 
termed degelatinized steamed bone. 

RAW BONE. 

The demand for bones by the farmers 
has caused the ends of the earth to be 
searched for this article. For years the 
plains of the West gave up carloads after 
carloads of buffalo bones. South Amer¬ 
ica and India have also been the source 
of large quantities of bones. These 
fields however, have been pretty thor¬ 
oughly gone over so that the supply of 
bones from that source in the future 
promises to be very small indeed. At 
present the raw bone that is on the mar¬ 
ket is made from bones gathered from 
the small butcher shops and slaughter 
pens scattered over the country. A car¬ 
load here and a carload there, not very 
much at any one place but all together 
making a considerable quantity. 

While the raw bone analyzes higher 
in ammonia than the steamed bone it is 
not considered as valuable owing to the 
fact that the grease and glue is still in 


the bone. The grease retards decompo¬ 
sition consequently delays the -time when 
the plant food will become available. For 
crops that are a long time growing or 
for fertilizing orchards the raw bone is 
not only a good source of ammonia but 
also of phosphoric acid. On crops that 
are grown in 60 or 90 days raw bone 
would be of very little use as a fertilizer. 

GARBAGE TANKAGE. 

The demand for fertilizer of all kinds 
and the continued increased prices of 
same has caused the manufacturer, chem¬ 
ist and any one interested to be on the 
alert for some material which would fur¬ 
nish plant food. 

One of the articles that comes in this 
line is garbage tankage. For years the 
garbage of the large cities has been gath¬ 
ered and dumped into waste places, the 
sea or burned. Now nearly all the up-to- 
date cities have large garbage plants 
where all the garbage of the city is gath¬ 
ered together; The tin cans, glass, china- 
ware, rags, etc., are all separated from 
the kitchen garbage. This latter is put 
into large tanks along with any dead an¬ 
imals, spoiled fish and meat and cooked in 
the same manner as the blood and bone 
in the slaughter houses. The grease is 
skimmed off and the residue pressed and 
dried and we have what is known as gar¬ 
bage tankage. This tankage is usually 
low in plant food containing 3 to 4 per 
cent ammonia and 5 to 6 per cent bone 
phosphate of lime and about 1 per cent, 
potash. The farmers who live close to 
the city have an opportunity to get their 
source of ammonia cheap, as the price the 
tankage is sold at is usually below the 
market price of ammoniates of higher 
grade. It is also a cheap source of am¬ 
monia where freight rates are not high. 
Whenever the goods are shipped any dis- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


117 


tance the freight rate makes the cost per 
unit run up so the goods cannot be used 
to advantage very far from the garbage 
plants, 

FISH SCRAP. 

Fish has been used as a fertilizer long 
before any other material. The New 
England Indians were the first to discover 
the value of fish as a source of fertilizer. 
They buried a fish .at the base of a hill of 
corn with the idea that the spirit of the 
fish would enter the corn stalk and en¬ 
courage it to produce a larger yield. They 
were satisfied of this fact because they 
knew that a hill of corn under which re¬ 
posed a good-sized fish gave a more 
abundant yield than when no fish was put 
there. 

The fish scrap produced now is quite 
a different article from what it was ten 
years ago. The old method of handling 
the fish was so crude and the stench so 
great that the factory was almost un¬ 
bearable to all except those constantly 
working in it. Their methods were 
crude and the fish was usually dried by 
the sun after coming from the kettle. It 
frequently happened that before the fish 
was thoroughly dried a rain would come 
and wet it and the flies would blow it 
and it would become a putrified mass. 
When this class of material was finally 
dried and sacked it is no wonder that 
the odor was not only penetrating but 
very objectionable to anyone. Under 
the present method for quick handling of 
the fish and the quick process of drying 
it, it is delivered in perfect shape with¬ 
out an objectionable odor, no more ob¬ 
jectionable than the smell of dried her¬ 
ring. 

Fish scrap is a byproduct in the manu¬ 
facture of Manhattan and fish oil. The 
oil is the finest article sought after but 


the scrap has proven to be of such value 
as a fertilizer that the revenue from same 
goes a long ways towards keeping the 
balance on the right side of the ledger. 

Fish scrap produced at the present time 
very seldom analyzes below 9 per cent, 
ammonia and frequently as high as 12 
per cent. So great has been the demand 
for fish scrap that whale meat from the 
whaleries has been saved and made into 
whale tankerage or whale meat, which 
like fish makes a splendid source of am¬ 
monia for general farm crops, especially 
where it can be applied and worked into 
the ground. Anyone who has once be¬ 
come acquainted with the odor of fish 
scrap or whale meat tankerage can read¬ 
ily detect it, not only when they are us¬ 
ing it themselves but when their neigh¬ 
bors are using it some distance away. 

, HOOF AND HORN 1 MEAL. 

Hoof and horn meal has been used for 
a long time as a source of ammonia and 
yields in the neighborhood of 18 per cent. 
If the ammonia were quickly available, 
this w r ould be an excellent source, but un¬ 
fortunately it takes some time for hoof 
meal to decompose and give up its am¬ 
monia. The hoofs and horns of the 
slaughter houses, after being steamed and 
ironed out and the better parts cut out 
and saved for the manufacture of “tor- 
toise-shelU combs, the balance is ground 
and sold as hoof meal. It is sometimes 
mixed with blood and bone to bring up 
the percentage of ammonia. For long- 
feeding crops, or for use on moist land, 
the hoof meal is an excellent source of 
ammonia. It decomposes slowly and 
there is no danger of its being leached out 
by moisture, consequently it can be used 
on land where nitrate of soda or sulphate 
of ammonia would be a loss. On the 
other hand, if it were applied on quick 




118

growing crops or on soil that was dry 
and inclined to be thirsty, very little good 
would be derived from its use. 

LEATHER SCRAP. 

There is always some one on the look¬ 
out for something that they can put on 
the market at a less price than the market 
is paying and still give them a good profit. 
It has been known for a good many years 
that leather contained a considerable 
quantity of ammonia and it was also 
known that a piece of leather will re¬ 
main in the ground for years and the 
plant would be no better for its being 
there as the ammonia \vas irert. The 
demand for ammoniates has caused a 
number of experiments with leather to 
be made and different methods have been 
used to put it into marketable shape. This 
has been effectually done during the last 
few years. The leather is scorched and 
pulverized and treated in different ways 
so from the appearance you would never 
recognize it as once being leather. The 
nostril is the only means of detecting it. 
Notwithstanding all the treatment you 
give it it still holds the leather odor. In 
some states it is against the law for 
fertilizer manufacturers to use leather 
scrap as a source of ammonia in their 
goods and it is well that it is so. A man¬ 
ufacturer who uses leather scrap can 
guarantee a given analysis and the chem¬ 
ist will bear him out in the guarantee by 
showing the fertilizer to contain that 
amount but the plant would be unable to 
assimilate any very large portion of the 
ammonia. As ammonia in leather scrap 
is sold considerably below the market of 
other ammoniates it is very easy to un¬ 
derstand why a brand of fertilizer can be 
cheaper than another and yet have the 
same analysis. While an analysis is a 
good method of recognizing the value of 
a fertilizer the true value is the ability 


of the plant to utilize or assimilate it un¬ 
der climatic and soil conditions in which 
it is used, io per cent, ammonia from 
leather scrap would not give the grower 
of lettuce and cabbage one-half the ser¬ 
vice that 5 per cent, from nitrate of soda 
or dried blood would. 

GUANO. 

One of the first fertilizers used to any 
extent in this country in a commercial 
way was Peruvian guano which was im¬ 
ported from Peru. The first deposits that 
were discovered had been hundreds of 
years in accumulating and were thor¬ 
oughly rotted, frequently analyzing as 
high as 12 per cent, ammonia. When 
this grade of guano was used on the gar¬ 
den the results were wonderful as the 
ammonia, owing to the long time the de¬ 
posits had been there was in an available 
form. The demand for Peruvian guano 
soon exhausted the supply of the higher 
grade goods. -It is now very seldom that 
we find guano analyzing io per cent, am¬ 
monia on the market. There are guanos 
offered that analyze from 2 to 8 per cent, 
ammonia, from 8 to 18 per cent, phos¬ 
phoric acid and from i to 2 per cent, 
potash. 

At different times we hear considerable 
about bat guano that has been discovered 
in caves on different islands. This guano 
when it is in caves that are perfectly dry 
is a very valuable article often analyzing 
as high as 17 per cent, ammonia, but 
there are very few caves of this kind, in¬ 
deed nearly all of them, contain more or 
less moisture. When the guano becomes 
wet with lime water the chemical action 
is to free the ammonia, consequently it is 
of very little value. Those buying bat 
guano should only buy it on a guaranteed 
analysis as one ton may be worth $40 
while another would be dear at $5.

VEGETABLE AMMONIATES. 

COTTON SEED MEAL. 

Among the most valuable of the veg¬ 
etable ammoniates is cotton seed meal. 
This like other fertilizer products for 
years was a waste product but now is a 
source of much profit not only to the oil 
mills but to the farmers themselves. The 
process of making the cotton seed meal is 
a very simple one. The seeds are 
crushed and passed into a hot tank or re¬ 
ceptacle and heated and from there k 
goes into a hydraulic press where the oil 
is pressed out and the cotton seed cake 
is the result. This cake is then ground 
and we have cotton seed meal. 

The value of the meal depends on how 
much lint is ground in with the meal and 
also on the general condition of the seed 
when they were ground. Bright cotton 
seed meal will average 8 per cent, am¬ 
monia when properly made but the in¬ 
creased price of meal of all kinds has been 
a great temptation to the mill people to 
increase their tonnage by increasing the 
amount of hull or lint in the meal. This 
reduces the percentage of ammonia and 
where the meal should analyze 8 per cent, 
it frequently goes as low as 6 1-2 and 7 
per cent. During the last few years the 
demand for meal has increased and the 
price advanced so the mills are not very 
particular about making 8 per cent, goods 
and are satisfied with 71-2 per cent. 

The bright meal is made from the 
short staple cotton while the dark meal is 
made from the long staple and does not 
contain as much ammonia at any time 
as the bright meal owing to the hull being 
much harder and forming a larger pro¬ 
portion of the hull. The analysis of the 
dark meal is from 5 to 6 per cent, am¬ 
monia. The dark meal is as good as the 
bright for fertilizing purposes unit for 
unit. 


CASTOR POMACE. 

Castor Pomace is now very largely 
sold as an ammoniate and is made in a 
similar way to cotton seed meal, that is 
the castor beans are ground and the oil 
pressed out and the cake pulverized. The 
analysis of castor pomace varies from 5 
1-2 to 6 1-2 per cent, ammonia with a 
small percentage of phosphoric acid and 
potash. It is considered a valuable source 
of plant food where crops are long feed¬ 
ers. This is especially the case in rais¬ 
ing pineapples. 

TOBACCO STEMS. 

In former years tobacco stems were 
used more largely as a fertilizer than 
now. Formerly they could be purchased 
at $2.00 per ton in bulk at the stemenes 
and now their value is placed at from 
$16.00 to $20.00 according to the kind 
of tobacco. The nicotine extract has be¬ 
come so valuable that the manufacturers 
can afford to pay a much higher price 
for the stems than the farmer. They are 
considered a very good source of fer¬ 
tilizer where the price will warrant their 
use. 

TOBACCO DUST. 

In the manufacture of all kinds of to¬ 
bacco there is more or less dust which 
heretofore has been thrown away but is 
now carefully saved and sold to the grow¬ 
ers. Besides containing ammonia and 
potash it is also used as an insecticide 
and is considered of considerable value 
for that purpose. The ammonia, how¬ 
ever, of the average tobacco dust does 
not exceed 4 per cent, and frequently is. 
not over 1 1-2 to 2 per cent. 

GROUND TOBACCO STEMS. 

The sheep-dip manufacturers had an 
accumulation of soaked tobacco stems on 


120 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


their hands which were very hard to get 
rid of and learned men were put to work 
to devise a means by which the nicotine 
could be extracted and the remaining 
stem handled without loss to the com¬ 
pany. This work resulted in the pulver¬ 
ized or ground tobacco stems that is now 
on the market which is very high in pot¬ 
ash and contains a good percentage of 
ammonia. This was somewhat of a sur¬ 
prise to everyone as no one supposed that 
the tobacco stem could be so manipulated 
as to give an analysis of 3 per cent, am¬ 
monia and 10 per cent, potash, yet this is, 
a fact and today hundreds of tons of 
ground tobacco stems are used and it is 
considered one of the best sources of am¬ 
monia and potash. It is easily applied 
and quickly available. 

Besides the information gathered above 
we should take a lesson from what has 
been said, not only from a fertilizer view, 
but from an economical standpoint. There 
are only a few of the products mentioned 
above that are not byproducts. The great 
wealth of the fertilizer business is from 
byproducts or things we are now saving 
that were formerly thrown away. If one 
goes to the slaughter house he cannot 
help being impressed with the carefulness 
with which everything is saved even to 
the minutest piece of bone, drop of blood 
and even the hairs. Everything is pre¬ 
served to add to the profits of the com¬ 
pany. If our growers and farmers were 
as careful in preserving everything on 
the farm as the slaughter house people 


are to save and care for the waste pro¬ 
ducts, they would be able to live closer 
at home and not have to ask the fertilizer 
men for credit for his yearly supply of 
fertilizers. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Kilgore—I would like to know 
if there is not a commercial value on 
our muck beds on account of the am¬ 
monia there is in muck. It seems to 
me there should be plenty of by-pro¬ 
ducts to render the investigation of 
this phase of the question profitable. 

Mr. Painter—The problem has been 
looked into, but the trouble is that 
there is no main product that can be 
derived from the muck that would 
make the by-product profitable. There 
is about 3 per cent, ammonia in a ton 
of muck when it is thoroughly dried, 
but that ammonia is inert; almost as 
much so as in the leather. 

We are getting sulphate of ammonia 
in a ton of coal varying from one to 
one and one-half per cent. I do not 
from coal. The amount of ammonia 
think we can ever get any ammonia 
from the muck except to use it on the 
farm and let the ammonia be freed by 
decomposition. Lime applied to the 
muck will hasten that decomposition. 

Adjourned.

SOME PROBLEMS OF FERTILIZING. 


By E. S. Hubbard. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In presenting this individual report as 
a member of the standing committee on 
fertilizers I shall depart from the ques¬ 
tion of fertilizers as mixtures to their ef¬ 
fects in fertilizing. 

The A. B. C. of fertilizers is well un¬ 
derstood by all intelligent horticulturists. 
The nature of the various materials, their 
percentages and the proportions neces¬ 
sary for complete or special fertilizers 
have been fairly well worked out in prac¬ 
tice but our knowledge of the physiolog¬ 
ical effects and defects of their action 
on plant life is in its infancy and I wish 
to suggest a few of the problems that 
have occurred to me on which exact sci¬ 
entific knowledge would be of great value. 

The primary elements of plant growth 
are nitric ancl phosphoric acids. Nitric 
acid to nourish and stimulate the - life 
principle and phosphoric acid to act as 
a clarifying and transferring medium in 
the interconversion of carbon dioxide 
into fluid gums and sugars to the fixed 
forms of starches and dellular tissue. 

These acids, however, are corrosive 
and unstable. They can only be assim¬ 
ilated as acids in a high state of dilution 
in small quantities. They must be neu¬ 
tralized by combination with alkaline 
bases when they are gradually dissolved 
or absorbed by the plant rootlets. 

They are most healthfully assimilated 
as nitrate of potash and phosphate of 
lime. This is the ideal condition of plant 
fertilization. The other salts found in 
plants are either accidental or of small 
tonic value. Unfortunately, however, 


our soil conditions are hardly ever ideal 
and we have to use many commercial 
materials that must undergo chemical 
changes either by bacterial nitrification 
in the case of ammoniacal compounds or 
of decay and disintegration in the case 
of phosphates before they can be most 
healthfully assimilated by • plants and 
there are several commercial chemical 
salts one element of which is unnecessary 
or detrimental. 

In a state of nature the equation of 
plant nutrition is self-regulating. Given 
a soil with sufficient mineral bases, moist¬ 
ure and drainage, all the plant waste and 
decay remains as humus to hold the ni¬ 
trogen and other food elements and the 
soil increases in fertility till limitations 
of room, light and air define the amount 
of vegetation that can flourish. 

In agriculture and horticulture all this 
is changed. Plants chiefly foreign to the 
soil and climate are grown and the mar¬ 
ketable products are removed, thus car¬ 
rying away the stored-up fertility of the 
soil, while the remaining fertility is often 
still further dissipated in the air and 
drainage by improper exposure and cul¬ 
ture. 

Here man, to continue growing crops, 
steps in with artificial fertilizers com¬ 
posed largely of unassimilable, unneces¬ 
sary and even detrimental materials and 
often applies them far in excess of the 
plant’s needs or requirements. 

The commercial results are then meas¬ 
ured by the endurance or tolerance of the 
plants. 

I consider this the great unwritten 




122 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


chapter of the agricultural chemistry of 
the future, for which only scattered and 
unharmonized data have been gathered, 
the tolerance of plants for unsuitable 
fertilizers. 

To illustrate: Some twenty-five years 
ago when I first began orange culture 
on my own account, when the spring 
growth was pretty well matured, some 
time in April, I dumped about four quarts 
of brine from a mackerel kit near the 
trunk of an orange tree that could carry 
a box of oranges, as an experiment, to 
see what effect it would have as a fer¬ 
tilizer. 

In a week's time all the leaves had 
dropped from that tree and most of the 
new growth was dying. It was two 
months before the tree had got back half 
its foliage again and the effect was as 
bad as a severe freeze. This was a most 
striking example of the tolerance of an 
orange tree for chlorine and soda. I say 
chlorine and soda because it is a well 
known chemical fact that there are points 
of saturation in common salt solutions 
in which the chlorine and soda are in 
very loose combination and there might 
be some separation in the sap of a tree. 

Some people have an idea that plant 
rootlets have considerable power of se¬ 
lection of the solutions with which they 
come in contact and take only what they 
need or is beneficial. This experiment 
convinced me plants have to take what¬ 
ever is offered them in the soil water 
and that plants with green foliage or in 
a growing condition are continually sus¬ 
ceptible to sap poisoning. 

In the case of the orange tree and the 
brine it is evident that as the brine as¬ 
cended in the sap to the leaves and was 
evaporated from them a point of satura¬ 
tion or crystalization was reached that 


killed the life principles of the sap and 
the leaves dropped off. 

In this most simple case a chemical 
analysis of the leaves for salt and a com¬ 
putation of the total foliage on the tree 
would have determined the extreme tol¬ 
erance of a tree of that size for chloride 
of sodium. After the leaves were all 
fallen there still remained the salt solu¬ 
tion in the twigs, branches, trunk and 
roots. As the fresh growth of twigs had 
an evaporation function partly as great 
as the leaves the solution was strong 
enough to kill most of them also. 

The solution in the branches, trunk 
and roots being weakest of all had proba¬ 
bly to be mostly excreted by the roots 
and the solution in the soil leached out 
at one-half the cost of imported nitrate 
by rains before the tree could grow again. 
This brings us to the root excretions of 
plants. 

Root excretions of plants have long 
been recognized-but so far as I know no 
exhaustive experiments have been con¬ 
ducted to determine their character and 
effects. It is well known that many 
crops cannot be grown successively on 
the same ground without losing so much 
vigor as to be unprofitable or suffering 
from disease. 

In my opinion the study of diseases has 
drawn attention away from the specific 
salts and humic acids these plants may 
leave in the soil that are poisonous to 
succeeding crops of the same variety. 

There is also, of course, the natural 
acidity of some soils that is detrimental 
to many crops unless corrected with lime 
and it may be lime would be a good ap¬ 
plication for root excretions. Lime has 
succeeded in some cases where tomatoes 
grown successively nave been affected 
with blight. Tomatoes will not do well 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


123 


on very acid soils and lime is not a cure 
for blight. An acid soil is not very de¬ 
trimental to Irish potatoes, and stable 
manure or lime favors scab, of Irish po¬ 
tatoes in Florida grown successive 
winters seems to> fall off even with inter¬ 
mediate summer crops. 

There are a great many questions in 
plant nutrition that ought to be settled 
and as to which we can only conjecture. 

Rev. Lyman Phelps discovered that 
an excess application of sulphate of am¬ 
monia in summer or a spray of bi-sul- 
phate of soda prematurely sweetened or¬ 
anges. Winogradsky of Zurich, the dis¬ 
coverer of nitrifying bacteria, found that 
liquid grown plants would healthfully 
assimilate considerable sulphate of am¬ 
monia. The ammonia of sulphate of am¬ 
monia takes the place of an alkaline sait 
like lime or potash combining with the 
sulphuric acid. 

What becomes of the sulphur? When 
sulphate of ammonia solution is ab¬ 
sorbed by orange trees? Small percent¬ 
ages of sulphur are found in the nitro¬ 
genous protoplasm of the sap of the 
plants. 

Reasoning from analogy, is it not pro¬ 
bable enough sulphuric is freed to have 
a similar effect in sweetening oranges to 
sulphuric acid in the manufacture of glu¬ 
cose or grape sugar from starch? 

There must be considerable sulphuric 
acid excreted by the roots. Is a small 
yearly application of lime to orange trees 
indicated to neutralize the unstable sul¬ 
phur acid compounds if they exist? 

I found premature sweetening of or¬ 
anges with sulphate of ammonia depress¬ 
ing to the trees. 

Nitrate of Soda.—In an Irish potato 
fertilizer experiment years ago on the plot 
using nitrate of soda alone, 4 the foliage 


had a sickly, gray color and the tubers 
a soapy taste. A recent German experi¬ 
ment shows that grains and grass largely 
absorb the soda of nitrate of soda, but 
Irish potatoes, beets, etc., excrete it from 
the roots, leaving soda in the soil. 

Organic Nitrogen.—The albumens of 
organic nitrogen compounds in decay split 
up into poisons similar in chemical com¬ 
position to strychnine and morphine and 
decompose still further to ammonia. The 
soil must not be too acid and nitrifying 
bacteria must be present under favorable 
conditions of tillage, moisture and alka¬ 
line bases to secure nitrification. Who 
has not had plant roots burned by organic 
ammonia ? 

Die-back and foot-rot of the orange 
tree are often traced to the use of or¬ 
ganic nitrogen and there is no doubt in 
my mind that the trees absorb so much 
of these decomposition poisons that the 
sap is wholly or partially paralyzed, the 
sugar, starch and wood forming func¬ 
tions deranged and similar symptoms ex¬ 
hibited to animal blood poisoning. 

Phosphoric Acid.—Experiments have 
shown that a small percentage of the 
phosphoric acid needed by plants can be 
absorbed in its water soluble state. A. 
full ration of soluble phosphoric acid in 
pineapple culture on the East Coast 
spruce pine ridges is corrosive and 
poisonous. There is little lime or humus 
in these soils to revert or hold the acid 
for root acid action. On the other hand, 
I consider the partial sterility of bog ore 
iron hard pan soils due next after their 
acidity to the immediate iron basis re¬ 
version of the soluble phosphoric acid of 
fertilizers, so that quick-growing plants 
cannot get phosphoric acid fast enough 
to harden and perfect their growth. 

Potash.—Potash, besides forming a 



124 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


base for nitric acid before entering the 
plant also forms a base for the plant’s 
organic acids after being separated by 
the sap from the nitric acid and is carried 
along till it finally forms part of the 
plant's tissues. Impure nitrate of potash 
can be bought as fertilizer, but the sup¬ 
ply is limited. It leaches so rapidly as 
to be desirable only for fractional appli¬ 
cations. 

Nitrate of potash can be formed by 
mixing heated solutions of nitrate of soda 
and muriate of potash and recrystallizing 
the resulting nitrate of potash and 
chloride of sodium. It would be a boon 
to horticulture if this could be done with 
little increase in cost. We need informa¬ 
tion as to the effects of the sulphuric 
acid and chlorine of sulphate and muriate 
of potash both before and after nitrifica¬ 
tion. 

The cheap nitrate of the future prom¬ 
ises to be the electrolytic nitrate of lime. It 


is said a 20,000 horse water power will 
soon be used for this purpose in Sweden, 
and that nitrate of lime can be produced 
of soda. Experiments on the efficiency 
of these new lime nitrogens are being con¬ 
ducted in Germany with results averag¬ 
ing about the same as nitrate of soda and 
sulphate of ammonia. There is no doubt 
moderate quantities of nitrate of lime can 
be healthfully appropriated by most 
plants and that its use will open up new 
problems in plant nutrition. 

In this paper I have touched on only 
a few of the more prominent problems 
of fertilizing but enough I trust to stim¬ 
ulate thought on this subject. There is 
no doubt in my mind that we are entering 
an era of soil and fertilizer specialization 
in plant growing that in thoroughness 
will compare favorably with the intricate 
manufacturing processes of the industrial 
arts. 


By B. M. Hampton. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

For some reason unknown to me I have 
been asked to contribute a paper on “Fer¬ 
tilizers" to be read before this meeting. 
Now, I can assure you I would very much 
rather have sat still and listened to the 
other fellow, and let him have written 
this up. You have, or a good many have, 
had a trial at this fertilizer business; and 
while it is something that is vital to every 
farmer, truck grower, and especially so 
to those who make a specialty of Citrus 
culture that I am loath to attempt to write 
on a subject that is of such vast import¬ 
ance to one and all. 

But, after all, perhaps I am not ex¬ 
pected to tell what I know, or rather what 
T might think I know about fertilizing, 


and was perhaps expected to write about 
what I didn’t know; but that would be 
a still greater task, so I will strike a hap¬ 
py medium between what I don’t know 
and what is just possible I might know, 
and what those have known before me. 

There is one point I think you will all 
agree with me on, and that is, it is one 
of the most vital questions of the day, 
and one that after all the centuries that 
have rolled away since man became 
a tiller of the soil, the least understood; 
still we are gaining ground a little, a ray 
of light here and one there, in time it 
will become of much more of an exact 
science than it is today. It seems strange 
when we come to think of it that so little 
was known by the first settlers of this

country of the importance of fertilizer, 
even of the three main ingredients, Ni¬ 
trogen, Phosphoric Acid and Potash; 
these three ingredients did not seem to 
be understood at all by our Pilgrim 
Fathers when they first landed on the 
rather bleak shores of the New England 
coast. It must have humbled their pride 
and lowered their self-conceit when they 
had to turn to the Savages, as they 
termed them, for assistance to keep from 
starving; for it seems that a friendly 
Indian came to their aid and showed them 
how, not only to prepare the ground, but 
to fertilize it as well. So here was the 
beginning of “How to Fertilize,” so far 
as the people of this great nation are 
concerned. The advice as to how to pre¬ 
pare the ground was crude and the fertil¬ 
izing was then meager; but meager as 
it was then, it was in advance of what 
the colonists themselves knew; at least, 
thev had not been able to raise corn, the 
great staff of life, even more so then than 
now. So they were compelled to turn to 
the aborigines and learn of them, so when 
one Squanto, an Indian well versed in 
the mode of corn culture, came to their 
aid and gave them a practical lesson of 
the land to choose, and how to prepare 
it, then how to use the fertilizer so as to 
produce corn as well as stalk. This may 
be said to have been the first practical 
Farmers’ Institute ever held in America, 
and it seems odd to think that it was the 
Indian teaching the white man the art 
of successfully raising corn on the New 
England coast. Even at that day the fer¬ 
tilizing question was of great importance 
as it is today, for without the fertilizer 
the corn was so slow of growth that it 
failed to mature in their short season. 

It was much in knowing what kind of 
soil and where to locate it and how to 


prepare the land, crude though it was, 
yet it was vital to the colonists to learn 
even this much, and even more so to learn 
how to fertilize it; so you see the fertil¬ 
izer question was a vital one then, as it 
is today. The clearing of the land and 
burning of the brush on the ground was 
part of the fertilizing, but this did not 
seem to be thoroughly understood even 
by the teacher of the “Institute;” yet he 
did know it was necessary that the brush 
should be burned on the ground intended 
for corn, but the wherefore neither he nor 
his pale-faced pupils understood that it 
was the Potash and the Phosphoric Acid 
in the ashes of the hard wood burned on 
the ground that caused the grain to ma¬ 
ture; but he did know it was needful to 
burn the brush, and in this he was ahead 
of the Pilgrims. 

Then 2 again, he knew that fish was a 
good fertilizer for the corn, and while 
he did not understand, as we do today, 
that it was the nitrogen they contained 
that was needed to give the grain a more 
rapid growth, he did know and so taught, 
that “no fish, no corn.” This latter as¬ 
sumption on his part, it seems, was re¬ 
sented by the settlers at first, but after 
failing they were glad to take the advice 
from this first Institute and Experiment 
Station Instructor. So Squanto taught 
them to fertilize the hill for the corn with 
a couple of fish, first placing the fish in 
the soil, then covering it with dirt, then 
to drop the corn and cover with the fine 
soil, then to firm the soil with the foot 
and the operation was completed, and in 
due time the harvest, and thus ended the 
first Institute. 

And so the colonists thus had learned 
all there was to be learned in the art of 
fertilizing and growing corn; but once 
more they had to go to the Experiment 



126 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Station to ask for further information as 
to the cause of their once prolific fields 
failing to bring forth their usual yield 
of the precious grain; and once more 
Squanto came to their rescue and proved 
equal to the occasion after hearing their 
story. He held another Practical Insti¬ 
tute, showing them that though they put 
an extra quantity of fish in the hill for 
the corn, and though they still had fine 
stalks but no corn, that the land was worn 
out as we say today, and they must 
clear new land, burn the brush as before, 
drop their fish and corn as before and 
all would be well. This they seemed loath 
to believe, but they had but one experi¬ 
ment station to go to to get information 
that was so vital to their very existence, 
and so they started anew as before, and— 
lo!—Squanto was right, as at first, just 
as our Experiment Station should be to¬ 
day. It must have been humiliating in 
the extreme to the Pilgrims to get their 
information from such a source, but they 
must learn or starve. 

But time rolled on and the Pilgrims 
taught their instructor; for they noticed 
that the corn was always the best where 
there had been the most ashes left on the 
ground near some large brush-heap; this 
gave them an idea perhaps, after all, it 
was just the ashes, as they had learned 
from the Indians that a field worn out 
would be as good as new after it had 
been allowed to grow up again with a 
young growth of timber, this in turn cut 
down and burned as before, and presto! 
the land yielded crops as before, with the 
aid of the fish to supply the nitrogen. 
When they first noticed the fact that the 
corn was the best near where an extra 
large brush-heap had been burned, that 
was a step forward in the art of fertiliz¬ 
ing; the next step was to save the ashes 


from their log piles and from chimney cor¬ 
ners, and in the following spring these 
ashes were applied to their worn-out land 
and the usual amount of fish to each hill, 
when—lo!—a better crop of corn than 
they had grown at the start was produced 
on this worn-out field by applying Nitro¬ 
gen in the form of fish, Phosphoric Acid 
and Potash in the form of hard-wood 
ashes, and thus a long step in advance 
in fertilizing had been made. But neither 
the colonists nor the Indians knew the 
why or wherefore; they knew such was 
the fact and so were content. So for a 
long period but little advance was made 
in the art of fertilizing as a science, that 
is, in furnishing the crops with the com¬ 
mercial fertilizer as we know it today. 
But some fifty years ago or so an awak¬ 
ening seemed to take place, then came 
Guano, Bone Meal, and such like, more 
into general use. I remember quite well 
when both were introduced in my im¬ 
mediate neighborhood in Pennsylvania. 
Lime and Plaster had long been used in 
a haphazard way; I don’t think any of 
the farmers of those days had little, if 
any, idea why they used Lime, Guano, 
Fish^scrap, Bone Meal, etc. 

They knew, like Squanto, that such 
and such things gave certain results, and 
I think that was about all there was to 
it; but the use of these various ingredi¬ 
ents showed they were feeling their way, 
slowly but surely, so that in the last 
twenty-five years there has been a tre¬ 
mendous awakening, until today the art 
of fertilizing is becoming more of a 
science, not an exact one by any means, 
but far in advance of what it was a few 
years ago. But we have much to learn, 
we are just in the A. B. C.’s as yet so to 
speak, and it is of this uncertainty that 
I hesitated to produce this paper before 







FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

this assembly of progressive farmers and 
fruit growers today. 

Had I been called on twelve or fifteen 
years ago to write this article, I would 
have given vastly more information on 
the art of fertilizing than I can today, 
at least I thought so. If you want to 
know just how to fertilize an orange 
grove for any purpose under the sun, al¬ 
ways go to some novice, some one that 
has not been in the business more than 
five or six years, and you can generally 
find out just what you have been striving 
for all these years to learn; rank ignor¬ 
ance on your part. But in a few years 
go to this same person and broach the 
subject, and he is mute as a clam. 
Squanto and the Pilgrim Fathers would 
be outclassed by him for a lack of exact 
information, and yet he is learning. 

I very much doubt if we could, find half 
a dozen in this house who could agree 
as to the exact way to' treat a grove for 
the best results; some would stand out 
for a clean culture the year round, and 
others seem to think to get best results 
from your grove and from the commer¬ 
cial fertilizer applied there is nothing 
like Humus. Humus is a term we under¬ 
stand for all decaying vegetable matter in 
the soil; to my way of reasoning it is the 
storehouse of Nitrogen, one of the most 
expensive and most necessary of all plant 
foods. It contains the food upon which 
the soil organisms live, whose function is 
to convert organic nitrogen into nitrates 
in order to be available for the use of 
plants. It even assists in decomposing 
the mineral constituents of the soil, thus 
making them available for plant food. It 
serves to increase the drouth-resisting 
power of sandy soils; it also conserves 
the fertilizer we apply to the soil and 
holds them within reach of plant life to 


feed in; so I can't help but think that 
Humus is especially needful to our high 
pine lands. You all know the history 
of the grove of Dudley W. Adams, how 
he took an old worn-out farm and by the 
use of all kinds of vegetable matter 
changed the soil from a barren waste to 
one of the most prolific tracts of land in 
that vicinity. 

Of course, he added Phosphoric Acid 
and Potash. Of the many ingredients 
that enter into plant life, from carbon to 
iron, none of them are so vital to the 
average fruit grower as Nitrogen, Phos¬ 
phoric Acid and Potash. I wish our 
experiment stations would go to work 
and analyze a box of oranges, for instance 
grown on the average sandy soil in Flor¬ 
ida, and let us know in plain English just 
how many pounds of Nitrogen, Phos¬ 
phoric Acid and Potash that box con¬ 
tains; give it to us in plain figures in the 
pounds and ounces, so those not versed 
in chemistry may understand at a glance 
just what that box contains. Don’t carry 
out the analysis in the hundredths and 
thousandths of parts, but just say a box 
contains so many pounds or so many 
ounces of each ingredient, without any 
technicalities attached to it at all; then 
send this broadcast over the state, and a 
long step will be made in the art of citrus 
culture. I well remember when I was in 
the West, engaged more or less in the 
mining business. I used to analyze the 
different samples of rock for myself and 
others. Now, it would have been useless 
for me to have given an analysis as a 
rule of a sample of rock in the technical 
terms that I used in the office. 

What they wanted to know and paid 
for was to find out just how much of the 
valuable minerals the rock contained, and 
wanted that in dollars and cents, or in 



128 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


pounds and ounces, as the case might be. 
I very much doubt if I could make out 
one of my own certificates today as I took 
them down in my book at the time. So 
now let the Experiment Station give us 
one, two or three analyses of a box of 
citrus fruit from different sections of the 
state, grown on different soils and, as I 
said, give it to us in plain English; just 
say right out: box No. i, for instance, 
contains so many pounds and ounces of 
each of the ingredients, then we will 
know what we are doing. 

We will know for every box of oranges 
we expect to get from a tree we must ap¬ 
ply to the soil so much Nitrogen, Phos¬ 
phoric Acid and so much Potash. Of 
course, we must give the soil enough to 
supply not only the fruit, but the natural 
growth of the tree as well. After we 
have learned just how much to apply, we 
can soon find out when to apply it. I 
used to think I knew just what to apply 
to make my fruit small or large, sweet 
or sour, or to make it bright or other¬ 
wise. I am not so sure now, so we will 
pass that by. 

Again, as to the time when to apply, 
if the season is normal I prefer November 
for the fall application, and of late I have 
been using a fertilizer heavy in Phos¬ 
phoric Acid and Potash, with a low per 
cent, in Ammonia; in the fall this has 
given me quite satisfactory results. But 
so many questions spring up that I am 
loath to set any cast-iron rule. But if I 
were going to apply it myself, little and 


often, first when the tree seemed to need 
it; but if I were going to hire it done, 
and only give one application, then I 
should give it in November. For one 
application, I think, this would give the 
best satisfaction. 

Here in South Florida, if you apply 
the fertilizer much earlier and weather 
continues warm, the trees are likely to 
start to grow and in the end cause an 
injury. Farther north it might be ap¬ 
plied earlier, but as I said before, there 
are so many sides to< this question that it 
is hard to give any iron-bound rule that 
will apply to every section or locality. The 
seasons often are so different that what 
would suit one year might not the next; 
then again there is so much we don't 
know for sure, as intimated at first; we 
are-just in the a b c department as to 
fertilizers and fertilizing. But I must 
draw this, to me, interesting subject to 
a close, and yet I have just begun. But 
the time is precious. You notice I have 
departed somewhat from the beaten track 
usually followed on this subject and gone 
out into the by-ways, so to speak, think¬ 
ing a little variety might not be amiss to 
one and all. 

I am like the Pilgrim Fathers, still 
seeking light on this most vital question 
up before the American farmer and fruit 
grower of today. 

So, thanking you for your kind atten¬ 
tion, I am sincerely yours, seeking for 
more exact knowledge on this subject.

By Mrs. Nettie M. G. Prange. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I am assured it is the wish of the 
Society to have a plain talk on fertilizer 
anu its value, by a beginner, to those 
even newer to the work, so I will make 
no excuses, but gladly relate my humble 
experience. 

When I decided to make a grove I 
wrote to several prominent orange grow¬ 
ers to ascertain which was, in their opin¬ 
ion, the best nursery in the state. In 
the spring I engaged the best trees in 
that nursery, to be delivered the next fall. 
My land lay beside a flourishing grove, 
so I thought, after securing my trees 
properly, I had settled all vexing ques¬ 
tions, for, of course, all good groves 
were made with “Smith’s’’ fertilizer. 

A valued correspondent wrote:. 
“Though ‘Smith's’ fertilizer is good, he 
asks more per unit of plant food than 
‘Brown’ does.” About all I understood 
of this sentence was that there might be 
a change to save some money; and you 
know that idea appeals to any of us. But, 
was “Brown’s” fertilizer as good? I felt 
the need of being able to judge for my¬ 
self. My first step was to take prices 
from a list of agricultural chemicals, and 
get cost of contents in the two formulae 
under discussion. I struck all the av¬ 
erages, finding price per pound of each 
ingredient, and worked it all out in reg¬ 
ular schoolma’am fashion. The figures 
showed my correspondent to be right, but 
for further information I submitted the 
work to a person experienced in that line. 
I do not begrudge his quiet smile, for he 
wrote me the kindest of letters, tell¬ 
ing me the easy way to reckon fertilizer 
values, and many other things of interest 
and importance. Neither do I begrudge 


the work I did. Try it yourselves and you 
will see it is just what one needs to make 
him realize that fertilizer is not just fer¬ 
tilizer! 

When one sees it is a combination of 
plant foods, mixed in stated proportions; 
that three of these nutrients, ammonia, 
phosphoric acid, and potash, have a mar¬ 
ket value, and only these three; and that 
the name of Smith, Brown or Jones has 
nothing to do with it beyond his relia¬ 
bility as to work and materials, and that, 
as we shall see later on, we do not have 
to trust him very far even in this—one 
next wonders which of the numerous 
formulae presented is best suited to his 
purpose. This calls for a knowledge of 
the effects of the different plant foods . 

There are many good books on this 
subject for sale, but I will speak only of 
those to be had for the asking, though 
I am to append a list of the others I have 
found useful. 

Send to German Kali Works, 93 Nas¬ 
sau Street, New York, for their “Orange 
Culture,” and then for the other dainty 
booklets listed in it. Peruse carefully the 
pamphlets from all the fertilizer firms. 
There, is something to be learned in every 
one. To be sure, one must always bear 
in mind, the firms issue these books to 
sell their goods, and while all presented 
may be facts, yet each emphasizes that 
fact which is to its own interest; also 
remember, no law controls these state¬ 
ments, and if a company wants to mis¬ 
represent its goods in the pamphlets, it 
can do so. It is the tag on the fertilizer 
that has to tell the truth. 

Write to the Secretary of Agriculture, 
Washington, D. C., for a list of Farmers’ 
Bulletins, and ask to have your name put

on the monthly mailing list. Also to the 
Experiment Station, Gainesville, Fla., for 
a list of the publications issued from 
there, and to the Commissioner of Agri¬ 
culture, Tallahassee, Fla., for the Quar¬ 
terly Bulletins sent out from that office. 
I secured a copy of every available bul¬ 
letin, circular and press notice, pertaining 
to this subject and have learned from 
each one. 

From our State Bulletins, Nos. 22 and 
43, both by A. A. Persons, we gain a 
very good knowledge of plant food, its 
sources and effect on different soils. But 
they were written years ago and the pro¬ 
portions given were based on chemical 
analyses of the soil and the crop desired; 
so it was a pleasure to find in United 
States Farmers’ Bulletin, No. 238, by 
our Prof. Rolfs, statements of the effect 
the different foods have on trees and 
fruit, and other necessary knowledge. In 
fact, it is a description of the citrus in¬ 
dustry in a nut shell. While in Farmers’ 
Institute Bulletin No. 2, which will be 
sent from our Experiment Station on re¬ 
ceipt of postage, I marked on page 23, 
in the interesting address of Chemist 
Rose, his statement of the need of— 

“Nitrogen to produce foliage, suc¬ 
culent leaves, * * * and immature 
wood. 

“Phosnhoric acid * * * to produce 
mature wood in fruit trees. 

“Potash to assist in formation of 
starch and sugar * * *” 

Later I learned farther that while ni¬ 
trogen is most essential, it has to be used 
with the greatest of care, for too luxuri¬ 
ant a growth means weakened tissues, 
and weakened tissues are prey to insects 
and diseases, organic nitrogen being es¬ 
pecially likely to produce bad effects on 
the citrus family. 


Too much phosphoric acid may bring 
about abnormal conditions, such as pro¬ 
fuse bloom, or an over-supply of seeds, 
and thus be detrimental to the general 
health of the tree; while too much potash 
may retard growth somewhat by harden¬ 
ing the fibers too soon; but the worst ef¬ 
fect of an excess of either phosphoric 
acid or potash is on the pocketbook. When 
we pay for more than we need we are 
out just so much money. 

The discourses by Brother Painter in 
Farmers’ Institute Bulletin No. 1, and 
by Brother Wilson in our Annual Re¬ 
port 1906, are instructive; especially the 
latter. Study carefully United States 
Farmers’ Bulletin No. 44 by Dr. Voor- 
hees. It is a thorough discussion of com- 
cial fertilizers. I could name many 
more free helps, but time is passing. 
Without cost one can lay a good founda¬ 
tion upon which to build the real knowl¬ 
edge which comes only by experience. 

When needing help on any point, write 
to our advanced brothers. They show 
unfailing patience and kindness in 
helping the weaker ones. Up to 
the point I have taken the study 
of plant foods in this talk, all au¬ 
thorities are practically agreed. Beyond, 
there is a great diversity of opinions of 
those seemingly equally well-posted, as 
to proper formulae and methods of cul¬ 
tivation. It seems to me that this is 
caused by different situations, and that 
we must each adapt the general principles 
to his own need. 

But we all have to pay for our fertil¬ 
izer. Now we come to this: • 

Hoze are zee to know we get what we 
order, and which formula gives us best 
value for our money? 

The state protects us in this if we avail 
ourselves of the privileges given. Our 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


131 


worthy Commissioner of Agriculture at 
Tallahassee will send you copies of the 
fertilizer law and bulletins containing just 
what we are looking for. The law al¬ 
lows us to have the fertilizer analyzed 
free of cost, so we need never be in doubt 
of what is sent us; but read instructions 
* carefully and send samples for analysis 
just as they direct. Florida is the only 
state in the Union that gives this chance 
for free analysis. The out-of-state fer¬ 
tilizer companies have striven hard to 
have the Legislature strike out this 
clause. We, as horticulturists, ought to 
see that the law remains as it is. The 
inspection costs us an exceedingly small 
amount. I say “costs us” for since the 
fertilizer companies add the inspection 
fees to their expense accounts, we, who 
use the fertilizer, pay the bills, so why 
should a company object unless it wants 
to hide the true content of its product? 
The honest manufacturer is protected as 
well as the consumer. 

If the statements on the tag are proven 
untrue there is trouble ahead. Study the 
tag and believe exactly what it says. 
Don't think “animal matter" on the tag 
has to mean what is described in the pam¬ 
phlet. It means “animal matter” and 
probably the cheapest animal matter ob¬ 
tainable, or the description would be 
more explicit. Study the tag for all these 
points and doubt any obscurity; for trade 
• does not “hide its light under a bushel.” 

Well, if the materials are all right, let 
us see about the formula. It reads: Mois¬ 
ture, 8 to io per cent. “Ah ha!” says 
our neighbor, “Jones’ fertilizer has only 
5 to 8 per cent moisture. You must like 
to buy water!” 

We tell him with a superior air that 
one pays only for actual plant food when 
he buys fertilizer; and never “let on” 


that a few weeks ago we made the very 
same mistake ourselves. Next comes: 
“Ammonia, 4 to 5 per cent.” and we re¬ 
member that ammonia is sort of an in¬ 
flated nitrogen. Sounds like they give 
us more for our money, when they call 
it “Ammonia.” “Available Phosphoric 
Acid, 6 to 7 per cent.” That’s the phos¬ 
phoric acid we get. “Insoluble Phos¬ 
phoric Acid, 1 to 2 per cent.” That’s 
the phosphoric acid, we don’t know sure 
whether we get or not. “Potash, Actual 
K 2 0 , 5 to 6 per cent. H’m, this has it 
all in “Potash, Actual K 2 0 ." Another 
calls it “Potash Actual,” and another 
“Potash K 2 0 but we have found out 
it’s all the same. 

Those scientific fellows would have a 
good laugh could they look into our 
minds and read our “translation” of the 
formula; but so long as we understand 
the meaning, our crude expression does 
not matter. 

Now, let us see what this ton of fer¬ 
tilizer is worth. We have learned to use 
the smallest per cent, given; 4 to 5 per 
cent doesn’t guarantee a bit better content 
than a plain 4 per cent., so our formula 
is: 

Ammonia. 4 P er cent. 

Available Phosphoric Acid . . 6 per cent. 

Insoluble . 1 per cent. 

Potash . 5 per cent. 

Perhaps we “hate to figure,” but any 
of us can turn to the State Chemist’s 
work and read: “A unit is 20 lbs. or 1 
per cent, in a ton ” and find prices he 
gives per unit. 

Ammonia .$ 3 - 3 ° P er un L 

Available Phosphoric Acid 1.00 per unit 

Insoluble .20 per unit 

Potash . 1.10 per unit 












132 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Therefore: 

4 units of Ammonia are worth. . .$13.20 
6 units Available Phosphoric Acid 6.00 


1 unit Insoluble.20 

5 units Potash . 5.50 


The least plant food that can be in this 
ton of fertilizer, legally, is worth at sea 
board Jacksonville, $24.90; and we take 
this value in comparing with other for¬ 
mulae. But when comparing with the 
catalogue price, we must remember the 
analysis runs above the lowest figure, 
really, and every ounce of plant food has 
cost the manufacturer and is worth mo¬ 
ney to us. Then there are the handling, 
storage, mixing and bagging, the inspec¬ 
tion fees, the general ups and downs in 
trade, and so forth. Don’t for a minute 
think the manufacturer can sell the fer¬ 
tilizer at this price, still he must not ask 
too much, for now we know when he 
claims too big a profit and save many a 
dollar by that knowledge. 

But the financial saving is the lesser 
gain from our study, after all; for as one 
learns he looks more and more to the 
how’s and why’s, and his whole life is 
broadened by the study of Nature’s won¬ 
drous wavs.

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Skinner—I notice this lady 
made a statement in her paper that 
potash stopped growth. 

Mrs. Prange—I do not claim to 
know anything by experience. What 
I have presented here is gathered from 
authorities and experts on the subject. 

Mr. Skinner—I might give you a 
little experience I had in the potash 
line. It was the first lemon crop I 
grew. I thought I would mature that 
lemon crop early and get it on the 
market in nice shape; so I gave it a 
dose of high-grade sulphate of potash. 
Well, my neighbors gathered and 
shipped their lemons, and while my 
lemons looked nice, they kept on 
growing, and they grew, and they 
grew, and they grew, and they grew. 
I was not able to market them until 
the first of December, but I got a good 
price for them. My experience has 
been to show that too much potash 
makes late ripening fruit. 

Mr. McCarty—In pineapple culture, 
in the summer application of fertilizer 
we do not use much potash, but 
in the fall application we u-se a higher 
percentage of potash. We find that 
the more potash we use, the closer the 
texture of the fruit and the better are 
the carrying qualities. It is said that 
it hardens the pineapple, but I don’t 
know. 

Mr. Griffing—The peach also carries 
much better. We know that an excess 











FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


133 


of potash for peaches will retard the 
ripening. This we know by sad ex¬ 
perience, as when we used too much 
of it we came in a week or ten days 
later than some of the orchards ad¬ 
joining us. But potash does materially 
aid in the carrying quality of the fruit. 

Mr. Hart—My experience with or¬ 
anges in the free use of potash is that 
it has a tendency to prevent softening 
of the fruit. 

Mr. Longley—My experience in us¬ 
ing potash was in the fall. I fertilized 
in the fall and didn’t think there was 
enough potash, so I sent to Brother 
Painter and got a carload. The next 
summer we got the finest crop of le¬ 
mons I ever saw. They were big and 
fine looking, and brought a good price 
in the market. I think a good deal of 
it was due to putting it on in the fall. 
I also put on an extra amount. 

Mr.-In the spring, my trees set 

a good crop of fruit, and I gave them 
a good application of potash. As the 
result, I lost nearly the whole crop of 
fruit. A friend of mine said he had 
the same experience. It was just about 
this time of year that I put the potash 
on ; perhaps a little earlier. 

Mr. Hart—Was it a dry year? Per¬ 
haps that was the cause of your losing 
the crop instead of too much potash. 

Mr.-No, it was not a particularly 

dry year. I saw no reason except too 
much potash. The season was an av¬ 
erage season. 

Mr. Jones—One fall we had drops 
to the tune of 500 boxes. They began 
to drop in September. Somebody told 
me what the ground needed was pot¬ 
ash, so I got five tons of high-gra'de 
potash and put it on the grove, which 


was about nine acres, and the next 
year I could not get a box of drops. 
They were fine oranges; clear and 
smooth and fine. 

Mr.-Did you put on in the fall? 

Mr. Jones—No, it was put on in 
June. 

Mr. Griffing—I understood the lady 
to say that potash had a tendency to 
harden the wood fibre. Now, take it 
in the growth of nursery trees. In the 
early season we use fertilizer more 
largely composed of nitrogen, and in 
the fall we increase the potash very 
materially, running up to eight and 
nine per cent. We find the trees will 
carry better and stand more cold 
than trees that have been given more 
nitrogenous matter. In the fall we 
leave out one per cent, of the ammonia 
and increase the potash three or four 
per cent. 

For the orange nursery trees, we 
fertilize them in the early part of the 
season, then give them about two 
more applications during the season; 
in all, about three or four times a 
year, increasing the potash every time. 
We fertilize the peach seedlings as 
soon as they are about four or five 
inches in height, giving a strong pot¬ 
ash fertilizer in the fall, and it un¬ 
doubtedly hardens the wood fibre. 

Mr. Skinner—Why do the formulae 
run so high in phosphoric acid for 
young trees? All the formulae run 
very high. 

Mr. Rose—I can only surmise that 
it is a business proposition. The phos¬ 
phates are the cheapest source of plant 
food that we have, particularly in 
Florida, and it is the predominating 








134

material in all fertilizers, and is used 
as a filler. It is the basis of fertilizers. 

Mr.-It seems to me there have 

been many conflicting statements 
made. Now, suppose I fertilize this 
year's crop; does this year’s crop or 
next year’s crop get the benefit of it? 

Mr. Hubbard—You fertilize both 
crops. That is, if the application is 
put on before the fruit has matured. 
The fruit keeps on growing and ma¬ 
turing and the sap takes up the food 
elements and carries them to the fruit 
already on the tree. If you use a well- 
balanced fertilizer, you fertilize the 
present crop and also put in the foun¬ 
dation for the next year's crop. 

There has been a good deal of ex¬ 
perimenting done since we have be¬ 
gun using commercial fertilizers, both 
as to discovering what constituents a 
complete fertilizer should have, and 
with the different elements used sep¬ 
arately. It is generally agreed that 
the office of phosphoric acid in the sap 
is to assist in the transference of su¬ 
gar and starch to build up plant tis¬ 
sues. I believe the general experience 
in using potash alone after midsum¬ 
mer or early in the fall after the trees 
have stopped growing, is to increase 
the acidity and retard the ripening of 
the fruit. Liebig, the father of agri¬ 
cultural chemistry, stated in substance 
that after the alkaline salts had served 
as bases for nitrates, they were used 
by the plant as bases for the organic 
acids that are transferred into the 
starches which build up the plant. 
Potash without nitrogen misses its 
first office in plant growth. 

Mrs. Prange—As I understand it, 
it is better to start the growth with 
the airmonia an 1 harden it with the 


potash. My father's grove was af¬ 
flicted with die-back until he used 
more potash. 

Mr. Rose—In the last few years we 
have gradually increased the potash 
until now we are using ten per cent, 
in many instances. The method of 
applying is the question. It depends 
very much upon the condition of the 
tree, the location of the grove, etc. No 
two are alike any more than two cases 
of illness present the same aspect to 
a physician. Now, we have fought this 
out at session after session ever since 
I have been a member, and we will 
never agree upon a general proposi¬ 
tion. If a specific case were given 
where the condition of the tree, the 
season, the former treatment of the 
tree, its present growth, and every¬ 
thing known about that tree, it might 
be possible to tell just exactly what 
that tree needs, and when and how to 
be applied. .The general supposition, 
as our Professor Hubbard has said, is 
that potash is a vehicle for the trans¬ 
ference of sugar and starch from the 
root to the foliage and tree. 

Mr. Longley—I have been fertiliz¬ 
ing my trees in November, usually, 
for the next year, and have met with 
very good success. My trees bear a 
good crop right along. This year I 
fertilized in October, for the reason 
that help is very scarce and I had 
get my trees plowed before the or¬ 
ange packing began. 

As Mr. Hubbard says, he thinks it 
retards the growth to put on too much 
potash. I think it retards the ripen¬ 
ing of the fruit. 

Mr. Reaves—I fertilized with potash 
after the fruit had set, the blooms had 
shed and you could see little oranges. 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

The prices were good and we thought 
it would be a good thing for us to get 
some oranges in to market right away. 
So we put on a good application, and 
lost the fruit. 

Mr. Painter—That experience has 
been had by a good many, not only 
with potash. Some time ago, a man 
wrote me that his trees had just put 
out a fine bloom and wanted to make 
an unusually fine crop of fruit. He 
ordered an extra amount of fertilizer, 
applied it, harrowed and worked it in, 
and the result in due course of time 
was that the young fruit dropped. You 
can do that without the fertilizer if you 
happen to have a good rain about the 
time you do the cultivating. It is the 
stimulating effect given to the tree 
that causes the dropping. My experi¬ 


ence has been that the orange trees 
ought to be left severely alone during 
the setting period. 

Mr.-How long do you consider 

the setting period? 

Mr. Painter—Until the orange 
reaches the size of a good-sized 
marble. Of course, up to that time 
there will be a good deal of fruit drop¬ 
ping on account of being imperfect. 

Mr.-Will the cultivation of trees 

alone, without fertilizer, cause the 
fruit and foliage to drop ? 

Mr. Painter—I have known of cases 
of that kind. 

Prof. Rolfs—I congratulate the au¬ 
thor of the paper, which has brought 
on more discussion than any other we 
have had. 











Controlling Capilliary Moisture. 


By A. W. Blair, 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

When rain falls upon fields and groves 
a part of it runs off to the lower places, 
and a part sinks into the soil and per¬ 
meates it. The amount which runs off is 
determined by the condition of the surface 
and the rapidity of the rain. If the sur¬ 
face is hard and compact and also some¬ 
what sloping, much of the water will run 
off. If the surface soil is loose and mel¬ 
low, and contains much organic matter, 
it will absorb much of the water that 
falls on it. When the rains are heavy 
and continue for some time, a part of this 
absorbed water will continue its course 
downward until it reaches the water-ta¬ 
ble or ground-water. 

Another part remains distributed in the 
soil, and it is this part that is thus held 
in the soil against the force of gravity 
that we call capillary water. As the sur¬ 
face of the ground dries out, some of the 
water that has filtered through to the wa¬ 
ter-table may be drawn up into the soil 
again and become capillary water. This 
may be illustrated as follows: Close one 
end of a glass tube by tying over it a 
piece of muslin, then partly fill the tube 
with soil, and pour on water; the entire 
mass of soil becomes saturated and a 
part of the water runs through, provided 
a sufficient quantity has been added. If 
now the soil in the tube is allowed to dry 
for a few days, and then the end over 
which the muslin was tied is dipped into 
a basin of water, the water will slowly 
rise in the tube, being lifted up by cap¬ 


illary attraction against the force of grav¬ 
ity. The water in the basin may be com¬ 
pared to the ground-water in the soil; 
though the cases are not strictly parallel, 
since under natural field conditions the 
soil is constantly in contact with the 
ground-water. The principle however is 
the same. It is from this capillary water, 
for the most part, that trees and plants 
obtain the water necessary for their 
growth. We can readily see then the im¬ 
portance of knowing how best to control 
this source of water supply. The prin¬ 
ciple on which the water, known as capil¬ 
lary water, rises in the soil, is a well- 
known law of physics. When small glass 
tubes of different internal diameters are 
placed in water, the water will rise high¬ 
est in the smallest tube. That is, the 
height to which the water rises is in¬ 
versely proportional to the diameter of 
the tube. A knowledge of this law helps 
us in the study of the movements of soil 
moisture. The small spaces between the 
soil particles or grains, may be likened 
to fine tubes; though in this case the 
tubes are neither straight nor of uniform 
bore. By capillary attraction water is 
drawn up through the pore spaces or fine 
tubes, to take the place of that which is 
lost by surface evaporation or used by 
plants and trees. 

The size of these tube.% will be deter¬ 
mined by the size of the particles or 
grains that make up the soil; that is, if 
the soil is composed largely of coarse 
particles, the capillary tubes will be

large, and if it is composed of very fine 
sand or clay loam, the tubes will be much 
smaller. Then, according to the law al¬ 
ready stated, the water will rise highest 
in the soil that is made up of the finest 
grains. This is well illustrated bv tying 
muslin cloth over the ends of glass tubes 
as described above, filling each tube with 
a different soil, and letting the ends of 
the tubes dip into a basin of water for 
a few days. The results of such an ex¬ 
periment are shown in diagram I. In the 
coarse sand from Saint Lucie county the 


which compose the Hillsboro county soil 
are one-half millimeter (about 1-50 inch) 
or less, in diameter. However, the odds 
are not all against the coarse soil. True, 
it does not lift the water so high as the 
finer soil, but neither does it allow this 
water to evaporate from the surface so 
rapidly. It has been shown that a mulch 
of coarse, dry sand is more effective in 
preventing surface evaporation than one 
of finely pulverized clay loam. 

Furthermore, we have shown by exper¬ 
iments similar to those already described

height of eight and a half inches. In the 
moderately coarse soil from Alachua 
county it rose ten and a half inches in the 
same time; and in a very fine soil from 
Hillsboro county it rose sixteen inches in 
the same time. The tables which accom¬ 
pany this diagram show the relative

inches in the same time. Stable manure, 
muck, cover crops, straw, or leaves, may 
be used to increase the capillary power of 
the soil.

Mention has been made of the 
loss of capillary water by surface 
evaporation. The loss of water in 
this way is great, but it is pos¬ 
sible to very materially reduce this loss. 
This may be accomplished, as is generally 
known, by plowing and frequently stir¬ 
ring the surface. King, in Wisconsin, 
has shown that a piece of ground lost in 
seven days, in consequence of not having 
been plowed, no less than 9.13 pounds 
of water per square foot more than an ad¬ 
joining piece that had been plowed; an 
amount equivalent to 1.75 inches of rain, 
and to more than 198 tons of water per 
acre. Hilgard, in California, reports 
some investigations of moisture condi¬ 
tions in adjacent orchards differently 
treated in regard to cultivation. In one 
case investigated, two orchards of apri¬ 
cots were separated by a lane only, and 
the soils were identical; but one owner 
had omitted to cultivate while the other 
had cultivated to an extra depth in view 
of a dry season apparently impending. 
Table I shows the difference of the two 
fields in moisture content in July to 
the depth of six feet. This difference of 
244 tons of water per acre he regards as 
quite sufficient to account for the observed 
difference in the cultural results. These 
results were that on the cultivated ground 
the trees made about three feet of annual 
growth and the fruit was of normal size, 
while the trees on the uncultivated ground 
made barely three inches of growth, and 
the fruit was stunted and wholly unsal¬ 
able. Hilgard adds that, instructed by 
the season’s experience, the owner of the 
uncultivated orchard cultivated deeply the 
following season. His trees then showed 
as good growth and fruit as his neigh¬ 
bor's. Hilgard attributes the cause of 
this difference to the fact that in the un¬ 
cultivated field there was a compact sur¬ 


face layer of several inches in thickness 
which forcibly abstracted the moisture 
from the substrata, and evaporated it 
from its surface; while the loose surface 
soil on the cultivated ground was unable 
to take moisture from the denser subsoil. 

In diagram II I have undertaken to rep¬ 
resent this condition graphically. In the 
unplowed ground the capillary tubes or . 
openings, through which the moisture is 
brought from the deeper subsoil, extend 
all the way to the surface, and thus permit 
the evaporation of this moisture. 

Where the ground has been plowed, the 
capillary tubes are broken a few inches 
below the surface, and much of the moist- 
ture is thus prevented from escaping 
into the air. However, the movement 
of capillary moisture may take place in 
any direction, even downward, if the 
conditions are favorable. 

Note. —The diagram is necessarily 
very much exaggerated, and represents 
only very imperfectly what takes place 
in the soil. It- is not intended to convey 
the idea that cultivation will entirely 
prevent surface evaporation. 

At the Experiment Station we have re¬ 
cently determined the moisture in plowed 
and unplowed land with the results shown 
in table II. The plowed land selected is 
a cotton field that was plowed about 
March 24, and harrowed twice between 
that date and the time of planting the 
cotton on April 16. The unplowed land 
lies just across a path from the cotton 
field, and has not been plowed since last 
December. Samples for moisture deter¬ 
minations were collected on April 18, 24, 
28, May 1 and 7. (On the twenty- 
eighth of April, 0.86 inch of rain 
fell. On the thirtieth, 0.30 inch fell; and 
on May 6, 0.70 inch fell; making a total 
of 1.86 inches from April 28 to May 6.) 

We find here a difference of 164.66 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


141 


tons per acre, to the depth of four feet, 
in favor of the plowed land, which is 
equivalent to 1.45 inches of rainfall. If 
we consider for a moment what it would 
mean to have missed 1.45 of the 1.86 
inches of rain that fell during this period, 


The low moisture content in Grove A 
at Lake Weir may possibly be explained 
by the fact that here the roots of the 
trees are unusually near the surface of 
the ground, and as a consequence cultiva¬ 
tion has been shallow; and by the further

Report of Committee on Tropical Fruits. 


THE EAST INDIAN MANGO IN FLORIDA. 


By John B. Beach 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The East Indian Mango, with its spicy, 
resinous sap and luscious pulp, stands 
pre-eminent the king of all fruits. The 
only reason it has not assumed the posi¬ 
tion that belongs to it centuries ago in 
the markets of Western civilization is the 
fact that it cannot be reproduced true 
from seed. Consequently it has been con¬ 
fined to its home, Hindustan, and ad¬ 
jacent countries to which trees could be 
transported. For the past ten or fifteen 
years, with the aid of fast steamers, the 
fruit has been finding its way into the 
London markets from Bombay via the 
Suez Canal. Its remarkable keeping 
qualities render this long journey possi¬ 
ble, yet the fruit surely cannot develop 
its full flavor when gathered so long be¬ 
fore maturity, as is necessary in this in¬ 
stance. For the past twenty years I have 
made a hobby of the East Indian mango, 
and have ridden it pretty hard at times. I 
rode it into the ground at Melbourne in 
1894. Then I moved to Palm Beach and 
conducted pretty exhaustive experiments 
for five summers in propagation methods, 
assisted by Mr. J. F. Bergin, who is now 
manager of the Tropical Fruit Associa¬ 
tion’s mango plantation at Bayamon, 
Porto Rico. It was our object to ascer¬ 
tain the cheapest and most feasible meth¬ 


od for commercial production of East 
Indian Mango trees. I am informed that 
the results of our work have proven 
the same as those conducted in the green¬ 
houses at Washington. We have fallen 
back on the old East Indian principle, 
though we greatly improve on the method 
of inarching. Under certain conditions 
budding is perfectly feasible, also root¬ 
grafting or root inarching. But when it 
comes to turning out a maximum per¬ 
centage of healthy, vigorous trees, fitted 
for long-distance transportation at a min¬ 
imum cost, inarched pot-grown trees take 
the lead. A half-inch seedling tree can 
be grown in a five-inch pot, a two or 
three-foot vigorous East Indian top can 
be grown on it in six or eight weeks, and 
this tree properly planted and cared for 
will in three years produce several dozen 
fruit. They can be packed very light 
with sphagnum and oiled paper in pine¬ 
apple crates and will readily stand four 
or five weeks’ shipment through the 
tropics in the Spring and Fall. 

U T p to the last few years the only speci¬ 
men of this wonderful fruit that had ever 
been, produced in Florida was a Mulgoba 
tree (and its descendants) which was im¬ 
ported with a number of others by the 
Government. This tree was the only one 
that survived the cold of ’94 and ’95 and

is growing on the place of the late Rev. 
A. Gale at Mangonia. I have just seen 
the tree (April 25th) and it has enough 
fruit set to make five bushels if 
they all mature. Mr. Geo. Gale has or¬ 
ders for all he can produce at 25 cents 
each f. o. b. The tree is two feet in 
diameter and has a spread of twenty-five 
feet. It is on the very poorest kind of 
spruce pine land, coarse and white, with¬ 
out fertilizer or irrigation. It is wonder¬ 
ful that anything could live and grow 
under such conditions, and speaks well 
for the vigor of the East Indian Mango. 

I have a tree budded from this ten 
years ago, that stands twenty-five fset 
high, and has yielded from. 500 to 1,000 
inarches per year, since I began to pro¬ 
pagate from it. Before I began this it 
had produced two crops of fruit, but since 
then I have been working it so hard on 
propagation that it only sets a few fruit 
each year. It is on spruce pine land, but 
I give it fertilizer and water, which 
everything here needs to produce max¬ 
imum results. If Mr. Gale’s tree had had 
the same treatment that mine has had, 
it would undoubtedly be yielding 25 to 
30 bushels .of fruit per year. All the 
imported trees that we have bearing pro¬ 
duce fruit that is free from fibre. There 
is a little down on one side of the seed, 
but no fibre at all in the body of the 
fruit. You can cut around the seed and 
lift off a fruit cup just as you would 


with a free-stone peach or an avocado 
pear. The pulp is far richer than the 
finest peach, melting and juicy with a 
spicy flavor not to be found in any tem¬ 
perate fruit. 

The Mulgoba weighs fourteen to six¬ 
teen oz., has a fine red cheek, and is a 
fine market fruit. Shape is often nearly 
cylindrical, and never very lopsided. The 
AlphonsO', one of the recent importations 
via Washington, is considered in India 
the best of all. It is superior in flavor 
to the Mulgoba but inferior in size and 
appearance. Sundersha weighs from two 
to three pounds, but is not equal to Mul¬ 
goba in quality. Fernandez, one of my 
own importations, has a distinct subacid 
flavor, unusual in mangoes, and which 
will make it popular when known, though 
the size is only 6 oz. It is a most pro¬ 
lific bearer, and I have to pick off half 
the fruit to give the rest a chance. Young 
trees just inarched will often start to 
bloom the first year. There are quite a 
number of other varieties imported by the 
Department, by Mr. E. N. Reasoner and 
by myself that have not as yet fruited, 
selected from the finest in India that may 
develop other qualities that may appeal 
to the taste of the public, but it will be 
hard to beat the Alphonso. The develop¬ 
ment of these we await with interest, and 
next year expect to hear from some of 
them, as many have blossomed and set 
fruit.

PINEAPPLE GROWING AND SHIPPING. 


By B, K. McCarty. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Growing and shipping—these two 
words represent the nucleus of the pine¬ 
apple industry, upon them rests success 
or failure; and I will treat the subject as 
fully and clearly as it is possible to do in 
a limited address. 

The first and most important step in 
the growing of pineapples is the choosing 
of the land. There are two kinds of this 
that are best adapted to pineapples, viz.: 
Spruce Pine and Hammock. Spruce 
Pine, as the name implies, is high dry 
land covered with spruce pines, the best 
having an undergrowth of scrub oak and 
hickory. Hammock land is more densely 
grown with larger timber usually of 
hickory and oak. Opinions differ as to 
which is the best, but it is generally con¬ 
ceded that the hammock land raises the 
largest pines both as to plant and size; 
the spruce pine land does not seem to 
have as much humus in the soil, but the 
plant seems to last a greater number of 
years upon it. A combination place con¬ 
taining some of each kind of land is de¬ 
sirable if you can obtain such. After 
the careful choosing of the land, the next 
step is the clearing, i. e. placing in proper 
shape; this is done by first removing the 
tree’s brush, etc. The process of grub¬ 
bing the land consists in taking a tool 
known as a grub hoe about six inches 
wide and shaped like a mattox; with this 
implement all the roots are removed to 
a depth of about fourteen inches. Ground 
should be grubbed during the winter for 
the summer planting; do not, however, 


remove the roots and brush until sum¬ 
mer when you fork the land, because 
this shades the ground and prevents the 
sun from baking the same. Pine stumps 
are not grubbed out, only the roots are 
cut up to the stump and the tree is cut 
down. This stump soon rots and makes 
humus for your land. Hickory, Bay and 
all other stumps are dug out either with 
a grub hoe or a stump-puller. All brush 
and large roots are forked into the trails 
which are from four to six feet wide, six 
feet preferred; here it is burned. The 
land is now ready for raking. Before 
this is done, in order to level, a harrow 
is run over, thus removing all bumps; the 
land is now raked; all the fine trash and 
rootlets are raked into where your trail 
is to be, or the same place that the trash 
was burned. When these rootlets and 
fine trash are worked into the ground 
by rolling over it with the wheelbarrow 
and other work done in the trail, it forms 
a hard path which enables the man who 
wheels to carry bigger loads. We have 
now reached the point of setting. 

Select good plants; of whatever va¬ 
riety you wish to plant, the universal 
opinion is that Red Spanish are the most 
desirable both from the commercial and 
safety point of view. The slips range 
in length from eight to fourteen inches; 
the stocky heavy-butted ones are the best 
growers; slips are shucked or the hard 
butt is cut off, and the first eight or ten 
shucks are removed, thus allowing the 
roots to be exposed so when the slip is 
planted they will start quicker and be 







FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


147 


rooted firmer. Usually about 12,500 Red 
Spanish slips are planted to the acre; 
twenty inches square being the proper 
distance. 

The ground is laid off with a marker 
which is pulled by a man, thereby giving 
you an even and symmetrical field. Plant¬ 
ing is done by the use of a trowel; the 
ground is simply broken and the slip is 
inserted to the depth of about one inch. 
Be sure not to set too deep. A slip set 
too deep becomes choked by the sand 
working into the bud and the plant does 
not make the proper growth. Equally 
as bad, however, is shallow setting, be¬ 
cause the wind blows the unrooted plant 
from its place. The point of proper set¬ 
ting cannot be overestimated and should 
receive the careful attention of every pine- 
apple grower. We have three methods of 
working pineapple plants; the most pop¬ 
ular as well as the best is shufflehoeing. 
This is done by means of a shuffle-hoe. 
When the plant is young you work care¬ 
fully up to the base of each plant, being 
sure Jo stir all of the ground. Opinions 
differ as to how often young plants 
should be shufflehoed; as for me, I do 
this early and often, every three weeks, 
if the ground is in the proper condition, 
until the plant becomes too large to per¬ 
mit. A small plough is used also to stir 
the ground in young fields; a rake is also 
used by some people, but it is much 
slower and more expensive. 

The shuffle-hoe is our most used tool, 
for with it are the trails kept clean of 
weeds and stirred, as well as the fields. 

Upon our sandy soils we have to fer¬ 
tilize extensively, almost from the time 
the plant is set, and continue to do so 
until the field has grown too old to bear 
properly. The question of fertilizing is 
an intricate one, requiring a great deal 
of study and close attention to details. 

10 


I have used Painter’s fertilizers for some 
time, with the best of results. It seems 
to be the census of opinion that a bearing 
field of pines should be fertilized twice 
a year.. What is called the summer ap¬ 
plication is usually put on about July 10th 
to 30th; and the fall application is put 
on about October 15th to 30th. It is 
almost impossible to tell formulas, be¬ 
cause of the differences in fields, age of 
plants and, last, the difference in land; 
there are not any two^ pieces of land which 
would require the same kind of fertilizer; 
climatic conditions change the whole 
status of affairs. 

The watch-word in shipping pineapples 
is carefulness in handling. Let it ever 
be the foremost idea in your mind, that 
a fall which will injure an egg will do 
the same to a pineapple. The first thing 
in shipping pines is the picking; upon this 
point lies success or failure; i. e., how 
to pick, when to pick, color and methods 
of picking. There are two ways to pick; 
first to snap the apple from the stalk; this 
is done by placing your knee or wrist 
against the stalk at the base of the ap¬ 
ple and giving a quick downward motion 
toward the body. If there are slips around 
the base of the apple, one should be re¬ 
moved. The snapping process is a very 
good one where the slips are not thick 
and when there has been rain, thus mak¬ 
ing the stalk brittle. The second method 
is by cutting with a knife; an ordinary 
all-metal oyster knife is the best; one or 
more slips, if necessary, are pushed off 
from the top of the stalk, the point of 
the knife is here inserted and the apple 
is removed by this method, the slips are 
saved, and it also prevents the apple from 
becoming plugged so it leaks and rots 
while in transit. The census of opinion 
is that the first-named method is the best, 
although many of the best growers use 


148 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


both; the grower will have to use his own 
judgment in this matter to a large extent. 
When to pick the fruit so as to get it to 
the market in the best possible shape is 
one of the all-important points of the in¬ 
dustry. The apple should show a light 
greenish cast around the base. It should 
always be remembered that a Red Span¬ 
ish pineapple always ripens from the out¬ 
side in; also from the base to the top of 
the apple. When pines are picked in this 
condition they will keep for some time, 
even in the heart of the summer, if they 
are not bruised. 

Step number two is the method of get¬ 
ting the apple from the field to the pack¬ 
ing house. Some people use a wheel¬ 
barrow with a rack; into this the apples 
are placed where they are then taken to 
the house; others use pineapple crates 
that are filled by the wheeler as they are 
thrown by the picker. These crates are 
picked up and hauled to the house with 
a wagon, where they are carefully laid in¬ 
to the bins, being now ready for wrap¬ 
ping. Baskets are also sometimes used 
in place of crates on the wagon. When 
the pines arrive at the packing-house they 
are placed in long bins about four feet 
wide and three feet deep; from this they 
are packed. If the fruit is wet when it 
is brought to the house, it is always let 
dry in order to save spotting the paper. 
Pineapples are packed in crates ioj 4 by 
12 by 36 inches; they are wrapped in 
strong paper 15 by 20 inches. Most grow¬ 
ers use plain white, because it is stronger; 
still many growers use the colored paper 
with varied success. 

Sizing is all done with the eye and is a 
most particular job; the crate must be 
packed snug but not full enough, so when 
the covering is put on that it bruises the 
apples. The point should be carefully 


borne in mind, that the apple in transit 
shrinks a trifle, so that what seems to be 
a perfect package on leaving your pack¬ 
ing-house will not be so when it is re¬ 
ceived by your commission house. Ex¬ 
perience is one's only teacher in the mat¬ 
ter of packing and the man who feels 
that he is shrewd enough to beat the 
buyer on his pack will find, to his sor¬ 
row, that he is receiving from 10 to 25 
cents less for his fruit than his neighbor. 

Pineapples run in size from 18 to 48 
to the crate; they are laid in the crates 
crossways, alternately apple and crown; 
this is done to prevent bruising if one 
apple came in direct contact with an¬ 
other. The crate is made the wide way, 
so as to give the apple more room. Each 
package should be packed with carefully 
selected fruit both as to size and quality. 
Never pack an apple that is the least bit 
doubtful, because you not only lower the 
price on that crate, but you lower the 
reputation of your brand which is price¬ 
less. 

An ordinary packer packs 100 crates 
a day and does it well. Of course, size 
has a great deal to clo with the number 
a man can pack, but for all season’s work 
100 crates a day is plenty. 

Your crate should be stenciled or, if 
you prefer, stamped with your name, va¬ 
riety, etc., so as to present a neat and 
attractive appearance. 

My whole article has dealt with the 
Red Spanish Pineapple, which is king of 
all varieties; it has won its place justly 
in the great markets of the world against 
the bitterest competition. Cuba with her 
immense crops of pineapples combined 
with both Florida’s and Porto Rico’s form 
a stupendous business. It is sufficient to 
say that if we are to retain our enviable 
position as producing the finest pineapple

PLANTING OF FRUIT TREES. 
By Aubrey Frink. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Early in April I received a letter from 
President Rolfs asking me to prepare a 
paper for the Horticultural meeting, but 
lie did not suggest a topic. After some 
correspondence with Prof. Rolfs, we de¬ 
cided upon the subject of Planting Fruit 
Trees. 

My reason for selecting this topic is 
that there seems to be a very general de¬ 
sire for information along this line. 
Scarcely a day passes during the planting 
season that I don't receive inquiries as 
to when to plant, how to prune for plant¬ 
ing, about fertilizers and fertilizing, best 
sized trees to set, etc. And, no wonder, 
for the success of an orchard depends 
to a considerable extent on proper meth¬ 
ods in planting. 

WHEN TO PLANT. 

The., best time for setting fruit trees 
is one of the first things to be considered. 
As a general rule fruit trees do better 
when set during late fall or early winter 
—as soon as they have hardened up their 
growth and become dormant. Trees 
planted then will have time R> become 
established in their new positions and 
nearly all of them will have put on feeder 
rootlets before time for growth to start 
in the spring; thus enabling them to start 
promptly and make and sustain a good 


first growth in the spring, as well as suc¬ 
ceeding growths, and to withstand 
drouth. 

Many people suppose that when a tree 
is dormant, it is dormant in root as 
well as in top, but if you care to test this, 
dig up a few trees during the late fall 
and heel them in or transplant them, and 
then during late winter or early spring 
before top growth has started, dig them 
up and examine the roots. You will 
nearly always find small rootlets long be¬ 
fore the top shows any signs of starting. 

If planting is left until spring, the top 
will start out immediately and before the 
roots have time to throw out feeders, 
thus drawing severely upon the stored-up 
sap within the tree, with the result, too 
often, that the vitality of the tree is 
weakened and not infrequently it suc¬ 
cumbs, especially in case of a severe 
drouth. 

Deciduous trees can be planted success¬ 
fully only when dormant, during the late 
fall, winter or early spring. But Citrus 
trees can be planted at almost any time 
when conditions are favorable; that is, 
when the ground is moist and weather 
cloudy, although they, too, generally do 
better for being planted during late fall 
or early winter. Some planters like to 
plant during the rainy season of mid¬ 
summer. 



150 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


It is desirable always to plant all kinds 
of trees only when the ground is in good 
moist condition. 

PRUNING. 

The pruning of fruit trees at time of 
planting, or before, is a matter that is 
given entirely too little attention. A very 
large percentage of trees are set out 
exactly as received from the nursery, 
whether pruned at all or not, in an en¬ 
deavor to save as much of the top as 
possible. This oftentimes results in los¬ 
ing a large percentage of trees, for the 
root system of the tree has been deranged 
while the top is left as it originally was, 
with the result that the tree has to draw 
upon the sap stored up within itself to 
support the top and, if evergreens, all 
the foliage, while the roots are getting 
started. This heavy drain upon the vital¬ 
ity of the tree not infrequently causes it 
to die. Nearly all fruit trees should be 
severely pruned when planted. They will 
start out better, make better and quicker 
growth, and actually form good heads 
sooner than when planted with all their 
tops left on, besides materially reducing 
the percentage of loss in planting. Fruit 
trees should nearly always be cut back 
to a straight stem of about twenty to 
thirty inches. This gives the point at 
which the top will form, thus making a 
low branched tree, giving a larger fruit¬ 
ing surface than would be possible were 
the top started four or five feet or higher. 
It also allows of the fruit being picked 
with greater ease and less expense than 
from high-topped trees, because a good 
portion of the fruit can be picked with¬ 
out the use of a ladder. 

The roots should also be pruned to 
some extent, but I do not believe what 


is known as the Stringfellow method of 
pruning off all the roots is good practice; 
in fact, it has not proven so in my own 
planting of many thousands of trees an¬ 
nually, except in some instances where 
trees are very small and the top is also 
cut to within a very few inches of the 
ground. 

In pruning citrus trees, it is advisable 
to cut out the fibrous roots almost en¬ 
tirely, the belief of many planters to the 
contrary notwithstanding. These fibrous 
roots are but feeders and are an annual 
growth, and when a tree is transplanted 
with these fibrous roots left on it, they 
will simply rot off before new rootlets 
will start, thus hindering the starting of 
new feeders. If anyone doubts this as¬ 
sertion, let him heel in a few orange trees 
during the early winter, and then examine 
them during the late winter. He will 
find the fibrous rootlets rotted off, and 
new rootlets starting. In making the 
test, try a few with fibrous rootlets cut 
out and see if he does not find that they 
have started new feeders much sooner than 
those with the fibrous roots left on them. 

A pretty good plan, when ordering 
trees from a nurseryman, is to instruct 
him to have the trees pruned ready for 
plarfting. He will seldom make any 
charge for this, and the plan has several 
advantages. In the first place the trees 
will be properly pruned; with many plant¬ 
ers it takes considerable nerve to prune 
as hard as trees should be pruned. 
In the second place, this will save you 
the trouble and expense, and will save 
considerable useless weight and, con¬ 
sequently, transportation charges. And 
in the third place, evergreen trees will be 
the better for being pruned and defoliated 
immediately when dug. This stops, to a 
large extent, the evaporation of sap, al- 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


151 


ways going on through the foliage,and re¬ 
duces considerably the drying out in tran¬ 
sit that would otherwise be hard to over¬ 
come. Evergreens should nearly always 
be defoliated when transplanted, for 
otherwise the evaporation of sap is so 
great through the foliage that the trees 
have a hard struggle for life, and if ship¬ 
ped during hot weather they are apt to 
scald in transit, especially if out for some 
time. 

PREPARATION OF THE GROUND, AND 
FERTILIZING. 

The preparation of the ground for the 
tree is of great importance and is too 
often neglected. The ground should have 
been broken up very deep with a turn 
plow and thoroughly pulverized some time 
in advance of planting. If the land is 
new, this will enable it to mellow and 
sweeten up, that is, lose the acidity which 
so often occurs in our Florida soils. And, 
right here, I want to say that new land 
should always be used for trees subject 
to attacks from the root-knot nematode, 
such as peaches, mulberries, figs, etc. The 
root-knot nematode is generally plentiful 
in old lands, while new lands are fairly 
free from it. By using new land your 
trees have a chance to get started well 
before this pest becomes sufficiently 
abundant to do any damage, and then 
the tree is generally able to resist its at¬ 
tacks. 

It is a pretty good plan to use half a 
pound to one pound per tree of some good 
high grade commercial fertilizer at time 
of planting or before, mixing it thor¬ 
oughly with the earth in the holes where 
the trees are to be set. This puts the 
fertilizer right where the tree can take 
advantage of it immediately it puts out 


new feeders, thus enabling the tree to 
put on and maintain a good first growth, 
and by reason of this good first growth, 
the succeeding growths will be much bet¬ 
ter. In other words, this will get your 
tree established in a way impossible if 
you depend upon using the fertilizer after 
the tree has started growth. 

The particular brand of fertilizer does 
not so much matter. There are a num¬ 
ber of excellent brands sold by manufac¬ 
turers and dealers in the state. It should, 
however, contain about the following pro¬ 
portion of chemicals: Ammonia 4 to 6 
per cent.; Phosphoric Acid 7 to 9 per 
cent.; Sulphate of Potash 3 to 5 per cent. 

SETTING THE TREE. 

In setting the tree, generally consid¬ 
ered a simple task, care should be used 
to see that roots are placed as near as 
possible in the same positions they orig¬ 
inally occupied, and to have the earth 
packed very firmly around them. It is 
'a good idea to place your tree in its 
proper position, then pack earth around 
the lower roots with your hands, then 
pour in a bucket of water and allow that 
to settle into the earth. This will firm 
the earth around the roots far better than 
you can do it otherwise. Then fill in 
the hole, and pack the earth down hard 
by stamping it with your feet. After the 
hole has been filled, make a basin of earth 
around the tree, say, a couple of feet 
across and pour in another bucket or two 
of water, and after that has soaked in, 
throw some loose earth over that to pre¬ 
vent scalding. 

Ordinarily trees should be set the same 
depth in the ground they originally were 
in nursery. Nature marks the proper 
earth line, and it is generally a good idea 


152 


FLORIDA STATETMORTI CULTURAL SOCIETY. 


to accept this, not trying to put the tree 
either deeper in the ground or higher out 
of it. 

PROPER SIZED TREES TO SET. 

As to the most desirable sized trees uO 
plant. This is a question about which 
there are many different opinions, but 
my experience and observation has been 
that sizes usually listed in nursery cata¬ 
logues as Standard, are about as good as 
can be used. In deciduous trees, like 
peaches, plums, pears, mulberries, apples, 
persimmons, etc., this means 4 to 6 feet; 
while in citrus trees one year buds 4 to 
5 feet. Either medium size, 3 to 4 feet, 
or extra size, 6 feet and up, is all right, 
and some planters prefer smaller sizes, 
while still others want only two-year old 
buds in citrus trees. Two-year buds of 
deciduous trees are seldom as desirable 
as one-year buds and nothing is to be 
gained by using them, for the one-year 
buds, if thrifty, should give you fruit 


just about as soon and as much as the 
two-year olds. 

But, if good thrifty trees are planted, 
and sizes within reason, the size does not 
count so much. It is the proper care at 
time of planting and afterward that 
makes for success in fruit-growing, pro¬ 
vided always that proper varieties have 
been selected. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Hart—Do you make it a point 
to plant trees in relation to the points 
of the compass; that is, do you plant 
them in exactly the same position as 
they were originally, with the north 
to the north? 

Mr. Frink—No, I don't think that 
makes any difference. Of course, I 
have not had a very long experience, 
but I never could see that it makes 
any difference whatever.

SELECT BULBOUS AND TUBEROUS-ROOTED PLANTS FOR 

FLORIDA GARDENS. 


By H. Nehrling 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Florida is the land of “unlimited pos¬ 
sibilities” as far as ornamental horticul¬ 
ture is concerned. We are able to grow 
in the open hundreds—no, thousands— 
of species of tropical and subtropical 
plants which farther north can only be 
grown with considerable trouble and 
many expenses in glasshouses. I have 
wandered through many parts of our 
country in quest of birds and plants. I 
have sojourned in Texas, and made my 
home for a number of years in the Ozark 
region of south-western Missouri. I have 
lived on the prairies of Illinois, and spent 
my boyhood days in the idyllic forest 
regions of Wisconsin, my native state. 
I have seen all the elaborate gardens 
around Boston, New York, Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, Chicago, Milwaukee, 
Washington, and New Orleans; but no¬ 
where have I found such a wealth of 
beautiful native and exotic plants as in 
Florida, very aptly called the land of sun¬ 
shine and flowers. Even if we were de¬ 
prived of exotic plants, we could make 
glorious gardens from the material found 
in our woodlands and along our water¬ 
courses. Native plants should form the 
foundations of all our gardens. Plant 
first of all the cabbage palmetto, the 
noble Magnolia grandiflora, the sweet bay 


(Magnolia glauca), the loblolly bay 
(Gordonia Lasianthus), the holly (Ilex 
opaca), the dahoon (Ilex Cassine), the 
red cedar (Juniperus Barbadensis), the 
laurel cherry (Prunus Caroliniana), the 
wild olive (Osmanthus Americanus), the 
live-oak (Quercus virens ) 7 and do not 
forget that jewel among climbers, the 
Carolina or Yellow Jessamine (Gelse- 
mium sempervirens). This greets you 
on New Year’s day with a wealth of de¬ 
liciously sweet-scented, yellow flower- 
trumpets. 

Our worthy president has suggested 
to me to read a paper on bulbous and 
tuberous-rooted plants adapted to our soil 
and climate. This suggestion is very 
timely, because only a very limited num¬ 
ber of our people really know what has 
been done along these lines* in recent 
years. It is true, gifted writers of high 
intellect, like P. W. Reasoner and E. N. 
Reasoner, Theo. L. Mead, Walter N. 
Pike, W. C. Steele, Mrs. Jennie S. Per¬ 
kins, and others, have pointed out, time 
and again, the great possibilities of grow¬ 
ing bulbous and tuberous-rooted plants in 
Florida. Many and important have been 
the articles that have appeared from time 
to time in The Florida Agriculturist , and 
in the older volumes of The Farmer and 
Fruit Grower; but as far as I am aware 




154 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the subject has never been treated in a 
systematic manner. 

I begin with the Lily Family ( Lilia - 
ceae ). 

This is a very large group of plants, 
comprising the true Lilies (Lilium), the 
Gloriosas, Sandersonias, Littonias, the 
Tulips, Hyacinths, the Lily of the Valley, 
the Mariposa Lilies (Calochortus), the 
Blue African Lily (Agapanthus), etc. 
The genera Trillium (Wake Robins), 
Erythronium (Dog's-tooth Violet), Bes- 
sera, Blandfordia, Funkia, Milla, Allium, 
Kniphofia (the Tritoma), Albuca, Hem- 
erocallis, etc., all belong to this family. 

Though I have experimented quite ex¬ 
tensively with almost all the genera of 
this family, I have not been successful 
with most of them. The Tulips and 
Hyacinths, which’ form such an important 
part of all the gardens of the North, are 
a failure in Florida. It is useless to 
meddle with them. We have numerous 
tropical bulbous plants, outrivaling them 
in beauty and in easy culture, and only 
these should be largely planted in our 
gardens. 

The true Lilies (Lilium) are the gems 
of this noble family. They all belong to 
the Northern Hemisphere, being num¬ 
erously represented in the cool mountain 
glens of the Californian Sierra Nevada 
and Coast Range, and reaching their 
greatest beauty and highest development 
in Japan. China is likewise rich in fine 
Lilies, and some of the most beautiful 
are found in the Himalayas. They abound 
in Europe and Northern Asia, and some 
of the species attracting the attention of 
all flower-lovers grow in our northern 
meadows (L. Canadense, L. superbum 
and L. Philadelphicum). One species, 
Catesby’s Lily (L. Catesbaei), grows 
abundantly in the flatwoods of our own 


State. Its large, orange-yellow, upright 
flower chalices, spotted with deep-brown, 
'form glorious masses of rich color in 
September. The bulb is small, but is 
easily transplanted to our gardens in rich, 
moist soil. It seeds freely, and batches 
of young plants are usually found around 
the old bulb. Though I have experi¬ 
mented quite extensively with most of the 
species ,of the jtrue Lilies; I have not 
found their behavior encouraging. This 
was, however, at a time when I did not 
understand the soil and climate of Flor¬ 
ida thoroughly. Even at the North, most 
Lilies are very capricious. They thrive 
splendidly for a time; then they suddenly 
disappear. Since I began the cultivation 
of bulbous plants in a systematic way 
under sheds and in well-prepared soil, I 
have had better results. 

None of the European Lilies, not even 
the chaste Madonna Lily (Lilium candi- 
dum) of Southern Europe, will grow 
here. The species of our northern states 
are also a failure. The gigantic Hum¬ 
boldt’s Lily (L. Humboldtii), and the 
fragrant Washington Lily (L. Washing- 
tonianum), being sojourners of the high 
and cool mountain regions of California 
refused to grow with me. The only 
American Lilies which may finally, after 
many generations, adapt themselves to 
our soil and climate, are the Californian 
L. Parryi, a very fragrant lemon-yellow 
species, and the vigorous L. pardalinum. 
Both have flowered with me, but they 
died shortly after the blossoms had faded. 

The Golden-banded Lily of Japan (L. 
auratum) and its varieties, the most im¬ 
posing and beautiful of all the Lilies and 
the most fragrant, has not proved a suc¬ 
cess with me; though some bulbs made 
a vigorous growth at first. The Japan 
Lily (L. speciosum) and its varieties, L.

speciosum album, L. speciosum rubrum, 
and Melpomene, grow much better and 
bloom abundantly. They seem to do best 
in pots on verandas; but I have had them 
frequently in flower in the well-drained, 
rich and moist soil of my shed. All are 
very beautiful and exhale a delicious per¬ 
fume. 

Henry’s Lily (L. Henryi), discovered 
several years ago in the mountains of 
Junnan, in southern China, by Dr. Au¬ 
gustine Henry, grows vigorously in 
Florida. It has been termed the “Or- 
. ange-yellow Speciosum Lily.” Its con¬ 
stitution is robust; the plant growing 
four to six feet high and bearing from 
ten to twenty rich, orange-yellow blos¬ 
soms, well set off by its ample deep-green 
foliage. I have crosses now growing 
vigorously between this species and L. 
speciosum rubrum. 

The Tiger Lily (L. tigrinum), a Chi¬ 
nese species which has been repeatedly 
reported to be successfully grown in our 
State, never made itself at home in my 
garden. • 

The most satisfactory of all the true 
Lilies, growing admirably in Florida, 
provided they are well cared Apr, are 
those belonging to Endlicher’s Eulirion 
group—the Funnel-flowered Lilies. We 
all are acquainted with the Easter Lily 
(L. Harrisii), a variety of the Japanese 
L. longiflorum, carrying a magnificent 
crown of long-tubed, snowy-white, frag¬ 
rant blossoms, usually at Easter time, on 
a stem two to three feet high. L. longi¬ 
florum has branched out in quite a num¬ 
ber of distinct and superior varieties. The 
type usually only bears one or two flow¬ 
ers; the Easter, or Bermuda Lily (L. 
longiflorum Harrisii), usually from four 
to six. L. longiflorum giganteum is an 


improvement on the last-named variety. 
It is of very free growth, carrying from 
six to ten flowers on each stem. They 
are large and well-formed, of great sub¬ 
stance and purity,, lasting a long time 
when cut. The finest variety of all is 
undoubtedly L. longiflorum Takesima 
grandiflorum, very strong-growing, with 
glossy foliage and dark-brown stems, 
bearing from six to ten long tubular 
flowers, white inside and tinged with 
brown externally. All these Lilies have 
proved a perfect success with me, flower¬ 
ing abundantly in the latter part of April 
and early in May. 

Have you ever seen the beautiful L. 
Brownii in bloom? The form of the 
flower reminds one of the last-named 
species, but the outside is a deep choco¬ 
late brown. Of still greater beauty is its 
variety, L. Brownii leucanthum. It is ’ 
more or less ruddy-brown externally, 
milk-white inside, with a rich yellow 
throat. The type is rather difficult to 
grow, while its variety grows as easily 
as the L. longifl’orum varieties. 

In 1872 the celebrated botanical col¬ 
lector, Gustav Wallis, discovered a beauti¬ 
ful funnel-shaped Lily in the Philippine 
Islands, the L. Philippense, which was 
scientifically described by Baker in 1873. 
At that time it did not attract much at¬ 
tention. Only recently, since the United 
States has taken possession of the islands, 
this lily has become better known and 
American firms have distributed it 
largely. Though occurring in a tropical 
country it has proved*hardy even in Ohio. 
The stems are rather slender, and the 
grass-like leaves grow all along the stems, 
as in all true lilies. Usually only one pure 
white flower is carried on the extremity 
of each stem. The flowers exhale a de¬ 
licious perfume. It grows well in my 


156 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


garden, and I have raised quite a number 
of seedlings from it. 

The Neilgherry Lily (L. Neilgher- 
rense) is another species adapted to our 
soil and climate. Coming from the 
mountains of the Indian peninsula, where 
it grows in great abundance, in the rich 
vegetable mold of half-shady positions, it 
is not quite hardy here in Florida. It 
insists on pushing up its stems late in 
autumn and during winter, and therefore 
js easily damaged by one of our cold 
spells; though it can stand a few degrees 
of frost with impunity. The flowers are 
pure white and very fragrant. 

Wallich’s Lilv, also known as the Sul- 
phur Lily or the Himalayan Lily (Lilium 
sulphureum, syn. L. Wallichianum) is a 
native of the Himalayas, at an altitude 
of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet, growing in 
the same places with the tree-like Rhodo¬ 
dendrons (R. barbatum, R. arboreum, R. 
grande, R. Falconeri, etc.) which are 
awaiting introduction into our gardens; 
when in bloom it transforms the moun¬ 
tain sides into an earthly paradise. It is 
a vigorous grower, with large funnel- 
shaped flowers, rich yellow inside, tinted 
rosy and brown outside, of a rich fra¬ 
grance ; it produces small bulbs at the 
base of the leaves like L. tigrinum. I 
have had this lily in good condition for 
years; but a species of burrowing mouse, 
so common in Florida, destroyed these 
and many other Lily bulbs last winter. 
A few days ago I received another con¬ 
signment of bulbs of this and the next 
species from Burma. ^ This species, with 
some protection, has proved perfectly 
hardy near Boston. 

The Nepal Lily (L. Nepalense) is my 
special favorite. It grows wild in the 
western and central portions of the Hima¬ 
layas, and has recently been collected in 
quantity in Burma. The slightly fra¬ 


grant flowers have a purplish crimson 
tube, and the segments are broadly tipped 
with creamy white—a most beautiful 
color combination. Though growing at 
a higher altitude than the last-named 
species, it is much more delicate. 

For all the true Lilies I have found the 
following mode of culture the one most 
likely to give good results. Prepare a 
bed under half shade. Dig out the soil 
to the depth of three feet, and place on 
the bottom a layer of oak trunks. Cover 
this with a mixture of rich muck, leaf- 
soil, old cow-manure, along with some 
lime and a liberal quantity of crushed 
charcoal. Fill up to the rim. Mix thor¬ 
oughly, and dig the bed repeatedly be¬ 
fore planting. All the bulbs should be 
planted in November or early in Decem¬ 
ber. Surround each bulb (which should 
be covered with three inches of soil) 
with crushed charcoal, and press the soil 
firmly around it. When in full growth, 
I apply a small quantity of Painter’s Si¬ 
mon Pure garden fertilizer. This also 
helps to keep out the burrowing mice, 
which are so destructive to all the Lily 
bulbs. Never order Lily bulbs in spring 
—they are always a failure. I also sur¬ 
round all my choice Lily plants with 
broken bricks and stones. This helps to 
keep the soil cool, an essential point in 
Lily culture. The Lily will never flour¬ 
ish where the surface of the soil becomes 
hot. Almost all the Lilies are in full 
growth in our dry season. If the growth is 
in any way checked during this time, they 
invariably perish; with the exception of 
the L. longiflorum section. For this rea¬ 
son they must be kept well watered. 

THE GENUS GLORIOSA, OR CLIMBING LILIES 

In the foregoing I have pointed out 
that the true Lilies need careful attention, 
if success is to follow. It is quite differ-

ent with the Gloriosas. They are per¬ 
fectly at home in Florida. No plants are 
grown more easily and with less care. 
Deep rich soil, and a support to climb 
upon are all they require. They are all 
tropical plants, one species being found 
in India and the others in Central Africa. 
This genus, evidently so closely allied to 
the true Lilies when we consider the foli¬ 
age and flowers, is a puzzle to the biol¬ 
ogist as far as the rootstock is concerned. 
In the Lilies we have typical bulbs made 
up of numerous loose scales; while Glori¬ 
osas .have peculiarly shaped solid tubers, 
giving no clue to their relationship. 

The most magnificent of all the species 
is the new Uganda Climbing Lily 
(Gloriosa Rothschildiana). It starts 
into growth with me by the middle of 
April, and is in full flower by the middle 
of May. (Some varieties, however, start 
much later.) It is a very vigorous grower, 
climbing to a height of from six to ten 
feet. The flowers, as in all the species, 
are axillary, near the ends of the stems. 
The points of the leaves are provided with 
tendril-like apices, with which the plant 
fastens itself to bushes and tall herbage. 
The flowers are large and very gorgeous, 
lily-like, with reflexed segments, and of 
a dazzling orange-scarlet color with yel¬ 
low edges. Each stem bears from eight 
to ten flowers, which open successively; 
the lower ones first and the terminal ones 
last. This species was discovered several 
years ago' in Uganda, Africa, and was 
introduced into cultivation by Lord Wal¬ 
ter Rothschild of Tring, England; from 
whom I received about a dozen tubers in 
the spring of 1905. 

The Malabar Glory Lily (G. superba) 
starts into growth much later, usually not 
before the beginning of June. It is also 


a very strong grower and exceedingly 
floriferous, each stem producing from ten 
to thirty of its showy blossoms. The 
stems, attaining a height of from six to 
ten feet, often throw out side-shoots at 
their tops. The flowers are rather dis¬ 
appointing at first, from the predominance 
of green in them; but after a few days, 
bright orange-yellow hues supersede the 
green almost entirely. Nothing can be 
more striking than this lily in full bloom, 
clambering over a flowering specimen of 
Pleroma macranthum. The bright, glow¬ 
ing, orange-yellow flowers of the Glori¬ 
osa, and the large, glossy, bluish-purple 
blossoms of the Pleroma, show a charm¬ 
ing and strikingly beautiful contrast. I 
have fertilized this species with the pollen 
of G. Rothschildiana and vice versa; and 
I have now quite a number of promising 
hybrids from both species. In 1906 I 
raised several hundred seedlings of the 
Malabar Glory Lily, and most of them 
flowered last year. I have never noticed 
such a variation as was displayed here, 
though the plant was crossed with its own 
pollen. Some plants were strong grow¬ 
ers ; others showed a weak constitution. 
Many had broad, large leaves; others 
small and narrow foliage. But the great¬ 
est difference was displayed in the blos¬ 
soms ; the color ranging from a dull yel¬ 
lowish green to the deepest orange-yel¬ 
low. Some of the flowers even were pure 
yellow. 

The Mozambique Glory Lily (G. vire- 
scens), as its name implies, was intro¬ 
duced from Mozambique. Its prevailing 
color is yellow, with some green. 

Leopold’s Glory Lily (G. Leopoldii) 
seems to be intermediate between two 
already mentioned. The flowers are pure 
yellow when opening, changing finally to 


158 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


a much brighter and deeper hue. The 
segments show rosy-red streaks and spots 
in the center. 

A friend of mine in France sent me 
this spring an evidently new species, 
which was collected on the Congo. The 
tuber is very thick and shaped like a 
wedge, not branched in tomahawk-like 
fashion as in other species. 

Plant in deep, rich soil; either near a 
shrub over which the plant may clamber, 
or give a bamboo stem with branches left 
intact as a support. Do not disturb the 
tuber for a number of years; and give, 
each spring, an application of good com¬ 
mercial fertilizer. 

Sandersonia aurantiaca and Littonia 
modesta are allied plants from Natal. 
Both have bell-shaped, yellow-orange 
blossoms; both are climbers and both 
grow well in Florida. 

Tritomas (Kniphofia) grow well in 
Florida, and Fowler 'in profusion; but 
they need attention and good soil rich in 
humus, not too dry and not too wet. An 
application each spring of cow manure 
as a top-dressing is essential to their wel¬ 
fare. Several years ago I had a collec¬ 
tion of about twenty-five different sorts. 
They were planted out on rather high 
and dry pine-land, where they grew fairly 
well. A few years later I intended to 
improve their condition, and prepared a 
bed in the rich soil near the lake. When 
the rainy season came, the bed was soon 
entirely submerged; and my entire col¬ 
lection, consisting of several hundred 
plants, was lost. All the Tritomas are 
natives of Africa. 

The Day Lily (Hemerocallis) grows 
as well in Florida as anywhere else, soon 
forming large and conspicuous clumps of 
great beauty. Though the individual 
flower only lasts one day, the blossoms 
are produced in such abundance, and are 


so showy, that Day Lilies should find a 
place in every garden. The most vigor¬ 
ous grower is the common Tawny Day 
Lily (H. fulva), with large lily-like, 
tawny-orange flowers. The double form 
of this (H. fulva fl. pi.) and another 
double form from Japan (H. Kwanso fl. 
pi.)—the latter with strikingly varie¬ 
gated foliage—deserves extensive dissem- 
mination. 

The Lemon Day Lily (H. flava) is an 
exceedingly beautiful plant, with large 
lemon colored flowers, strongly fragrant. 

I also grew H. Middendorffii with 
golden yellow flowers, and H. Thunbergii 
with sweet-scented bright yellow blos¬ 
soms, and some hybrids which I raised 
from the various species. 

Day Lilies require a yery rich soil. 
They are splendid objects among, or in 
front, of shrubbery. 

THE IRIS FAMILY (iRIDACEAE). 

This very large family is rich in first- 
class garden plants, comprising such well- 
known genera as Gladiolus, Watsonia, 
Antholyza, Crocus, Babiana. I x i a, 
Sparaxis, Moraea, Tigridia, Montbretia, 
etc.; but the most important is the genus 
Iris itself. About 175 species of Iris are 
known to science. With the exception 
of a few North African species, all are 
natives of the North Temperate Zone, 
inhabiting North America, Asia and Eu¬ 
rope. The most important of all, and 
the most easily grown, is the German Iris 
(Iris Germanica), the glory of northern 
gardens in June. It is a failure in Flor¬ 
ida. When I made the State my per¬ 
manent home, in 1902, I brought with 
me about a thousand rhizomes, in about 
forty distinct and beautiful garden forms. 
They died out one after the other, and 
in three years none were left. This Iris 
is so beautiful that it is worth all the

trouble to grow it. I have had the dwarf 
Iris pumila in flower in the autumn 
months. Some plants which were set out 
on my place in 1886, were still in exist¬ 
ence in 1896; but they never made much 
growth. 

In moist rich soil the Japanese Iris 
(I. laevigata) flourishes with all the vigor 
of a native plant. It will not grow on 
high dry pine-land or in poor soil. The 
soil must be rich in humus. A rich black 
vegetable mold near the edge of the water 
is just the right place for this exquisitely 
beautiful plant. Before planting add a 
very liberal amount of old cow-manure 
to the soil; also apply good commercial 
fertilizer early in spring, just before 
flowering. There is such a wealth of rich 
and delicate colors in the different vari¬ 
eties, and they flower so abundantly, that 
it seems strange that they are not grown 
more in Florida. There are hundreds of 
fine varieties, single and double, which 
almost all originated in Japanese gardens. 

Our Florida Iris (I. hexagona) should 
not be omitted from this list; as it is a 
very beautiful and easily grown plant, 
growing well where the Japanese species 
flourishes. There is also a pure white 
form of it. This species offers a good 
field for the hybridizer. 

The Roof Iris (I. tectorum) of Japan 
thrives finely in my garden in half shade 
and in rich moist soil. As its name im¬ 
plies, it grows largely on the straw roofs 
of Japanese houses. 

There are undoubtedly numerous spe¬ 
cies of the rhizomatous Irises which will 
thrive splendidly in our gardens. I only 
experimented with them in a limited way; 
but hope to take up the genus as a spe¬ 
cialty in the near future. 

I have never planted the bulbous Irises, 
such as the English and Spanish, and I 


Nazarina, I. Sarii and I. Bismarckiana 
have found Iris Susiana, I. Iberica, I. 
a failure. In their native home they rest 
in a dry hot soil during the summer and 
autumn months; while here they grow 
and flower in the dry season, April and 
May, and rest in the rainy season, which 
invariably makes the thick rhizomes rot. 

To Mr. E. N. Reasoner belongs the 
credit of having introduced to our gar¬ 
dens an Iris-like plant, which is at once 
a most vigorous grower and an abundant 
bloomer. It is at home on our high, dry 
pine-land, and also in moister soil, but it 
will not flourish in places where our wild 
Iris and the Japanese Iris thrive best. 
This is the Natal Iris (Moraea iridioi- 
des), a veritable jewel for our gardens. 
If well cared for, it will soon form large 
clumps and will flower four or five times 
during the spring and summer months. 
In order to see it at its best, it should 
be planted in groups or large beds. The 
flowers are three to four inches across, 
pure white, and marked with deep yellow 
on the claws of the outer segments; the 
style is marked with blue—a very strik¬ 
ing combination of colors. 

The Blackberry Lily (Pardanthus Chi- 
nensis) comes up from self-sown seed 
everywhere in my garden. Antholyza 
Aethiopica and other species, Watsonias, 
and Montbretias grow all well, but I 
never have been successful with the Tigri- 
dias, which grew to perfection in my gar¬ 
den in Texas. 

The Gladiolus (the Gandavensis as 
well as the Childsii and Groff varieties) 
grows as well in Florida as in other 
southern states. I prefer the Gladiolus 
Childsii varieties on account of their 
vigorous growth, large and finely formed 
flowers, and gorgeous colors. This strain 
was produced by the celebrated hybrid- 


160 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


izer, Max Leichtlin, of Baden-Baden, 
Germany. 

Last year I received from my friend, 
Dr. Walter Van Fleet, another celebrated 
hybridizer, a number of tropical African 
kinds. Among them G. Quartinianus, 
with dazzling red flowers having an or¬ 
ange-yellow throat. These flower in Oc¬ 
tober and November, at a time when all 
other Gladioli have gone to rest. They 
are all vigorous growers, and the stems 
attain to a height of from three to five 
feet. 

The Gladiolus also does best in half¬ 
shade, and the soil should be made rich 
with old cow-manure. The flowers are 
not of long duration here in Florida, and 
therefore the stem should be cut when 
the first flower opens. Placed in the house 
in a vase, all the flowers will open, and 
they last much longer in this condition 
and give much better satisfaction. 

THE AMARYLLIS FAMILY. (AMARYLLI- 

DACEAE.) 

The word Amaryllis sounds to me like 
poetry. No other word is so charming 
to my ear. The mere thought of it carries 
me away into the world of my ideals. 
Noble form, gorgeous colors, indescriba¬ 
ble beauty, refinement, delicacy, delicious 
fragrance—all these attributes are com¬ 
bined in the Amaryllis. I have given 
up the cultivation of Orchids in order to 
devote all my time, my undivided interest, 
to these plants. I came to Florida with 
the sole object in rny mind of growing 
and hybridizing Amaryllis. I bought my 
place in 1883 with the view to make the 
cultivation of Amaryllis my specialty. 
When I say Amaryllis, I mean the word 
in the broader sense of the Amaryllis 
family. This noble family comprises such 
superb genera as Amaryllis, Hippeastrum, 


Crinum, Hymenocallis, Pancratium, Is- 
mene, Griffinia, Eucharis, Haemanthus, 
Ammocharis, Buphane, Brunsvigia, Spre- 
kelia, Lycoris, Nerine, Vallota, Habran- 
thus, Zephyranthes, Cooperia, Clivia, Al- 
stroemeria, etc.—all names sounding 
familiar to those who take a deeper in¬ 
terest in floriculture, all very important 
and beautiful garden plants. Though 
closely allied to the true Lilies—which 
they not only rival but eclipse, alike in 
beauty and fragrance—they are of 
much easier culture, and flower more 
abundantly. 

I am sorry to say that I have not been 
successful in flowering the true Amaryllis 
or Belladonna Lily (Amaryllis Bella¬ 
donna) a native of South Africa. I am 
of the opinion that this is the most ex¬ 
quisite of all bulbous plants. It invaria¬ 
bly flowers in August, before the leaves 
appear; and the large finely formed blos¬ 
soms, varying from a delicate pink to a 
deep purplish rose, exhale a very strong 
and delicious perfume—the very ideal of 
perfumes. 

About ten years ago, I planted several 
hundred bulbs, partly on high dry soil, 
partly on lower land, and partly in a half 
shady position. All grew well and multi¬ 
plied rapidly and those on low ground 
flourished best; but not one bulb ever 
flowered. In Texas, and even much 
farther north, and also in California, the 
Belladonna Lily flowers profusely. Evi¬ 
dently it needs a heavier soil, or it may 
dislike our wet summers. 

The most valuable, the most gorgeous, 
and the most showy of all bulbous plants 
are undoubtedly the Hippeastrum species 
and hybrids, everywhere known as the 
Amaryllis. The scientific name which 
was given to this genus by Dean Herbert, 
the great Amaryllis specialist, means

Knight’s Star. They are all natives of 
the American Tropics, occurring in a 
wild state in the rich vegetable mold of 
the primeval forest; in cool mountain 
glens; among the grass of the llanos; or 
even as epiphytes on trees, among Or¬ 
chids, Bromeliads, Aroids, Ferns, etc. One 
species, the Blue Amaryllis (Hippeastrum 
procerum), grows in the full tropical sun 
on rocks near Petropolis, Brazil. When 
in flower all the species are strikingly 
beautiful—so beautiful that even the dull 
Indian or the indolent peon cannot help 
pausing a moment to admire them. With 
the exception of the fancy-leafed Cala- 
diums, no plants in our Florida gardens 
are admired as much or create such en¬ 
thusiasm as the various Amaryllis and 
their still more gorgeous hybrids. When 
I saw the first clumps of Johnson’s Ama¬ 
ryllis in a garden in Houston, Texas, in 
May, 1879, I stood speechless. Their en¬ 
chanting beauty, their brilliant color and 
refined form overpowered me. From that 
time on to the present day, I made the 
cultivation of this class of plants my spe¬ 
cialty. I entered a field with unlimited 
possibilities. I began to collect the vari¬ 
ous species from their native countries, 
and added the best hybrids from Eu¬ 
ropean collections. I began myself to 
hybridize with excellent results from the 
start. This was about thirty years ago; 
and at present my own hybrids rival in 
beauty of color, perfect form and sub¬ 
stance, the best European collections. I 
grow at present all the species that could 
be obtained, with all the best old and re¬ 
cent hybrids of European plant breeders; 
and my collection of named hybrids con¬ 
sists of about a thousand different vari¬ 
eties. 

All the species are most valuable gar¬ 
den plants here in Florida. There are 


about fifteen species in cultivation, and 
about as many varieties or local forms of 
the different species. 

I11 April, most of the Florida gardens 
are aglow with gorgeous masses of the 
Orang'e Amaryllis or Orange Lily (Hip¬ 
peastrum equestre). It revels in the ap 
parently poor sandy soil, soon forming 
imposing clumps which produce numer¬ 
ous stems, each carrying two large, some¬ 
what nodding, bright orange-red flowers, 
with a yellowish-white star. Planted in 
large groups or beds, these Amaryllis in 
full flower produce a magnificent sight, 
being far more beautiful than Tulips and 
other bedding plants of the northern gar¬ 
den. Planted around palms and in front 
of shrubbery, they are particularly ef¬ 
fective. They form a charming picture 
in long lines on borders, and along ver¬ 
andas, backed by such beautiful shrubs 
the sky-blue Eranthemum (Daedalacan- 
thus nervosus), and the deep-blue Thun- 
bergia erecta, which flowers at the same 
time. This species is a native of the 
West Indies, Central America and North¬ 
ern South America. A beautiful form 
(H. equestre Wolteri) was lately intro¬ 
duced into cultivation from Costa Rica. 
Its flowers are glowing deep orange-scar¬ 
let. 

The double Orange Amaryllis (H. 
equestre Alberti) is common in the gar¬ 
dens of Havana, and is frequently found 
under cultivation in Florida. Its flowers 
last considerably longer than those of the 
single form. 

Johnson’s Amaryllis, the so-called 
Scarlet Lily (Hippeastrum Johnsoni), is 
one of our most valuable garden plants. 
It does not thrive as well in our state as 
in Texas, at Mobile or at Charleston, but 
I have seen magnificent clumps, beds, and 
long borders of it in Orlando. With a 


162

little care it will thrive everywhere in 
the State. The flowers are produced on 
stems about two feet high, and each stem 
carries a magnificent umbel of from four 
to six large trumpet-shaped blossoms. 
The ground color is a very brilliant 
cherry-red, and each segment has a dis¬ 
tinct white band. It exhales a delicate 
aromatic fragrance, which becomes quite 
powerful when thousands of flowers are 
open at the same time. This is the first 
hybrid that was ever raised.- In the be¬ 
ginning of the last century, an English 
watchmaker by the j’name of Johnson, 
crossed Hippeastrum vittatum with H. 
Reginae, and the result was this fine 
Amaryllis, which flowered for the first 
time in 1810. Thousands of hybrids 
soon followed, but this is the only one 
which has held its own—“the survival of 
the fittest.” It is so beautiful that it 
should find a place in every garden in 
Florida. 

Hippeastrum Reginae is said to be a 
native of Mexico and the West Indies to 
Brazil and Peru. I have not succeeded 
in obtaining it from its native wilds. A 
bulb received from Europe about ten 
years ago has only formed two offsets 
so far. It grows well and flowers reg¬ 
ularly each year. The color is a glowing 
scarlet, with a greenish-white star. My 
plants are evergreen. 

H. vittatum exhibits funnel-shaped, 
slightly fragrant flowers. The ground 
color is pure white, with broad white 
bands, which are bordered on each side 
by a very distinct purplish-crimson stripe. 
Its native home is in the rather dry re¬ 
gions of the Andes of Peru. This species 
grows much better in California than in 
the humid climate of Florida, and most 
of the Amaryllis hybrids, have origin¬ 
ated in the former state, are produc¬ 


tions of this species. No other species 
has been used so much for hybridizing 
purposes in bygone days. Very beautiful 
forms were frequently obtained. They 
were, however, weak growers. They had 
small, long-tubed flowers with narrow 
segments, and the form was invariably 
imperfect. For this reason, neither the 
species nor its hybrids are used any 
longer by the best plant-breeders. I have 
abandoned its use long ago. 

The Funnel-shaped Amaryllis (H. 
solandri florum), I have received repeat¬ 
edly from Caracas, Venezuela. It is de¬ 
ciduous, like the last-named, and grows 
abundantly on the grassy plains or 
llanos. The color is greenish-white and 
the tube is about ten inches long. It 
exhales a very strong fragrance. 

H. solandri florum conspicuum. This 
is one of the most beautiful Amaryllis in 
existence and deliciously fragrant. The 
flowers are long trumpet-shaped, some¬ 
what reminding one of the Easter Lily; 
and its stems, which carry a magnificent 
umbel of from six to eight flowers, grow 
three to four feet high. The ground 
color varies from pure white to deep pink, 
striped and lined with deep purplish-red, 
and suffused a little with scarlet. It is 
much superior to the type. Some years ago 
a friend of mine in San Jose, Costa Rica, 
whom I had asked to keep an eye on 
the different wild and cultivated forms 
of Amaryllis in Costa Rica, informed me 
that only H. vittatum was growing abun¬ 
dantly in the gardens. He sent me at the 
same time a few bulbs. When opening 
the box, I saw at once that it could not 
be H. vittatum, as the bulbs were of 
different form, and they were covered, 
moreover, with deep brownish-black 
tunics, while in H. vittatum they are light 
grayish-brown. When the bulbs began

to bloom a few weeks later, I recognized 
them at once as the above-named variety. 
A little later I received another lot of a 
hundred bulbs, which are now growing 
beautifully here in my garden. I have 
used them largely in my hybridizing 
work, with the following points in view: 
first, to introduce vigor and strong 
growth into my strain; second, to make 
my Amaryllis hybrids fragrant; and 
third, to obtain a more numerous flowered 
umbel. After having accomplished this, 

I never used the variety again. The first 
and second generation of seedlings had 
comparatively long tubes, but in the third, 
the wide open form and the short tube 
predominated. I still grow this Amaril- 
lis, however, for its own sake, and I 
always greatly admire it when in bloom. 
The long blunt leaves have a decidedly 
glaucous green color. 

The Parrot Amaryllis (H. psittaci- 
num), from southern Brazil, is not a gor¬ 
geously colored species; but it has been 
very fruitful in the production of first- 
class hybrids. The celebrated hybrid, 
“Empress of India/' raised by De Graaft 
Bros., of Leyden, Holland, one of the 
parents of the new race of show Ama¬ 
ryllis, was raised from this species. The 
tube is very short. The ground color is ' 
greenish-white and all the segments have 
a crimson edge and a green keel, with 
crimson stripes radiating from the keel. 
At one time, common in cultivation, it 
is at present difficult to obtain true to 
name. It grows vigorously in Florida, 
and is very interesting. 

H. rutilum is perhaps the most com¬ 
mon Amaryllis in the forests of southern^ 
Brazil near Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, 
etc., branching out in a number of very 
beautiful and distinct varieties. All are 
stoloniferous, producing numerous blind 


offsets around the base of the bulb, which 
may lie dormant for years. In the type 
the flowers are bright crimson with a 
green keel extending half-way up the seg¬ 
ments. In Milwaukee, where the Amaryl¬ 
lis belongs to the most popular house 
plants, I frequently noticed a beautiful 
bright yellow Amaryllis suffused with or¬ 
ange. It was even more common than 
Amaryllis Johnsoni. I frequently saw spe¬ 
cimens with io to 20 flowers all open at 
the same time. These specimens usually 
flower twice a year and the bulbs multi¬ 
ply rapidly by offsets. This Amaryllis 
proved to be H. rutilum fulgidum, from 
southern Brazil. I procured a few bulbs 
and planted them out in my Florida gar¬ 
den, where they soon formed imposing 
specimens. A former Floridian, a grad¬ 
uate of Rollins College, now in the em¬ 
ploy of the Brazilian Government as a 
horticultural expert, Prof. Adolf Hempel, 
sent me another beautiful variety, H. ru¬ 
tilum equestriforme, a very strong grow- 
ing kind. The flowers remind one some¬ 
what of an Orange Amaryllis. There is 
also a yellow form, H. rutilum citrinum, 
and a saffron colored subspecies, H. ru¬ 
tilum crocatum. These two forms, which 
would be very important for hybridizing 
purposes, I have not yet been able to add 
to my collection. 

H. aulicum, the Lily of the Palace, 
and its fine variety, H. aulicum platy- 
petalum, are natives of the Organ moun¬ 
tains, Brazil, where they grow abundantly 
among old rotten wood in shady places. 
Another still more floriferous varietv H 
aulicum robustum, comes from Blume- 
nau, southern Brazil. They all have 
beautiful glossy evergreen leaves, and all 
flower about Christmas or New Year’s 
time. The form of the large, widely 
open flowers is rather unsymmetrical

from a florist’s point of view, and the 
color is a deep, dazzling crimson, very 
glowing and rich. My first attempt to 
grow these plants in the open proved a 
failure. They need a rich vegetable soil, 
and a liberal supply of old, well rotted 
cow-manure. As they all are evergreens 
and flower in winter, thev also need some 
protection. I now grow them in beds 
surrounded by boards, so as to be easily 
covered, when cold weather sets in. The 
soil consists of half-rotten wood, old cow- 
manure and black soil from the mucky 
edge of the lake. In this compost the 
plants grow vigorously and flower abun¬ 
dantly. When in full growth they also 
receive a liberal application of commer¬ 
cial fertilizer, preferably bone-meal. This 
species and its varieties belong to the 
most important ancestors of our new race 
of show Amaryllis. 

H. Organense, also from the Organ 
Mountains, is similar to the above, 
though quite distinct when closely 
studied. It is a vigorous grower and 
flowers in winter with H. aulicum. It 
thrives luxuriantly with the same treat¬ 
ment. 

H. pardinum. This exquisite species 
was discovered in 1866 by the late Mr. 
Pearce, in the Andes of Peru. It flow¬ 
ered first in 1867, and created a sensa¬ 
tion among flower lovers, on account of 
its fine form and unique coloration. The 
short-tubed, star-like flowers have a 
greenish-white ground color, and are pro¬ 
fusely and minutely spotted with crim¬ 
son. Some of the varieties have a de¬ 
cided yellowish ground color and some 
are, in addition to the spots, flushed with 
red. This species has opened a new field 
for the hybridizer. The progeny, how¬ 
ever, though of very beautiful form, is 
of weak constitution. I have used it at 


first but have finally abandoned it. The 
influence of this species is still noticeable 
in many of my hybrids, which are min¬ 
utely spotted with deep red on a white 
or pink ground. 

H. Leopoldi, Leopold's Amaryllis. This 
species was also discovered by the late 
Mr. Pearce, in the Andes of Peru, and 
it flowered first in cultivation in 1870. 
It is so beautiful and distinct, so perfect 
in form and so refined, and its color is 
so unique and so strikingly gorgeous, 
that Amaryllis lovers at once placed it 
at the head of the entire group. The 
ideal of perfect form and exquisite color 
combination had at last appeared, and it 
was used at once in cross-breeding. The 
very large flowers are short-tubed. The 
ground color is a beautiful bright red in 
the center, with a bifid white keel in the 
lower half of the red, and a large green¬ 
ish-white throat; the tips of all the seg¬ 
ments are white. The beautiful perfect 
form of our new race of show Amaryllis, 
their broad rounded segments, and their 
great substance have been derived from 
this species. No other species has in¬ 
fluenced the progeny in such a decided 
manner. The grand hybrids raised by 
James Veitch and Sons, London, the still 
finer Aigburth hybrids, produced by Robt. 
P. Ker and Sons, of Liverpool, and the 
Westorbirt strain of Col. G. L. Holford, 
the finest of all, were only possible after 
H. Leopoldi had been introduced. I also 
used this species largely in my cross¬ 
breeding. Many of my hybrids show its 
influence, not only in form but also in 
color, though I have lost the species long 
ago. 

The foregoing is a list of Amaryllis 
which I have grown, and which I mostly 
still grow. All of the species and vari¬ 
eties mentioned have been used in cross- 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

breeding. Though the blood of H. vit- 
tatum has been avoided, it is still tracea¬ 
ble through H. Johnsoni, a hybrid of this 
species and H. Reginae. I have not been 
able to use H. aulicum, but its blood, 
nevertheless, flows in the veins of my 
strain, as I used H. Ackermanni pucher- 
rimum largely in my hybridization work, 
and this is a cross between H. aulicum 
and H. Johnsoni. 

Though I have cultivated and raised 
Amaryllis since 1879, I did not start 
cross-breeding on a large scale before the 
year 1890. In the year named, I added to 
my collection a few dozen of De Graaff’s 
best hybrids and many of Veitch’s new 
productions, such as Southey, Enchantress 
Madonna, Giant, Giantess, etc. Em¬ 
press of India, a magnificent kind with 
broad rounded segments, and of a glow¬ 
ing orange-scarlet color with broad white 
bands, was my starting-point. My aim 
was to produce a vigorous strain with 
short tubes and broad rounded segments, 
of symmetrical form and good substance. 
The first attempts were very encouraging 
and the resulting hybrids were far su¬ 
perior to their parents. But the seedlings 
were very much alike. In order to obtain 
new breaks of color, I used these hybrids 
as well as those obtained from Europe, 
in crossing them with the various species 
in my possession and vice versa. Finally 
many thousands of seedlings were grow¬ 
ing in my greenhouse in Milwaukee. The 
first began to flower at an age of three 
years. I watched their development with 
a restless anticipation. Most of these 
hybrids were inferior to one or both of 
their parents, but new colors were abun¬ 
dant. I only kept a few of the best, and 
all the rest were discarded. The most 
beautiful of all were the crosses between 
the best show Amaryllis and H. Leo- 


poldii. Hybrids between Empress of 
Iirdia and H. equestre exhibited fine or¬ 
ange and salmon-red tints. This cross¬ 
breeding and weeding out of all inferior 
kinds was continued for many years, un¬ 
til the colors were fixed. Since 1900, 
I have not made much use of the species 
any longer, only using now in cross¬ 
breeding the best of my own hybrids. I 
also employ frequently, as pollen plants, 
such English hybrids as have received a 
first-class certificate or an award of merit 
from the Royal Horticultural Society of 
London. 

All my hybrids at present combine a 
vigorous growth and brilliancy of color 
with a fine open symmetrical form and 
great substance. The usual size of the 
flowers of the true species is from five 
to six inches, in the new race of show 
hybrids it ranges from seven to eleven 
inches. They range in color from an 
almost pure white to a deep glowing crim¬ 
son, without a trace of any other color. 
There is rarely a poor flower in a batch 
of a thousand seedlings. The green star 
in the center of the tube, so prevailing in 
the species and the older hybrids, and 
so objectionable to the florist and ex¬ 
hibitor, no longer mars the beauty of the 
flowers. It has given place to a pure 
white or a yellowish tint. The variety of 
colors is really marvelous in these new 
hybrids. There are numerous kinds with 
a deep glowing crimson, a dazzling scar¬ 
let or vermilion, a bright orange red 
and a delicate salmon ground color. Then 
we have deep pink and deep rosy purple 
varieties. Most of the brilliant red colors 
sparkle in the sun as if overlaid with 
gold-dust. Many are crimson seifs. 
Others have broad pure white bands; 
others a white or lemon yellow star. 
Some of the red hybrids have segments 



166 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


with a pure white edge; others are tipped 
with white. There are flowers mottled 
red and white, and a crushed strawberry 
color is by no means rare. I have ob¬ 
tained a few hybrids with a sulphur-yel¬ 
low ground color, lined and penciled with 
red. Some almost pure white ones with 
a narrow red band around the edge of 
the segments are particularly valuable and 
so are other white ones which are densely 
and minutely freckled with red. I have 
succeeded in raising quite a number of 
an almost pure white color, showing only 
a few traces of delicate red on the seg¬ 
ments. These are very effective. Many 
of my hybrids show the influence of H. 
Leopoldi in their form and color; having 
either a deep crimson, a scarlet or even 
a salmon ground color, with a white star 
and white-tipped segments. All are ever¬ 
green and of vigorous constitution. The 
leaves are from two to three feet long, 
and are of a deep green or glaucous green 
color. When grown in rich soil, they 
often exhibit deep reddish-brown or 
chocolate-colored tints. In many varieties, 
the entire lower part of the leaves shows 
a deep purplish-brown hue. 

This strain of Amaryllis is of very easy 
cultivation, but in order to do their best, 
they must have some attention. They 
grow as well in sunshine as in half-shade; 
on high pine land as well as on lower soif. 
On a bed a hundred feet long and three 
feet wide, three hundred bulbs can be 
easily planted. Two loads of cow-man¬ 
ure should be spread over this bed, and 
then it must be deeply spaded. Some clay 
mixed with the soil will prove beneficial. 
The bulbs should be planted in' such a 
way that the point of the neck is covered 
with at least one or two inches of soil. 
After having finished their flowering, 
and again in September or October when 


in full growth, they require either a top 
dressing or two inches of cow-manure or 
some good commercial fertilizer, either 
bone meal or, still better, Painter’s Simon 
Pure garden mixture. If in any way 
neglected after flowering, the bulbs be¬ 
come so weak that they do not flower the 
following season. These Amaryllis are 
gross feeders, but manures too rich in 
ammonia should be avoided. They rather 
require foods rich in phosphoric acid and 
potash. 

Hippeastrum Johnsoni is hardy as far 
north as Washington, if given some pro¬ 
tection. In the gardens of Raleigh, N. 
C. it is a rather common plant. The Or¬ 
ange Amaryllis is much more tender. My 
show hybrids I think will prove hardy in 
all the southern states bordering the Gulf 
of Mexico. They will not suffer by cold 
if the soil does not actually freeze. They 
may lose their foliage, but the bulbs will 
remain unhurt. A large bed of these 
Amaryllis in full bloom will outrival in 
beauty and brilliancy all the true Lilies, 
and most other plants. 

All the Amaryllis, and even the Cri- 
nums and particularly the Hymenocallis 
(Spider Lily), suffer a good deal from 
the ravages of the Amaryllis caterpillar 
and the lubber grasshoppers. The former 
often appears in countless numbers on the 
underside of the foliage. Here they can 
be easily killed. If left undisturbed they 
will soon defoliate the entire plant. When 
larger, they even damage the bulbs by 
eating into their centers. Usually on 
March 15, when the Amaryllis are in 
full bloom, the earliest hordes of lubber 
grasshoppers crawl out of the ground; 
at first small and brownish, then black 
with red stripes on their backs, which 
change into brighter yellow stripes a little 
later. They are ravenous feeders from 


167

the beginning, preferring the members of 
the Amaryllis family, particularly Hip- 
peastrums, as food plants. They mar the 
foliage, eat holes into the flower-stem 
and greedily devour the flower-buds. A 
constant vigilance is necessary. They 
take their meals twice a day—the first 
right after sunrise, and the second a little 
after noontime. After having fed, they 
crawl upon a bush or a small tree where 
they can easily be seen and killed. The 
young ones are gregarious. In dense 
masses they alight on slender stems where 
all can be killed with one stroke. After 
two and a half months have elapsed, they 
again change color. This mature color 
is a yellowish gray. Their wings are 
short and red. Being very clumsy in 
their movements, they are easily caught 
and killed. It is surprising how much 
damage a full-grown lubber grasshopper 
can do. Ismenes and Eucharis Amazon- 
ica, as well as the beautiful and deli¬ 
ciously fragrant Hymenocallis macroste- 
phana, H. fragrans and H. speciosa are 
perfectly at home in our garden; but on 
account of the lubber grasshoppers it is 
scarcely possible to enjoy their flowers 
or the beauty of their luxuriant foliage. 
Hand picking is, as far as I know, the 


only way of getting rid of these two 
pests. 

The late afternoon hours of spring, 
summer and autumn in Florida have an 
indescribable charm, a charm peculiarly 
their own, and the early morning hours 
are scarcely less enchanting. This is the 
time to enjoy nature, to enjoy our gardens 
and flowers. In the evening glow or very 
early in the morning, I am fond of 
wandering through my Amaryllis and 
Caladium garden to meditate on the in¬ 
effable glory of nature, to think of my 
ideals and of all that makes life beautiful. 
How charming is this Florida evening 
glow as it falls on the brilliant blossoms 
of the Amaryllis or on the gorgeous 
leaves of the Caladiums! In the cedars 
near by, the cardinal sings in jubilant 
notes its evening hymn, the mockingbird 
pours forth its unrivaled melodies from 
the top of an orange-tree, and the loud 
whistling calls of the chuck-will’s widow 
resound from the thickets of near 
woodlands. It is twilight. The air is 
wonderfully soft and salubrious, and the 
bright stars appear and shine as they only 
can shine in Florida—the land of flowers, 
the land of my ideals in horticulture.

PLANTING FOR HOME ADORNMENT. 


By W. C. Steele. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

When I was notified that I had again 
been appointed as a member of the stand¬ 
ing Committee on Ornamentals, I felt 
that there was nothing which I could say 
that would be worth the time which it 
would occupy. 

So many able committees have already 
made reports covering the entire subject 
that it did not seem that there was any¬ 
thing left for me to say. 

After some study, I thought that I 
would recommend the planting of native 
trees for home adornment; but that would 
leave out some things which I wanted to 
mention, therefore, after changing my 
plan several times, I finally settled upon 
the title given at the head of this report, 
which will admit of the introduction of 
anything which can be made useful for 
the purpose. 

Those of you who heard President 
Taber’s address to this Society at the 
meeting in May, 1905, or who read it 
as printed in the annual report for that 
year, will remember the eloquent tribute 
which he gave to the beauties of the na¬ 
tural growth in a thicket near his home. 
It is a fact, greatly to be regretted, that 
the American people do not appreciate 
the toeauties of the natural growth around 
them. If they can get something which 
has been imported at great expense, they 
will buy it at a high price, when the 
woods are full of much more beautiful 
things which may be had for the trouble 
of going after them and digging and 
bringing them home. 

I am a believer in the use of native 


plants so far as possible, not to the ex¬ 
clusion of the many beautiful and desira¬ 
ble foreigners which have come to stay, 
but rather to supplement them, or to take 
their place around many homes where the 
expense of these foreign beauties cannot 
be afforded. 

Of course, the evergreens stand at the 
head, the list including Magnolia grandi- 
flora and Magnolia glauca, the latter be¬ 
ing known as Sweet Bay. Both are indis¬ 
pensable where the space can be spared to 
allow them the room needed for proper 
expansion. To them I would add the 
Hollies, the common species Ilex opaca, 
is so well known that it needs no farther 
mention, but it may not be so well known 
that there are other species, Ilex Dahoon 
and I. cassine which are quite as valuable 
and are even more showy, when in fruit, 
as the red berries are borne in greater 
profusion. 

It is often desirable to have a tree 
during summer where shade is not wanted 
in winter, a deciduous species is much 
more desirable for such a situation. 

One of the best, if not the very best, 
of our native species is Acer rubrum, the 
soft or swamp maple. It usually blooms 
in February or early in March, but this 
year it blossomed in January. A single 
flower of this tree is small and incon¬ 
spicuous, but a large specimen covered 
with clusters of blossoms, which are 
found at the end of every twig, is very 
showy and attracts a great deal of atten¬ 
tion. The flowers are bright scarlet and 
the seeds as soon as formed, and until 
ready to d'rop, retain (the same bright

color. The only objection to it, is the 
fact that it produces large crops of seed 
which drift a long ways when the wind 
blows hard and as they germinate readily 
they become a nuisance, unless there is a 
drouth at the time when they fall. Al¬ 
though this maple is a native of swamps 
and low land, its common name being 
swamp or soft maple, still it will grow 
well on dry soil if it is not too poor. 

Probably the next most desirable native 
deciduous tree for ornamental planting, 
is the Sweet Gum. Liquidambar styraci- 
flua. Like the maple described above, it 
is found naturally, in swamps or moist 
land, but it still more easily adapts itself 
to dry land culture and is not so depend¬ 
ent on rich soil. It is one of the most 
symmetrical trees that we have, when al¬ 
lowed space in which to develop itself 
properly. In autumn it shows the most 
brilliant coloring of any of our native 
trees. Although it is a deciduous species, 
it retains its foliage later than most spe¬ 
cies ; often the old leaves hang on until 
pushed off by the swelling of the buds 
as the new leaves open. Occasionally the 
same thing happens with the soft Maple. 
I had a small maple this season which re¬ 
tained much of last year’s foliage on the 
upper twigs, when the lower part of the 
tree was in bloom, and a few still hung 
on when the seeds were grown and the 
new leaves were more than half grown. 
I have more than a dozen of these trees 
on the place, and this spring was sur¬ 
prised to notice that there was a great 
difference in the time when they opened 
their leaves; on some the leaves would be 
almost grown, while on others not forty 
feet away, on exactly the same soil, the 
buds were but little more than fairly open. 

While on this subject of curious varia¬ 


tions in the habits of growth of trees, 
I will call attention to a fact which may 
or may not have been noticed by you. 
All evergreen trees shed their leaves, but 
usually it is done so gradually, while the 
new ones are coming, that it is not not¬ 
iced. This year some Magnolia glauca 
trees near my house shed their leaves so 
nearly all at once, that they were quite 
bare and looked for a time like deciduous 
trees; it happened just as the first flow¬ 
ers were opening, and their almost leaf¬ 
less branches showing here and there 
scattered blossoms were a striking con¬ 
trast to their usual appearance. 

Another plant, also a native, which is 
usually classed as a shrub, but which can 
easily be grown as a small tree, is the 
common Elder, Sambucus Canadensis. 
At the north it is called a weed, but here 
it is an evergreen shrub or small tree and 
is almost everblooming. A specimen on 
my own place trained to a single stem, 
stands between eighteen and twenty feet 
high with a trunk over six inches in dia¬ 
meter. It is seldom out of bloom, ex¬ 
cept for a short time in the coldest 
weather of winter. During the summer 
it usually has flowers and fruit of all 
sizes from that just formed to fully ripe 
berries, though the latter are soon taken 
off by the birds. 

Vines, especially woody perennials, are 
always favorites with all flower lovers. 
Three native hardy climbers are worthy 
of special mention. Bignona capreolate 
sometimes called Cross-vine, is perhaps 
the most showy in the early spring. The 
individual flowers are rather dull red in 
color, but when you come to a large oak 
literally covered with a sheet of Bignonia 
capreolata blossoms, it is a sight worth 
going miles to look at. I have good- 


170 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sized oaks when there was hardly a 
leaf visible so thoroughly was the top 
covered with the bloom of this vine. 

Tecoma radicans, usually catalogued as 
Bignonia radicans, is another vigorous 
growing native vine; the flowers are scar¬ 
let, a much brighter color than those of 
capreolata, but it is not so profuse a 
bloomer at one time; that is, while it may 
produce as many blossoms in a season, 
yet as they are scattered over a period of 
several weeks, instead of all opening at 
once, they do not make so great a display. 
Bignonia capreolata is found in high ham¬ 
mocks on dry soil, while Tecoma radicans 
is generally found in cypress ponds; but, 
like many other natives of low land, it 
easily adapts itself to circumstances and 
will grow well on high land, if not too 
poor. 

Last, but by no means least, I will men¬ 
tion the Yellow Jessamine, Gelsemium 
sempervirens. The wild species is so well 
known that I should not mention it at 
all, were it not that I wish to call atten¬ 
tion to the fact that the double-flowered 
form is much more desirable than the 
single. It is not quite so profuse a 
bloomer as the wild form, or at least it 
does not show as many at one time, but 
as the blooming period is much longer, 
it may produce as many in a year. Last 
fall my double-flowered vines began to 
bloom in November, and kept it up until 
the latter part of February or the first of 
March. 

Sp far I have confined myself to native 
species which anyone can have for the 
trouble of going into the woods and dig¬ 
ging them; the last mentioned is an ex¬ 
ception, it is not offered, so far as I know, 
except by the P. J. Berckmans Nursery 
Company of Augusta, Ga., and they will 
not send any plants by mail. I hope that 


some of our Florida nurserymen will pro¬ 
pagate and offer for sale this very de¬ 
sirable variety. 

Three years ago, Mrs. Gates, in her 
report on Ornamentals, recommended a 
wild vine, a species of Smilax, very 
highly. I do not think that she said a 
word too much in its praise. Unfor¬ 
tunately she did not know its botanical 
name, nor have I been able to learn it; it 
is a wild Smilax and that is all that I am 
able to tell as to its name; but I can tell 
you how to find it. If you will watch 
the hammock woods very closely, in early 
spring, until you find a vine that is a 
strong, vigorous grower and bears a pro¬ 
fusion of small greenish flowers which 
have the fragrance of Mignonette only 
intensified, that is the one for which you 
are looking. 

While on the subject of vines, I want 
to recommend some which are not natives 
and therefore must be purchased or pro¬ 
cured by exchange with some neighbor. 
Foremost stands Rhynchosperum Jasmi- 
noides, sometimes called Star Jessamine, 
although it is not at all related to the 
Jessamine family. The vine is a strong, 
vigorous grower, perfectly hardy 
throughout this state, and for several 
weeks in early spring it covers itself with 
a sheet of pure white, very fragrant blos¬ 
soms ; the flowers are so thickly set on the 
branches that the foliage is hidden from 
sight. The only objection which I have 
ever felt towards this vine was that in 
the evening the perfume is so strong that 
it is almost overpowering. If you are at 
all sensitive to strong odors, do not set 
this vine very close to the house. 

Bignonia speciosa, Bignonia Thun- 
bergiana, Pithecoctineum clematideum, 
usually catalogued as Bignonia alba, and 
Pithecoctineum Kayense (?) ; the last

name was given me provisionally by the 
Missouri Botanic Garden from specimens 
which did not reach them in very good 
condition. These four species are all 
hardy, are vigorous growers and bear a 
profusion of beautiful flowers in the 
spring. When I say that they are hardy, 
I mean throughout the orange belt; they 
will not stand an indefinite amount of 
cold, but have not been killed on my place 
for several years. 

A m p e 1 o p s i s tricuspidata, the A. 
Veitchi of the catalogues, and commonly 
called Boston Ivy or Japanese Ivy, is per¬ 
fectly hardy, but not evergreen. This 
vine has every desirable feature for a 
screen, except that it sheds its leaves in 
winter. In some situations this is not a 
drawback and for such places no better 
plant can be found. The north-east end 
of my house is covered from the ground 
up to the roof by this vine, except parts 
of two windows which it is difficult to 
keep clear enough to allow the light to 
enter. The light green leaves are so* 
close, lapping like shingles, that no rain 
can reach the siding during the summer. 
When the wind blows strong, from either 
side, the foliage moves up and down like 
waves of water. 

Another climbing plant which I have 
tested quite thoroughly, deserves to be 


more generally cultivated. I refer to 
Gloriosa superba, the climbing Lily, this 
plant is a member of the true Lily family, 
and is so gloriously beautiful that it well 
deserves the name Gloriosa. The flowers 
are perfect Lilies in form and when fully 
developed are a rich scarlet in color. The 
opening buds are a greenish yellow, 
which changes to pure yellow and then 
to scarlet. No lady who has ever seen 
it on my place has failed to express great 
delight at its wonderful beauty. The 
plant is an herbaceous perennial, the bulbs 
live over in the open ground without any 
protection, coming up year after year. 

One caution is necessary; when growth 
starts be careful that the tip of a shoot 
is not broken off, for if it is, then all 
growth stops. Most plants will sprout 
from the axil of a leaf, if the end is 
broken off, but the Gloriosa never does. 

My subject is a fascinating one, and 
when I begin I hardly know where to 
stop. There are so many plants worthy 
of cultivation which are but little known, 
that it is difficult to know what to men¬ 
tion and what to leave out. Probably the 
best plan will be to stop right here and 
tell you to study the uncultivated lands 
around you; you will be surprised to find 
how many beautiful things are growing 
there which are unknown to you.

THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THE FLOWER GARDEN. 


By Mahlon Gore. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Horticulture, as a commercial asset, 
should not be underestimated. With 
us, who are interested in this Associa¬ 
tion, horticulture, in its refining and 
elevating influence upon the human 
family, is no less valuable. We seldom 
see a real lover of flowers who is coarse 
and vulgar in his nature. How many of 
us can trace our first noble impulses to 
Mother’s flower garden? How many of 
us plucked flowers from that garden with 
which to win the smiles of our chum’s 
coy little sister? Babies love flowers and 
are attracted \by their beauty and fra¬ 
grance. We ornament our houses and 
our tables with them; we bedeck our bride 
with flowers, and we place flowers on the 
graves of our departed loved ones. 

The flowers of Florida have already 
attracted thousands of visitors who, later 
on, have cast their lots with us and are 
now counted among our most desirable 
citizens. “There is a use in beauty,” 
and nowhere is the adage exemplified 
with more force than among horticultur¬ 
ists. And still we do not make the most 
of these gifts of the Creator in adding 
to the attractiveness of our homes and 
our state. As a purely business proposi¬ 
tion I believe that we might add twenty- 
five per cent, to the commercial value of 
our possessions if we would give suf¬ 
ficient time and attention to the cultiva¬ 
tion of flowers and ornamental plants and 
shrubs. What is of more value still, 
would be the added charm of home to 
our children; their greater interest in 


and love for home, and the refining ef¬ 
fect upon their developing intellects. The 
boy who loves flowers to such a degree 
that he will delight to cultivate them, will 
find little time to spend in the saloon, and 
will have little inclination to go there for 
amusement. 

We old men know that the girl who 
cultivates flowers for love of them is far 
more lovable than her sister whose chief 
delight is matinees and social excitements, 
although these last are not to be tabooed 
by any means, for they give the girls the 
opportunity to add to their own charms 
through dainty floral adornment. 

We all love beauty, and we are richer 
in mind for this love. We might be 
richer in purse if we would devote more 
time and attention to aesthetic horticul¬ 
ture. I believe that one hour a day on 
the part of each member of this Associa¬ 
tion, devoted to the cultivation of flowers 
and ornamental plants, for the period of 
five years, would add one hundred thou¬ 
sand intelligent, refined people to the 
population of Florida. Every city and 
town in the state should vie with all the 
others in adding ito its attractions for 
new settlers. The competition should be 
sharp, determined and continuous. Each 
home should have its floral gem of a 
flower garden. Each resident should try 
to outdo his neighbor. Each town should 
try to outshine all of the rest. Every 
country home should have its little orna¬ 
mental park. 

With such a state of things, Florida 
would be the most charming state in the 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


173 


Union, the most talked-about, the most 
thoroughly and favorably advertised spot 
in all the world. This is no flight of fancy. 
It is easily within our reach if we but wake 
up. L would make the work State-wide; 
organize floriculture associations in every 
community, with floral exhibits at each 


monthly meeting; study landscape gar¬ 
dening and floral and plant effect; and, 
finally, forever end those oft-heard and 
oft-repeated repressions of disappoint¬ 
ment indulged in by tourists and visitors 
over the fact that “there are so few flow¬ 
ers in Florida.” 


Irrigation. 


By Francis L. Wills. 


'ikfr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In reply to your letter asking me 
for a paper on irrigation, would say 
that we installed our irrigating plant 
on this grove in April, 1905. The plant 
consists of a twenty-horse-power, 
White-Blakeslee gasoline engine and a 
No. 4 Rumsey Improved Rotary 
Pump, located in a house thirty feet 
from the pond and about two hundred 
feet from the grove. The pump has a 
five-inch suction and a four-inch dis¬ 
charge giving two hundred fifty gal¬ 
lons of water per minute; we have a 
four-inch main pipe, running the en¬ 
tire length of the grove, every 150 
feet; laterals branch off from the main, 
running the entire width of the grove; 
the laterals start out with two-inch 
pipe, running down to one-inch pipe, at 
the extreme end. 

Our stanchions consist of a three- 
quarter-inch pipe, with a hose valve 
on top, and are 150 feet apart through¬ 
out the entire grove. When irrigating 
we use ioo-foot sections of three-quar¬ 
ter-inch hose, connecting one end to 
the stanchions and the other end to a 
six-foot piece of three-quarter-inch 
iron piping, drawn together and sharp¬ 
ened at one end to stick into the 
ground with a tee and nipple for hose 
connection eighteen inches from the 
bottom, the top fitted with a three- 
quarter-inch brass Magowan Spray, 


the stanchions when running throw a 
spray that will cover thirty feet and 
we move the stanchions from one mid¬ 
dle to another, until every middle has 
been thoroughly wet down. 

We usually run twenty stanchions at 
a time and leave them standing in each 
middle forty minutes, thus giving each 
middle or tree 480 gallons of water, 
which I think is equal to a little over 
three-quarters of an inch of rain. 

We have made it a practice to irri¬ 
gate the grove whenever the moisture 
sinks three inches below the surface, 
summer or winter, during the months 
of March, April and May we run an 
Acme Harrow over the grove as soon 
as it is irrigated. During a drouth we 
find it necessary to irrigate once every 
two or three weeks, harrowing the 
grove once every week; this keeps a 
good moisture under the sand mulch 
at all times. 

We have under irrigation thirty 
acres of grove. 

The plant, as I have described it, 
cost us a little over $6,000 and as yet, 
the plant being new, we have not had 
to lay out anything for repairs. I run 
the engine myself and have one man 
at $1.50 a day to move the stanchions 
from place to place. 

The engine consumes practically 
twenty-five gallons of gasoline, run¬ 
ning from nine to ten hours a day, and 







FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


175 


it takes practically two days to irrigate 
ten acres; so I calculate that to irri¬ 


gate ten acres costs— 

My time nothing.$ ... 

One man. 3.00 

Gasoline . 10.00 

Incidentals, such as oil, washers, 

waste .60 

Total .$13.60 


This does not include wear and tear on 
machinery. 

When irrigating in hot weather we 
start our engine up as soon as it is 
light enough to see, and run it five 
hours; then we start up again in the 
afternoon at three and run until seven. 


The first year we irrigated we ran the 
engine steadily from daylight until 
dark; but I became convinced that it 
was not a good plan to throw water 
into the grove in the heat of the day. 
Of course, it would be much better to 
irrigate at night rather than the day, 
but this is not practical, as I have yet 
to find men who will drag hose around 
through the grove in the dark. 

Some say it is a question whether 
or not irrigation pays. All I can say 
is that our trees look well and we seem 
to get a pretty fair crop of fruit each 
year. 


By J. W. Hoard. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

To the tourist or winter visitor, 
Florida presents a most beautiful pic¬ 
ture or panoramic view of flowers and 
sunshine; of magnificent and extensive 
evergreen forests, dotted here and 
there by beautiful lakes whose waters 
are as clear as crystal, and as pure and 
sparkling as the morning dew. He 
is delighted with our glorious climate, 
our orange groves laden with their 
golden fruit, and our truck farms em¬ 
bracing broad acres of growing veg¬ 
etables. He is impressed by the scenes 
of nervous activity and evidences of 
enterprise and prosperity on every 
hand, and especially in and around our 
packing houses during the shipping 
season. He hears and reads of vast 
sums of money being made by the fruit 
and vegetable growers in various parts 
of the state. He is delighted with all 
he sees or hears, and, in fact, it seems 


to him that Nature has almost ex¬ 
hausted her resources in making of 
Florida a veritable horticulturists’ 
paradise, leaving nothing to be desired 
which could in any way contribute to 
his happiness or success. And from 
his standpoint the tourist is right in 
his conclusions. Florida is a grand 
state, possessing many natural advan¬ 
tages and horticultural possibilities for 
which we hereby express our thanks 
and gratitude to the One from whom 
all such blessings must come. We all 
love our Florida and appreciate her 
many natural advantages and also 
those which have been brought about 
by the efforts of her enterprising citiz¬ 
ens ; and our hearts are bound to her 
by invisible and mysterious ties which 
we cannot possibly understand nor ex¬ 
plain and which grow stronger as the 
years go by. 

But, at the same time, those of us 








176 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


who have spent many years here, and 
have on several occasions seen the 
smiling features of our fair state dis¬ 
figured almost beyond recognition by 
natural causes, are forced to admit 
that Florida also has several natural 
disadvantages, among which may be 
mentioned the poverty of the soil, un¬ 
expected visits from Jack-frost in win¬ 
ter, the insufficiency of rainfall during 
the growing season, and a pretty good 
supply of insect pests of all of the lead¬ 
ing and up-to-date varieties; and one 
or two other disadvantages from which 
nature is not responsible, viz.: the high 
freight rates and poor services im¬ 
posed upon us by the railroads. 

Some of these adverse conditions 
have been overcome by artificial 
means, and most of the others can 
and must be, or the horticultural in¬ 
dustry will be overcome by them; and 
as I understand it, one of the principal 
objects of this Society as a body, and 
of each member as an individual, is to 
give each other the benefit of what¬ 
ever knowledge or experience we may 
have gained in our attempts to meet 
and overcome any one or all of these 
difficulties. 

The problem of poor soil has been 
solved to the satisfaction of all con¬ 
cerned by the fertilizer manufacturers 
of the state, who have placed within 
our reach, in convenient and available 
form, all of the necessary elements of 
plant food so essential to plant life, 
and in which our Florida sand is so 
deficient; thereby enabling us to not 
only make two blades of grass grow 
where only one grew before, but even 
making it possible for us to grow good 
crops of fruits and vegetables where 
nothing could grow before; thus, in 


my opinion, placing the fertilizer man¬ 
ufacturer in the front rank of public 
benefactors. The Florida Experiment 
Station and also the United States De¬ 
partment of Agriculture have given 
and are still giving us valuable infor¬ 
mation along the line of insect exter¬ 
mination, by sending to our assistance 
specialists of the highest order, men 
specially trained and fitted for this 
kind of work, who are industriously 
devoting their time and talents to sci¬ 
entific investigations and experiments 
along these lines. It has been my 
privilege to become acquainted with 
several of these gentlemen during the 
past two years and make myself some¬ 
what familiar with the work they are 
doing, and it gives me pleasure to say 
to this Society that they are meeting 
with success and are getting results 
which could never have been obtained 
in any other way and which will be of 
inestimable value to the horticulturists 
of Florida. 

We look to the Railroad Commis¬ 
sion, to the Inter-State Commerce 
Commission, and the Florida Fruit and 
Vegetable Growers’ Protective Asso¬ 
ciation, for reduced freight rates and 
better transportation facilities. 

So with all of the other problems 
disposed of, we now come to the ques¬ 
tion of irrigation. This scarcity of 
rainfall during the growing season, 
just when rain is most needed, is, in 
my opinion, the most serious difficulty 
with which the fruit and vegetable 
grower has to deal. It causes him 
more disappointments, more heart¬ 
aches than all of the others combined; 
it sours his disposition, causes him to

grow old before his time and, in fact, 
at times it causes him to almost doubt 
the existence and guidance of an im¬ 
partial and all-wise Providence. 

These conditions have been grad¬ 
ually growing worse for the past two 
or three seasons, until at the present 
time irrigation, which is, of course, the 
only remedy, is regarded as an almost 
absolute necessity. A good many 
growers who happened to be favorably 
situated as to water supply, who were 
sufficiently informed as to what kind 
of irrigation they needed and had the 
means to pay for it, have put in irri¬ 
gating plants which are working suc¬ 
cessfully and which have made their 
owners independent of rainfall. But 
most of these plants have been in¬ 
stalled at an expense which places 
them out of reach of the orange 
grower, one of my neighbors having 
just completed a plant which cost him 
over $10,000.00. It consists of one 
mile of six-inch wrought iron pipe, 
enough smaller pipe to form a com¬ 
plete network under his grove of about 
120 acres, and a rotary pump driven 
by a fifty-horse-power engine. The 
water is delivered through patent 
sprinklers which are placed in the 
centre between each four trees; he can 
run forty of these sprinklers at once, 
thus watering forty trees at one time. 

This kind of irrigation is all right 
for those who can afford it, but is be¬ 
yond the reach of about ninety-nine 
per cent, of us, and for this reason it 
is not necessary for me to enter into 
a detailed description of it at this time. 
What is needed is a system of irriga¬ 
tion which can be installed at a cost 
within the reach of the average grower 
of limited means and yet of sufficient 


capacity to meet all of his require¬ 
ments. 

For the past eight years I have had 
charge of the property of Chase & Co. 
at Waco. This property consists of 
the famous Isleworth groves and nurs¬ 
eries and, incidentally, an extensive ir¬ 
rigating plant of about the same ca¬ 
pacity in gallons of water as the one 
above mentioned and costing about 
one-eighth as much. I have visited 
and made myself familiar with the 
workings of irrigation plants of nearly 
every kind or system now being used 
in our part of the State, but for hand¬ 
ling vast quantities of water at the 
least possible expense, which is, of 
course, what the grower of limited 
means wants to do, I have never seen 
anything to equal our plant. 

A description of our pump and 
method of distributing the water over 
the graye will be found in the report 
of last year's meeting, but for the 
benefit of those who may not have 
been present at that meeting I will 
give a brief description here. The pump 
consists simply of a square box two 
feet in diameter inside and about eigh¬ 
teen feet high, or about six feet above 
the highest point in our grove. This 
box stands one end in the edge of the 
lake, where water should be two to 
three feet deep. Through the center 
of this box, from top to bottom, there 
is a steel shaft, with a water wheel on 
the bottom end; another one of the 
same kind in the middle and a pulley 
at the top for connecting with the en¬ 
gine. This bottom wheel, by being 
revolved at a high rate of speed, lifts 
a column of water two feet square, up 
to the upper wheel, which catches it 
in the same way and carries it out at 
an opening near the top of the box, 



178 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


and just below the belt and pulley. In 
case of a higher lift being required all 
that is necessary would be to increase 
the length of the box and shaft, put in 
another water wheel about seven or 
•eight feet higher up, put on more 
power and go ahead. From the top 
of the pump the water is conducted 
across the middle of the grove through 
a ten-inch terra cotta pipe; thence 
from this ten-inch main to either side 
of the grove through a five-inch gal- 
vanized-iron pipe of about Ihe thick¬ 
ness and weight of small slove pipe 
and connected up in the same way, but 
in sections ten feet long. 

Our pump will supply about four of 
these lines of five-inch pipe at one 
time; sometimes in case we are short 
on piping we run one or more of these 
five-inch openings in furrows. This 
running water in furrows in Florida 
sand has always been theoretically im¬ 
possible, but we have proved beyond 
question, by actual experience, that it 
works very successfully indeed; and, in 
fact, I consider fit one of the best, if 
not the very best, method now being 
used; and I would especially recom¬ 
mend it to vegetable growers. We 
can fill four or five furrows from each 
opening in our ten-inch main, and by 
using the furrow system exclusively 
we can have about twenty furrows 600 
to 700 feet long running at one time. 
This will give you some idea of the 
capacity of our pump, and also give 
you an idea how effective this system 
would be in irrigating vegetables. The 
imagination of the trucker could not 
possibly conceive a more pleasing pic¬ 
ture than to go out some evening 
about sundown and find twenty little 
rivers of cool, fresh water flowing 


gently down between twenty rows of his 
withering vegetables. 

I had, as the title of this paper sug¬ 
gests, intended giving quite an exten¬ 
sive collection of facts and figures as 
to cost of irrigation supplies of differ¬ 
ent kinds, but as I believe this part of 
the subject will be more thoroughly 
and ably covered by Mr. Skinner, I 
will only give a few points along this 
line in connection with this particular 
system of irrigation. 

The pump we are using is known as 
the Menge pump and is manufactured 
in New Orleans at a cost of about $150 
at the factory. The terra cotta piping 
of various sizes can be had at about 
the following prices, delivered to dif¬ 
ferent parts of the state: 

10-inch 25 cents per foot 

8-inch 17 cents per foot 

5-inch 10 cents per foot 

4-inch 8 cents per foot 

The five-inch galvanized pipe comes at 
about ten cents per foot, delivered. 
For locations where lake water is 
available, and the lift not more than 
fifteen feet, there is nothing better nor 
cheaper than the Menge rotary pump. 
For higher lift I would recommend a 
centrifugal pump, which will not only 
lift the water but also force it to any 
height up to about thirty-five feet. 

The capacity and cost of these four¬ 
teen pumps range about as follows: 
A pump with a capacity of 100 gallons 
per minute will cost about $110; 450 
gallons per minute, $210; 1,000 gal¬ 
lons per min., $360; and others, large 
or smaller in proportion. A pump fur¬ 
nishing 600 gallons per minute will 
cover one and three-tenths acres one 
inch deep in one hour, or 13 and one- 
fifth acres one inch deep in ten hours. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


179 


1,000 gallons per minute will cover two 
and one-fifth acres one inch deep in 
one hour, or about twenty-two acres 
one inch deep in ten hours. One inch 


of water over an acre or, in other 
words, one inch of rainfall, will wet 
thoroughly six to eight inches of per¬ 
fectly dry Florida sand. 


By L. B. Skinner. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I received a letter from Prof. Rolfs 
asking me to give a little talk on irri¬ 
gation. I am always ready to talk on 
irrigation, but I was not posted as to 
what special branch of irrigation I was 
expected to talk on, until I came into 
Gainesville. 

My experience has been entirely 
with what is called the sprinkling sys¬ 
tem. When I first had an idea of tak¬ 
ing up irrigation, I felt that I had to 
take it up if I were going to grow or¬ 
anges as a business and make a suc¬ 
cess. Of course, the first question 
that came into my mind was, where to 
get the water. There were only two 
ways: from a pond and from a well. 
I spent a little time going to see the 
irrigating plants through the state, 
and among them was one of Mr. 
Adams of Thonotosassa. His struck 
me as being the best I saw. It con¬ 
sisted of large pipes with small mains 
connected with them, running to dif¬ 
ferent parts of the grove. From these 
laterals were standpipes to which the 
hose was attached. By using the hose 
he was able to get along without using 
so much iron pipe. To the hose were 
attached the McGowan sprinklers, 
which he considered the best in all re¬ 
spects. They throw a large amount 
of water and throw a very fine spray 
with plenty of force all over between 


the trees. It struck me as being the 
best and most successful system I had 
seen, and he had a fine crop of fruit 
from his grove. 

At that time, iron pipe was beyond 
my reach, and I investigated the ad¬ 
visability of using cement pipe. The 
best iron main will cost thirty-five 
and forty cents a foot for four- 
inch pipe. I think a six-acre grove 
irrigating plant with steam pump and 
boiler, iron pipe, etc., will cost in the 
neighborhood of $1,000.00. I had 
plenty of muscle, time and some labor. 
I investigated the cement pipe and 
made up my mind that it would do. 
I bought a machine and a car of ce¬ 
ment and went to work. We turned out 
lots of pipe; I now have about 35,000 
feet of that cement pipe. It has cost 
from three to six cents a foot; gen¬ 
erally about four cents; but there is 
no time to stand around when you 
make it at even four cents. I think 
you can possibly make it at an average 
of five cents. 

You dig your ditch and put your 
machine right in it, and make the ce¬ 
ment pipe as you go along, cleaning 
out your machine when stopping at 
noon or night and starting again. I tried 
to make a solid joint by pressing the 
cement together with my hands about 
the core of the machine, but found that 
it would not do. When I put on my 


12 



180 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


power, every joint burst and there was 
trouble right away. A gentleman who 
has made and uses this pipe told me 
that though the weak places in his ce¬ 
ment pipe had broken, he had patched 
them until the pipe was all right. I 
began to find that there were weak 
places and fixed them up by this 
method. When I stopped making the 
pipe at any one joint, I set the ma¬ 
chine down in the ditch farther along 
and went on, leaving that gap. After¬ 
wards I put the machine on the ground 
and made some pipe for filling these 
gaps and sawed it into the proper 
lengths (you can pick up five or six 
or seven feet) and set it in the section. 
Then I set the right length into the 
gap and wrapped some wire loosely 
around the joint; then took some ce¬ 
ment well mixed and spread it around 
and in the wire completely. That 
joint will never break. Just wind some 
wire loosely around it and fill it in with 
cement, spreading it quite liberally, 
and it will answer every purpose. Any 
small wire will do; I generally use 
small, galvanized wire. 

We generally put in the hydrants 
the following morning after the ce¬ 
ment pipe is made. Scrape the top 
of the cement away so as to give a 
new surface. When you are running 
your irrigating plant and the hydrants 
break out, by using this wire plan, 
winding wire around again and again 
loosely and filling it up with cement, 
it will be tight and ready for use on 
the following day. 

I find this cement pipe very satis¬ 
factory. I have tried the McGowan 
nozzle. It has a little small top that 
screws down to regulate the amount 
of water. Sometimes it is screwed 


down too tight and sometimes too 
loose and you are apt to have trouble 
if you don't look after it pretty care¬ 
fully. Cement pipe will stand a good 
deal of pressure, but not as much as 
iron pipe. You have all heard the 
story of the man down at the Tampa 
Bay Hotel, who had a big head on 
him the morning after a festive even¬ 
ing. The manager took one of our 
finest Florida grapefruit and fixed it 
up with a little ice and sugar and a 
little French brandy and gave it to 
him. Pretty soon the man came down 
and asked for his bill and said, “I am 
going to New York to tell the boys, 
‘Eureka, I have found it.’ ” The Cac¬ 
tus sprinkler affected me very much 
the same way. When I saw it I felt 
like exclaiming, “Eureka, I have found 
it and must tell the boys." From 
a four-inch pipe I have seen it throw 
the water in a circle thirty-five feet in 
diameter, wetting it well in just a few 
minutes. It puts water on in the finest 
kind of spray. They are very simple 
and last a long time. There is only 
one that is any good for our irrigation, 
and that is No. io, one-inch size. It 
will put on lots of water and in fine 
shape and at low pressure. 

In the above system of iron pipe, the 
laterals are of two-inch pipe from a 
four-inch main. It waters about forty 
acres and costs about $3,000.00. To 
fix it up with cement pipe it would cost 
about one-third as much. The Chase 
& Co. system at Lake Butler, where 
there is an ample supply of water, is 
the cheapest plan there is, but you 
must have unlimited water. If your 
water supply is unlimited, you can 
take terra cotta pipe and the Mean’s 
pump and throw a world of water on

the ground, but where you have a 
limited amount of water and the 
ground is not situated where you can 
make the water flow, I think the ce¬ 
ment system with Cactus sprayers is 
the best and cheapest system I have 
even seen. 


DISCUSSION. 

Dr. Inman—How far under the sur¬ 
face do you lay the cement pipe? 

Mr. Skinner—Twelve inches. 

Dr. Richardson—What is the name 
of the sprinkler of which you speak? 

Mr. Skinner—Cactus Lawn Sprin¬ 
kler, No. io. They are made by the 
Phrenger and Hanger Company and 
are for sale by the Baird Hardware 
Company, Gainesville, who are the 
state agents. 

The most perfect system of irriga¬ 
tion for vegetables that I have ever 
seen is at Sanford. It is a revelation. 
Their system of irrigation with ar¬ 
tesian wells is really marvelous. 

Mr. Rose—I am not well acquainted 
with the Sanford system. As Mr. 
Winters has described it, there are 
varieties of the same system. There 
are admirable systems where the tile 
is perfectly laid; where the irrigation 
where needed is perfect and drainage 


where wanted is perfect. The greatest 
trouble is that the fields frequently get 
more water than they want and their 
plants take diseases and die. 

Mr. Skinner—The place I visited 
specially, had the tile so arranged that 
the gardener could draw the water off. 
I was told by Mr. Chase and some of 
the men who lived there, that in 
former years water would stand all 
over the country, but now the drains 
are all open, and when the artesian 
wells are shut off by the gate valve, 
the water flows off in a few hours. 

The men who had the best fields had 
level fields. 

That system has gradually grown up 
by their needs and their wants, and it 
certainly has served their purpose. It 
certainly has proven a great success. 
I do not believe I have seen so many 
new homes going up in Florida. Men 
who used to get two dollars and three 
dollars a day are now getting thou¬ 
sands a year, easy. 

We all agree that with plenty of fer¬ 
tilizer, plenty of water when we want 
it, and a way provided to carry off 
water when we do not want it, there is 
no place on earth that will blossom 
like Florida. 










Shipping and Growing of Vegetables. 



By N. O. Penny. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I am called on at this meeting for a 
paper treating on the growing and ship¬ 
ping of vegetables,—a large and an im¬ 
portant subject, one that not only re¬ 
quires, but deserves a great deal of 
thought; and unfortunately for me one 
that I am not as familiar with now as 
one should be when preparing a paper. 

It is now several years since I have 
had any active experience with the veg¬ 
etable business, and accordingly I shall 
only give you some of the conclusions 
arrived at at that time together with my 
observations since. 

I have no apologies to offer for know¬ 
ing so little about this subject. I am sim¬ 
ply here with this paper because I am 
called upon, and I feel that it is the duty 
of every citizen to respond when called 
upon to the best of his ability, and th?t 
is what I am now doing. 

The demand of our markets is for 
strictly fancy produce as well as fruits 
and it is only by catering to this de¬ 
mand that the grower is able to make 
money. Poor and inferior stuff seems 
to be a drug on the market at any price, 
a thousand crates of fancy goods will sell 
before one of inferior grade. 

Among the most successful practices 
seems to be that of irrigation and drain¬ 
age. There does not seem to be any 
standard for water supply, some are us¬ 
ing windmills, others artesian wells, 
while still others are using gasoline en¬ 


gines and pumps. The locality and 
source of supply seem to be the deter¬ 
mining features. As far as we can learn 
results are good from all, but probably 
the least efficient is the windmill, which 
I think is being gradually superseded by 
the gas engine, especially so where large 
quantities of water are required. 

Drainage also appears to be one of the 
fundamental requirements. It appearing 
to intelligent growers that if we cannot 
depend on Dame Nature for water when 
we need it, neither can we depend upon 
her not to send us more than we need, 
and growers find that a flood is as bad 
as a drouth. 

Drainage is usually accomplished by 
means of open ditches and underdrains, 
I believe that the most approved prac¬ 
tice is in having the system so arranged 
that they can be used for both irriga¬ 
tion and drainage at the will of the op¬ 
erator. The grower can then protect 
himself in either a wet or a dry time. 

More attention is being paid to inten¬ 
sive culture, intelligent growers find that 
one acre properly cared for will produce 
more than two indifferently cultivated, 
and at the same time there will be a 
larger per cent, of that most important 
essential fancy quality. 

A great deal of attention is also being 
paid to the use of fertilizers, and it is 
not uncommon for growers to use two 
and three thousand pounds per acre 
where but a few years ago it was only 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


183 


customary to use that many hundreds of 
pounds. This is not becoming necessary 
on account of any impoverished condition 
of the soil, but growers find that it is a 
paying investment, one that pays very 
large dividends. 

There also seems to be a tendency to 
specialization at certain points. I will 
cite Sanford for celery, Hastings for po¬ 
tatoes, etc. There are many advantages 
derived from this, and where it is possi¬ 
ble for him to do so the grower will do 
well to take advantage of them. I will 
not undertake to enumerate all the ad¬ 
vantages that may be derived from so 
doing, but will mention a few that occur 
to me at this particular moment. First 
we are sure of our land and the crops 
it will produce; we get the benefit of car 
lot rates, direct line transportation, cash 
buyers, and lastly but not least we se¬ 
cure the benefit of all prestige and reputa¬ 
tion this particular point has in the 
markets of our country. That this is 
a very valuable asset, is best illustrated 
in this way. It not only amounts to 
quick sales, but very often in an advance 
or higher price of at least 25c. on the 
crate over the same quality of unknown 
goods. All these things are a handicap 
to the grower who does not avail himself 
of these advantages, and quite frequently 
it amounts to all his profits. 

I do not mean to say that a grower 
or growers cannot build up a reputation 
for any particular point, or any particular 
product, but I do say, my friends, that it 
is uphill work, and a long pull; and if 
we can arrange to take advantage of a 
reputation already established it will more 
than pay to do so. 

METHODS OF PACKING. 

Growing a crop is scarcely half the 


battle. The successful grower provides 
a packing house of ample size, wherein 
to handle his crops with rapidity, he has 
also provided all the facilities that are 
essential for the handling of his crops. 
He will provide the best of crates. He 
has also furnished himself with stencils 
for each and every mark that goes on 
a crate, and under no circumstances al¬ 
lows a pencil to be used for any mark. 
He has also provided each year printed 
wraps if his crops are such as can be 
wrapped, each wrap being printed with 
a fac-simile of the brand that is used on 
each crate. He will gather his crops at 
the proper time, see that they are very 
carefully handled to avoid all damage 
from bruising, etc. See that his crates 
are all neatly and securely nailed, and 
made in the best possible manner, the bet¬ 
ter to withstand transportation, and that 
they may present a better appearance on 
the market. He will see that his produce 
is all properly cleaned, and washed if 
needed, that it is properly graded to a 
high standard, that it is carefully sized, 
and well packed. All crates being uni¬ 
form, only one grade and size in each 
crate, and that grade and size plainly 
and neatly stenciled on one end of each 
crate. 

He also sees that each crate bears his 
own particular brand either stenciled or 
printed on one end, and that all stencil¬ 
ing is done in a neat and systematic man¬ 
ner, and presents a good appearance. 
And when delivery is made to the trans¬ 
portation company each crate is in a con¬ 
dition that barring accidents or delays it 
will arrive on the market in prime con¬ 
dition. 

There is a tendency among the best 
growers, especially individual shippers to 
select one good firm in one or two cities 




184 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that can handle their goods to advan¬ 
tage, and ship to them each year, year 
after year. It places their goods on 
sound business basis, and does not bring 
it into competition with itself, and* in a 
short time they will often build up a 
trade that is enviable. No sensible 
grower will change his house without 
serious cause. He cannot afford to do 


it for in so doing he throws away all 
the prestige and reputation he has been 
years in building up. He would in chang¬ 
ing have to begin all over again with a 
new firm, and the new firm’s customers. 
It is like going into a strange city. It 
requires a long time to become ac¬ 
quainted with its people, and it is the 
same way in the produce markets. 


GROWING AND SHIPPING CELERY AND PEPPERS. 


By W. E. Robinson. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The first thing necessary is good land, 
well drained and irrigated; subirrigation 
is the best. The next important thing 
is good seed which can be obtained from 
any good seedsman. The best varieties 
to grow are “Golden Self Blanching Cel¬ 
ery,” and “Ruby King Peppers.” An¬ 
other consideration is good fertilizer. 
This can be obtained from any reliable 
fertilizer company. Be careful not to 
use fertilizer that runs high in ammonia, 
as it will cause heart-rot in celery and 
black-rot in peppers. Fertilizer should 
run at least io per cent, in potash and 
not over 3 per cent, in ammonia. Lands 
should be thoroughly cleared off, well 
plowed and harrowed thirty days before 
planting. Fertilizer should be applied 
broadcast and harrowed in both ways 
ten days before planting and land thor¬ 
oughly irrigated. For celery one ton per 
acre should be applied before planting, 
and one-half ton five weeks after plant¬ 
ing by spreading in the middle of rows, 
harrowing or plowing in, always plowing 


shallow after planting. For peppers, one- 
half ton should be applied before plant¬ 
ing, and one-fourth ton in four weeks 
after planting by drilling in middle of 
rows. One-fourth ton should be applied 
in eight weeks after planting for last 
application. Pepper will grow and con¬ 
tinue to bear till frost comes or season 
closes for shipping. Seed beds are the most 
important of all in these crops. Celery 
should be sown about August 20th broad¬ 
cast and not too thick on seed bed well 
prepared and raised eight inches above 
the level of the ground. Seed beds 
should be partially shaded—the best way 
is to cover with slats four feet above the 
seed bed slanting towards the south with 
cracks two inches wide. All shade 
should be removed after September the 
20th. Seed beds should never get dry, 
and should be watered twice a day for 
eight days after sowing and then kept 
wet. Plants should be sorted so all will 
run one size as near as possible and set 
in straight rows three feet wide and eight 
inches in drill, either single or double 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


185 


tows, single rows are preferred; if 
double rows in drill, then rows should be 
four feet wide. 

Peppers * should be sown the same as 
cabbage or tomato seed, seed beds are 
prepared about the same as for other 
things. Any farmer can raise pepper 
plants. Peppers should be Jplanted in 
rows three and one-half feet wide and 
twenty inches in drill. 

Celery and peppers should be sprayed 
with Bordeaux Mixture, celery every 
ten days, and pepper as often as black 
rot appears. Celery should be sprayed 
in seed beds from the time it comes up 
to the time of setting out. Celery should 
be well blanched with boards by standing 
the boards to the side of the row close 
to the celery as possible, and all cracks 
should be stopped to exclude the light. 
It will take from ten to twenty days to 
blanch celery, and the boards should re¬ 
main till celery is white. Twelve-inch 
boards are the best. Gather the celery 


by cutting around the root with a knife 
and leave a part of the roots on the cel¬ 
ery, but be certain to keep the celery 
clear from dirt, especially do not get dirt 
in bud or plume. All dead leaves should be 
removed and it should be packed in large 
crates with roots all one way and as many 
stalks in crate as possible. Crates are 
always packed from the side. Be certain 
to use plenty of nails and ship bv express 
or by refrigerator cars. 

Peppers should not be packed till 
thoroughly matured when it looks slick 
and feels firm, it should be allowed to 
grow as long as it will before turning red 
and it should be packed in tomato carriers 
or in lettuce baskets, as you prefer. Al¬ 
ways use the largest package for the 
same freight. Select your commission 
merchant before you get ready to ship 
and get in touch with him. All markets 
are about the same on celery and pepper, 
supply and demand governing the price. 


“Shall Rudimentary Agriculture and Kindred 
Sciences be Taught in the Common Schools?” 


By Capt. R. E. Rose. 


Mr. President f Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I find myself on this occasion in rather 
a peculiar situation. On coming in last 
night and listening to what Dr. Sledd 
had to say in regard to the relation of the 
University to the Horticultural Society I 
found that he had, to a very large extent, 
anticipated the remarks I expected to 
make this afternoon. It reminds me very 
much of an anecdote which has gone the 
rounds of the Florida political campaign 
for many years. Some years ago, a prom¬ 
inent candidate for Governor and Con¬ 
gressman Davis were canvassing the State 
for different political offices. The rule 
was that the gentleman running for gov¬ 
ernor should make the first speech, 
followed by Davis. At one point, the 
candidate for Governor was Invited by a 
friend to stay all night with him; conse¬ 
quently they were belated in going to the 
meeting the next morning. The local 
committee, not desiring to delay the 
speaking, asked Mr. Davis to address the 
audience. Davis had heard his friend 
speak so often that he got up and gave the 
candidate for Governor’s speech almost 
verbatim. When the other man came in 
and found that his speech had been taken 
thus unceremoniously from him, there 
was nothing else to do but be taken sud¬ 
denly ill and not make any speech at all. 

I could perhaps have overlooked one 


speech of this kind, but at the close of 
the meeting our worthy president had a 
paper largely along the line of common 
education in the public schools. That re¬ 
minded me of the little boy when the min¬ 
ister was taking dinner with his father 
and mother. The little fellow was very 
fond of chicken and chicken was scarce 
with them. His mother said, “Now, 
Tommy, you must only take one piece 
of chicken.” Tommy said, “Well, but, 
mamma, I want more than that.” She 
said, “I know, but there must be one 
piece left for manners.” It so happened 
that the minister took the last piece for 
his second or third helping and Tommy 
cried out, “Oh, mamma, there it goes; 
manners and all!” 

That is the way I feel today. I am 
very glad to see that this session has dealt 
very largely with the interests of educa¬ 
tion. I am very glad to see that our col¬ 
lege men, literary as well as scientific men 
are beginning to realize the fact that a 
slight understanding, at least, of the 
principles of a man’s calling, are abso¬ 
lutely necessary to his success. 

The question, Shall we teach rudimen¬ 
tary science in the common schools?— 
Physics, Chemistry, Biology and kindred 
sciences, relating to agriculture, and do¬ 
mestic science, better known as nature 
studies, is now occupying the attention of 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


187 


many thinkers. The question is dis¬ 
cussed from many points of view, by per¬ 
sons of divers professions,—-the scientist, 
the editor, the professors of our colleges, 
both literary colleges, and scientific 
schools ; the political economist, and the 
layman. 

The fact that the discussion is univer¬ 
sal among thinkers, shows its importance. 
No one at this day will deny the value 
of education; no one would dare suggest 
the abolishment of the common schools. 

The question is therefore, What is the 
purpose of public education? The reply 
would certainly be, to improve the man; 
to make of him an active, useful member 
of society; to teach him the principles of 
the calling he is to pursue ; to broaden his 
conception of the laws underlying his 
chosen profession; to give him the benefit 
of knowledge accumulated from the ex¬ 
perience of others, without the care, toil, 
research and time necessary to be given 
in the personal experimenting, and study 
of the subject, in gaining the information 
as to the facts, laws, and reasons underlv- 
ing the work he is to perform; inciden¬ 
tally to improve his reasoning powers, 
broaden his mind, and develop his intel¬ 
lect. 

The common school has greatly broad¬ 
ened its scope, in the last three decades,— 
much useless matter has been eliminated, 
and better methods adopted. 

The science of teaching has been recog¬ 
nized, teachers are trained. Pedagogy is 
now recognized as a science, and taught 
as such. To become a teacher one must 
study the science and art of teaching. 
Most of us can remember when the 
teacher in the common schools, was gen¬ 
erally an untrained workman, knowing 
little of the teacher’s profession, having 
more or less knowledge of the “Three 
R’s” and little if any capacity, or inclina¬ 


tion, to impart what little he did know. 

The demand for training, or education, 
has grown wonderfully in the past thirty 
years—particularly for training along 
special lines. In all walks of life the spe¬ 
cialist is now recognized,—in law, medi¬ 
cine, the sciences, teaching, agriculture, 
chemistry, physics; in none is the special¬ 
ist more evident than in the teacher’s 
profession. 

Agriculture, “the oldest art, the young¬ 
est science,” occupies by far the greater 
number of our people, while the trades, 
and other productive occupations; man¬ 
ufacture and transportation, the next 
larger part of the population of this and 
other countries. The proper fitting, or 
training, of this vast majority of our cit¬ 
izens, for their future occupations, be¬ 
comes a question of the utmost import¬ 
ance to the State. 

In a recent address delivered in this 
city, by an eminent authority, Dr. An¬ 
drew Sledd, President of the Florida 
University, he said: 

“For some years the public schools of 
the United States have not been fully 
meeting their obligation to the general 
public. According to the census of 1900, 
of the 29,000,000 persons over 10 years 
of age engaged in gainful occupations, 
10,400,000 were following agricultural 
pursuits, or 35.7 per cent; 24.4 per cent, 
were employed in manufacturing and kin¬ 
dred labor, domestic and personal occu¬ 
pations claimed 19.2 per cent., trade 16.4 
per cent, and the professions only 4.3 
per cent. In Florida the percentage of 
farmers is even greater, or 44 per cent., 
and of men engaged in the professions, 
smaller, or 3.5 per cent. 

“A public school system, established for 
the greater good of the greatest number, 
would, if free from prejudice and from 
traditional influences, base its educational 



188 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


policy along the line of bulks of popula¬ 
tion. The curriculum would be made 
to prepare the major part of the youth 
for their life work, instead of those pre¬ 
paring to follow some profession. Until 
recent times the major part has been ig¬ 
nored. 

“The present situation gives promise of 
what is to be, although the struggle with 
tradition is still going on. Modern ed¬ 
ucation is for the masses. Practical edu¬ 
cation is coming to the front. The cul¬ 
tural and humanizing subjects are not to 
fee ignored, yet the practical should as¬ 
sert its rights. 

“Washington, in his first message to 
congress, advocated the fostering of ag¬ 
riculture; The first organization of 
farmers in the United States was founded 
in 1785 at Philadelphia. Of this society 
Washington and Benjamin Franklin 
were members. Among the committees 
appointed was one to promote agricul¬ 
tural education. This committee advo¬ 
cated the founding of professorships of 
agriculture in the colleges already estab¬ 
lished, and the giving of courses of agri¬ 
culture in the high schools. The first 
professorship of agriculture was estab¬ 
lished at Columbia in 1792. «The first 
State Agricultural College was founded 
in Michigan in 1855; although private 
schools, some of college rank, were in 
existence before this date, and a few of 
these had State aid. 

“The Federal government early mani¬ 
fested its interest, the first action being 
taken even in the time of Washington. 
In comparatively recent times this interest 
in the practical education,—in the educa¬ 
tion for agriculture and the mechanical 
arts—has grown greatlv. Various acts 
have passed and several are now pending 
in congress for the fostering of educa¬ 
tion in agriculture and the mechanical 
arts. 


“In these acts the Federal government 
seeks solely to promote instruction in ag¬ 
ricultural and mechanical arts. It be¬ 
lieves that the masses need instruction 
where their work lies. There are several 
acts still pending. 

“I11 its aid the Federal government seeks 
to throw emphasis where it is most needed 
to help the masses, to enable the man who 
toils in the sweat of his brow to do his 
work more efficiently. It seeks to uplift 
the mass of working people. Schools 
founded for this purpose should keep it 
in mind; they should strive to serve most 
of the people in the best way.” 

“I have taken the liberty to quote Dr. 
Sledd liberally, his position as an educa¬ 
tor; his knowledge of the subject, gives 
his opinion an?i statement, weig'ht and 
authority. 

“I desire to call your attention, however, 
to the fact that the effort to teach agri- 
culure, and its kindred sciences, has been 
to establish colleges, and schools of higher 
learning,—a very necessary course per¬ 
haps in the early days; when trained agri¬ 
culturists and scientists were few, when 
the science of agricultre was drabtically 
unknown; when text-books on th. subject 
were few, and not adapted to the school¬ 
room ; in fact only of value to the trained 
scientist, and so cumbered with scientific 
terms, that the ordinary teacher, to say 
nothing of the school children, failed to 
grasp their meaning or understand their 
truths, which were, frequently, simply as¬ 
sumptions, and not yet demonstrated 
facts,—There were doubtless reasons for 
beginning the structure at the roof and 
building down to the foundation. As 
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson has apt’y 
said, “Place a faculty of agricultural pro¬ 
fessors in the top story of a building with¬ 
out a stairway, and say to the boys and 
girls of the country, jump im here and 
we will teach you scientific agriculture.” 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

When we remember that of the manv 
millions of school children, only one per 
cent, or less, graduate from the high 
school, (of which 80 per cent are fe¬ 
males), that by far the greatest number 
never enter the high school, but have to 
begin their life work, with but a few 
years (or months) training in the com¬ 
mon schools, we realize how few of our 
boys and girls destined to be the farmers, 
and farmers’ wives, of the country, ever 
receive in school any practical or scientific 
knowledge of the subject which will be 
the principal, if not the only, pursuit of 
their lives. 

I will not indulge in the usual plati¬ 
tudes, “The farm the basis of wealth, the 
mudsill or foundation of the nation’s 
prosperity.” The object of my talk is to 
stimulate a demand for teaching those 
things that will be of the most value, to 
the greatest number of the future men 
and women of the country, that will ele¬ 
vate their conception of the dignity of 
their profession, and stimulate them to 
excel in its pursuit. 

Ninety per cent, of our boys and girls, 
particularly in the rural districts, “quit 
school” before reaching what is known 
as the seventh grade of the common 
schools; very few enter the high schools, 
and still fewer graduate therefrom. 

By far the larger part of our people 
begin their life’s work without finishing 
the course in the common schools, with 
a smattering of “Reading, Riting, and 
Rithmetic,” with no effort made to teach 
them any of the facts, or laws, underly¬ 
ing the profession they are to pursue. 
It would be folly for me to decry the 
value of the necessary preliminary stud¬ 
ies, arithmetic, spelling, reading and 
writing, and such fundamental branches. 
I do contend, however, that the rudi¬ 
mentary principles of Physics, Biology, 


and other natural sciences, “nature 
studies,” should be substituted for the 
ordinary “reader,”—with its fables and 
glittering generalities, elocutionary gym¬ 
nastics, and singsong poetry. Our read¬ 
ing exercises could be made useful and 
entertaining, and impart knowledge at 
the same time, language equally as pure 
taught, and correct ideas as to natural 
science imparted at the same time. 

Equally as interesting stories, inculcat¬ 
ing facts, can be substituted for the fables, 
and stories, of the present reading les¬ 
son. 

Many of the text-books on agriculture, 
—now abundant,—are interesting to a 
degree to the youthful mind,—always 
hungry for information. That child 
once taught the first law of physics, ex¬ 
pressed in simple language,—that “force 
and reaction are the same and in opposite 
directions,” will not in future life spend 
years in the futile effort to create perpet¬ 
ual motion. 

That child taught a few lessons in 
Physiology, or animal structure, will 
never be guilty of removing an animal’s 
inner eyelids to cure the “hooks,” nor 
bore a cow’s horn for “hollow horn.” 

When taught a few of the fundamental 
laws of Agricultural chemistry, he will 
not buy a ton of “guano” because it is 
cheaper than another ton; nor will he he 
persuaded to buy fertilizer, or feeds, on 
account of a name, or brand, and pay 
more for an inferior material with a 
catchy name. 

No lesson is more quickly absorbed, 
nor more easily taken in, by the average 
child than Physical geography, simply 
because it deals in facts, as to produc¬ 
tions, and conditions of various countries, 
strange animals, plants, people, and cus¬ 
toms. 

A boy or girl may not know what the 


190

definition of a continent, peninsula, is¬ 
land, or isthmus is, he knows however, 
that oranges and alligators are found in 
Florida, that “Uncle Sam” is cutting a 
big ditch at Panama; that monkeys, cof¬ 
fee, jaguars and India rubber come from 
South America. 

We do not appreciate the capacity of 
our children for facts,—they care little 
for the reasons, but want facts,—these 
should be given as fully as possible. 
Rules mean but little to children, facts 
much. 

How many of you remember the old 
“Murray’s Grammar?” with its pages of 
rules,—which we “learned by heart” and 
did not understand, (and don’t yet). The 
old “Davies” or “Todd’s” arithmetic, 
with its rules and terms,—all Greek to 
us then, and to most of us now. 

We did know (when the teacher, or 
our parents told us) that certain con¬ 
struction of sentences, or certain words 
were not correct. We learned good lan¬ 
guage from hearing it spoken. 

We now teach grammar and arithme¬ 
tic almost unconsciously, by absorption 
we might say. 

The same may be said of science, or 
“applied common sense,”—the facts 
which experience, and experiment have 
proved to be facts, governed by natural 
laws. 

How many of us members of the Hor¬ 
ticultural Society, would have avoided 
serious mistakes, expensive in time and 
money, had we as children been taught 
a few facts, as to the composition and 
use of fertilizers,—why they were neces¬ 
sary, and for what purpose applied; the 
functions of nitrogen, phosphates, and 
potash, in the plant economy? 

How many of us have had to learn by 
experience, more or less expensive, the 
facts well known to the scientist of the 


day? though forty years ago he knew 
little more than the average pupil of the 
common school does now. 

There is little chance to teach agricul¬ 
tural science, (and art), to the adult 
farmer; barring the Farmers’ Institute, 
there is no efficient method of reaching 
him. However, teach these facts to the 
children, furnish them with authentic 
and trustworthy text-books, and very 
soon the parent will himself absorb a 
very considerable part of the sciences. 

It has been said, “The education of the 
child should begin in the cradle,” no 
greater truth was ever spoken. 

“The child is father to the man,” and 
on his early training depends the future 
citizenship of the country,—while teach¬ 
ing the child,—the common school pupil, 
—the rudimentary truths, facts and laws, 
of science,—“nature study,”—by simple 
statements of facts, with little discussi©n, 
rules, or reasons,—put before him in an 
interesting manner in the shape of nar¬ 
ratives or storks, illustrating the subject; 
together with simple experiments and il¬ 
lustrations, we unconsciously, but none 
the less certainly, teach the parent many 
truths, and broaden his conception of his 
calling. For rest assured, that whatever 
deeply interests the child at school, is 
discussed at home,—commented on and 
digested to a degree, not generally under¬ 
stood nor allowed for. 

Why have our children’s imaginations 
excited, their faith in the wisdom or 
truthfulness of their teacher,—and text¬ 
books lessened, by such tales as the “Ad¬ 
ventures of Sinbad the Sailor,” “Gul¬ 
liver’s Travels,” “Don Quixote,”—inter¬ 
esting and exciting to the imaginative, 
and credulous mind of the child,—and 
other equally useless, in fact, injurious 
matter; used in the schoolroom? When 
equally choice and interesting reading

matter, describing wonderful occurrence^ 
beautiful processes, and surprising re¬ 
sults,—all inculcating truths, that will 
be of value in succeeding years, can be 
given them; equally as interesting and ex¬ 
citing to their imaginations, making last¬ 
ing impressions on their plastic minds. 
Truths told in simple language, free from 
scientific jargon, comprehensible to the 
youthful mind, or to the ordinary adult, 
who has had no scientific training, of 
which the mass of our people are com¬ 
posed. 

Among scientific literature, written in 
plain, simple language, that should be 
found in every schoolroom, and read by 
every teacher, or pupil of our common 
schools, is the little monthlv publication 
of our State Board of Health, called 
Health Notes. It deals with common 
things, common diseases, their cause and 
effects in such simple, though forceful 
language, as can be readily understood by 
any one, child or adult, who can read. 
As a pattern for a child’s or adult’s pri¬ 
mary, scientific, text-book, it is com¬ 
mendable, and should be found in every 
household in the State. 

I am pleased to say that this subject 
is now attracting the attention of school 
officers and educators everywhere. 

I note our next summer schools for 


teachers, will have the benefit of twelve 
lectures on agricultural subjects, by such 
men as, Dr. Sledd, Prof. Rolfs, Prof. 
Floyd and Prof. Fawcett, of the Univer¬ 
sity of Florida, and the Florida Experi¬ 
ment Station. Lectures that will doubt¬ 
less go far towards instructing the teach¬ 
ers of the State, as to the importance of 
acquiring a knowledge of the rudimentary 
principles of agriculture, that they may 
be better fitted to successfully prepare 
the children of the State for a broader 
view and more comprehensive knowledge 
of their future callings; that they may be 
able to dignify the farmer's profession, 
by teaching that it is truly a science, as 
well as an art, requiring more knowledge 
of all the sciences, than does that of any 
of the learned professions, to master its 
details, and successfully practice it. 

I believe the place to begin the teaching 
of agriculture is in the common school, 
just where we begin the teaching of liter¬ 
ature, and the science of numbers and 
language. That the farm, the school, 
the experiment station, and agricultural 
college, should be linked together, and 
properly co-ordinated; that we should be¬ 
gin at the foundation,—the child,—and 
build upward toward the complete edifice, 
the college, and not from the college 
downward. 





Roselle. 


By P. J. Wester. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Of the smaller fruits that have been 
introduced into the State for a compar- 
tively long time, none, with its seeming 
commercial possibilities, have been more 
neglected than roselle ( Hibiscus sab- 
dariffa ), also known under the name of 
Jamaica sorrel. Even as a household 
plant, it is not, considering the ease with 
which it is cultivated, grown as widely 
as it deserves. At the Subtropical Lab¬ 
oratory we have paid particular attention 
to the cultivation of this plant for nearly 
four years, and on receiving an invita¬ 
tion from the President of the Society to 
deliver an address at this meeting, I se¬ 
lected this as a timely subject, so much 
the more as during the existence of the 
Society only once, in 1899, if I am rightly 
informed, has the attention of the mem¬ 
bers been called to the roselle. This pa¬ 
per is Farmers’ Bulletin No. 307 con¬ 
densed, where the subject is more fully 
treated, with such additional data as have 
been obtained since that bulletin was 
written. 

As those of you who are acquainted 
with roselle know, the plant is an an¬ 
nual and resembles somewhat the cotton 
plant in habit, attaining a height of from 
five to seven feet, with about a like 
spread, under favorable conditions. Its 
large, red-eyed yellow flowers indicate 
its relationship to the okra, the various 
species of ornamental hibiscus and the 


cotton plant. It is indigenous to the Old 
World tropics, but is now probably dis¬ 
seminated to all the tropical and subtrop¬ 
ical countries. Some twenty or more 
years ago the roselle was introduced into 
Florida, the name Jamaica sorrel being 
probably an indication that the plant was 
introduced from Jamaica. 

Keeping in mind that lands subjected 
to flooding and insufficiently drained 
lands should be avoided, as well as lands 
infested with the rootknot nematode 
(Heterodera radicicola ) to which the 
plant is very much subject, the roselle 
seems to thrive on any of our Florida 
soils that are moderately rich or sup¬ 
plied with the necessary plant food in 
the form of commercial fertilizer. If sta¬ 
ble manure is used it should be supple¬ 
mented with phosphates and fertilizers 
that contain potash, as an excess of am¬ 
monia in the soil tends to the develop¬ 
ment of large plants at the expense of 
their productiveness. 

The plants may be started in a seed¬ 
bed in the spring and planted out in the 
field similarly to tomatoes, or the seeds 
may be planted in the hills where they 
are to remain and thinned out to one 
plant to a hill. The rows should be 
from six to ten feet apart and the plants 
set out four to eight feet apart in the 
row according to the fertility of the 
land and the supply of moisture. In our 
experience a mixture similar to tomato 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


fertilizer has been found to be very sat¬ 
isfactory, applied at the rate of 1,000 to 
2,000 pounds per acre. Where a few 
plants are set out for home use most 
fertilizers that are available would 
probably serve the purpose. 

The greatest drain on the vitality of 
the plant is the ripening of the seed and 
if the calyces are picked as soon as they 
are full grown instead of allowing them 
to become more mature, the plant, in the 
effort to reproduce itself, sends out new 
flower-buds that set fruit continuously 
until cut down by frost if it is not injured 
bv diseases or insect enemies. 

In a report from the Porto Rico Ex¬ 
periment Station, 1906, the yield per 
plant is given as four pounds of fruit 
while some plants were estimated to 
yield double that amount. At the Sub¬ 
tropical Laboratory during the past few 
years we have been engaged in the breed¬ 
ing of a variety having larger calyces 
than the common kind and during the 
last fall and winter weighed the fruit 
from eight plants of this variety to as¬ 
certain the average yield. The data ob¬ 
tained, which are given in the following 
table, are quite interesting. 

Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent one 
plant each and No. 6 represents calyces 
from three plants weighed together. The 
yield from No. 1 was so markedly larger 
than from the rest of the plants 
that it was thought desirable to save the 
seed for breeding purposes, which ex¬ 
plains the omissions in yield from Jan¬ 
uary 6 to February 8, 1908, at which 
latter date part of the ripe calyces were 
saved and the remainder February 18. 
January 25 the calyces of all the plants 
except No. 1 (which was tented) were 
picked for fear that the plants might 
freeze down in an approaching cold wave. 


193 

Subsequently all the plants in this exper¬ 
iment died from the attack of rootknot 
nematodes, except No. 1, which was 
pruned back, has continued to bloom and 
is still in active growth and setting fruit.

Porto Rico as compared with that ob¬ 
tained by the Subtropical Laboratory, 
due partly to continued breeding and se¬ 
lection, and probably in part to more fa¬ 
vorable conditions and perhaps to better 
cultivation. 

In Florida the plant has thus far been 
grown for home use only and the caly¬ 
ces used in making a sauce similar to 
that made of the cranberry, or in jelly 
making. Besides the two products already 
mentioned, the roselle yields a most ex¬ 
cellent fruit syrup that can be used in the 
home in various ways. It can also be 
used as a flavoring extract at soda foun¬ 
tains. 

When the calyces are used as a sauce 
the seedpods must of course necessarily 
be removed but last fall we found that 
this is not necessary in the making of 
jelly. In the manufacture of jelly on a 
commercial scale this is an important con¬ 
sideration, as the removal of the seed- 
pod is at present a slow and tedious pro¬ 
cess.. 

Several years ago Mr. W. W. Tracy 
of the Bureau of Plant Industry, made 
jelly of the tender twigs and branches, 
but did not follow up his discovery to 
ascertain its commercial possibilities. 
Acting on this suggestion, during the 
past year the writer experimented with 
extracting the acid from the whole plant 
by boiling both the young stems and the 
leaves. The jelly obtained in this way 
was perhaps a little more difficult to 
make than that made from the calyces, 
but it is possible that some mistake in 
making it was the cause of this, for I 
understand that Mrs. P. H. Rolfs has 
made jelly from the stems and leaves that 
she considered fully equal to that made 
from the calyces of the plant. An excel¬ 
lent fruit syrup is also obtained from the 


same source that may be used in the 
household or used as a flavoring extract 
in soda water fountains. Utilized in this 
way the plant can be grown in a large 
territory of the United States and the 
ease with which the plant is cultivated 
probably renders it a cheaper source for 
flavoring extract than any other plant. 

The only disease that has so far been 
observed on roselle is a mildew that at¬ 
tacks all parts of the plant above ground 
and if the disease appears early it is apt 
to do considerable damage if it is allowed 
to spread unchecked. An experiment to 
ascertain the comparative value of dry 
sulphur, sulphuric acid diluted one part 
to 500, 1,000 and 2,000 parts of water, 
respectively, and liver of sulphur as a 
remedy for the disease was made last 
fall at the Subtropical Laboratory. 
Their comparative values as fungicides 
were found to be as in the order named. 
The sulphur should be applied early in 
the morning while the plants are still wet 
with dew. 

In addition to the soft scale ( Coccus 
hesperidum ) another scale was noted on 
roselle last fall. Specimens were sent 
to Dr. L. O. Howard, Chief of the Bu¬ 
reau of Entomology, United States-De¬ 
partment of Agriculture, who identified 
them as Hemichionaspis aspidistrae. It 
appears, however, to do very little dam¬ 
age as, while multiplying itself rapidly, 
the scale is followed by a parasite ( Aspi - 
diotiphagus citrinus) that seems to keep 
it well in check. 

In Queensland the cultivation of the 
roselle has assumed a commercial aspect 
during the past few years and consider¬ 
able quantities of roselle jam are yearly 
exported to Europe. In the Unite! 
States, aside from the home use as a 
sauce, the most popular products would

probably be jelly, a fruit syrup for the known to the public the roselle will fur- 
table use, or diluted with water as a cool- nish the basis for a considerable indus- 
ing drink and as a flavoring extract for try along these lines in the United States 
cool drink stands. The writer ventures at no distant date, in which Florida, due 
to express the opinion that when the man- to her geographical position, should have 
ufactured products of roselle become a large share.

Efforts to Secure Better Shipping Facilities and 

Rates. 


By F. D. Warner. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

For as far back as most of us can 
remember we have been complaining 
.of high freight rates on our fruit and 
vegetables, but it is only within the 
past year that any concentrated effort 
on our part has been taken to remedy 
the evil. Many cases of individual ef¬ 
forts have been made, but to no avail. 
But today we have a strong organiza¬ 
tion to fight for our rights, and if we 
can have the co-operation of all ship¬ 
pers we can accomplish much, we be¬ 
lieve. 

As most of you will recall, the 
Gainesville Melon Growers’ Associa¬ 
tion called a meeting in Jacksonville 
in February, 1907, for the purpose of 
securing a car-lot rate on our fruits 
and vegetables to the eastern markets 
and to form an association for that 
purpose. At that meeting there were 
some sixty members who joined and 
now we number over five hundred, 
with only one resignation during the 
year. 

Shortly after this meeting we had a 
conference with the representatives of 
the various railways leading out of the 
state, at the office of our secretary, J. 
C. Chase, Jacksonville, at which time 
they promised to take the matter up 
and give us some relief, but failed to 


do so; but instead asked us to meet 
them in Washington on November 
6th, which we did, our attorney also 
being present at this conference. We 
made them a compromise proposition, 
as follows: 5 cents reduction on stan¬ 
dard crates and 10 cents on bbls. or¬ 
anges and pineapples, with a refrigera¬ 
tion of 15 cents a package instead of 
20 cents, with a minimum of 20,000 
pounds to all eastern points. This 
they refused, but came back to us with 
a proposition-granting about one-half 
of our compromise ; which we in turn 
refused and took the matter before the 
Inter-State Commission in its original 
form, which amounts to much more 
than we were willing to compromise 
for. The first hearing before the Com¬ 
mission was held at Washington on 
February 4th, at which time we had 
eight witnesses from Florida and sev¬ 
eral from the commission merchants 
at the north. This meeting, as you 
know, was adjourned to Jacksonville 
on March 18th for the want of time, 
and as you all know we had a large 
representation. The final hearing 
takes place tomorrow at Washington, 
and we can look for some decision 
some time in June. 

There was a called meeting at Lake¬ 
land on April 21st, which meeting 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


197 


took the place of the annual meeting 
which should have been held in Feb¬ 
ruary. At this meeting the old officers 
were re-elected and several added to 
the board of directors. The matter of 
adopting a standard size box for both 
the celery and orange was gone into 
to considerable extent, but no action 
was taken to make the Florida orange 
box to conform to the California size, 
i. e., 11 J4xi 1^2x26. 

The matter was laid over until the 
next meeting, which will be held in 
Jacksonville some time in July, when 
we will have heard from the Commis¬ 
sion. i'-'j 

It was decided at Lakeland to con¬ 
tinue the Association and to take up 
the many matters which we are dis¬ 
criminated against both by express 
and freight. Some of our best markets 
are south of the Ohio and Potomac 
rivers and yet the rate is often higher 
than points beyond. 

There is no salaried office in this As¬ 
sociation and the officers have been 
faithful and loyal to the cause and have 
sacrificed much time and money, and 
we want the help of every person who 
ships a package of fruits or vegetables. 
We would also like to have the en¬ 
dorsement of this Society in good, 
strong terms. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Warner—This report is simply 
to show what has been done to secure 
better rates, especially car-lot rates for 
eastern points, than we now have. 
They have given us a promise that 
they will make a decision before they 
adjourn about the first of July. We 
would also like to have the endorse¬ 
ment of the Society. The railroads 


have tried to belittle our efforts, but 
we contend that we represent about 
seventy-five per cent, of all fruits and 
vegetables shipped. If all you people 
will come with us and stick to us and 
all of us hold together, we can get 
pretty nearly what we ask for, which, 
of course, is only our rights. I believe 
I have given you an outline of what 
has been done. We have here a copy 
of our attorney’s brief, but the testi¬ 
mony in our case amounts to volumes 
and volumes. I will be glad to answer 
any questions that any of you care to 
ask. 

Mr.-Have your efforts been con¬ 

fined to oranges and pineapples? 

Mr. Warner—No, sir; we have been 
working for better rates on everything 
that is raised in the state. 

Mr. Frink—I would like to ask Mr. 
Warner if the object of this Fruit 
Growers’ Association is to make a per¬ 
manent organization of it and continue 
the fight for better rates and better 
facilities of all classes of fruit and veg¬ 
etables, not only now but in the future. 

Mr. Warner—Yes, sir; that is the 
object of this Association, and in the 
meeting at Lakeland it was moved that 
the Association be continued. The 
final hearing that comes up tomorrow 
is for a carload rate to the East, which 
we do not now enjoy. We want to 
enjoy the same blanket rate that Cali¬ 
fornia has now on oranges, both East 
and West. 

Mr. Frink—I am in favor of Mr. 
Warner’s work, and think the mem¬ 
bers will all be in favor of it if they 
understand it. It is a great work and 
needs to be looked into more carefully 
in the future than it has been in the 
past. 





198 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Mr. Hart—It has a membership of 
about five hundred, hasn’t it? 

Mr. Warner—Yes, sir. 

Mr. Hart—Why didn’t they call on 
us ? 

Mr. Warner—They did. We have 
written letter after letter, and asked 
everybody to help us that we possibly 
could. But we have not had funds 
enough to foot the bills, and have had 
to go down in our pockets, because we 
thought we were doing the right thing. 

Mr. Skinner—The penalty of being 
a Director is about $500.00. 

Mr. Warner—We have hired the 
best attorneys we could hire. We have 
hired attorneys to get up briefs and 
have had all kinds of expenses to con¬ 
tend with and nothing to meet them 
with, unless we paid them ourselves. 
The next meeting will be held in Jack¬ 
sonville some time in July. 

Mr.- 1 would like to ask if any re¬ 

duction was asked for anything less 
than carload lots. 

Mr. Warner—No, sir. We thought 
we had a fight big enough for us to 
handle when we asked for a reduction 
on carload lots. There is a great deal 
of shipping done in less than car lots. 
They made a proposition to us say¬ 
ing that they would give us a carload 
rate provided we would accept their 
terms on less than carload lots. We 
refused to do this. However, the fight 
was taken up originally to get a car¬ 
load rate on fruits and vegetables. 

Mr. Skinner—The Clyde Steamship 
Line pays the Atlantic Coast Line 
Company ten cents for every package 
they deliver to them at Jacksonville, 
as a sort of compromise for not carry¬ 
ing it to Savannah and delivering it to 
the Ocean Steamship Line. The rate 


to Jacksonville is from 17 cents to 20 
cents on oranges. The rate to New 
York is 35 cents, 10 cents of that goes 
to the A. C. L. We contend, and I 
think we are supported in our belief, 
that they are transgressing the law, 
and that they should carry it to New 
York for 25 cents. The grower should 
have the benfit of the 10 cents that is 
paid to the A. C. L. 

Mr. Warner—In other words, the 
Clyde Line pays the Coast Line 10 
cents for not hauling it to Savannah. 
Now, gentlemen, if we will join to¬ 
gether and stick together, there is no 
doubt but that we can get our just de¬ 
serts and I think it is the duty of every 
one of us to uphold this Association in 
its fight. 

Mr. Skinner—It means about $200,- 
000 to the state if we win out. This 
is worth fighting for. 

Prof. Rolfs—I think we ought to 
hold up the hands of the Association, 
like holding up Aaron’s hands of old. 
I understood, Mr. Skinner, that a com¬ 
mittee was appointed this morning to 
prepare resolutions of some kind com¬ 
mendatory of the work this organiza¬

Orange and Grape Fruit Statistics. 

By P. Phillips, M.D. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Enclosed please find letters from the 
different railroad companies, in the 
state of Florida, with the exception 
of the East Coast Railroad, which I 
explain here below. 

The crop for the year of 1906-07, 
three million seven hundred seventy- 
six thousand naught eighteen (3,766,- 
018). I estimated the crop for the 
year of 1907-08 to be sixty per cent, 
of the above amount. This will make 
it 2,265,610. I will gladly get up the 
statistics again from the different rail¬ 
road companies of Florida, the num¬ 
ber of boxes shipped the past season 
and compare it with my estimate, pro¬ 
vided the Society desires me to do so. 

The East Coast Railway Company, 
I estimated, had five hundred thousand 
boxes, and after correspondence with 
them, I found that my estimate was 
not far wrong. I, therefore, think I 
have it as near as possible to the cor¬ 
rect amount that was shipped out of 
the state during the year of 1906-07. 

Hoping the State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety will continue to prosper, and 
with you—its president—I know they 
will succeed, I beg to remain, 

Yours truly, 

P. Phillips. 


Dr. P. Phillips, Orlando, Fla. 

Dear Sir—In reply to your letter of 
September 28th, I beg to advise that 
the Atlantic Coast Line handled dur¬ 
ing the season of 1906-07, 2,375,898 
boxes of oranges. 

Yours truly, 

James Menzies, 
General Freight Agent. 


Dr. P. Phillips, Orlando, Fla. 

Dear Sir—Replying to your favor 
of the 30th ultimo, would advise that 
during the year 1906 the Southern Ex¬ 
press Company handled 250,120 boxes 
of oranges. Respectfully,

Nursery Inspection From the Inspector’s Side. 


By E. W. Berger. 

Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 


The essential parts of this paper 
were written nearly a year ago, and 
were then intended to be a contribu¬ 
tion toward supplementing Nursery 
Inspection (i) and (2), published by 
Prof. H. A. Gossard as Press Bulletins 
Nos. 6 and 7 of the Florida Agricul¬ 
tural Experiment Station, and repub¬ 
lished in the Florida Agriculturist for 
June 19 and 26, 1907, pp. 5 and 7, re¬ 
spectively. The purpose of the paper 
was to set forth more fully the prac¬ 
tices of inspectors as understood by 
the writer, based upon his own experi¬ 
ence, and the experience of other in¬ 
spectors obtained verbally and from 
their writings. The writer realizes 
that, considered from the standpoint of 
the ideal, the inspection of nurseries, 
as practiced in the United States, is 
frequently open to criticism; but the 
subject has been treated here as modi¬ 
fied by the conditions which exist, 
rather than from an ideal point of 
view. In other words, we have to deal 
with a practical question and not a 
theory. 

THE RIGHTS OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES. 

These naturally come under three 
heads: those of the buyer, the nursery¬ 
man, and the inspector. 

The Buyer. —The buyer, or grower, 
is perhaps the most vitally interested 
of all, and generally has the least to 


say in regard to the inspection of the 
goods he desires to buy. That the 
buyer might have much to say will be 
brought out later. The buyer has the 
right to be protected; but at its very 
best, a certificate from an inspector 
cannot be a perfect guarantee of free¬ 
dom from insects and diseases; a fact 
noted in Nursery Inspection (2), and 
generally recognized by experienced 
inspectors. The point is, that it is 
physically impossible to examine every 
tree in a nursery, to say nothing of 
examining all parts of a tree. Never¬ 
theless, a certificate signifies much. 
After the inspector has examined, say, 
the four sides of a large block of stock 
and has passed through it in several 
directions, carefully scrutinizing ab¬ 
normal appearances as well as making 
a close inspection of an occasional tree, 
he feels reasonably certain whether 
the block is clean or not. Besides 
signifying that a diligent search has 
been made, a certificate implies that 
moral obligations have been assumed 
by the nurseryman. It thus becomes 
especially obligatory upon him to send 
out nothing but clean stock. Then 
there is a further deterring influence, 
namely the fear of exposure and for¬ 
feiture of the certificate if he sends out 
infested or diseased stock. 

In view of the fact that a certificate 
cannot be an absolute guarantee, it has 
been suggested that a written guaran- 



202 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tee from the nurseryman should be 
substituted for a certificate. But why 
should a written guarantee from the 
nurseryman not be required to accom¬ 
pany the inspector's certificate? Every 
buyer has the power to demand such 
a guarantee. Again, it has been sug¬ 
gested, that fumigation should be sub¬ 
stituted for a certificate, or that a cer¬ 
tificate of fumigation from the nurs¬ 
eryman should be required to- accom¬ 
pany each shipment of certified stock. 
The requirement of a certificate of 
fumigation from the nurseryman, to¬ 
gether with an inspector’s certificate, 
is the law in Georgia and some other 
states. Again, defoliation together 
with the cutting back of the tender 
growth should be required in all ship¬ 
ments, and several nurserymen now 
make this practice. In fact, one should 
practice not only defoliation and cut¬ 
ting back, but fumigation as well. 
There remains only the addition of the 
written guarantee, and I hope soon to 
see some nurserymen take this for¬ 
ward step. A nurseryman could give 
a guarantee which the inspector can¬ 
not give, because every tree sold ought 
to come under his or some competent 
person’s scrutiny at the time of digging 
and packing. 

It has been objected that fumiga¬ 
tion, defoliation, and cutting back are 
injurious to trees. In regard to de¬ 
foliation, the preponderance of evi¬ 
dence, so far as the writer can judge, 
indicates that, at least under certain 
climatic conditions, it is not injurious; 
and some even state instances where 
defoliated trees started off better than 
others not defoliated. Should fumiga¬ 
tion cause the death of some trees and 
retard the growth of others—a doubt¬ 


ful contingency—yet the loss of a few 
trees should not be deprecated when 
it may involve the saving of a whole 
grove from becoming overrun by in¬ 
sects. It is the writer’s opinion that 
defoliation, together with cutting back 
and fumigation, should be practiced by 
all nurserymen, in fact insisted upon 
by the buyer, whether any noxious in¬ 
sects are suspected to be upon the 
stock or not; for there are other pests, 
such as rust mite, red spider, orange 
weevil, and perhaps still others, living 
on the leaves and roots [the grubs of 
the orange weevil live on the roots], 
which would probably be completely 
eradicated by this means. 

No stock should be shipped partially 
exposed [leafy tops left uncovered], 
but it should be so covered and wrap¬ 
ped as to make it secure against be¬ 
coming infested in transit. We need 
only to bear in mind the possibility 
that a package of citrus trees may 
come in contact, either in the express 
car or at the railway station, with a 
crate of scale-infested citrus fruit, or 
a package of peach, plum, or other 
similar trees, or with some San Jose 
scale-infested fruit; when the in¬ 
festation may spread to the previously 
clean stock, if it was not completely 
and properly covered. All these re¬ 
quirements, I believe, are quite within 
the reach of the buyer, and need simply 
to be insisted upon when he contracts 
for his trees. 

Further, in regard to a written 
guarantee from the nurseryman, it wiU 
be evident that the nurseryman could 
not give a guarantee of freedom from 
insects and diseases extending ahead 
over any long period of time. The best 
form of written guarantee would pro- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


203 


bably be one to the effect that the 
stock was guaranteed to be free from 
all living insects (mites included), 
insect larvae, insect eggs, or other dis¬ 
eases, at the time of its delivery. If 
newly-set stock is found to be free 
from infestation when it has matured 
a new crop of foliage, this would be 
fairly clear evidence that it was clean 
when received. If infestation with in¬ 
sects, or infection with disease, was 
discovered by the time a new crop of 
foliage had matured, expert evidence 
[inspection of the neighboring prem¬ 
ises, and of the nursery from which 
the stock was obtained] would have to 
decide the case. Such a guarantee 
would also be in the nature of a chal¬ 
lenge to the buyer or grower to find 
insects and disease if he could; and 
no nurseryman would make such a 
challenge if the stock he shipped was 
not clean. 

In conclusion, the writer believes 

that the grower can best protect him¬ 
self by making' the following require¬ 
ments the conditions of buying a nurs¬ 
eryman’s stock: 

1. A written guarantee that the 

stock is free from noxious insects and 
diseases at the time of its delivery. 

2. A written guarantee that the 

contents of each package have been 
properly fumigated prior to shipment 
[ornamentals and other stock which 
would be killed by fumigation alone 
not to be fumigated, or fumigated with 
a smaller dose]. 

3. The complete defoliation and 

cutting back of all stock (especially 
citrus) prior to shipment [ornamentals 
and other stock which would be killed 
bv such treatment alone excepted]. 


4. Complete protection of the stock 
from outside contamination through 
insects and diseases during transporta¬ 
tion, by a properly constructed box or 
other covering. 

The writer also desires to direct the 
growers' attention to the following 
law: 

Ch. 4814, Acts 1899, Sects. 1 and 2. 

3701. The Sale or giving away of 
Diseased Nursery Stock or Seeds.—It 
shall be unlawful for any person to 
knowingly sell or give away any dis¬ 
eased nursery stock or seeds in the 
State of Florida. Any person violat¬ 
ing this section shall be fined not more 
than five. hundred dollars or impris¬ 
oned not more than six months-.—Gen. 
Statutes of the State of Florida, 1906. 

From the foregoing it will be seen 
that the grower has these matters 
wholly under his control, and all that 
is necessary is for him to take advan¬ 
tage of his rights. 

The Nurseryman. —That the nurs¬ 
eryman also has some rights must be 
conceded. When nursery inspection 
has become definitely established un¬ 
der well-defined laws and regulations 
within a State; and when a larger num¬ 
ber of nurserymen have learned to 
realize that a knowledge of insect 
pests and plant diseases is quite as im¬ 
portant to their business as the ability 
to grow plants; and when by the 
bringing of gradually increasing press¬ 
ure by inspectors from year to year, 
greater vigilance will be exercised and 
thoroughly up-to-date methods be em¬ 
ployed in all nurseries ; we may assume 
it proper to refuse a nurseryman a 
certificate in whose stock but one spe¬ 
cimen even of a species of noxious in¬ 
sect is found. But where, as in Flor- 



204 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ida, nursery inspection has not become 
systematized; and where, furthermore, 
citrus nursery stock has not before 
been certified [the writer did this for 
the first time last fall, when several 
states and foreign countries required 
citrus stock to be admitted under cer¬ 
tificate only]; it appears no more than 
fair that conditions of fumigation, de¬ 
foliation, etc., should sometimes be re¬ 
quired in giving a certificate in lieu 
of absolute freedom from insects. I 
admit that to the buyer one insect is 
as bad as a thousand, and the case 
merits careful thought and considera¬ 
tion. But the nurseryman having spent 
thousands of dollars to grow his trees, 
feels that to be refused a certificate 
means bankruptcy. The grower hardly 
desires to see the nurseryman bank¬ 
rupted, neither does he wish to see his 
own property jeopardized. In such an 
instance the inspector almost invaria¬ 
bly steps into the breach, so to speak. 
His knowledge of a certain pest, for 
instance, convinces him that the stock 
should be absolutely safe when cut 
back, defoliated and fumigated. He 
requires this as a condition of giving 
the certificate. The nurseryman as¬ 
sumes the moral obligation of good 
faith and the other conditions previ¬ 
ously referred to, and the case is gen¬ 
erally settled; unless the nurseryman, 
to his discredit and to the detriment 
of the inspector, breaks faith. Besides 
the above stipulations the inspector 
may require the destruction of all in¬ 
fested trees, and the exclusion of cer¬ 
tain blocks of stock from the market; 
or the entire nursery may be placed 
under quarantine pending a period of 
cleaning up. All of these practices are 
in the nature of a compromise; but 


they are practiced by all inspectors in 
some form or other, as will be evident 
from a perusal of the literature availa¬ 
ble on the subject. 

In connection with this same point 
we may imagine the case of two nurs¬ 
erymen, one of whom succeeds in con¬ 
cealing any disease in his stock; while 
the other one does not attempt this, 
and even points out the doubtful trees 
to the inspector. Under a cast-iron 
rule of “one insect—no certificate,” 
the honest man would fail to get a cer¬ 
tificate, while his less honest neighbor 
would get one. Again, of two neigh¬ 
boring small nurseries, the one is per¬ 
haps found infested or diseased; the 
other one is not, and gets a certificate. 
The whole of a large nursery is as 
large as two small ones; one portion is 
perhaps infested, the other part not. In 
view of the fact that the inspector can 
hardly, under ordinary conditions, re¬ 
fuse a certificate to the small clean 
nursery; then ought not the large 
nursery to be certified, with proper re¬ 
strictions, to the extent of its clean 
portions, leaving the infested portion 
without any certificate? Besides, if 
the man with the clean, small nursery 
is dishonest, he may buy infested stock 
from his neighbor and sell it under his 
certificate. 

The Inspector.— The rights of the 
inspector—what are they? He is en¬ 
titled to a hearing if anything is sup¬ 
posed to be going wrong. He should 
be the first one to be notified. Thus, 
last fall, the entomologist of a certain 
southern state wrote to me stating 
that there were rumors of unclean 
stock having been shipped into that 
state from Florida. I asked him to send 
me particulars at once. He answered 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


205 


that he would as soon as he had seen 
th stock in question; but as lxe was 
never heard from again in regard to 
this matter, it is to be presumed that 
the rumor was without foundation. 

The inspector must insist upon the 
right to use his judgment. It is not 
unfair to assume that his knowledge 
of insects qualifies him for this beyond 
all others, few excepted. In the facts 
already discussed, the writer has im¬ 
plied that, under certain restrictions 
and preliminary operations, certificates 
are sometimes issued where adherence 
to a fixed rule would prohibit this. In¬ 
spection in Florida is not for Florida 
itself, but for other states and coun¬ 
tries which admit stock only under 
certificate. The inspection require¬ 
ments of these states and countries will 
therefore naturally be made the chief 
guide in the inspection of Florida 
nurseries. Furthermore, when the 
writer was in doubt he wrote to the 
entomologist of a certain southern 
state into which he knew that large 
quantities of citrus wotfld be shipped 
from Florida, and received the follow¬ 
ing answer: “Our plan in Louisiana 
is to give a certificate of inspection to 
nurseries, even when whitefly is pres¬ 
ent; provided, of course, that we have 
no reason to believe the nurseries in 
question will not thoroughly defoliate 
the stock.’' With this statement in 
mind, I acted so as to meet the exig¬ 
encies of the case, and I believe that 
the interests of the grower have been 
safeguarded; for no one has yet 
claimed to have found whitefly on 
citrus stock sold under the writer’s 
certificate. I did more than the previ¬ 
ous statement exacted, for I required 
the stock to be fumigated besides; 


which to the best of my knowledge, 
together with cutting back and com¬ 
plete defoliation, makes citrus trees 
safe from whitefly. The following cir¬ 
cular was sent to nurserymen on No¬ 
vember 12, 1907, and a revised form 
will be jssued during this summer or 
fall. 

PRELIMINARY CIRCULAR TO NURSERYMEN. 

Following are several simple re¬ 
quirements, compliance with which is 
expected from every nurseryman re¬ 
ceiving a certificate: 

1. To fumigate all nursery stock 
prior to shipment; excepting ship¬ 
ments to states and countries that 
fumigate all stock at the port of en¬ 
try; excepting to parties desiring to 
do their own fumigation; and except¬ 
ing a few ornamentals, such as roses, 
that do not stand fumigation, and coni¬ 
fers. 

2. To defoliate all stock, if not al¬ 
ready defoliated, at the time of ship¬ 
ment. A few ornamentals that do not 
stand defoliation are alone excepted; 
and shipments of citrus stock may be 
excepted during November and De¬ 
cember if the buyer so requests, pro¬ 
vided the same are fumigated and 
completely enclosed in a box or in bur¬ 
lap. 

3. Since it is impossible for the in¬ 
spector to examine every tree in the 
nursery, it is imperative for the nurs¬ 
eryman to see to it that no diseased 
stock is sent out. This should be a 
simple matter, since each tree must be 
handled several times in preparing it 
for shipment. 

4. The inspector reserves the right 
to re-inspect, at the expense of the 
nurseryman, any nursery previously 


206 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


certified, for the purpose of verifying 
that all conditions have been, or are 
being, fulfilled; and to annul the cer¬ 
tificate if the conditions in the nursery 
prove unsatisfactory, or if any require¬ 
ments upon which the certificate is 
conditioned are violated. 

N. B.—The purpose of Rule i is not 
to encourage nurserymen to be less 
careful in keeping out whitefly, scales, 
etc.; for a badly infested nursery will 


not be certified under any conditions. 

E. W. Berger. 

Entomologist to Florida Agricultural 
Experiment Station, Gainesville. 

In conclusion, the present inspector 
can in no sense be considered a state 
official, and inspections have been 
carried on by the Experiment Station 
solely to meet the exigencies of nurs¬ 
erymen doing business with other 
states and with foreign countries. 


THE GROWER'S SIDE. 


C. B. Thornton. 


Mr. President } Ladies and Gentlemen: 

As a member of the Committee on 
Nursery Inspection would say: In my 
opinion, the only measure to insure jus¬ 
tice to all, is a State law, so framed that 
all nurserymen in Florida large or small, 
selling trees in the State, especially citrus 
trees, are compelled to have a certificate 
duly attested, from a State officer, com¬ 
petent to judge, stating the absolute con¬ 
dition of the trees offered for sale and' 
this done often enough to give security to 
the buyer. This is a drastic remedy but 
in no other way can positive security be 
given the buyer nor an impartiality hin¬ 
dered between the different nurserymen. 

As a prominent nurseryman writes me: 
‘‘How much good will it do you if I sell 
a lot of nursery trees to you, duly in¬ 
spected, passed, and finally to make sure, 
fumigated and your neighbor “J”—, 


going to a little out of the way nursery, 
buys a lot of trees infested with scale, 
mealy bug, white fly and all other ills? 
How long will your trees stand in their 
neighborhood without becoming in¬ 
fested? At present nursery inspection is 
simply of no value to Florida and with 
the exception of out of the State and 
West Indian business, it does not amount 
to a row of pins.” This is from an 
experienced, successful nurservman. Un¬ 
less a severe State measure is passed, all 
that should be required 1 of a Florida nur¬ 
seryman is, that lie has his stock free 
from white fly and mealy bug. These two 
are the most dreaded and justly so. Un¬ 
less radical measures are taken at once, 
the white fly will be prevalent in all 
citrus growing parts of the State as the 
common purple or long scale is at present 
and this in spite of all sprays, fumiga¬ 
tions, fungus or other preventatives. 




Cultivating and Fertilizing Citrus Trees. 


J. D. Bell. 


Mr. President f Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It is not to be expected, since horticul¬ 
tural science has become a lifetime study 
in what may be called) the producers col¬ 
leges, established by our government all 
over our country, that much that is new 
can be brought you by a lay member 
of our brotherhood. I shall endeavor 
to remind you anew of well known facts, 
upon the principle that line upon line 
and' precept uppn precept is needed in our 
business as in all others. Cultivation is a 
word having a vast range, applying not 
only to the every day business of the hor¬ 
ticulturist but to every department of 
human activity. In the limited sense in 
which we are to consider it today let us 
call to mind why we cultivate. First, to 
conserve moisture; second, to put the soil 
in good tilth; third, to kill grass and 
weeds which are taking tree food from 
the soil; fourth to decrease evaporation. 

During the months of 'March, April 
and May in Florida the orange grove 
should be cultivated 1 every ten days. In 
the fall the grove should be plowed shal¬ 
low, this being the best method of put¬ 
ting it in a clean condition for winter 
and thus reducing danger from cold. As 
to the tools and minor particulars of cul¬ 
tivation every grower should judge by 
his own experience what is best for him¬ 
self or follow the example of his most 
successful neighbor. In the dry weather 
of spring and early summer cultivate 


shallow, cultivate often. During the 
rainy season cease cultivation. 

Prof. Hume says “the horse and cul¬ 
tivator are often a most excellent sub¬ 
stitute for an irrigation plant.” Some 
one has said “cultivation is fertilization.” 
Theory and practice strongly enforce the 
necessity of frequent and thorough cul¬ 
tivation during our dry season. An 
equally important duty of the orange 
grower is a liberal use of fertilizers. 
Citrus trees amply repay good care and 
attention. Not less than one ton of the 
best quality of fertilizer should be ap¬ 
plied to each acre of bearing grove. A 
good way of guaging the quantity of fer¬ 
tilizer for a bearing tree is to increase 
your applications until your tree has a 
good crop of oranges and is at the same 
time making a good growth. Look over 
your grove and endeavor to make every 
tree in it as good as the best one. Scat¬ 
ter fertilizer broadcast through the grove, 
except for young trees, then scatter upon 
the feeding roots. Some successful grow¬ 
ers fertilize in January, May and Octo¬ 
ber. Others in February, June and No¬ 
vember. Three applications are better 
than a less number, having the same 
amount of fertilizer. Work in fertilizer 
soon after it is applied. Always be lib¬ 
eral with your trees, a stingy man can¬ 
not make a great success in orange 
growing.

Reports from Local and Horticultural Societies. 


By Lawrence C. Moore. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

At the time I received President 
Rolf’s circular letter (which was 
doubtless mailed to every member), 
naming certain subjects which should 
have the attention of our Society, and 
then mentally examined my stock of 
knowledge upon said subjects I threw 
the letter in with my answered mail, 
satisfying my conscience with the 
thought that he would find more fully 
equipped men to discuss and entertain- 
ingly present all the leading facts; so, 
donning my hat, I wandered forth to 
my orange trees, drying up for want 
of water and cultivation, with work 
enough in sight to keep three men 
busy for a year! But—two topics kept 
persistent hold of my mind and I found 
myself repeating the old adage, “What 
is everybody’s business is nobody’s 
business,” and, in my egotism, I ap¬ 
plied it to the letter of our President, 
and persuaded myself that it was my 
duty to do the little I might, to hold 
up his hands—send him some response 
and leave it to him to present the best 
thought offered on any given subject, 
or to dissect each paper, and combine 
the best ideas, to the end that individ¬ 
ual knowledge might be increased and 
some progress be the result. I there¬ 
fore throw upon him the whole respon¬ 
sibility should this paper reach other 
eyes—or ears—than his own! 

Having determined my duty, next 
came the selection of the subject. This 


was not difficult; it was suggested on 
every hand by the wilting trees, the 
encrusted ground, the hot, dry winds 
and eight or ten neighbors sitting 
around whittling, smoking and dis¬ 
cussing everything but the improve¬ 
ment of surrounding conditions. Per¬ 
haps it was the strong contrast to all 
this which caused my mind to revert 
to my boyhood’s days, when I had the 
good fortune to spend several happy 
vacations in that wonderfully thrifty 
Quaker settlement, Sandy Spring, 
Montgomery county, Maryland, where 
both my grandmother and my honored 
father first saw the light. Here the 
local Horticultural Society has ce¬ 
mented the neighborhood into one 
homogeneous 'whole, and no such con¬ 
ditions as those surrounding me could 
exist under the unity plan. Neglected 
trees, idle men have no part or place 
in that community, but persistent 
labor and the helping hand of neigh¬ 
borly neighbors have converted it into 
one of the garden spots of this country. 

And so I wrote to our President and 
accepted an assignment on “Local 
Horticultural Societies.” Then came 
the rub; I was committed; had to 
work out a given thing in a given time, 
and that is always a nerve-strain. 
Suddenly a brilliant inspiration came: 
why not write for a full account of the 
organization and life of the Society at 
Sandy Spring and substitute it, warm 
from its birthplace, for any colder facts 
which I should have to cook over?

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


And so I will give you the reply which 
came to my letter, with only such al¬ 
terations as are necessary to elucidate 
facts otherwise obscure because of lack 
of familiarity with the surroundings. 

“Sandy Spring, Md., 

2nd month, nth, 1908. 

My dear Cousin—I was glad to have 
thy letter, for I believe it has been 
twelve years since we have met. I send 
thee, as requested, such information as 
I possess regarding our Horticultural 
Society. The Horticultural Society of 
Sandy Spring has been in exist¬ 
ence about forty years, and it seems 
to us to be a fair model of a local 
organization. It was started with the 
double object of promoting a desira¬ 
ble social life among country people, 
and to cause them, by this contact of 
minds, to learn better ways of living 
and better methods of producing, thus 
enabling the community to discover 
and put into practical use new methods 
of doing old things, as well as the most 
modern and economical manner of 
producing, harvesting and marketing 
the products best adapted to its local¬ 
ity. 

Our Society meets once a month, 
from March first to November first, 
but in thy locality this would doubtless 
be changed, and possibly twelve de¬ 
lightful meetings might be held. About 
fifteen different households belong to 
the Society, with an average of three 
to a house in attendance; guests often 
bring the numbers up to seventy-five. 
Meetings are held in rotation at the 
homes of the members, and each one 
is expected to bring small samples of 
his wheat, best fruits and flowers, or 
specimens of plants to be discussed, 
looking to improvements in its propa¬ 


gation, or to the extermination of 
some enemy. We meet at 3 130 p. m., 
and have the usual officers—President, 
Vice-President, Secretary and Treas¬ 
urer—who are elected annually. The 
latter is a mere complimentary posi¬ 
tion, as funds are not much in evi¬ 
dence, nor are they needed; hence 
there is no membership fee. The read¬ 
ing of the minutes of last meeting is 
disposed of in the usual way, and also 
the minutes of the last meeting held 
at the farm of the present hosts, since 
this takes up the work most interest¬ 
ing and valuable to them. For exam¬ 
ple : Thee may be devoting thy time 
to orange growing; another to pine¬ 
apples; another to grapefruit; and so 
on; each wants the ideas on his spe¬ 
cialty, and it is the aim of the presiding 
officer to keep this subject uppermost. 
Then comes the report of the “Fore¬ 
thought Committee,” which is always 
bright. Then each member is asked 
a question, or may read a brief, suita¬ 
ble selection. Generally two readers 
are appointed, with the understanding 
that they will not be called on if busi¬ 
ness prevents. An early collation is 
served in any informal manner selected 
by the hostess. The collations are 
purposely kept very simple and consist 
of tea, coffee, hot rolls or biscuit, ham, 
chicken, or better still, a salad; or else 
coffee and sandwiches, with a simple 
dessert of cake or melons, in season. 
This is served either by handing round 
with paper napkins or is placed on a 
table on the lawn, each guest helping 
himself. 

I have gone into particulars to show 
how easy it is to serve seventy-five or 
a hundred guests when it is done sim¬ 
ply. It seems unnecessary to say that 
neither politics, religion, nor any sub- 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


211 




ject calculated to provoke heated dis¬ 
cussion, is permissible. 

Our Society always has a waiting 
list. There are two similar ones in the 
same country neighborhood, of forty 
members each; this speaks volumes 
for its usefulness. Your cousin, 

M. B. Thomas. 

Mr. President, this article is suffi¬ 
ciently lengthy to stop here, but I ask 
your indulgence for a single moment, 
to say that no place in our country of¬ 
fers a better field for local organiza¬ 
tions than Florida. We boast of the 
most cosmopolitan citizenship of any 
State in the Union. Local jealousies 
and petty personal differences are sap¬ 
ping the life of many communities; 
men antagonize progressive local 
measures because others advocate 


them, and I have yet to see the neigh¬ 
borhood unanimous even for good 
roads. One neighbor withholds the 
price obtained for a shipment, and 
makes a secret of the name of the 
house to which he consigns it. An¬ 
other will write your customer, whose 
name he has obtained at depot from 
your shipment, underselling you. 
These and similar local unpleasant¬ 
nesses are rendered void by local as¬ 
sociations, and the old but true state¬ 
ment is exemplified, that “There is a 
giving that does not empoverish and 
a withholding that doth not enrich.” 
If this be true, then go home and or¬ 
ganize, and let the first Society render 
us a synopsis of its year’s work, 
through its secretary, at our next an¬ 
nual meeting. 


ORGANIZATION OF LOCAL SOCIETIES. 


By H. B. Stevens. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I said I did not have any paper; I 
might have said also that I did not 
have any speech. If you want to or¬ 
ganize a Society, go ahead and do it. 
If you succeed, you succeed; and if you 
fail, you fail. We organized a Society 
in DeLand to fight against insects, and 
the people, through that organization, 
have become more interested in horti¬ 
culture. If you organize a local soci¬ 
ety, you will find it is an easy way to 
get members into this Horticultural 
Society. The Fruit Growers’ Protec¬ 
tive Association will be a great help to 
us, and our society saw at once the 
advantage of taking hold of it and the 
great need of carrying on its work. 


When they made an appeal for money, 
$300.00 was raised with us in about 
fifteen minutes. If you have an or¬ 
ganization like this, it is an easy and 
quick way to bring matters of vital in¬ 
terest to you all, before them, and it 
is an advantage to have as many or¬ 
ganizations as you have neighbor¬ 
hoods. 

I think it well to get together locally 
and form other organizations and all 
join together against the things that 
are working against our interests; the 
railroad transportation, etc., and to 
work with the Horticultural Society. 
There is everything for us in co-opera¬ 
tion, and failure for a good many if 
we insist on standing as individuals.

Agricultural Organization. 


By C. K. McQuarrie. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It gives me the greatest of pleasure to 
present to you for consideration and dis¬ 
cussion a subject that every member of 
this Society is interested in, viz., Agri¬ 
cultural Organization. 

In dealing with this subject I want to 
say at the start that the word Agricultural 
in this case means Horticulture as well as 
Agriculture. 

There is no doubt whatever of the 
benefit to be derived individually and col¬ 
lectively where there is a wide-awake, 
up-to-date organization of farmers and 
fruitgrowers in existence, and it would 
be to the advantage of the country at 
large if their numbers were largely in¬ 
creased. One can easily understand how 
uniformity of prices can be maintained 
and the proper distribution of products 
controlled by an organization, where the 
individual would be hopelessly lost. We 
have had ample proof of this in West 
Florida during the last twenty years and 
if it would not seem to be out of order, I 
would like to give a little history of a 
couple of these organizations of which I 
happen to be a member. 

Eighteen years ago there was a rush 
of new settlers around DeFuniak and 
every last one of them going in for peach, 
pear and plum growing. We found that 
collectively we could buy nursery stock 
to greater advantage in car-load lots; so 
we organized “The West Florida High¬ 
land Fruit Growers Association.” We 


had a membership of more than one hun¬ 
dred. For three or four years everything 
went along smoothly; bought nursery 
stock and fertilizer in car-load lots and 
saved considerable money in so doing. 
G. W. Mellish was our energetic and 
capable secretary, and A. G. Hollowed 
was president, and under this manage¬ 
ment things did very well. We held 
meetings once a month and in the sum¬ 
mer time, or when weather permitted 
these meetings were held at members’ 
residences in rotation. At those meetings 
was laid the foundation of the greater 
interest that West Florida takes in farm¬ 
ers’ meetings than any other portion of 
the state. And here let me digress a 
little from my subject to' say that the at¬ 
tendance at Farmers’ Institutes in West 
Florida is far beyond any other section 
of the State both in attendance and in¬ 
terest in the subject on hand. 

When our orchards began bearing, we 
tried to ship in the same way that we 
bought, but it somehow would not work. 
The varied individuality of the member¬ 
ship caused considerable friction. Poor 
packing, packing unripe fruit, and pack¬ 
ing fruit that was too ripe were some of 
the causes and we found that, generally 
speaking, the man that did the worst 
packing and was not particular as to uni¬ 
formity in size and coloring was the one 
who did the most kicking and loudest 
grumbling. 

The L. & N. (the only road in this 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


213 


section) would not give us che rates to 
which we were entitled. They had us 
by the neck, and they knew it. So when 
our Association came to the marketing- 
side of its usefulness it did not prove 
as successful as the purchasing side of 
it, and, to add to our calamities, our 
enemy, the San Jose Scale, came in 
among us to stay for good, and in a very 
few years we were as busy grubbing up 
dead trees as we had been planting, and 
the grubbing was the more laborious job 
of the two. 

For a- few years after that our Asso¬ 
ciation drifted along with a very small 
membership waiting to see how affairs 
would turn out. Brown-rot and crown- 
gall, and other enemies made themselves 
at home jimong the few remains of our 
orchards. We knew we had one of the 
best fruit sections in the country and our 
faith was strong that we could devise 
ways and means to overcome most of our 
difficulties. 

On July 4th, 1899, was formed the 
“West Florida Agricultural Society,” 
whose formation was the outcome of a 
general farmers’ picnic at Grand Ridge. 
This picnic was gotten up by Judge Por¬ 
ter so as to get West Florida farmers 
together in a social way and discuss mat¬ 
ters relating to their calling. 

The Society was launched at that meet¬ 
ing, but at a later one, at DeFuniak, the 
officers were appointed and a constitution 
and by-laws adopted. The Society has 
been very successful along purely agri¬ 
cultural lines. The president at that 
time, Judge Porter, called on the pres¬ 
ident of the L. & N. R. R. (Mr. Smith) 
and was successful in getting a one-cent 
rate for members to attend meetings. 
The territory covered by the Society ex¬ 
tends from River Junction to Pensacola, 


160 miles. In its earlier history meet¬ 
ings were held once a month in the sum¬ 
mer and every two weeks in the winter. 
At these meetings all subjects relative 
to farming interests were discussed. In 
fact, they were equal to Farmers’ Insti¬ 
tutes ; but as we had no funds at our dis¬ 
posal to pay expenses' of state lecturers, 
were confined to members for speakers. 
At each meeting the place for holding 
the next one was decided. The favorite 
places were Grand Ridge, Chipley and 
DeFuniak. 

Members attending from a distance 
had to deposit a certificate of membership 
with the ticket agent to get the one-cent 
rate for distance traveled. The condition 
to be observed in getting this reduced 
rate was to notify the division ticket 
agent a week ahead of any meeting to 
allow him time to notify the local agent. 
The membership of this Society at one 
time numbered nearly three hundred of 
the most progressive farmers of West 
Florida. 

In 1901 it was decided to try to ship 
canteloupes and other early farm pro¬ 
ducts in car lots, the railroad agreeing 
to give us certain facilities by placing 
pick-up cars at our disposal. This worked 
fairly well, but we found a great many 
obstacles in the way; the different soils 
and different modes of planting causing 
uncertainty in time of ripening; also the 
different fertilizers used and the different 
modes of culture. Every small thing 
had in the aggregate quite a decided in¬ 
fluence on the general success of any one 
crop, and the studying of results along 
these lines was a very valuable education 
to those interested, and as the writer hap¬ 
pened to be the secretary, the informa¬ 
tion he got and the means of observation 
at his command, were very valuable to 


214

him for further work in this connection. 

The death of C. P. Atmore, the gen¬ 
eral ticket agent of the L. & N., gave the 
Society a severe setback; for Mr. At- 
more’s successor cancelled the arrange¬ 
ment for the one-cent fare, thus giving 
us a blow from which we have not yet 
recovered, for the regular passenger rate 
on this division of the L. & N. is four 
cents a mile, and few farmers are going 
to leave home, lose time, and pay this 
rate to attend meetings, let the subjects 
be ever so important. 

We are still holding together nom¬ 
inally, waiting for • better times to come 
to us in the shape of the return of the 
old rate. We may not get it, and we 
may, but the good the Society has al¬ 
ready done in awakening interest among 
the farmers of our section and in educat¬ 
ing them in the meeting-habit is of great 
value to all concerned, for it is a very 
difficult matter to get agriculturists to at¬ 
tend meetings. They think they have no 
time to devote to meetings and yet these 
are schools of education to them. The 
very fact of meeting each other and get¬ 
ting interested in each other’s doings 
awakens a livelier interest in all matters 
pertaining to their good. 

We all know that the real prosperity 
of the country depends on its agriculture. 
It is the real creator of wealth, and if 
those engaged in it would only wake up 
and get more mutual confidence in each 
other the good they could do is incal¬ 
culable. To get this ideal state of mat¬ 
ters, we have to begin early. We have 
to start in the district school house. Edu¬ 
cation is at the bottom of it. An ignorant 
man or woman is always a suspicious 
one; thinks someone is going to get 
ahead, of him: for this lack of education 
keeps his mind cramped and his outlook 


narrow. In all agricultural meetings, the 
man who knows least thinks that he know 
most, and this holds true everywhere; 
and the past history of agricultural so¬ 
cieties all over the country will bear out 
what I have said. 

The outlook for this usefulness of agri¬ 
cultural organization is very bright. 
Their past history is full of achievements, 
but their future history will be yet fuller. 
The solving of the present problem of the 
age, good roads, is in the agriculturists’ 
hands, and they are leading the way in a 
wonderful manner. About fifteen years 
ago the farmers of New Jersey pro¬ 
claimed the fact that the state at large 
was as much interested in good roads as 
the farmer; that every individual resident 
of the state, through the market, was 
affected for weal or woe by road condi¬ 
tions, and demanded that the state treas¬ 
ury pay at least half the cost of good- 
road building. This really was the birth 
of the state aid-for good roads in Amer¬ 
ica, and the New Jersey agriculturist was 
at the bottom of it. This work was not 
done by leading individuals among agri¬ 
culturists, but by the combined efforts of 
the agricultural ^organizations of the 
States. Their good work was so evident 
that others caught on to the New Jersey 
idea and the good work spread rapidly, 
until today state aid for good roads ob¬ 
tains in fourteen states. All save two 
east of the Alleghenies have it. Michi¬ 
gan has a sensible law whereby the state 
pays a bounty on every mile of good 
road, ranging from two hundred and fifty 
dollars to one thousand dollars per mile 
according to the class of improvements, 
irrespective of the cost of it. 

The State of Pennsylvania is spending 
over a million dollars yearly for its roads, 
and New York has a constitutional 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


215 


amendment providing for a bond issue 
of fifty million dollars available at the 
rate of five million a year, all for good 
roads. 

The New York farmer, strange to re¬ 
late, did not share his New Jersey 
brother’s enthusiasm for good roads at 
first, but now he has fallen into line and 
goes one better in that the state does more 
for this purpose than any of the others. 

Let us look at our own state and see 
the paltry efforts the farmers are making 
for good roads and compare it to those 
mentioned, and yet we could make good 
roads at less cost than any of those. The 
Middle West is setting the pace in this 
direction. The Indiana agricultural or¬ 
ganizations have been the means of get¬ 
ting that state to lead all others, as thirty- 
five per cent, of the entire roads of the 
state are hard roads. Ohio comes next 
with thirty-three per cent.., Wisconsin 
seventeen, Kentucky sixteen, Michigan 
ten, Illinois eight, Missouri two, Iowa 
one and seven-tenths, and Mississippi 
0.38. Where is Florida? Too low to be 
figured out. I hope the day is not far 
distant when we can also make a show¬ 
ing in this direction. 

The Highway Commission of Illinois 
has been collecting some very valuable 
data on the benefits of good roads versus 
mud roads. Travel is uniform all the 
year round on good roads, while mud 
roads show a falling off of at least three- 
fourths during February, March and 
April, showing fully that the economic 
benefits of good roads are not fully un¬ 
derstood by the ordinary individual. 

The need of the hour is the road- 
builder and our agricultural organization 
more than any other must be in the lead 
to get him here as soon as possible. 

“The schoolmaster and good roads are 

o 


the most important agencies to advance 
civilization,” declared a great statesman 
in the U. S. Senate years ago. The 
schoolmaster is in evidence and doing 
good work; but where are our good 
roads? Now, let us, as an organization 
of horticulturists representing the best in 
the state in our particular line, lend our 
aid to hasten this good movement for the 
common highways of our country are the 
veins of commerce and civilization, and 
the greatest need of our day is good 
roads. This question outweighs the 
Panama Canal or the irrigation of the 
arid West. The world’s food supply 
passes on wagons over our country roads 
and that tells the story in a sentence. 
Any interruption of traffic upon our 
roads affects market conditions. The fact 
of the matter is that prices of farm pro¬ 
ducts have depended more on road con¬ 
ditions than anything else. In the great 
grain-producing section, crops must all 
be hurried to market in about two 
months’ time for later than that the roads 
will be impassable, thus crowding into a 
few weeks what should have six and 
eight months to do it in. The conse¬ 
quences are stringency in the money mar¬ 
ket, deoression of prices, and a good time 
for those parasites on the so-called 
Boards of Trade who feed on what they 
don’t, produce and gamble with other 
people’s property. 

I could give this subject all the time 
at the disposal of the Society during the 
whole meeting and then I would be touch¬ 
ing only the fringe of it. 

And now let me finish by saying that 
the good that can be done by a live agri¬ 
cultural organization is beyond calcula¬ 
tion, if conducted along proper lines. The 
subject of immigration is one that could 
be profitably handled by such, for the en- 


216 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


couragement of the right class of settlers 
is one that calls loudly at our doors 'for 
solution. 

The agitation for uniform rates from 
our railroad company is another live is¬ 
sue that could be taken up and properly 
settled, and a score more of abuses that 
exist to keep the agricultural industry in 
a backward condition. And not the least 
of these is the subject of compulsory edu¬ 
cation, for until we compel careless 
parents to keep their children at school 
we cannot expect a first-class citizenship 
from the rising generation. 

In recommending the consideration of 
these very important questions that con¬ 
front us as citizens and agriculturists, we 


must by all means steer clear of giving 
any of them a political aspect, for the 
history of the past goes to show that 
politics has been the rock on which the 
most of agricultural organizations have 
been wrecked in the past. So by all means 
let us keep away from giving any ques¬ 
tion under consideration a political color¬ 
ing. 

And now, ladies and gentlemen, I 
leave the subject with you for your criti¬ 
cism and discussion. My remarks have 
been made with a view of bringing out 
the best point in the subject under con¬ 
sideration by the after-discussion which 
I hope it will bring on in a lively manner. 


Pasadena Farmers’ Club. 


By H. Roberts. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The Pasadena Farmers’ Club con¬ 
tinues in a prosperous condition, with 
meetings well attended and interest in 
the discussions increasing. 

This is primarily a social club, de¬ 
signed to promote friendly intercourse 
among all the people in our rural com¬ 
munities, both natives or old residents 
and those who have come in later from 
other states. We realize the fact that, 
especially in sparsely settled districts, 
farmers and fruit growers are apt to 
live too much to themselves. They 
fail to take advantage of the opportun¬ 
ities afforded them to enjoy and de¬ 
velop the social side of life, thus un¬ 
willingly imposing upon themselves 
and families privations that could well 
be avoided, and failing to obtain the 
full benefits to be derived from the 
freedom and healthfulness of a life 
among the trees. 

In this effort to amend social con¬ 
ditions we have succeeded even beyond 
our expectations. Our people are 
united and in hearty sympathy with 
each other. New-comers are intro¬ 
duced at once into the best society and 
old neighbors who had not visited each 
other for years are brought pleasantly 
together and old friendships renewed. 

Our discussions are on some matter 
of general interest, on some line of our 


work as home-builders. For that is, 
after all, our principal aim, to make of 
our little corner of Florida a land of 
happy homes, such as can only be 
found among a prosperous and united 
people. 

We should be more than pleased if 
this club idea would spread to other 
districts and that a system of inter¬ 
correspondence could be established 
between the clubs so that the people 
of one county or section might feel a 
closer interest in the people of other 
sections; that all might work together 
for the better settlement and upbuild¬ 
ing of our beautiful state. 

A very interesting feature of our 
work during the past year was a 
Farmers' Institute held under the aus¬ 
pices of the Club, at which lectures 
were delivered by Prof. Rolfs and 
Prof. Blair, of the Florida Experiment 
Station, the exercises being inter¬ 
spersed with talks and discussions by 
local workers, and not neglecting the 
generous picnic lunch supplied by the 
ladies who are, after all, the mainstay 
and support of the Club. 

With many thanks to your Society 
for the invitation to “report progress,”’ 
we remain, yours for a still better and 
more prosperous Florida, 

The Pasadena Farmers' Club. 
Per H. Roberts, President.

REPORTS OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The Executive Committee met at 
the Secretary’s office in Jacksonville 
on July 1st, and instructed the Secre¬ 
tary to print the report of the meeting 
held at St. Petersburg last May. This 
volume was dedicated to the memory 
of our deceased president, C. L. Mc¬ 
Carty. Sundry bills were approved 
and ordered paid. 

On March 19th, your Committee 
met in Jacksonville and named the 
date of May 12, 13, 14 and 15 as the 


time for holding the twenty-first an¬ 
nual session at Gainesville, and in¬ 
structed the Secretary to secure rail¬ 
road rates and arrange with the local 
committee at Gainesville for place of 
meeting and hotel rates. 

The Executive Committee met at 
the Brown House Thursday morning 
May 14th; bills as presented by the 
Secretary were examined and ordered 
paid. The accounts of the Secretary 
and treasurer were examined and 
found correct. The treasurer’s report 
showed a deficit previous to this meet- 



















220 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ing of $136.85, which amount the 
treasurer has advanced. 

The amount paid in by the Secretary 
at this meeting amounts to $311.11, 
which will give only $174.26 towards 
printing this year’s proceedings and 
other necessary expenses. It is evi¬ 
dent that the Society will be over 


$200.00 short of meeting expenses. 

This time seems opportune for an 
endeavor to secure state aid for the 
Society. 

Adjourned.

Final Resolutions. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Whereas, The members of the Flor¬ 
ida State Horticultural Society in its 
twenty-first annual session have been 
so well entertained and so well cared 
for by the citizens of Gainesville, and 
in view of the courtesies extended to 
us by the State University and the 
officers of the Experiment Station, 
therefore be it 

Resolved, That we wish to thank 
the citizens of Gainesville for our royal 
entertainment (they have made good), 
the officers of the University for a very 
profitable and entertaining afternoon 
and evening and the best of suppers, 
and for showing us that we have an 
interest in so great an institution. We 
feel gratified to know its size and 
scope, and pledge it support and good 
will. 

Resolved further, That we wish 
especially to acknowledge the very 
efficient work and interest in our en¬ 
tertainment of Dr. C. L. Crow and 
Messrs. Wilson and Ellis. Their work 
has been thoroughly and carefully 
done, and we appreciate and thank 
them. We wish further to thank Mr. 
Jno. Billing, Press Secretary, for the 
very complete reports of our proceed¬ 
ings, and congratulate the people of 
Gainesville on possession of so bright 


a Sun. This paper has given us the 
use of several columns daily. 

Resolved further, That we feel 
under especially heavy obligations to 
President Rolfs for the wonderfully 
interesting and instructive program he 
has been able to prepare for us, and 
extend to him our hearty thanks. 

Resolved further, That we thank 
the gentlemen in Uncle Sam's most 
efficient ranks of workers, who are en¬ 
gaged in solving for us the difficult 
problems that confront us, and wish 
them speedy success. We also wish 
to thank the Transportation Com¬ 
panies for the courtesy of giving us 
good service and in reducing the rail¬ 
road fare, thus enabling more of us to 
come to the meetings, and hope that 
they may some day see the wisdom of 
inaugurating a lower rate in the move¬ 
ment of our produce to the markets of 
the country. We hope that they may 
see that our interests and theirs are 
identical and that they prosper as we 
prosper. 

It is also desired to extend thanks 
to the two ladies who added so much 
to our pleasure and entertainment— 
Mrs. Prange and Miss Hubbard.

EULOGY OF REV. LYMAN PHELPS. 


E. S. Hubbard. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

On April 26th our friend and fellow 
worker, Rev. Lyman Phelps, embarked 
on his last journey to “the undiscovered 
country, that bourn from which no 
traveler returns,” and I would render a 
tribute to his memory. The lofty brow, 
the piercing eyes, the Dantean nose, the 
grim yet tender mouth, the prognathous 
jaw, the countenance that was index to 
his character will be seen among us never 
again. The distinguished presence that 
graced our gatherings is a memory of 
the past. The subtle intellect that coun¬ 
seled and guided in our deliberations is 
a shade with the host of departed spirits, 
and the place that knew him once will 
know him no more. 

Thirty-five years ago, broken in health 
from overwork in his chosen profession, 
having buried the wife of his youth, with 
even life despaired of, he came to Florida. 
In our balmy climate he gradually gath¬ 
ered strength and courage and began mis¬ 
sionary work among the scattered settle¬ 
ments. The long drives through the wild 
forest country gave him an intimate ac¬ 
quaintance with Orange county and stim¬ 
ulated anew his interest in botany, giving 
him a knowledge of the species and habits 


of the Flora of Florida equalled by few. 
From this he became interested in the 
horticultural and business advancement 
of his surroundings. For a time he was 
postmaster at Sanford, connected with 
the bank and an encourager of all legi¬ 
timate enterprises; but what appealed to 
him most was the growing and improve¬ 
ment of citrus fruits. 

For a time superintendent of General 
Sanford’s Bellair orange grove he made 
an intimate study of the great number 
of new varieties imported by General 
Sanford and was the chief factor in se¬ 
lecting the most desirable and introduc¬ 
ing them to the public. At that time 
nearly all the oranges in Florida were 
grown on sweet seedling trees from seeds 
of the old Spanish strain of stocks and the 
groves planted by Zephaniah Kingsley. 
Mr. Parsons, the nurseryman of Flush¬ 
ing, Long Island, had made quite a list 
of importations from Rivers of England, 
including the Excelsior, also known as 
Hart’s and Valencia Late and imported 
by General Sanford as Brown, but the 
-varieties of Maltas, Jaffas, etc., were 
mainly brought to public notice by Mr. 
Phelps. 

He was the father of chemical fertiliz¬ 
ing for citrus fruits in Florida. When

he began his experiments the old groves 
were mainly fertilized by cowpenning 
with cattle; the muck mania was in full 
blast and the small amounts of commer¬ 
cial fertilizers used were usually either 
organic nitrogen material or one-sided, 
ill-balanced chlorine base mixtures that 
produced when used continuously unfa¬ 
vorable results. The discovery of a well- 
balanced chemical fertilizer produced 
from sulphates that can be used safely 
year after year was a triumph of which 
any horticulturist might be proud. 

The influence of this discovery has been 
far-reaching not only with citrus, but with 
deciduous fruits and the principle in¬ 
volved is now generally recognized as the 
correct method for high-grade results. He 
also discovered that an excess of sulphate 
of ammonia or a spray of bi-sulphate 
soda prematurely sweetens oranges. 

Mr. Phelps was also a prime mover in 
the citrus exhibits and competitions 
started at Orlando and continued at San¬ 
ford and Ocala. He used his full in¬ 
fluence for the judging of citrus fruits by 
scales of points and furthered the im¬ 
provement of those scales to this present 
form. Nothing educated public opinion 
and knowledge as to the standards of ex¬ 
cellence of oranges and the merits of 
different varieties as did these competi¬ 
tions, and there was no greater object 
lesson on scientific culture and fertilizing 
than the thin-skinned, high-flavored fruit 
shown at these exhibitions. I think Mr. 
Phelps was most proud, however, of his 
discovery of the cause of bud-sports, va¬ 
riations or so-called mutations of citrus 
fruits. The origin of new varieties, 
types or species in plants is a complex 
subject. The production of new varieties 
or types by cross-pollination or hybrid¬ 
ization and the culling and selection from 


thousands of seedlings is exemplified by 
the work of Burbank and others. 

To illustrate the small and inconclusive 
extent of experimental research into the 
origin of so-called accidental sports I will 
quote from Prof. H. J. Webber, Bulletin 
251, February 1908, Cornell University 
Agricultural Experiment Station of the 
College of Agriculture, Plant Breeding: 
“A second type of variation is that known 
to gardeners and horticulturists as sports 
and to scientists as mutations. These are 
large pattern, striking variations which 
do not occur very commonly, but which 
when found are likely to prove useful in 
the production of new types of value. The 
recent scientific studies of De Vries, a 
famous botanist of Holland, have empha¬ 
sized the great importance of such varia¬ 
tions in the production of cultivated vari¬ 
eties and the evolutions of species. As is 
well known to gardeners, these sports or 
mutations appear suddenly without warn¬ 
ing or reason so 1 far as we know. We 
cannot produce them and must simply 
wait until they appear and then be pre¬ 
pared to recognize and propagate them. 
Mutations usually reproduce their char¬ 
acters without much reversion to the 
parental type except such as is caused by 
cross-pollination. Mutations of self-fer¬ 
tilized plants thus usually come true to 
type, while in cross-fertilized plants the 
mutations must usually be cultivated in 
an isolated place and carefully selected 
to weed out the effect of such crossing 
as has occurred. Many seedsmen exam¬ 
ine their trial grounds regularly for the 
sports or mutations and many of our best 
varieties have resulted from the selection 
of such sports. Livingston, of Ohio, 
who during his life was famous for the 
number of new varieties of tomatoes 
which he produced, made a practice to 


224 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


regularly search the fields of tomatoes 
which he grew for seed purposes, for 
such sports, and almost all of his num¬ 
erous varieties were produced by the dis¬ 
covery of such striking variations.” 

“Another kind of variation, probably 
of little value to the breeder of annual 
plants and about which we as yet know 
very little, is the so-called bud varia¬ 
tions, sports or bud mutations. Chrysan¬ 
themum and rose growers know that it 
is not a very uncommon thing for a plant 
to produce a branch which will be entirely 
different from the remaining portions of 
the plant. Valuable new varieties of 
roses, chrysanthemums, carnations and 
some other flowers and fruits have been 
secured by the selection and propagation 
of such bud variations. They seem in 
a large measure to be comparable to 
mutations except that they originate in 
a bud change instead of a change occur¬ 
ring in the sexual reproduction. It is 
probable that they will ultimately be 
found to be due to similar causes, being 
produced in the same way..” 

Prof. Webber also speaks of the work 
of an experimenter stimulating plants to 
produce mutations by injecting chemical 
salts at certain periods. Mr. Phelps, 
however, believed that no effect in nature 
is produced without some active, adequate 
cause and that the bud changes were ef¬ 
fected by the organs of reproduction of 
the flowers. 

The citrus are the most highly organ¬ 
ized plants I know of. The discovery 
that cross-pollination changes citrus 
fruits on the parent tree to hybrid fruits 
but not with hybrid seeds, goes back one 
hundred vears to Gallesio. 

Mr. Phelps discovered that not only 
was the fruit affected in these rare in¬ 
stances by cross-pollination, but that the 


wood immediately below the fruit partook 
of the cross also and by taking buds be¬ 
low the fruit when small he secured trees 
that bore the hybrid fruit and remained 
true to type. Pie also claimed that by 
forcing the trees with special combina¬ 
tions of chemical fertilizers they were 
more susceptible and that he proved these 
results by artificial cross-pollination. 
These were lost in 1895. 

It is unfortunate no public experi¬ 
menter has had the courage and patience 
to work on this line like Burbank on hy¬ 
brids, as the results when obtained are 
more immediate and certain. The estab¬ 
lishing of a working plan, however, 
would require considerable experiment 
compared with growing hybrid seedling 
plants, as a majority of hybrids show 
crossing from the start, while with cross- 
pollinated sports the negative results 
might possibly be as great as the rejec¬ 
tions from seedlings. The occurrence of 
these bud sports from bud wood used just 
after the spring bloom has been often ob¬ 
served by citrus nurserymen and fruit 
growers. 

So far as I know they have never been 
noted from bud wood taken before bloom¬ 
ing. I have secured two and probably 
three varieties of navels in this manner. 

The influence of the bud on the stock, 
is also greater than imagined, as 
was shown in numerous cases after the 
1895 freeze where lemon and sweet or¬ 
ange sprouts sprang from the roots of 
sour stocks on which lemons and oranges 
had been previously budded but killed 
out. 

Mr. Phelps was an original member 
of the Nurserymen’s Association that was 
reorganized into the old Florida Horticul- 
tural Society. He was a charter member 
of the present State Horticultural Society 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


225 


and chairman of its executive committee 
till failing health rendered him unable to 
fulfill its duties, and he did as much as 
any one man to steer the Society through 
the perils of its infancy and establish those 
conservative policies which have made it 
respected and a power in this state and 
country. 

Mr. Phelps was a man of imagination 
and possessed the subtle outreaching in¬ 
stincts that mark the prophet and the 
seer. His enthusiasms may sometimes 
have carried him to temporary erroneous 


conclusions, but that happens to us all and 
it is the so-called cranks and visionaries 
that reach out into the unknown and dis¬ 
cover and harness the unseen forces. Let 
his example be to us an inspiration, a 
stimulus to high resolve and stern en¬ 
deavor, for a pioneer in the van of mod¬ 
ern progress, a paladin in the crusade 
against ignorance, superstition and error, 
a lofty and a knightly soul has passed 
from the realm of human endeavor into 
the great beyond. 


Rev. Lyman Phelps, who was a native 
of New York State, was born December 
I 2 > 1833. 

He early served an apprenticeship to a 
cabinetmaker, where he learned the 
art of working, polishing and finish¬ 
ing woods which was to be in later life a 
source of pleasure to himself and friends. 

He attended the Moravian Institute as 
a student in winter, teaching in various 
places during the summer months. 

Later he attended the Theological Sem¬ 
inary at Nashotah, Wisconsin. 

He was ordained to the deaconhood 
of the Protestant Episcopal church at 
Nashotah Seminary, St. Sylvanns Parish, 
Wisconsin, June 15, 1862, and to the 
priesthood at Zion church, Oconomonoc, 
Wisconsin, June 28, 1863. 

Under Bishop Jackson Kemper he did 
missionary work part of the time among 
the Indians; later he became rector of the 
parish at Mineral Point, Wisconsin and 
principal of the church school at that 
place. 

While here he was married to Miss 


Apia Hait, who was a teacher in the 
school. 

During the summer of his last year at 
Mineral Point, he went for his vacation 
to a resort near Magdaline Island where 
he was to hold services. He was accom - 
panied by his wife. 

Owing to bad sanitary conditions 
while here both Rev. and Mrs. Phelps 
contracted typhoid fever, which resulted 
in the death of Mrs, Phelps and complete 
loss of health to Mr. Phelps. 

He was obliged to give up his charge 
at Mlineral Point. He went east for 
medical advice and treatment, stopping 
for some time at the sanitarium of Dr. 
Foster at Clifton Springs, N. Y. 

In the winter of 1875, accompanied by 
a devoted sister, he came to Florida. 

Here much of his time was spent with 
gun over his shoulder, in taking long 
tramps through the 'woods studying the 
flowers, trees and birds of the southland. 

His health improvecj and lie became 
deeply interested in the culture of the 
orange and other tropical and semi-trop¬ 
ical fruits. 



226 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


On August 15, 1877, he was married 
to Mrs. Mary Lyman Wells, the widow 
of the late Philip Wells of Armenia, N. 
Y., and daughter of Moses Lyman, of 
Goshen, Conn., who had a winter home 
on Onoro lake near Ft. Reed, Fla. 

Rev. and Mrs. Phelps chose for the 
site of their future home a lovely spot 
lving between Silver and Onoro lakes. 

At this time Mr. Phelps applied the 
knowledge acquired in early life to dec¬ 
orating his house -with beautiful speci¬ 
mens of Florida mahogany and curly 
pine; beautifully finished and polished 
'doors, panels, mantels, tables and suites 
of furniture remain as monuments of his 
knowledge, skill and handiwork. Mr. 
Phelps’ health continuing to improve, he 
did considerable missionary work through 
the county. He was rector of the church 
of the Holy Cross at Sanford for some 
time. 

He continued the study of the orange 
and all citrus fruits, was manager of the 
famous Belair Grove, owned by General 
Sanford, when in its prime. 

It was while manager of this grove, 
that under his direction were raised some 
of the first and finest pineapples ever 
grown in the State. 

He was appointed postmaster at San¬ 
ford February 26, 1883, serving the pub¬ 
lic faithfully during the term of his ap¬ 
pointment. 

He was one of the originators of the 
Lyman Bank, and director of the First 
National Bank until failing health caused 
him to resign. 

His grove at Denmere, his home, be¬ 
came one of the finest in the State. 

The freeze of 1895 was a severe blow 
to Mr. Phelps. 

The death of his beloved wife in Jan¬ 


uary, 1897, was shortly followed by a 
severe attack of typhoid fever. Much of 
his time for the next two years was spent 
in rebudding his grove. 

During the winter seasons he went to 
Lake Maitland each Sunday to assist his 
honored and beloved friend, Bishop Ben¬ 
jamin Whipple, in the services at the 
church of the Good Shepherd. This he 
continued to do until the death of Bishop 
Whipple, which was another severe blow 
to Mr. Phelps. 

On January 17, 1900, he was married 
to Miss Mary Louise Blanie, of Sanford, 
Fla., whom he had known for many 
years. 

At this time Mr. Phelps became very 
much interested in the growth of lettuce 
and celery, which was attracting a great 
deal of attention in the State. During 
the two years in which he was engaged 
in this work he raised successively very 
fine crops of each vegetable on his lots in 
Sanford. 

During the winter of 1905 and 1906, 
M,r. Phelps’ failing health was a source 
of great anxiety to his wife and friends. 
He could take only short walks about his 

j 

home. 

After January, 1906, he was never 
able to leave the house. His days were 
spent in his roller chair. Much of the 
time on the east porch overlooking the 
beautiful lake Onoro, or on the south 
porch looking toward Silver lake. His 
favorite spot in the evening being at the 
west hall door to watch the sun sink to 
rest behind the orange trees. 

There was little noticeable change in 
his health until the winter of 1907-8 
when he grew gradually weaker, but suf¬ 
fered very little pain. 

On Easter Sunday loving hands placed 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


227 


\ 


him in his chair for the last time. By his 
own wish he remained up all day, and 
watched the sun set at evening. 

Easter Monday he was too weak to 
get up. Each day he grew weaker, the 
last three passed in a semi-conscious 
state, recognizing no one but his sorrow¬ 
ing wife. 

His spirit quietly passed away on Sun¬ 


day morning, April 26, at about ten 
o’clock. 

The funeral services were held at Den- 
mere, Archdeacon Brown officiating. 

The remains were laid in the family 
burying ground near Silver lake, where 
in their season, the orange trees he loved, 
may scatter their blossoms over his quiet 
grave. 


WILLIAM H. EARLE. 


William H. Earle for many years was 
a prominent and leading citizen of Tan¬ 
gerine. He was born at Hubbardston, 
MJass., on the 22nd day of May, 1831. 
His father -was a farmer, and of good 
New England stock. 

The life history, and a detailed account 
of the work done by the subject of this 
sketch, would, as those best acquainted 
with him well know, fill a volume. Being 
possessed of a mind, more than ordinarily 
bright and active, and having a natural 
inclination to literature, he at an early 
age became, and through all of his active 
business career remained a valued and 
constant correspondent of many of the 
leading papers not only of his native 
State, but also of the State of his adop¬ 
tion. Nor was it by pen alone that he 
acquired the respect and' esteem of the 
citizens of his native State; for we find 
him taking an active and leading part in 
the granger movement; and as one of the 
strongest and most aggressive advocates 
of the cause of temperance, and it was 
upon the platform 'and the rostrum that 
he won his brightest laurels ; eventually 
becoming the gubernatorial candidate on 
the ticket of the temperance party of his 


native State. Again we find him actively 
engaged in mercantile pursuits, he 
having founded and for many years per¬ 
sonally conducted the agricultural imple¬ 
ments, feed and seed business, still car¬ 
ried on by Ross Biros, in the city of 
Worcester, Mass., and which owing in 
no small measure to his care and fore¬ 
thought has continued to flourish until at 
the present time it is one of the largest 
concerns of the kind to be found any¬ 
where within his native State. Mr. Earle 
continued in the active management of 
this enterprise until about 1885, when on 
account of failing health, he was com¬ 
pelled ito (dispose of the business, and 
turned his thoughts toward a more con¬ 
genial climate than that afforded by the 
old Bay State. His former schoolmate 
and life long friend, Mir. Dudley Adams, 
having acquired extensive holdings of 
real estate near Lake Beauclair, in Or¬ 
ange county, Florida, it was perfectly 
natural that his thoughts should turn 
that way, and we soon find him in com¬ 
pany with two near and dear friends, Mr. 
George H. Rice, of Worcester, Mass., 
and Mr. S. C. Davis of New York, lo¬ 
cated near the small village of Tanger- 


15 








228 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ine; this was about 1883, and the three 
friends at once commenced the construc¬ 
tion of a cottage, for their winter home 
in the Sunny South. The genial and 
equable climate of Florida soon brought 
about a decided improvement in the 
health of Mr. Earle; and he thereupon 
determined to make Tangerine his future 
home. His friend, Mr. Rice, and' him¬ 
self immediately embarked in die orange 
culture, then in its infancy in their local¬ 
ity. 

They established a large nursery, and 
set out many of the orange groves in 
and about the village of Tangerine, the 
subject of this sketch at once entering 
heart and soul in the enterprise. 

Their groves grew, flourished and com¬ 
menced to bear fine crops of golden fruit; 
then came that never to be forgotten 
freeze of 1895. Almost every tree was 
destroyed; and absolute ruin stared every 
owner of a grove in the face. The result 
was that most of the capitalists from the 
north withdrew from the field', and aban¬ 
doning everything returned to their 
northern homes in disgust. 

Not so with Mr. Earle, and it is just 
here that his indomitable will, energy and 
perseverance most shows itself. He did 
not give up, but patiently, persistently 
and industriously went to work to repair 
so far as lay in his power the damage 
done to his groves, and by his acts and 
advice inspired' a few of his neighbors to 
follow his example. The result is that 


we have the Tangerine of today, sur¬ 
rounded by its tens of thousands of beau¬ 
tiful orange and grapefruit trees; while 
many another settlement has for the lack 
of a man of Mr. Earle’s sterling worth 
and character, been absolutely deserted, 
and literally wiped from the map of 
Florida. 

During all of these years Mr. Earle 
was also 'an active member of the Horti¬ 
cultural Society of Florida, and through 
his association with that society and its 
officers, he was enabled to secure many 
choice varieties of fruits, plants and 1 flow¬ 
ering shrubs from other countries, many 
of which remain as a monument to his 
good taste and practical forethought. 
There is still another enterprise in which 
Mr. Earle was interested. He became 
the owner of the only hotel in Tangerine, 
about 1885, naming it The Wachuset 
House and personally conducted the 
house for many years. 

Here he hospitably entertained many 
of his friends from the north, during 
their winter sojourn in this land of sun¬ 
shine, of fruit and of flowers. Mr. Earle 
was twice married, his first wife was 
Sarah R. Greenwood. Two children 
were born to them; one a son, William, 
who died at the age of 17 years; the 
daughter now Mrs. W. S. Morehouse, 
and her daughter, Reba Earle Morehouse, 
reside at Seneca Falls, in the State of 
New York. Mr. Earle’s second wife, 
Addie Greenwood Earle, survives him.

MR. F. LIPP. 


Mr. F. Lipp, who died at his home in 
Cocoa May 8, was born in Bavaria, Ger¬ 
many, 1844; he came to the United 
States, 1882, New York, and in 1886 
moved to City Point, Fla., remaining for 
one year. After that he came to Cocoa 
and has lived here since. He was mar¬ 
ried the second time 33 years ago to the 
present wife, who survives him. He was 
buried in the Cocoa cemetery Saturday 
evening, with only the formal burial cere¬ 
mony, read by his old time friend Mr. R. 


N. Andrews, and his remains now rest 
by the side of his little son who died 21 
years ago. A large number of friends 
were present. Mr. Lipp has been unwell 
for almost a year, and bore his affliction 
with great patience. He was kind—a good 
neighbor, and his closest neighbors for 
21 years bear testimony to his genuine 
worth as a citizen. The old song “kind 
hearted and true’’ sums up the life of 
Mr. Lipp, and many admirers will miss 
him. 


Question Box. 


No. i—To what extent do orange and 
grapefruit growers practice cutting out 
the dead wood accumulating on the in¬ 
side of trees? We would like to hear 
from some of our best growers on their 
practice along this line. 

Mr. Hart—I think it is desirable to 
cut it out and I do so when I can pos¬ 
sibly find time for the work. The dead 
wood there does no harm to the tree so 
far as I know, unless it is very large, 
but it is very inconvenient to the pickers 
and it injures and destroys considerable 
fruit. I think it advisable to prune out 
all dead wood while the fruit is small. 


No. 2—Do we cultivate the soil, dur¬ 
ing a dry time, to bring the moisture up, 
or to keep it down? 

Mr. Hoard—I do not see how cultiva¬ 
tion could have any effect towards bring¬ 
ing the moisture up, but think it would 
have the tendency to check it and keep 
it down. 

Mr. Von Engelke*.—I presume the 
practice of cultivating during a dry spell 
is for the same purpose as that accom¬ 
plished in the Western States, where 
they raise crops with practically no rain¬ 
fall whatever. They keep the soil 
stirred 1 ; in other words, keep the mois¬ 
ture down where it will do the most 
good. 

Mr. Hart—The earth cools off at 
night and sucks in the aiil that is laden 
with moisture, and in the morning as it 
warms up, that air expands and much of 


it goes out, leaving the moisture behind. 
Cultivation just helps to retain that mois¬ 
ture that is brought in the night before. 
It also prevents the escape of moisture 
that is brought up by capillary action. 


No. 3.—Will you kindly tell me of 
Bermuda Onions? Can they be success¬ 
fully and profitably grown in the latitude 
of Gainesville, Fla. ? 

Mr. (-)—At McIntosh the farm¬ 

ers have been growing onions for ship¬ 
ment on a small scale and have been 
very successful. They are pretty fair 
onions, too. 

Mr. Taylor—You cannot grow them 
on very dry land. They must be planted 
on moist land, but not too moist. It is 
one of the surest crops we can grow. 
They stand both cold and reasonably dry 
weather pretty well, and the man who 
puts them on the right kind of land is 
sure to make something of a crop. 

Mr. Painter—A crop of Bermuda on¬ 
ions grown so as to reach the early mar¬ 
ket is sure to be profitable. Late onions 
will seldom sell for over $1.00 per bushel. 
They require a rich and moist soil, or 
the soil made rich with fertilizer. I 
grew seven successive crops and all were 
profitable except one, when the * seed 
turned out to be White Californias in¬ 
stead of White Bermudas. The former 
made a large crop, but would not carry 
to market. By raising onions on irri¬ 
gated land they can be pushed during 
growing season and when they are large

enough, withhold the water and let them 
ripen and dry up. Two weeks can be 
gained in this way and two weeks often 
means a difference of $1.00 to $1.50 per 
crate. The market does not want a 
large onion. The best size is three inches 

o 

in diameter. 


No. 4—Is It desirable to prune out 
watersprouts from orange trees? 

Mr. Hart—If the sprout is where I 
can let it grow, I always save it. Their 
tops can be swung usually to where 
there is room for them, I do not Waste 
any growth that I can put to use, and 
you can put almost any watersprout to 
use. It is very rare indeed that I take 
one out. I consider that more groves 
were killed after the freeze of 1894 and' 
1895 by cutting off the sprouts, than in 
any other way. It takes away the leaf 
surface the tree should have, and I think 
every inch of leaf surface adds to the 
strength and bearing capacity. 

Mr. (-)—Do they not take a great 

deal of strength from the tree? 

Mr. Hart—No, sir ; they bear the 
second year, and properly trained, soon 
become as profitable as any part of the 
tree. The fruit bends them down and 
the next growth starts from the bend. 
The limb thickens up, the rest of the tree 
grows out around it and it becomes a 
valuable part of a symmetrical tree. 

Mr. (-)—D<o I understand that 

you would let nature do its own pruning 
unless you found that the limbs were 
bending and rubbing against each otker? 

Mr. Hart—Yes, sir; that is pretty 
nearly right. 

Mr. (-)—After the freeze of 

1894, there were a lot of sour sprouts 


came up, sometimes as many as eight or 
ten. In most instances I have left all 
and they have made large limbs. Instead 
of having a large single trunk, I have a 
number of large limbs. The trees are 
about 25 feet from each other and in 
some cases they almost overlap, but 
there is a dense growth in the center. I 
have been in doubt as to whether it 
would not have been better to thin it out 
and get more fruit in the interior of the 
tree, but I have been afraid to do it. I 
understood that you, Mr. Hart, did not 
do it, but I am a little in doubt as to 
whether I am losing fruit by not thin¬ 
ning them out, or not. 

Mr. Hart—Wlhen the sour sprouts 
came up, I budded two or three of them 
and as the buds took, instead of cutting 
them away, I cut them partly off above 
the buds and laid them down. I would 
cut them partly off and then press my 
foot against them above the cut so that 
there would be a long break or split. In 
that way I retained the leaf surface of 
the sour wood in connection With the 
root until the sweet buds became larger 
and could take care of the strength of 
the roots. After a year or two the sweet 
buds have gotten good tops, those limbs 
that I had laid down had served their 
purpose and I took them 'away. Do not 
cut them entirely away and destroy the 
leaf surface until the sweet stock is large 
enough to take care of the root system. 

Mr. Seymour—After the freeze, I had 
to saw off my trees level with the ground 
and when the sprouts came up budded 
from four to eight, according to the size 
of the trunk. I have in my grove from 
one to seven or eight sprouts on the trees. 
As to the fruit of a single stock bearing 
as much as one with four stocks, I have 


















232 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


proved that not to be so. I have one 
tree with one stock and some with four, 
and I get a great many more off the four 
than off the one. As Brother Hart says, 
I do not pull all the extra sprouts off. 
I think the tree needs the leaf surface, 
and I leave them on in big bunches 
and after awhile I pull them off I think 
my grove is as fine a bearing grove as 
any in my neighborhood. 

Mr. (-)—Where you have a clus¬ 

ter of limbs growing up from the ground, 
do you prune or not? 

Mr. Seymour—I let nature do its own 
pruning. Unless a limb gets across 
another one and rubs it, I never cut it 
out. I have a neighbor who is all the 
time cutting his trees and he never gets 
more than half a crop any time. I think 
in pruning too much, you stop the bear¬ 
ing qualities of your tree. 


No. 5.—Is Frenching of the citrus 
family a disease in itself or simply a 
symptom of a derangement? How can 
it be treated? 

Mr. Painter—Frenching comes from' 
malnutrition. This may be from, differ¬ 
ent causes, therefore the treatment that 
will cure in one case will not necessarily 
cure in others. The most prevailing 
cause is humic acid in the soil. Apply a 
liberal application of airsl'acked or hy¬ 
drated lime to' th<* tree or on the side of 
the tree affected and harrow or hoe it in. 
Fertilize with a few pounds of nitrate 
of soda in addition to the regular appli¬ 
cation of fertilizer. In some cases three 
or four pounds of copperas applied to 
the diseased tree has apparently cured or 
helped the tree. 


No. 6—I especially would like to know 
why it is set down so positively that we 
cannot grow apple trees in Florida. With 
me several varieties are growing quite 
as well as they do in my New York 
orchard. I rely on heavy mulching for 
all trees, but especially for apples, plums, 
peaches, etc. I slope my mulch inward 
so as to catch and retain the rains. This 
mulch is made of any coarse material 
and covered with a layer of sand. If 
carefully made it equalizes the temper¬ 
ature around the roots. The hottest days 
do not affect the fine roots seriously. I 
am having excellent success so far with 
King David (one of Stark’s new apples), 
Stayman’s Winesap, and a few more of 
the fruits set down as hardly belonging 
in Florida. Of course my test has not 
yet reached the fruiting stage. I am suc¬ 
ceeding so far admirably well with Lam¬ 
bert and Bing cherries. I am planting 
freely of Mr. Munson’s hybrid grapes, 
and they promise exceedingly well. 
Among my peaches I have several from 
Stark Bros, in Missouri, that are doing 
quite as well as our Florida sorts. One 
of the best of these Is Wright. The 
Early Wheeler, (first received from Mr. 
Munson), is doing well. I think, how¬ 
ever, that this variety has some of the 
Chinese blood in it. 

What I miss in Florida is humus, and 
this I put forth every effort to create. 
Fortunately nature offers us abounding 
material for this purpose. I do not allow 
a pound of humus material to be burned. 
In such material I grew an 18 pound 
sweet potato this last year. Florida is 
full of problems, and is to me, immensely 
attractive. 

M(r. Painter—It has been set down 
that apples cannot be grown in Florida, 







FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


233 


after repeated experiments by some of 
our best horticulturists. Many of the 
varieties growing in the north have been 
tried' with varying success. The first 
year the trees are planted they apparently 
do well; the second year they may do 
fairly well and bear a fruit or two. but 
the third year generally winds them up. 
The apple evidently was not intended for 
this latitude, consequently will not thrive. 


It may be that some day by hybridizing 
carried out on the same line that Prof. 
Weber is following with the citrus, we 
may get an apple that will do fairly well 
in Florida. I believe that the Secretary 
of the Horticultural Society will be able 
to eat all of your next season’s crop of 
apples grown in Florida, and would not 
object to trying.

PROCEEDINGS 


OF THE 

Twenty-Second Annual Meeting 

f 

OF THE 

Florida State Horticultural Society 


The Florida State Horticultural Society 
held its twenty-second annual meeting in 
the historic city of Daytona, Volusia 
county. Quite a number of parties gath¬ 
ered at Daytona the day before the open¬ 
ing of the meeting as they wanted to be 
sure of good accommodations and enjoy 
the beach at Seabreeze and take in some 
of the attractions of Daytona before the 
meeting began. 

The place of meeting was in the Ar¬ 
mory and all of the sessions were well at¬ 
tended. The evening sessions were es¬ 
pecially well attended by the citizens of 
Daytona. In fact, the number of citi¬ 
zens turning out to the meetings was 
probably as large if not larger than at 
any place where a meeting has been held 
for years. The program was carried 
through with but little variation and all 
the time was taken up. For the lack of 
sufficient time some of the papers were 
simply accepted and ordered printed with 
the balance of the proceedings. 


The good ladies of Daytona entertained 
the lady members of the society at the 
Palmetto Club and all pronounced it a 
most enjoyable affair. The whole mem¬ 
bership of the Horticultural Society was 
treated to a boat ride to New Smyrna 
and an automobile ride from New Smyr¬ 
na to Daytona. It was hard to say which 
was the most enjoyable, and to cap the 
climax of good things the people of Day¬ 
tona assisted by the New Smyrna citi¬ 
zens gave a clam chowder lunch at the 
Ocean House. This House is noted for 
its clam chowder and on this occasion it 
nobly held up its reputation and those 
present had nothing but words of praise 
to utter. The members all expressed 
themselves as having a most enjoyable 
time and will remember their short stay 
with the good people of Daytona and 
New Smyrna with a great deal of pleas¬ 
ure. 

When the time for the next place of 
meeting was brought up, Orlando, Pa-

latka, and Jacksonville were the only 
places offering invitations and Orlando 
won, so that the next annual association 
meeting will be held in Orlando. Two 
previous meetings have been held in Or¬ 
lando and they were most enjoyable af¬ 


fairs and the next meeting is looked for¬ 
ward to with a great deal of pleasure. 

All of the members present enjoyed the 
lectures and addresses given by the Gov¬ 
ernment attaches, and hope that they will 
be with us each succeeding year.

Address of Welcome. 


By Mayor E. W. Greene. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It must be gratifying to the members 
of The Florida State Horticultural So¬ 
ciety to see so many gathered in atten¬ 
dance at this the opening meeting of the 
Twenty-second Annual gathering of this 
Society. It shows a marked and grow¬ 
ing interest in Horticulture throughout 
the State. 

I do not intend to occupy much of your 
time in a lengthy address of welcome 
for I know your time can be better 
spent in listening to addresses from more 
able speakers bearing on the subject more 
directly connected with the work of this 


association, but I want, on behalf of the 
citizens of Daytona to extend to the vis¬ 
iting members and friends a cordial wel¬ 
come and perfect freedom of the city dur¬ 
ing these meetings and after seeing the 
beauty and advantages which this section 
can offer, some of you, may wish to 
cast in your lot with us. To such I would 
say our welcome extends indefinitely. I 
hope the committee who have been in¬ 
trusted with your comfort have faithfully 
performed their duty and that your stay 
in our midst may be one of pleasure as 
well as profit to us all. 

Again I repeat, you are welcome and 
the freedom of the city is yours. 


RESPONSE TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 


By H. Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

It has fallen to my lot to reply in brief 
to the kind words of welcome extended 
to us by the Mayor on behalf of Daytona. 

Your Honor, in replying, I beg to say 
to you that we appreciate your cordial 
words and if your words did not amply 
assure us, there is abundant proof that we 
are indeed welcome. We were met and 
taken charge of by a committee of your 


representative citizens when we alighted 
from the train and made to feel that we 
were at home. When a few of us sat 
down to a belated dinner today, we were 
promptly informed that we were subject 
to a fine of increased rates, if we did not 
partake amply of the food before us. The 
idea of being fed by compulsion was en¬ 
tirely new. In fact, in the many and va- 
ried experiences which all of us have had 1 ,

the rule has always been to put a premium 
upon eating sparingly. It must be the 
Daytona way. And this afternoon, I 
made note of a pair of horticulturists tres¬ 
passing perhaps, upon the property of one 
of your citizens. They had, judging from 
their actions, found something interest¬ 
ing and made themselves at home. They 
were not molested. Now, your Honor, 

I beg of you, should any of this body be 
brought before you for trespassing, deal 
leniently with them, they are harmless. 

We have seen many things worthy of 
note in your city. It is a city marked, 
and out of the ordinary, a city built in 
the woods, a city where the touch of na¬ 
ture in all its beauty has been left un¬ 
spoiled. Your Honor, you have here a 
city unique, a city with well paved and 
shady streets, restful in its simple natur¬ 
alness, a city of which you may well feel 
proud. 

And you may feel assured, your 
Honor, that you will find this society not 
at all backward in accepting of your kind 
hospitality. This body stands for the 
progress of horticulture in this state, if 
it stands for anything. It is interesting 
to note the way along which the way of 
progress has led. The parent horticul¬ 
tural industry of this state—orange 
growing—had its origin in hammocks on 
the banks of rivers, lakes and streams. 
The first problem confronting the grower 
of those earlier days was that of propa¬ 
gation—the task of bringing those wild 
sour groves into profitable producers of 
sweet, edible fruit. Then came an enor¬ 
mous amount of work with varieties, ac¬ 
companied by much costly introduction 


work. The problem of fertilizers became 
prominent and looking over the older 
volumes of our proceedings, you will find 
lengthy dissertations on muck and other 
harmless substances. Scale insects and 
fungous diseases claimed attention and 
the strife between sprayers and non- 
sprayers. The cold came and with it there 
came into being numerous other horti¬ 
cultural industries. Latent possibilities 
were developed and as a result our horti¬ 
culture became more diversified. More 
recently irrigation has become a question 
of importance, for we have learned, 
whether it rains or not, we must have 
water. The problems connected with 
the marketing of our products are now 
being agitated and out of the discussion 
good will come. And in all these years 
no old question has been or can be laid 
down for no problem connected with the 
growing plant can ever be permanently 
settled. Difficulties have been met as 
they arose, mastered in part and relegated 
to a place of secondary importance as 
some new one claimed attention. The 
path has not been an easy one, but it has 
been cheerfully traveled upward. You 
can feel certain, your Honor, that an as¬ 
sociation, with a history such as this, will 
not be backward in accepting your hos¬ 
pitality, for the way has not always fallen 

in such pleasant places. 

And when we leave, we trust that it 
will be with a feeling on your part that 
you are glad we came and we shall, I 
speak for the society, carry away with us 
pleasant remembrances of our brief so¬ 
journ with you. 




Address of the President. 


By Dr. Wm. C. Richardson. 


Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In accordance with the requirements of 
precedent and duty it devolves upon me 
as your president on this occasion to de¬ 
liver an address. 

A year ago when you unexpectedly 
elected me to the office of president, I was 
reposing in a pool of ambitionless lethargy. 
I told you at that time that I was unfitted 
for the place both by inclination and 
equipment, and that I did not feel quali¬ 
fied to discharge its onerous duties, how¬ 
ever your call was unanimous and in ac¬ 
cepting the office I did it fully aware of 
its responsibilities and with a high appre¬ 
ciation of its honors. 

I am very much of an optimist, not be¬ 
cause optimism is pleasant or fashionable, 
but because it is a prerequisite to all suc¬ 
cess and achievement. Optimism and 
hope nerve the weary toiler’s arm and in¬ 
spire the sinking heart to renewed effort 
and ultimate victory. 

As Horticulturalists we are so beset 
with difficulties, disappointments and 
temporary failures that I confess it re¬ 
quires a large and vigorous supply of op¬ 
timism to keep us from falling into de¬ 
spair and despondency. 

There are those who look to the past 
for their models; whatever has the haze 
of antiquity has for them peculiar charms. 
They think and speak a great deal of 
“the good old times.” And, when they 
look forward, it is with forebodings of 
evil and prophecies of disaster. 


The world in general, is making pro¬ 
gress, and is better to-day than in any 
century of the past. As an illustration, 
permit me to refer to the “labor ques¬ 
tion,” now agitating this great country 
from center to circumference. There is 
much of fallacy in argument, and ignor¬ 
ance of fact, apparent in the discussions 
of this subject by leading agitators and 
demagogs in the various political parties 
of our land. It is asserted that the con¬ 
dition of the laborer is becoming worse 
from generation to generation; that the 
rich are getting richer, and the poor are 
getting poorer. The falsity of these 
statements will appear from even a slight 
acquaintance with history. The circum¬ 
stances of the poor are vastly better now 
than they were during the Middle Ages, 
or at any other period of the world. The 
laborer of our time wears finer clothes, 
sits down to a more sumptuous table, 
sleeps in a better ventilated and regulat¬ 
ed house than the former king and noble 
enjoyed. A faithful picture of the rags, 
the filth, the wretchedness, the stolid in¬ 
difference to manly aspirations, the ig¬ 
noble contentment with their very poverty 
and ignorance in which multitudes of 
poor people were once brought up, or 
rather allowed to struggle down to the 
grave, would doubtless astound many a 
grumbler, who is fond of exaggerating 
his own hard lot in comparison with that 
of his ancestors. “Say not thou, what 
is the cause that the former days were 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ntr 

l*o 


better than these? for thou dost not in¬ 
quire wisely concerning this.” 

In the irrepressible and seemingly never 
ending conflict between capital and labor, 
we the independent producers always and 
invariably get the worst of it. 

In point of numbers, including all those 
who are not affiliated with either class, 
we are largely in the majority, yet by 
our supineness we see our rights ignored 
and ruthlessly trampled upon by both 
sides of these contending forces. 

We are crushed and ground between 
the upper and nether millstones of ag¬ 
gressive dictatorial labor and tyrannous, 
oppressive capital. It is not merely a 
Kilkenny cat affair in which the combat¬ 
ants injure only themselves, but it is a 
deplorable and disastrous wrangle that in¬ 
volves the entire public. 

The solution and termination of this 
vexatious problem and cruelly ruinous 
struggle can not be left to the demagog 
and walking delegate, but the injured and 
long suffering, unbiased people themselves 
will finally be compelled to rise up in 
their strength and put an equitable and 
fair finish to this cruelly pitiful combat. 
The question naturally arises how do 
these people who are relatively only a 
small part of our population get such a 
powerful influence: the answer is sim¬ 
ple, it is because both capital and labor 
have their strong combinations and per¬ 
fect organizations. We too must organ¬ 
ize and combine before we can ever hope 
to wield much influence. 

It may be said that this is not a horti- 
culturalist’s question, but it seems to me 
that as horticulturalists and members of 
the body politic we are vitally interested 
in all questions of political economy and 


social welfare. The horticultural and 
agricultural population of our country is 
the leaven that converts the whole mass 
of the populace into a beneficient and glo¬ 
rious nationality. 

I believe in Evolution and Develop¬ 
ment, though not altogether as expounded 
by Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall and others. 
The element of progress runs like a gold¬ 
en chain through all the Universe of God: 
and nowhere does it sparkle with more 
refulgency than in the physical and ma¬ 
terial world—a realm to which the whole 
school of speculative philosophers have 
not lifted their eyes. The pessimistic un¬ 
believer in men, natural law and natural 
selection, has seen only half the truth,, 
or rather he has not seen half the truth.. 
Like an insect, which must be examined 
microscopically, he has seen only the 
smallest objects. 

The epoch in which we live is essenti¬ 
ally and emphatically a utilitarian age. 
The study of abstract science and specu¬ 
lative philosophy as a part of man’s edu¬ 
cation have like many other kinds of men¬ 
tal gymnastics been relegated to the rear 
and the demands of modern requirements 
insist on that kind of science and philos¬ 
ophy which can be put to immediate prac¬ 
tical and beneficial uses. 

Throughout all the past ages natural 
selection has played an important part in 
the evolution and development of all 
those horticultural products requisite to 
the sustenance of human life. At first 
these variations and survivals of the best 
and most useful fruits, grains, etc., were 
the result of sectional environment and 
climatic influences but later as man in¬ 
creased in intelligence and experience, he 
took a hand in the matter and has so as- 



24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sisted nature that results most prodigous 
and startling have been attained. 

Man’s first efforts were along the lines 
of careful selection of the best seeds, un¬ 
scientific fertilization and indifferent cul¬ 
tivation, later, grafting, budding, cross- 
pollenization, etc., were practiced and at 
the present day some of the results of 
man’s experiments along these lines are 
so marvelous and rapid as to be quite in¬ 
credible. 

The modern horticulturalist has by a 
judicious selection of variations* otherwise 
known as “sports and freaks,’' given us 
the luscious peach as a development from 
the scanty, bitter husk and large seed of 
the wild almond; wheat and other valu¬ 
able grains by a selection of variations in 
wild grasses. 

The strawberry has by careful selection 
been developed from an insignificant 
bunch of leaves into one of our most de¬ 
licious fruits, and now we learn that 
among the latest things in this kind of 
evolution is the production of a large, lus¬ 
cious, edible cactus, as much ahead of the 
kind that the Mexicans have for genera¬ 
tions been harvesting for their markets 
as the present magnificent tomatoes of 
our gardens are superior to those thought 
to be unfit to eat if not poisonous only 
some fifty or sixty years ago. We might 
go on with examples of this character, 
but enough has been said to show that the 
possibilities of this kind of evolution are 
almost absolutely limitless. 

It sometimes seems that the forces of 
nature combine with man in a determined 
assault on our welfare. No sooner have 
we met and vanquished the ill effects of 
'cold, drouth, lack of fertility, insect and 
other pests than we are beset by human 


or rather inhuman enemies who seek to 
rob us of our well earned success, through 
fraudulent markets, swindling buyers, 
robber transportation companies, trusts 
and combines. 

There are evils so vast in their propor¬ 
tions and so fortified by position and 
wealth, that to assail them seems to the 
eye of sense to be madness and folly. 
These combinations belong to this class 
of evils. The longer one studies their 
nature and all permeating extent, the 
more conversant he becomes with their 
results, the more he is persuaded that no 
tongue, however eloquent, can describe, 
and no pen, however graphic, can portray 
a tithe of their evils. To exaggerate is 
impossible. As John Wesley said of sla¬ 
very, I would say of this: “It is the sum 
of all villainies.” 

The discussion of their oppression is 
hindered by the difficulty—in a sense, the 
hopelessness—of the undertaking. They 
are defiant and laugh our puny efforts to 
scorn. Their conquests and despotisms 
have continued over a period of lo these 
many years, and we almost despair. 

Let us remember, however, that while 
the storms of adversity, the fierce strug¬ 
gles for rights, the crushing of worthy 
ambitions, the bitterness of disappoint¬ 
ment, the gloom of despair, all affect the 
mental as well as the physical life; and 
that in some cases disaster is complete; 
nevertheless to the cheerful, optimistic 
mind there comes reaction, relief and 
final victory through determined, persis¬ 
tent and well directed work. 

In our successful efforts to extract 
from the soil its richest and best pro¬ 
ducts, we have through selfish, individual 
effort fenced ourselves in with a wall of 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


25 


almost seclusive isolation, shutting out 
our neighbors and fellow workers. While 
we have been doing this all those others 
with whom we are compelled to deal, 
Aave combined among themselves and 
with each other for aggressive mutual 
benefit. The fertilizer industries, the 
transportation lines, the commission con¬ 
cerns and the buyers; all and each have 
their well organized systems of doing 
business without encountering ruinous 
competition, and are reaping golden har¬ 
vests of profit. With us lack of any and 
all organized methods of mutual co-oper¬ 
ation in making our requisite purchases 
of materials and commodities necessary 
to our operations, and in the ruinous, fool¬ 
ish competitive manner of marketing our 
crops, have led to a point where our la¬ 
bors are not only unremunerative but de¬ 
structive of all gains. We have met and 
vanquished the evil influences of earth 
and air and it now behooves us to buckle 
on our armor and meet these last foes. 
The result can not be uncertain, our 
forces are now gathering and when we 
make a united and concerted effort, wc 
must and shall come out victorious. 

u Let us then be up and doing with a 
heart for any fate.” 

We are altogether to blame ourselves 
for the deplorable conditions now existent 
which bear down on us with such oppres¬ 
sive weight. If we would only give a 
little part of the time to the cultivation 
of mutual interests that we do to the 
cultivation of the soil we would soon get 
such results that our gains might be com¬ 
mensurate with our desires. 

Man is a gregarious creature and when¬ 
ever he attempts to flock by himself, he 
invariably makes a dismal failure. What 


we need and must have is mutual com¬ 
binations of our entire producing inter¬ 
ests, so that we can go unitedly into the 
markets and demand fair prices for pro¬ 
ducts and transportation. Our neighbors 
in California have in a most signal way 
succeeded in combining their mutual in¬ 
terests so that they are realizing splen¬ 
did returns for their products, and this 
too, without curtailing or interfering with 
individual rights. What they have done, 
we can do with such modifications of 
their system as may be requisite to our 
situation. 

Co-operative efforts have frequently 
failed, but usually this has come about 
through a too strong communistic ten¬ 
dency in the details. Co-operative move¬ 
ments and organizations where individual 
rights have been fundamental and re¬ 
spected have nearly always succeeded. 

Let us at once combine together in a 
final herculean effort to get redress and 
justice. If we do this intelligently we 
can not fail. 

Upon occasions like the present, active, 
conscientious thinkers and workers nat¬ 
urally fall into a line of thought and med¬ 
itation, having reference to the flight of 
time and opportunity; the dead past, the 
living present, the unborn future. The 
dead past with all its memories, whether 
prosperous or adverse, can give us only 
the unalterable lessons of example and 
experience; the living present we seize 
with avidity, in an eager strife to make 
it as a past an improvement upon that 
which may have preceded it; the unborn 
future we ardently hope may prove a vast 
improvement upon both the present and 
the past. It is probably a wise provision 





26

of our mental and moral constitution, 
that— 

“Hope springs eternal in the human breast; 

Man never is, but always to be blessed.” 

Today, while standing upon the narrow 
niche of ever fleeing time we peer back into 
the sepulchral portals of the buried past; 
and while ardently wishing it had been 
better, we, as it were, simultaneously 
hope, work and pray that the womb of 
the future, with all its unborn progeny, 
may have something better in store for 
us. 

Results in life are largely, very large¬ 
ly, what we make them in the exercise of 
industry, wisdom and sagacity. Accident 
and chance as factor in results, are but 
flimsy excuses or pretexts to cloak our 
ignorance, stupidity and failures. 

In the preparation of this address mat¬ 
ters purely and essentially horticultural 
have not had that prominence which has 
usually been customary, but as an offset 
to this, those who are in charge of the 
several committees and the authors of the 
various papers will give us a feast of 
knowledge and detail along horticultural 
highways, and byways that will make up 
for the deficiency. 

If I have touched questions of public 
interest in certain directions it has been 


because I feel that these questions are live 
wires charged with dangers that menace 
our welfare and I trust that the voicing 
of my personal sentiments may not be 
misunderstood or misconstrued. 

In conclusion, let us all work earnestly 
and faithfully to make this gathering 
one long to be remembered as one fruit¬ 
ful in good things, beneficial alike to 
every member of the Society, and to the 
cause of Horticulture. Let us in our dis¬ 
cussions, give up freely the treasures of 
personal experience; let each bring forth 
his little or much, to strengthen his broth¬ 
er and give him will, force and self-re¬ 
liance in his daily struggles. 

Finally may each and everyone of us 
live to a ripe old age in harmony with the 
last words of the great Victor Hugo, 
“Winter is on my head and eternal spring 
is in my heart. The nearer I approach 
the end, the plainer I hear around me the 
immortal symphonies of the worlds which 
invite me. For half a century I have been 
writing my thoughts in prose, verse, his¬ 
tory, philosophy, drama, romance, tradi¬ 
tion, satire, ode, song; I have tried all. 
But I feel I have not said the thousandth 
part of what is in me. My work is only 
a beginning. The thirst for infinity 
proves infinity.” 


What the Experiment Station is Doing for the 

Fruit and Vegetable Grower. 


By P. H. Rolfs. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I wish to give a somewhat general talk, 
similar to the one I delivered to the So¬ 
ciety at the Tampa meeting. All know 
more or less about the experiment station; 
yet I suppose those of us who are at the 
experiment station think we know less 
about it than many people in the State ap¬ 
pear to know about it. That is quite in 
keeping with the general order of things; 
the nearer one gets to the real thing, the 
less he finds he knows about it. I be¬ 
lieve our worthy secretary said, a couple 
of years ago, that at one time he knew 
all about fertilizers, but now he found 
that he was just beyond the beginning 
point. In fact, his knowledge had in¬ 
creased until he was in the position of 
knowing just how little he did know. 

We have published from the experi¬ 
ment station 98 bulletins, 117 press bul¬ 
letins, and 20 annual reports. Of the bul¬ 
letins it will be found that over 50 per 
cent, deal directly or indirectly with hor¬ 
ticultural subjects. During the past fiscal 
year the experiment station has distrib¬ 
uted over 73,000 copies of bulletins, press 
bulletins and reports. In addition to 
this a very large amount of time is de¬ 
voted to answering special inquiries made 
by various people in the State. 


FERTILIZER EXPERIMENTS. 

In the matter of making field experi¬ 
ments it is a recognized impossibility to 
grow all crops of the State at the central 
station, consequently the workers must 
proceed to the fields where these crops 
are grown. And to make these experi¬ 
ments of general value it is necessary to 
carry them on under conditions which 
exist in the field. 

PINEAPPLES. 

We have conducted for the past eight 
years experiments in fertilizing certain 
plots continuously with certain definitely 
known fertilizers. As the result of this 
work four bulletins and one separate from 
the annual report have been published. 
We have now ready for publication an¬ 
other bulletin on the chemical analyses of 
the fruits grown on the various plots. 
This work we believe has been carried 
on as long as it will be profitable under 
our present scheme of fertilization. 

CITRUS. 

About a year ago Professor Blair took 
up the question of arranging for carrying 
on a co-operative experiment in citrus 
fertilization. This is being done in co¬ 
operation with Mr. G. M. Wakelin, of 



28 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Lanepark, Fla. We have 480 trees that 
have been planted 1 out and fertilization 
has begun. It is intended to carry this 
work forward for at least 10 years. While 
the funds of the experiment station would 
not permit the experiment to be enlarged 
to the extent of making it complete in 
every detail, it is thought that the present 
experiment will cover some of the essen¬ 
tial points upon which we need a great 
deal more information. A sufficient num¬ 
ber of trees (10) have been set out to 
each plot; so we feel that the results ob¬ 
tained from each plot will be fairly indic¬ 
ative of what will occur on an 'entire 
field. The standard formula, or one that 
is most commonly used by the citrus 
growers, has been taken as a basis. In 
some of the plots the ammonia contents 
are increased and in others decreased. 
In others the potash contents are increased 
and in others decreased. In others the 
phosphoric acid contents are increased 
and in others decreased. In still other 
plots the sources of ammonia are changed, 
while in others the sources of potash and 
phosphoric acid are changed. So that 
while we have not made all the possible 
combinations, we still have made enough 
variations to enable us to understand 
something definite about the results when 
they occur. 

Accurate data regarding the rainfall 
and also in regard to the temperature of 
the soil and of the atmosphere will be 
kept. Chemical analyses will be made 
of the soil before beginning the work, and 
repeatedly during the progress of the ex¬ 
periment. Chemical analyses will also be 
made of the foliage, the twigs, and the 
roots of the trees, as well as of the fruit 
when it shall have matured. 


DISEASE INVESTIGATIONS. 

The investiation of diseases in fruit and 
vegetable crops has always been an im¬ 
portant piece of work; and in this con¬ 
nection we have been able to save to the 
State many thousands of dollars annually. 
While the ideal condition would be an 
orchard or field that is entirely free from 
diseases, we cannot hope to attain to that 
state of perfection immediately. As a 
matter of fact, we have to understand 
the diseases rather perfectly before we 
are able to prevent their occurrence. 
When a tree or plant has become thor¬ 
oughly diseased, no amount of theorizing 
as to how it should be treated to be kept 
well is of any value to us. We need to 
know the remedy and how to have it 
applied. 

PEACH TWIG BLIGHT. 

This disease has been causing consid¬ 
erable difficulty for some years past in 
the peach orchard. It is now being 
taken up as a special study by one of our 
assistants in the experiment station. 

CITRUS DISEASES. 

The citrus crop is the biggest money 
crop that we raise in the State, and like¬ 
wise there is probably no other crop that 
is so severely beset by diseases of various 
kinds. 

This work of remedial measures 
against such organisms as are the cause of 
diseases in citrus trees has been taken up 
by Professor Fawcett, who will speak to 
you later in regard to the diseases of 
citrus. 

In addition to the diseases of citrus 
that are caused by micro-organisms, cer-

tain diseases are caused by unfavorable 
soil or fertilizer conditions. In short, 
they are the results of improper physio¬ 
logical surroundings. This line of re¬ 
search has been lately taken up by Pro¬ 
fessor Floyd, who will later tell you about 
gum disease, melanose, dieback, etc. 

WHITEFLY STUDIES. 

In combating our enemies we have 
two methods of proceeding; first, by 
artificial means; and, second, by en¬ 
listing in our (service the natural ene¬ 
mies or some other natural condition. In 
combating scale insects, many of us have 
conducted an uneven warfare by using 
insecticides and spraying machinery at a 
very considerable cost. Later it was dis¬ 
covered that we could enlist the fungi 
which are natural enemies of the scale in¬ 
sect, and so do this work at much less cost 
to ourselves. 

It will be remembered that Dr. Webber 
about twelve years ago reported to the 
Horticultural Society that he had discov¬ 
ered a fungus which grew parasiticallv 
upon the whitefly. This was a very 
great surprise to all of us and was eager¬ 
ly received. In connection with this work 
however, a great many difficulties arose 
which prevented a sufficiently rapid dis¬ 
semination of the fungi to annihilate the 
whitefly. Dr. Berger has reported to you 
from year to year his success in devising 
means for increasing the efficiency of the 
fungi and making it it easier to distribute 
them. We now know at least seven spe¬ 
cies of fungi that are parasitic upon the 
whitefly, and the indications are that there 
are still undiscovered species that will 
work for us if we will but give them the 
proper opportunity. 


Over 1,200 acres of citrus groves have 
been treated with whitefly fungi and vis¬ 
ited by members of the experiment sta¬ 
tion staff. In addition to this we have 
received letters from owners of several 
times as many acres stating that they are 
using this method. The whitefly fungi 
are being used in the following locations: 

Winter Park, Boardman, Titusville, 
McIntosh, St. Petersburg, Candler, Au- 
burndale, Orlando, Bartow, East Palatka, 
Plymouth, Palmetto, Ybor City, Fort 
Myers, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Alva, 
Buckingham, Bradentown, Manatee, De- 
Land, and Dunedin. 

CO-OPERATIVE EXPERIMENTS. 

These experiments are carried forward 
jointly with the citrus or vegetable grow¬ 
ers. As a general rule, the Experiment 
Station bears the expense of its agent, 
and a part of the expenses of making the 
experiment; the citrus or vegetable grow¬ 
er bearing the expense of maintaining the 
field and a part of the expense incident to 
carrying on the experiment. 

Co-operative citrus experiments are be¬ 
ing carried on at Lanepark. These are 
expected to' be continued for a period of 
ten years. Pineapple fertilizer experi¬ 
ments have been carried on at Jensen for 
a period of eight years. Citrus disease in¬ 
vestigations are being carried on at Bay- 
view. Celery fertilizer experiments have 
been carried on at Sanford, and celery 
disease experiments at Orlando and 
Bradentown. 

Co-operative whitefly experiments are 
in progress at Gainesville, St. Petersburg, 
Leesburg, DeLand and New Smyrna. 

The advantages to the Experiment Sta¬ 
tion can readily be seen from the fact that 


30 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the groves or fields are certain to be un¬ 
der the normal circumstances, with the 
exception of the conditions of the experi¬ 
ment. In other words the grove in case 
of disease experiments will receive the 
normal and usual cultivation and fertiliz¬ 
ation just as though the experiments were 
not being carried on. We are certain, 
therefore, that if any difference occurs on 
the experiment plot, it due entirely to> the 
test that is being made. The advantages 
to the grower are that he comes immedi¬ 
ately in contact with the most advanced in¬ 
formation that results from the experi¬ 
ments. We find in every case that where 
these co-operative experiments have been 
conducted there is established at once a 
Horticultural Society composed of at 
least one in the audience and a speaker 
who discusses all sorts of questions in 
connection with the work in hand. 

farmers' institutes. 

This work is not properly experiment 
station work, but from the nature of the 
case our experiment station workers are 
well prepared to discuss most of the prob¬ 
lems connected with agricultural and hor¬ 
ticultural work. It is quite probable that 
this is the reason why the Institutes con¬ 
tinue to call so frequently for workers 
from the experiment station. During the 
biennium from July i, 1907, to the pres¬ 
ent time, 91 sessions of Farmers’ In¬ 
stitutes have been held. The total atten¬ 
dance on these institutes is 9,301, making 
the average attendance a little more than 
100. In this connection I might be allowed 


to state that the institutes are being called 
for more frequently in northern and wes¬ 
tern Florida, than in eastern, central and 
southern Florida. As both our time and 
funds are limited, we have been unable to 
hold all the institutes requested. Under 
the circumstances, we are not able to 
work up institutes in sections where they 
are not called for. 

CONCLUSION. 

Those of the Horticultural society who 
have been earnestly interested in the ex¬ 
periments made by the experiment sta¬ 
tion will have discovered that our most 
important work and our most lasting 
work is such as has required a consider¬ 
able time for perfecting. We might say 
in a general way that the surface and easy 
problems have to a large extent been 
worked out, and have passed from the ex¬ 
perimental stage to the demonstration 
stage. From time to time as we secure 
valuable results in our experimental 
work, publications are issued setting forth 
our discoveries. We have two lines of 
publications. First, the regular bulletin 
which discusses certain problems and 
gives the information in a full and con¬ 
cise way. These are distributed to the 
people of the State. The press bulletins 
are short essays discussing certain phases 
of problems and announcing discoveries 
in our research work. These press bul¬ 
letins, as their name indicates, are sent to 
all the newspapers of the State with the 
request that they publish them. 


Handling of Citrus Groves. 


By B. H. Chilton. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

This to me covers a large field; for I 
am aware that with so many different 
conditions that have to be met with in the 
different qualities of soils, and modes of 
working, and before this body of wide 
experienced and practical growers, I 
hardly know where I ought to commence. 

First—I believe in thorough cultiva¬ 
tion on all common sandy soils; and com¬ 
mence fertilizing and cultivating as early 
in February as we can with safety. While 
many of us no doubt feel that there is 
some danger yet of a late cold striking 
us. But if your acreage be small, or run 
up in the hundreds, you have to take your 
chances, for there is nothing gained by 
waiting; for about this time generally, 
nature herself begins to assert itself and 
the orange tree is among the first to re¬ 
spond. 

With fertilizing we make two appli¬ 
cations a year: February and June or 
July, giving at each application io to 15 
pounds of the standard brands, Gem mix¬ 
ture or special fruit and vine, according 
to the conditions and needs. This is on 
eight to ten-year-old bearing trees. With 
the younger trees planted in grove shape 
to allow from two up to six pounds 
to the tree. I believe in blood, bone and 
potash, governing the amount according 
to the condition and size of the tree, and 


for building up your soil. With our June 
and July application of fertiliser it differs 
but little, if the season is favorable; only 
we use if possible the high grade of spe¬ 
cial mixture of the highest per cent, in 
potash, on our bearing grove. 

On our hammock grove we use less in 
ammonia and a higher per cent, in potash. 
Where the vegetation makes a heavy 
growth we find also that the die back mix¬ 
ture gives good results. For in our heavy 
timbered grove or marl hammock land, 
there is a tendency in a moist season, for 
the trees to show more or less die back 
signs. 

CULTIVATING OR CULTIVATION. 

On all old groves and sandy soil, we 
use nothing but the Planet Junior and 
Rolling Cutaway and Acme Harrow, and 
the hoe around the trees. This is kept up 
until the first of August; and in a dry 
season, if possible, I would recommend 
that the Acme Harrow be brought into ac¬ 
tive service, and all grove be gone over 
once a week. After July we let the beg¬ 
gar weed and crab grass take possession, 
which will give your trees a heavy mulch 
and shade the ground until the first of 
November. Then we begin again for 
winter protection. Using the Morgan 
Spading Harrow, which can be used both 
ways, and will cut up the growth which 
has already begun to die down, and mix-

ing it with the soil. And this also makes 
a fire protection. For with us we use the 
open pine fire for frost protection, in 
every check in our bearing groves. With 
our young groves we make fire in our mar¬ 
gins, and bank high all young stock. And 
in cultivation in our hammock grove, 
nearly all the work is done with the hoe 
and scythe. Hoeing large circles around 
the trees and mowing the margin, this is 
done three times a year. 


PRUNING. 

I believe in the use of the knife wiith 
good judgment. And that along the line 
with Professor Harold Hume, gave uls in 
his able lecture two years ago at St. Pet¬ 
ersburg. Cut close and clean and using a 
dressing on all large cuts, of either graft¬ 
ing wax, or oil, lamp black and white 
lead. And keeping the center of your 
tree clean of all dead limbs and water 
sprouts, unless you want to bring out a 
new limb or leader to fill out the vacancy. 


By Jas. E. Kilgore. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

After thinking this subject over I have 
decided that it is a very large and diffi¬ 
cult one for me. Any method I advance 
will depend, for its success or failure, on 
the soil and the season where the test is 
made. A method that would give good 
results in a wet year may fail in a dry, 
without proper irrigation, and the dif¬ 
ferent conditions in warm and cold win¬ 
ters also interfere with our plans. 

The soil problem is also very compli¬ 
cated where we have citrus groves on ev¬ 
ery description of land from rich, damp 
hammock to spruce scrub. Many small 
groves extend over so wide a range of 
soil that one side will not do well with a 
treatment adapted to the other side. Un¬ 
der such conditions there is no best meth¬ 
od ; every grower must have a flexible 
system to suit himself and his groves. 
However, I think that I gain more use¬ 
ful information at our meetings than I 
do all the year alone in my grove, and I 


regret that I can give so little in return. 

In setting out citrus trees, I prefer mid¬ 
winter for moist land but for high, thirsty 
soil the summer rains often make up for 
the other conditions, so I take that time 
for setting out. When the trees begin to 
grow I watch the tops until they are five 
or six feet high and if two or more buds 
show equal strength I take off all but 
one or nip the buds. This prevents a 
crooked tree and causes little loss of fol¬ 
iage. I prune out water sprouts and dead 
branches and take off the lower branches 
as they Come to the ground. 

In general fertilizing I use a mixture 
containing little nitrogen and give all the 
trees a good share. If they look well they 
need it to keep them so and if they look 
badly it ’will help them. Then I go over 
the grove with my nitrogen 'and give such 
trees as need fit, a dose according to their 
needs. If a tree is pale, with small leaves, 
or has a heavy crop a good lot is used 1 , if 
it has large green leaves and few fruit 
little or none is needed. This is not a

33 


task for an ordinary laborer but it gives 
good results in keeping a grove uniform 
in condition. For my bearing trees I use 
from twenty to fifty pounds of land plast¬ 
er per tree and suppose that it does some 
good. I use also about twenty pounds of 
Kanit on the same supposition, where the 
drainage is good. But if I depended on 
sulphate of ammonia for my nitrogen, es¬ 
pecially in early spring when I apply most 
of it, I would not use the Kanit on account 
of the well known fact that a chlorin and 
a sulphate of ammonia do not act well to¬ 
gether; 

I had a great deal of trouble with my 
outside rows of trees. The groove is. partly 
surrounded by heavy timber that I did 
not care to destroy. I put all kind's of ferti¬ 
lizer on the outside rows and a great deal 
of it, but the woods looked much better 
than the orange treees and the application 
of lime was all that seemed to help the 
orange trees. Then I decided to dig a 
good deep ditch between the wood's and 
the grove. Now the outside trees look 
best and one dollar’s worth of ditching 
did more than ten dollars worth of ferti¬ 
lizer could have done for them. The 
ditches are also very useful in case of a 
flood. I am convinced that one wet, sobby 
season can do a grove more lasting injury 
than a dozen droughts. Also when high 
land does get too wet it seems h> suffer 
more than low land. If we can keep our 
ground front staying too wet and “sob¬ 
bing” off the deep feeding roots the 
drought will have much less effect. So a 
good, deep ditch even on high land may 
largely relieve the need for irrigation. I 
use also a lot of muck and' lime but as 
their action is more directly on the soil 


than as a fertilizer I will mention them 
under cultivation. 

Cultivation or, in a general way, the 
handling of the soil is the real problem in 
handling a citrus grove and one of which 
I know little and confess a great amount 
of ignorance. But for the sake of discus¬ 
sion I will beg your leniency. When I first 
became interested in this problem the 
clean culture method seemed to be gener¬ 
ally practiced. We cultivated all the year 
and hauled in mulch to keep up the hum¬ 
us. This seemed alright especially on very 
dry land where nothing would grow any¬ 
way and the weather was too warm for 
much summer work. But the trees seemed 
to show age badly and dieback and disease 
were too common. Then we began to let 
the grass grow a little after the summer 
rain had wet the ground thoroughly, and 
we could cultivate the fertilizer into the 
wet soil, so that the trees‘would get it be¬ 
fore the sun evaporated it. When the grass 
died in the fall or was used for hay we 
commenced over. The grass took the 
place of some of the mulch hauling and it 
seemed to do' better. About six years ago 
my summer fertilizer did not arrive on 
time, we had early rains, and as I had 
some beggar weed and a lot of grass the 
ground was covered with tender stuff. 
When the fertilizer did come I had to put 
it on and cultivate it in to save it. It was 
very easy to see the result and I decided 
not to try that way again. As I could not 
see how the sun would destroy my citrus 
fertilizer I next put it on before the rains 
began, then let the grove take care of itself 
till late fall, when it was a mass of tang¬ 
led and dead vegetation except where I 
had cut hay. This method seemed to me

nearly perfect and I got good results and 
by moving a few times there was little 
trouble. 

But I tried further to find just when the 
cultivation should cease. First I left a 
square of sixteen trees as soon as the 
bloom had 1 opened, and cultivated all oth¬ 
er trees until the first summer rain. Then 
the soil got dry and I cultivated a few 
rows again before the heavy rains. The 
spring drought was not severe enough to 
kill the weeds and grass in the test plot so 
it was two or three feet deep in fairly rank 
growth through the worst weather, but 
the trees looked as well as the cultivated 
ones and when the rains commenced they 
put on a much better growth* and were 
ahead of those cultivated. The rows culti¬ 
vated last were the last to show 
new growth and made the least growth 
and the differences were almost as appar¬ 
ent and in the same order the following 
season. I next turned loose a large plot 
about the first of April. We had a good 
shower which gave the weeds and grass 
good start and they got about eight inches 
high when the weather got so bad that 
they commenced to wither and expose 
the soil to the sun. Then they 
dried up until I thought they were all 
dead and the temptation to cultivate was 
very strong but I considered the mischief 
done so I let it go. I did not at that time 
nor have I since noticed any bad results 
from the neglect, but there was no appar¬ 
ent advantage except a saving of labor. So 
I have about decided that the best time to 
lay by is when the bloom opens if there 
is sufficient moisture; if not then we must 
cultivate until the first rains of summer. 
But on fairly moist land if a good deep 
growth can be secured by the first of May 


it will keep the ground cool and grow 
right through the drought when a small or 
scattering growth would die and be of no 
use at all. The only use of this growth in a 
drought is to keep the ground cool and in 
good condition, for I think that there is 
little doubt that the growth takes less 
moisture than would be lost by the direct 
heat of the sun on the soil. With irriga¬ 
tion, we can lay by when we choose and I 
would wish to get a cover before the hot 
weather any way. 

Four years ago about twenty-five trees 
in the lower corner of my grove, where the 
soil is rather moist and rich, showed die- 
back. I had little hope for them and have 
done nothing more to them except to cut 
down the weeds and young bushes. This 
season the trees in that plot are the health¬ 
iest I have and had the best crop and the 
best fruit on the place. So it is quite easy 
to consider this more perfect, except that 
the dead trash on the ground all winter 
is too tempting to fire, but closer mowing 
with some clean middles Would help that. 
I have thought that it would increase the 
danger from cold but I am not now sure 
of that when the more uniform condition 
of sap is considered. I believe that irriga¬ 
tion will be necessary to adapt this culti¬ 
vatorless cultivation to high land but irri¬ 
gation is needed anyway and this sort of 
cultivation will simplify irrigation and in¬ 
crease its benefits, for the final results of ir¬ 
rigation on the bare, hot sand has seemed 
doubtful to me. If I were dealing with a 
fruit like the peach which has reached per¬ 
fection through strenuous urging, or a 
short lifed vegetable, the result of intense 
culture and forcing, I would seach for 
more artificial means in improving them. 
While the citrus tree shows great ability

35 


to stand forcing- and other well intended 
abuses, I think that it is not wholly domes¬ 
ticated and prefers some of its natural 
forest conditions, a sweet, moist, rich soil 
on which the sun cannot shine and where 
its delicate root system, will not be disturb¬ 
ed. To bring the soil to such a state 
plenty of muck, leaves or trash will be 
needed and a good application of ground 
shell or raw ground limestone will be 
necessary. A number of observations on 
shell and marl land, besides liming tests, 
make me sure on that point. And if the re¬ 
quirements of this system are filled its 
adoption will be almost a necessity. The 
reverse is also somewhat true of it. 

Why do we cultivate so much in our 
too active sandy citrus soils? I would not 
use a fertilizer on my grove that would 
be injured by the sunshine or would not 
wash into the soil with a few showers. If 
cultivation really saves much moisture un¬ 
der our grove conditions it is of little con¬ 
sequence under modern irrigation or on 
low land. If to keep the crust broken, so 
far as I know the sort of crust we break 
only forms under cultural conditions, and 
if we keep the top crust broken one will 
form just below the cultivator limit 
that we cannot break without 
injury to the roots. This also indi¬ 
cates that the soil mulch as we use it is 
not perfect as a mellowing agent. I think 
also that the apparently good results from 
cultivation are deceptive and may finally 
become destructive, especially when the 
soil is worked when wet or green stuff is 
worked into it. And the warmer the 
weather the greater the resulting injury 
will be in any case. The action of culti¬ 
vation on our active sand is as a powerful 


stimulant to the tree when it is done, 
afterwards, the reaction. 

Many of us have seen groves that 
for some reason were thrown out. If 
these trees were properly fertilized, irri¬ 
gated, mulched, and pruned with the grass 
mowed to return to the soil instead of 
clean grazing the quantity of fruit might 
increase to commercial proportions with¬ 
out destroying the quality. At least, we 
should not be complaining of bad results 
from fertilizing, etc., when bad cultural 
conditions were the cause. If any one 
should be favorably impressed with this 
idea I can only ask them to go slowly with 
it as I did. . But on rich, moist land the 
commercial possibilities of this system are 
especially good and it might adapt such 
land to citrus culture where it now fails. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mir. Mead—I have been trying some 
experiments in fertilizing trees lately. I 
came to the conclusion that the effect 
of fertilizer does not last very long, so a 
year ago I tried the experiment of ferti¬ 
lizing much more often than I had ever 
done before, giving a less quantity. Now, 
the ordinary method is to give from twen¬ 
ty to forty pounds of fertilizer to a tree all 
at once and several months apart. I exper¬ 
imented by giving a tree ten pounds every 
month. Tlie yield the very first year, al¬ 
though I began the experiment in Jan¬ 
uary, increased from an average of six, to 
eighteen boxes of oranges. This year the 
tree has grown splendidly and has set 
what seems to be a moderate crop of fruit, 
but it may turn out to be much better than 
it now seems. I used a complete orange 
tree fertilizer (Mape’s) the “fruit and

vine” variety for all except one applica¬ 
tion. I tried the same experiment years 
ago with five pounds a month on a plot of 
six trees, and the results were very satis¬ 
factory. The fertilizer was paid for sev¬ 
eral times over. I used a brand that con¬ 
tains 12 per cent, potash, 2 per cent, to 
3 per cent, ammonia and 8 per cent, phos¬ 
phoric acid. It is one of the standard 
brands for fruiting trees. 

Mr. Temple—May I ask the gentleman 
if he made any change in his method dur¬ 
ing the dormant period of the tree? Do I 
understand that he fertilized every month, 
the same quantity, right through the 
year? I would also like to- know if he 
found this had any effect on the tree ; that 
is whether it bloomed earlier in the 
spring, or later than trees treated as they 
are ordinarily. 

Mr. Mead—I gave ten pound's each 
calendar month. As to earliness the differ¬ 
ence is so slight as not to- merit attention. 
Possibly it did open up a little earlier but 
I think that was due to the tree being* in 
more vigorous health, but the difference 
was but a few days. Some of the trees 
that I did not fertilize at all last year 
bloomed more heavily, and some of them 
bloomed earlier in isolated cases. How¬ 
ever, this tree has certainly -set a good 
crop. 

Mr. Penny—May I ask the gentleman 
how the fruit on the trees ripened up; did 
it ripen up earlier or later, and also how 
was the texture of the fruit, coarse or fine, 
and -was the skin smooth or rough ? 

Mr. Mead—There was not very much 
difference between the trees; they all rip¬ 
ened about the same time. The fruit is not 
of the very best quality but as the other 


trees were similar I took it to be due to 
Other conditions than the fertilizer. I could 
not see any difference in the texture of 
the fruit. When I was fertilizing the plot 
of six trees the fruit was exceedingly good 
and smooth. I was fertilizing then with 
five pounds a month. I could not see that 
the fertilizing had 1 very much to do with 
the quality of the fruit. The tree was af¬ 
fected with the whitefly more or less but 
that did not seem to make any particular 
difference. 

Mr. Penny—How about the ripening? 

Mr. Mead—It ripened a little later than 
usual this year, but by December it was all 
right and shipped a little later than the 
middle of December. 

Dr. Richardson—Then you mean to 
say that you think the only difference was 
the increased bearing. I have heard it said 
that an experiment was tried in which a 
tree was given 300 pounds of fertilizer 
during the year, but after 125 pounds was 
given they could not see any difference in 
the bearing capacity or condition of the 
tree; that it did not seem capable of assim¬ 
ilating more than 125 pounds. 

Mr. Penny—I would like to ask Mr. 
Kilgore what kind of nitrogen he uses. 

I understand that he used nitrogen inde¬ 
pendent of his other fertilizer. 

Mir. Kilgore—I use almost any sort of 

nitrogen I can get, dependent on the sea¬ 
son. In the spring I keep my grove just 
as rich in nitrogen ais I dare. I get it eas¬ 
ily from the legumes, rich muck beds, etc. 
In the early spring I generally use nitrate ‘ 
of soda or nitrate potash. Later in the 
season I would prefer organic nit¬ 
rogen from the soil but I can only do that 
by allowing the weeds and grass to grow.

Mr. Penny—Then you consider nitrate M,r. Kilgore—I do, most decidedly. I

Packing and Shipping Citrus Fruits. 


MODERN METHODS OF PACKING ORANGES. 


By Lloyd S. Tenny, Pomologist. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

More than ever before in fruit grow¬ 
ing, the quality of the product as it ar¬ 
rives on the market is of first importance. 
No matter how fine the fruit may be in 
the orchard or packing house if it reaches 
the market in a decayed or poor condi¬ 
tion, the grower ultimately loses money. 
The methods of growing the fruit are 
of prime importance for unless it is well 
grown, of fine quality on the tree, free 
from disease and insect pests, there is no 
hopes of it ever being in first-class condi¬ 
tion when it reaches the market. But it 
is not sufficient to have the fruit in per¬ 
fect condition as it hangs on the trees 
ready for the harvest. The processes of 
harvesting and packing are almost equally 
important with the methods of growing 
for unless these methods are correct, the 
handling of the fruit in packing may be 
the means directly or indirectly of much 
loss from decay in transit or on the mar¬ 
ket. The work of the department of ag¬ 
riculture in California and Florida on 
better methods of packing oranges is suf¬ 
ficiently well known for me not to dwell 
long on these results. The paper which 
was read at the last meeting of this so¬ 
ciety at Gainesville gives the data in full 


to that time. Suffice to say that the ex¬ 
periments all lead to the belief that the 
methods of picking and packing the or¬ 
anges very clearly indicate what the car¬ 
rying quality will be. 

The aim of our work in Florida dur¬ 
ing the past season has been rather more 
practical than experimental. We have 
selected certain picking gangs and pack¬ 
ing houses where we have had virtually 
full control of the different processes to 
determine if careful methods can be 
adopted on a commercial scale and to 
learn how the cost of the different pro¬ 
cesses under these conditions compare 
with the rougher methods. Chief, too, in 
our work, was a desire to know how the 
fruit handled in this improved way car¬ 
ried to market. 

♦ 

This work is not completed as yet, and 
I shall reserve until some future time the 
very encouraging results which we ob¬ 
tained. We want you to know, however, 
that it has been possible to train a pick¬ 
ing gang to do good work. It has been 
possible to eliminate much, if not all of 
the rough handling in the packing-house 
and best of all we found that fruit picked 
and packed under our own supervision 
had splendid carrying quality and held

for two weeks after reaching the market 
with surprisingly little decay. 

I should like to spend more time on 
this subject to-night but we want to take 
a long trip and study some modern meth¬ 
ods and modern machines used in pack¬ 
ing oranges. The pictures which you will 
see will not all represent ideas which you 
as orange growers of Florida can incor¬ 
porate into your business, but where this 
is true, you may find some suggestions 
which under changed conditions will be 
of service to you. 

(Following Prof. Tenny illustrated the 
different packing houses in California 
with stereopticon views which were very 
interesting and we regret we cannot show 
the pictures here.—Secretary.) 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Tenny—A statement made this 
afternoon was slightly misleading. At 
this time of the year you would see noth¬ 
ing but clean culture but lately there has 
been a tremendous tendency to allow the 
grove to become covered, and uncultivated 
the greater part of the year. 

Just now, at the beginning of your 
rainy season it is just finishing the rainy 
season in California. The land should all 
be cultivated at the present time. There 
is thorough cultivation with irrigation 
possibly once a month during the entire 
summer period while there is no rain 
whatever. It would not be surprising if 
they did not have a drop of rain for the 
next three or four months. They irri¬ 
gate very heavily when necessary and 
as soon as it is possible to harrow 
they do so and keep this ground for about 


six or eight weeks, thoroughly pulverized. 
This is continued until usually about Sep¬ 
tember; possibly October. The rains are 
beginning then but only slightly, and be¬ 
fore the rains really start in they get the 
ground in proper shape and put on a cover 
crop, mostly the velvet bean and other 
things of that kind. They come up and 
grow rather rapidly during October, No¬ 
vember and December. Then it depends 
largely on the personality of the grower, 
but usually before the ist of February 
the ground is plowed and from that time 
it is clean cultivated. 

The wet season with them happens to 
be in the winter time; in your case it is 
the summer time. They plow rather 
deeply and cultivate deeply; six or eight 
inches. 

Mr. Kilgore—-How deep is their soil? 
Very deep? 

Mr. Tenny—Very deep; 200 or 300 
feet. It is made from the wash from the 
mountains, then hard pan and sub-soil in 
places that are hard. 

I agree thoroughly with what Mr. 
Hart stated this afternoon. From his 
standpoint and from the standpoint of a 
few packers in Florida the methods that 
are pursued in California look rather 
rough. They handle an immense amount 
of business, however, and it is impossible 
to give it the same time and attention 
that a small packer can give his fruit, if 
he will. And their orange will stand 
more than the Florida orange will. But 
as an average, I think Mr Hart will agree 
with me, their methods are more careful 
than the average methods in use in Flori¬ 
da. Of course, Mr. Hart’s methods as 
well as a very few others in Florida, are 
more careful than many in California.

When we first started out in Califor¬ 
nia, in many places we found the fruit 
was elevated and allowed to run down by 
gravity through the various machines. 
This made a tremendous amount of 
rough handling. The first thought that 
presented itself to Mr. Powell and my¬ 
self was that this probably had some¬ 
thing to do with the decay. We took up 
the dropping experiments and got very 
excellent results. When we came to Flo¬ 
rida, for the moment I did not begin work 
on dropping oranges. I began to look 
for clipper cuts and found comparative¬ 
ly few, and long stems, but there were few 
of those. At the close of the first year 
we began dropping experiments and the 


results were startling. Sometimes we 
had as high as 70 per cent decay where 
oranges were dropped 18 inches, while 
oranges not dropped showed only 3 or 4 
per cent decay at the end of two weeks. 

We find there is a great deal of dif¬ 
ference shown in the effects of dropping 
on oranges. Some oranges will st? id 
a considerable amount of dropping 
while others are much more susceptible. 
It may be due to the fertilizer, climatic 
conditions; I don’t know just what it is. 
They may have a thin skin or a thick 
skin, but it is a fact that some will go to 
pieces almost immediately, while others 
will not show the effects for a much 
longer time. 


By E. H. Mote. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

In discussing this subject, I wish to re¬ 
fer to some of the problems that must be 
solved before we begin to pack the citrus 
fruits, I once heard a clergyman, 'who 
was debating the subject: “How to Read 
the Bible,” begin his oration by saying: 
“You must first have a Bible to read.” He 
■had bibles to sell. We are fruit growers 
—and I wish to emphasize the fact that 
we must first grow the right kind of fruit, 
before successful packing is possible. 

In our discussion of this question at the 
last meeting of this society, Mr. W. S. 
Hart began an excellent paper on this sub¬ 
ject by saying: “We must begin by 

proper cultivation, fertilizing, etc.” 

I would place the beginning further 
back than that. I would begin with the 
•selection of the proper locality, and the 


preparation of die soil, before a tree is 
planted, or cultivation and fertilizing be¬ 
gins. The question of drainage, manage¬ 
ment of subsoil, to insure the necessary 
circulation of air among the root system 
of the tree during the growing season is 
the surest foundation for successful culti¬ 
vation that will insure the production of 
a class of fruit that will have all the excel¬ 
lent qualities of pulp and rind necessary 
to successful packing of fruit that will 
carry well, and command a price at destin¬ 
ation. 

I recall a personal experience, some 
years ago, when I bought the fruit in two 
groves, aggregating some eleven thou¬ 
sand boxes, which broke down and began 
rotting before I could get it out of the 
packing house. One evening I left the cov¬ 
er off of fifty boxes, and found, next 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


41 


morning, an average of ten to the box that 
were already showing signs of immediate 
decay. To all outward appearance, the 
fruit was perfect—but there was a radical 
defect in production that made it impossi¬ 
ble to get it to market in good shape—even 
by the most painstaking care in handling. 

I also call to mind that a few years ago 
—in the neighborhood where my own 
grove is located, that the fruit “creased” 
so badly that a large percent was lost. The 
fruit now produced in both the localities 
referred to, has been improved by proper 
fertilizing, drainage and cultivation, so 
that no difficulty is experienced in putting 
it into market. Of course when a grove 
is already planted and in bearing, these 
precautions cannot be taken in advance; 
but, even then, much Can be done to re¬ 
move the evil, by looking well to the 
cause; and, as far as possible, remedy the 
natural defects in the soil; so as to bring 
the fruit into the packing house in a pos¬ 
sible condition to be benefited by good 
packing. In this connection I wish to call 
your attention, to the fact that there is a 
promising outlook for the successful culti¬ 
vation of the lemon in Florida. We have 
all the congenial environments for this 
valuable citrus fruit, that can be found in 
any country now producing the lemon 
commercially. 

My own experiments in its growth— 
while not sufficiently extensive to make a 
hard-and-fast opinion expedient; yet, I 
have produced some samples of this fruit 
that are, to say the least, very encourag¬ 
ing. It will be remembered that in Cali¬ 
fornia the early efforts to cultivate the 
lemon promised to be a total failure—not 
because the natural conditions zverc zmnt- 


ing, but simply because the growers there 
did not know how. 

The present value of the lemon groves, 
now in that State, shows conclusively that 
it pays to learn how; to so combine the 
natural advantages which we have in 
abundance with the habits, of this fruit, 
in order to> make its cultivation here very 
profitable. I believe it will be as easy for 
us to succeed with the lemon in the near 
future, as it has been to succeed with the 
grapefruit in the recent past. It may, 
perhaps, be properly said that the keynote 
to successful packing and shipping may 
simply be in “knowing how.” We cer¬ 
tainly have much yet to learn as well as 
considerable to unlearn. We are fast learn¬ 
ing the fundamental principles of culti¬ 
vation, and are making rapid strides in 
producing the quality of fruit that can 
be successfully put into profitable mar¬ 
kets ; and, it only remains for us to learn 
the detail of the most perfect method in 
harvesting and packing. Just in this con¬ 
nection I wish to say that want of proper 
sanitation in harvesting, is a matter that 
we are too apt to overlook—especially 
when we consider the class of labor we 
are compelled to employ. 

Who has not seen the evidence of this 
in the eggplant, exposed for sale in our 
own home markets; where the print of ev¬ 
ery finger that touched the fruit in hand¬ 
ling, was marked by a decayed spot, due 
to the perspiration of the ungloved hand 
of the employes, in harvesting, for 'home 
use. Is it not possible that the same cause 
contributes to the breaking down of the 
citrus fruits in transit? Some of our thin 
rind fruit may be as susceptible to injury 
from this cause, as the smooth rind of the 
eggplant. 









42 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


One of the principal evils of our present 
system of packing and shipping is the 
want of uniformity. This is evidenced in 
every department of our industry. 

It is just as important that we should 
have a uniform system, as it is necessary 
for the railroads to have a uni¬ 
form gage for their tracks. Who 
does not remember the embarrass¬ 
ment and inconvenience that grew out of 
the “broad gage,” “standard gage” and 
“narrow gage” of former rival railroads. 
There must be—above all—a uniform 
standard of shipping boxes, applicable 
alike to every State in the union produc¬ 
ing the citrus friuts. 

The size of the California box is 
ii i-2xi i 1-2x26, slats 26 inches by 3 
while the size of the box in general use in 
Florida is 12x12x26 1-2, making a differ¬ 
ence of 12 per cent, in favor of the Cali¬ 
fornia box. This is a discrimination 
against Florida fruit, and the general pub¬ 
lic are not educated to note the difference. 

To them, a box of oranges, is a box of 
oranges—without a thought of the fact 
that one contains more than another. 
There seems now to be a willingness on 
the part of our Congress to establish a 
uniform package for many of the fruits 
entering into interstate commerce. The 
influence of every member of this as¬ 
sociation should be exerted to the utmost, 
to have the packages for marketing the 
citrus fruits included in this legislation; 
and every section engaged in the business 
should be compelled to use a package of 
the same cubical contents—or if any sec¬ 
tion persists in using a package below the 
standard, they should be marked, “short” 
when used in interstate commerce. 

There should be uniformity in the hand¬ 


ling and marketing of fruit, which in¬ 
volves central packing houses in different 
well defined, sections. 

These separate, district, packing houses 
should at least be under a single advisory 
head; so as to maintain, as far as possible, 
uniformity and co-operation in grading 
for each district. 

Perhaps these may be considered Uto¬ 
pian conditions in the present chaotic con¬ 
ditions of the fruit industry of Florida; 
but, my experience of one year in Cali¬ 
fornia, fully convinced me that it is im¬ 
perative—that substantially the same sys¬ 
tem*—as used in California—must, sooner 
or later, be introduced here. 

I venture to predict, in advance of the 
report of the committee lately returned 
from that State, that their recommenda¬ 
tions will be along this line. 

Along the line of shipping early fruit 
I wish to point out the great harm to our 
industry by unscrupulous buyers and 
growers shipping our late varieties under 
the brand and name of our earliest va¬ 
rieties. This is a palpable fraud and 
should, if possible, be regulated by the 
police powers of the State—making it a 
misdemeanor for any one to ship the im¬ 
mature and unripe late varieties under 
the name of the earliest varieties. It is a 
fact, well known to all growers, that we 
have early oranges that will go on the 
market in a fairly ripe and palatable con¬ 
dition as early as October, but it is unfair 
to the consumer, as well as very detri¬ 
mental to the grower, to* have the imma¬ 
ture, unripe, and sour fruit, of the latest 
varieties, hastily colored by artificial 
means, and offered to the Thanksgiving 
trade as an average sample of Florida 
oranges. Of course no* reputable grow-

er will do so himself, but do not many of 
our growers who sell their fruit on the 
trees, know that this will be done ? 

In the present condition of orange 
growing it is, perhaps, unavoidable that 
we should have oranges of several degress 
of excellence—good, bad and indifferent. 
The uniform influence of this society 
ought to be earnestly directed to educate 
the northern jobber to discriminate be¬ 
tween the varieties; and the degree of 
maturity at the different seasons; so that 
equal quality from any section of the 
State will command uniform prices. Per¬ 
haps, in time, this may be, to some extent, 
regulated by the shippers being compelled 
to ship the lowest grades of fruit in bulk, 
as the continued advance of box material 
will soon make it much cheaper to- pre¬ 
pare cars for bulk shipment than to pack 
them in costlier boxes. 

In my opinion the shipping of our fruit 
can be much facilitated, and more advan¬ 
tageously distributed, by selling F. O. B. 
Fruit will then move only on demand, 


and the section that can most quickly and 
Cheaply supply the desired quality; will, 
most likely, get the order. Consignment 
to unknown markets ought to be discour¬ 
aged ; as fruit so consigned, always comes 
in direct competition with purchased 
fruit; to the injury of bona fide buyers. 
It is quite certain that the great majority 
of responsible solicitors wou.ld prefer to 
become F. O. B. buyers, if selling were 
more general, and the grades made per¬ 
fectly reliable. In time all the best grades 
would be sold at the packing house, and 
only the inferior grades—from poor 
handling—‘would go forward on consign¬ 
ment. 

In conclusion, I want to urge the im¬ 
portance of neatness and scrupulous sani¬ 
tation in every department. Clean hands, 
clean picking boxes; bright, well seasoned 
packing boxes—clean, sanitary cars for 
carrying the fruit to market—for it is a 
commercial fact, that if you please the 
eye you touch the pocket book. 

“So mote it be.” 


By S. C. Warner. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

At the last meeting of this society we 
had reports from your committee on the 
subject before us that were extremely 
valuable and I can add but little to their 
suggestions. Permit me, however, to 
quote from a recent article by one who is 
an authority: 

“Harvesting—This is one of the most 
absorbing subjects of the day and de¬ 
mands the most thorough and careful in¬ 
vestigation and thought, followed by the 


most energetic action upon the part of 
every one engaged in the fruit industry. 
Our careless handling is costing the state 
thousands, yea, hundreds of thousands of 
dollars every year. I make the assertion 
that fully 90 per cent of the Florida fruit 
that arrives in market in bad order is at¬ 
tributed to careless clipping and careless 
handling. 

“All of us flatter ourselves that we are 
taking extra pains and doing better than 
our neighbors and if our fruit does not

reach its destination sound the fault lies 
with the transportation companies and not 
with us; when, if the truth were known 
fully one-fourth of our oranges wtere 
either punctured by the clippers, scratched 
by the fingernails or bruised by dropping, 
jamming against ladders, pouring into 
field boxes, the rough treatment by team¬ 
sters and emptying and piling into hop¬ 
pers and falling from the sizers into the 
bins.” This from Dr. Inman. 

It is an inconsistency not easily ex¬ 
plained why we expend so much labor 
and money in the production of a crop 
which receives such meagre attention in 
its preparation for market as do our cit¬ 
rus fruits. 

We have, no doubt, sometimes ques¬ 
tioned the inherent quality of our oranges 
to “stand up” but are not the causes of de¬ 
cay—at least in great measure—our own 
lack of careful, intelligent, systematic 
work. 

Weather conditions, when fruit is pick¬ 
ed, must be right. This, I regard as one of 
the important factors in successful ship¬ 
ping. Oranges should not be picked when 
the fruit hanging on the trees shows de¬ 
cay to any considerable extent, even when 
split or thorned. It is apt to be very in¬ 
convenient to lay off the hands at such a 
time but if the work is persisted in the 
results are pretty sure to be very unsatis¬ 
factory. Simple wetness, as from dew, is 
not important but if the degree of humid¬ 
ity is such that the decay of the fruit on 
the trees is very noticeable, decay of the 
packed fruit, even where care is otherwise 
used, is apt to result. 

The Somer-Hart clippers I like better 
than any dthers that I have used. They 
cut a clean, short stem and with ordinary 


care, clipper-cutting and scratching is 
avoided. 

As a receptacle for the picked fruit 
the sack should be avoided. The basket 
or can, with a perfectly smooth surface 
inside is very much safer, avoiding the 
pressure of the body of the workman, 
thorning and bruising. 

The grove box should be carefully 
made, every edge which can come into 
contact with the fruit being rounded and 
sandpapered. Its capacity should not 
much exceed three pecks, and the top 
slat being two inches below the top of 
the end, which we make in panel. The 
willow splint baskets, used by grocers, 
make a very desirable field crate, afford¬ 
ing excellent ventilation and being light 
to handle. 

In delivering the fruit to the washer or 
brushing machine it should not be piled 
more than two deep in the hopper—better 
only one layer. In emptying the field 
crate a canvas cover should be drawn 
over the top, one edge being fastened to 
the bottom of the hopper, and the fruit 
can then be poured out without bumping 
and bruising. 

Cleaning fruit adds to its attractive¬ 
ness and quite possibly to its keeping 
quality, if done with proper care. There 
must be no abrasion of the skin nor rup¬ 
turing of the cells from pressure. This, 
of course, would be fatal. 

Sorting is one of the most important 
packing house operations and should have 
the greatest care. Cull fruit should never 
pass the sorter. It would be extremely 
desirable if the different grades could be 
so standardized that it would not be a 
matter of mere whim or individual opin¬ 
ion as to what constitutes a “fancv” 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

‘ ‘choice bright” and so on. This will, 
perhaps be one of the benefits of the new 
marketing system which I devoutly hope 
will materialize. 

As the fruit comes into the packing¬ 
house, after it has been cleaned and sort¬ 
ed, it is desirable to have room for stor¬ 
age before sizing. If boxes are used they 
should be so made and used as to give 
the best possible ventilation to their con¬ 
tents. Rack bins are, however, better. In 
them the fruit receives unobstructed ex¬ 
posure to the air, the pores are more 
quickly closed and possible scratches 
have a better opportunity of drying and 
healing over. A few hours of this treat¬ 
ment should place the fruit in good condi¬ 
tion for packing. 

One of our most successful growers 
dispenses with packing-house curing en¬ 
tirely by letting the fruit remain out in 
the grove, after picking, for about twen¬ 
ty-four hours before hauling to the pack¬ 
ing-house. If the results of a method are 
a measure of its sucess, this is certainly a 
good one. 

With the excellent machines now in use 
there should be no trouble in sizing prop¬ 
erly. I use the latest Maull production 
and find it quite satisfactory for oranges, 
grapefruit and tangerines. 

Whether the “bulge” or flat pack be 
adopted the box should contain all the 
oranges possible without bruising. There 
is scant excuse for a slack packed box. 

I use a press, also made by Maull. 
Some sort of press, I deem very important 
as the jar to the fruit in nailing down the 
cover should be avoided. 

Whether white or manilla paper be used 
or whether there be trimming is, perhaps, 
not very important but it is pretty sure to 


be a matter of satisfaction and profit to 
make the package as attractive as possible. 
It should be a matter of pride with us, 
as it is with the California packers. 

Stenciling and stamping should be 
neat and in good taste and it is well to 
use some distinctive motto or brand, un¬ 
less we want our work for our own suf¬ 
ficient reasons, to be anonymous. 

Let me add a few “don’ts.” 

Don’t pick your fruit when you notice 
split fruit decaying rapidly on the trees. 

Don’t use a grove crate holding more 
than three pecks. 

Don’t permit a long or pointed stem 
on your fruit. 

Don’t fill your grove crate so that the 
highest orange will touch the bottom of 
the crate above when stacked. 

Don’t pick into a sack. 

Don’t pour your fruit so that it will 
fall more than one inch unless it strikes 
a cushion. 

Don’t permit a sharp point or edge in 
crate or bin where it can come into con¬ 
tact with the fruit. 

Don’t permit long fingernails to be 
worn by pickers or packing-house men. 

Don’t permit jolting when the fruit is 
being hauled. 

With regard to artificial means of pre¬ 
venting decay, fumigation in the car has 
not been found to give good results. In 
some cases a spray or bath of ammoniacal 
solution of copper carbonate or bisulphate 
of soda has been efficient. 

There is one point that we cannot too 
much emphasize, the value of reputation; 
not only our individual reputation but the 
reputation of the Florida fruit generally. 
You are aware how sensitive the market 
is, how quickly there is depression when

fruit is arriving in bad order, how quick¬ 
ly buyers turn to some other source of 
supply. 

We are all, to a considerable extent, de¬ 
pendent on each other for the popularity 
of our fruit, and in this connection there 
is one question I would ask you to con¬ 
sider : Whether the reputation of Florida 
citrus fruits has not suffered from the 
practice of selling on the tree, leaving the 
picking and packing as well as marketing 
to parties who have an interest only in 
the selling of that particular crop and not 
in the reputation of the fruit in a general 
way and which is dependent on careful 


selection as to maturity and proper hand¬ 
ling generally. Is not the manner in which 
much of our fruit is handled by buyers 
seriously detrimental to us? Having no 
further interest than getting results from 
that one crop, depending on the incident 
of good weather to delay decay which will 
ultimately result from careless handling, 
perhaps deferring it till the fruit has 
gone into the hands of the retailer, who 
suffers in consequence and then makes us 
suffer later. 

Is it not a fact that this practice has 
a very far reaching effect on the reputa¬ 
tion and popularity of our citrus fruits? 


Efforts to Secure Better Shipping Facilities 

and Rates. 


By B. J. C. Chase. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

It is recognized that we have entered 
upon an era of economy all over the 
world. The factor of shipping facilities 
and freight rates is important in the cost 
of an article to the consumer. The less 
value there is in an article the greater 
the importance of the element of freight 
cost. We do not undertake to say that 
the rates in general are too high or too 
low. All we ask is a square deal and 
equitable rates compared with other sec¬ 
tions. Rates that are given to other sim¬ 
ilarly situated localities producing com¬ 
modities that are marketed in competition 
with ours. This is a very complex 
question and we do not undertake to pass 
judgment on whether general freight 
rates are too low or too high. We merely 
say that when rates are established, Flor¬ 
ida and Florida products are entitled to 
equitable consideration. 

The Florida Fruit and Vegetable 
Shippers’ Protective Association was or¬ 
ganized in Jacksonville, Fla., January 30, 
1907, by Florida growers and shippers 
upon a call issued by the Gainesville Melon 
Growers’ Association to co-operate in the 
establishment of carload rates and car¬ 
load minimums on Florida vegetables to 
eastern markets. The purpose of the or¬ 
ganization was afterwards changed to se¬ 


cure more equitable rates of transporta¬ 
tion to all markets on all Florida fruits 
and vegetables, material and supplies per¬ 
taining thereto and to otherwise protect 
the interests of the fruit and vegetable 
growers and shippers of the State of 
Florida. 

Investigation developed the fact that 
Florida fruits and vegetables were called 
upon to meet constantly increasing com¬ 
petition from like commodities from 
Cuba, Jamaica and Porto Rico, Califor¬ 
nia, Mississippi and other states market¬ 
ing competitive products at the same time. 
Upon comparing rates it was found that 
these like commodities grown elsewhere 
were favored with lower freight rates 
whether based upon the package or upon 
the hundred weight and whether trans¬ 
ported by water, by rail and water, or by 
all-rail. 

At the time of the formation of this 
association Florida rates had been in ef¬ 
fect between twenty and thirty years and 
little or no effort had been made during 
that time to better conditions. While 
carload rates and carload minimums were 
in effect to western markets no carload 
rates or carload minimums (except on 

cantaloupes) were in effect to eastern 
markets. In spite of the alleged water 
competition, rates were and still are high- 



48 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


er in proportion to the haul to the east 
than to the western markets. For in¬ 
stance : 

It costs 53j4c to ship a crate of toma¬ 
toes from Palmetto, Fla., to Chicago, 
Ill., a distance of 1,384 miles, while the 
transportation charges on a crate from 
Palmetto, Fla., to Boston, Mass., are 69c 
covering a distance of 1,449 m il e s, al¬ 
though Boston is supposed to receive the 
benefit of competitive rates by water. 

Crystal Springs, Miss., can ship a 
crate of tomatoes to Chicago (a distance 
of 763 miles) for 26c and to Boston 
(a distance of 1,773 m il es ) for 39/4 c or 
2914 c per crate less than from Palmetto, 
Fla., although the Crystal Springs crate 
travels 323 miles more than the crate 
from Palmetto to Boston. 

Like discrimination was found to exist 
against practically all Florida fruits and 
vegetables when compared with freight 
charges on the same products grown else¬ 
where and going into the same markets. 

Comparative statements were submitted 
to the Traffic Departments of the Florida 
transportation companies showing freight 
rates 011 Florida perishable products, and 
similar products grown elsewhere, to the 
principal markets of the country and ef¬ 
forts were made to arrive at an amicable 
adjustment of the differences in order to 
put Florida fruits and vegetables on an 
equal footing in the markets of the coun¬ 
try. 

It is to be regretted that those in con¬ 
trol of the Florida transportation com¬ 
panies failed to meet the growers and 
shippers in a spirit of fairness or to show 
the slightest desire to encourage and pro¬ 
mote Florida fruit and vegetable indus¬ 
tries. As a last resort, the association 


was compelled to file a complaint before 
the Interstate Commerce Commission and 
the case was heard in Washington, D. C., 
continued and completed in Jacksonville, 
Fla. Under the decisions and orders of 
the Interstate Commerce Commission 
Florida growers have made the following 
substantial gains in freight rates: 

ORANGFT, GRAPEFRUIT AND PINEAPPLES. 

On all-rail shipments to Atlantic sea- 
coast and interior eastern markets, in a 
territory bounded on the west by Pitts- 
burg and Buffalo and east including the 
New England States, the carriers are re¬ 
quested to establish carload rates with 
a minimum of 300 boxes or crates and 
rates have been reduced from 4C2C as 
high as fifteen (15) cents per box and 


per crate as follows: 

Baltimore, reduced from.47 y 2 c to 43c 

Philadelphia, reduced from. 48y 2 c to 44c 

New York, reduced from. 50y>c to 46c 

Boston, reduced from.59c to 51c 

Buffalo, reduced from.60.8c to 53c 

Pittsburg, reduced from.60.4c to 52c 

Providence, reduced from.59c to 51c 


VEGETABLES. 

The reduction by the commission on 
shipments of vegetables via rail and water 
to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York 
and Boston is five cents (5c) per crate of 
fifty pounds, which is a reduction from 
the old rates of fifteen to twenty-five per 
cent. On cabbage and potatoes via rail 
and water the rates have been reduced 
as follows: 

Cabbage— To Baltimore, Philadelphia 
and New York reduced from 54c to 44c 
and to Boston from 63c to 52c per barrel 
or barrel crate of 120 pounds. 

Potatoes— To Baltimore, Philadel¬ 
phia and New York reduced from 60c 10 
50c and to Boston from 70c to 60c per 











FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


49 


barrel or per barrel crate of 185 pounds. 
The all-rail rate to Boston was reduced 
from 53c to 49c per crate of 50 pounds, 
and from $1.06 to 98c per barrel. 

Strawberries —The minimum load¬ 
ing of two hundred crates at the rate of 
$1.80 per crate from Starke and Lawtey 
to New York was reduced to a minimum 
of one hundred and seventy-five crates. 

The above rates have been in effect 
during the past shipping season and will 
be instrumental in saving hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to Florida growers. 

During the past season, we estimate 
that 4,429 cars of oranges and grapefruit 
passed through the Potomac yards to mar¬ 
kets supplied through that gateway upon 
which there was a saving of over $100,- 
000. 

We have every reason to believe that a 
great saving will be made to the pine¬ 
apple growers on all-rail shipments into 
the same territory although the volume 
of the pineapple shipments will not ag¬ 
gregate as many carloads as the orange 
shipments. Even if no further concessions 
are had these reductions mean much to 
the Florida growers. 

I11 addition to the reductions in rates 
this association has also been instrumental 
in securing consideration from the trans¬ 
portation companies in the matter of di¬ 
verting cars in transit and protecting 
through carload rates in order to avoid 
over supplying one market and leaving 
other markets comparatively bare. 

Transportation companies have also 
withdrawn altogether, and modified, 
other objectionable clauses that inter¬ 
fered with the proper distribution of 
Florida products. 

At the suggestion of this association, 


the Florida East Coast Railway has in¬ 
serted in its tariff a clause providing for 
the shipment of mixed carloads of fruits 
and vegetables making the carload rate on 
each commodity apply and we feel rea¬ 
sonably assured that other transportation 
companies operating in Florida will fol¬ 
low the lead of this road. This will en¬ 
able Florida growers and shippers to 
place mixed cars of Florida products in 
the small markets of the country that 
are not in a position to handle to advant¬ 
age a straight car of the different com¬ 
modities. 

In its report the commission stated 
that “all-rail rates on vegetables were too 
high.” It suggested that the Florida rad- 
roads put into effect to Atlantic sea coasts 
and interior eastern markets an all-rail 
minimum carload and all-rail rates from 
Florida base points approximately as fol¬ 
lows : 

33c per crate of 50 lbs. to Baltimore . . .now 40c 

34c per crate of 50 lbs. to Philadelphia .now 41c 

36c per crate of 50 lbs. to New York . . .now 43c 

42c per crate of 50 lbs. to Boston .now 49c 

with corresponding rates to interior points. 

The Interstate Commerce Commission 
also stated that “in their opinion rates on 
oranges to the west from Florida ought 
to be less perhaps to the Ohio River 
points and ought to be less from Ohio 
River points to destination, and ought 
not to be higher on the average than rates 
from California.” In event the carriers 
do not put reduced rates into effect the 
Commission’s attention may be called to 
the matter later on.” 

As the transportation companies have 
failed to act upon the suggestions of the 
Commission, the Association has filed an 
amended complaint covering vegetable 
rates and minimums under ventilation and

refrigeration to eastern markets, and 
rates on oranges, pineapples and vege¬ 
tables into markets north of the Ohio and 
west of the Mississippi Rivers. 

Please understand that we are not ask¬ 
ing for lower rates on Florida products 
compared with rates from other sections 
but only want to be permitted to go into 
the markets of the country on an equal, 
or the same, basis as competitive products 
produced elsewhere. We have confidence 
in the merits of Florida products winning 
out with a fair profit to the producer, pro¬ 
vided they are not badly handicapped and 
discriminated against in the way of 
freight and refrigeration charges. 

At the present time the Florida, pine- 
apple growers are treated to an object 
lesson in preferred attention and expedit¬ 
ed service given to Cuban pineapples at 
a time when Florida pineapples and Cu¬ 
ban pineapples are moving into the mar¬ 
kets of the country in open competition. 

Is it fair that a product produced with 
American labor should have to pay a 
higher freight rate over the same rails 
and on a shorter haul to reach the Amer¬ 
ican markets than a product produced by 
cheap foreign labor? The rate on Cuban 
pineapples (in crates) from Havana to 
Chicago, via Knights Key, is 66 * 4 c per 
crate with a minimum of 250 crates per 
car while the rate on a crate of Florida 
pineapples from Miami, Fla., to Chicago, 
with a minimum carload of 300 crates, is 
92.6c per crate or a greater charge of 
26 cents per crate, or $78 a car more on 
Florida pineapples for a shorter haul by 
nearly 250 miles than on Cuban pineap¬ 
ples. The same railroads are giving the 
Cuban pineapples special attention and 
running special trains through to Chi¬ 


cago on a schedule of 2^ days whereas 
it takes a car of Florida pineapples, mov¬ 
ing over the same route, from Miami to 
Chicago anywhere from five (5) to eight 
(8) days. When you take into consider¬ 
ation the fact that Cuban pineapples cost 
less to produce and less to ship than Flor¬ 
ida pineapples the outlook is not encour¬ 
aging for the Florida growers. Under 
the circumstances, it is not surprising 
that the Florida grower feels that he :s 
not getting a square deal. 

While this association was not formed 
to handle the tariff on Florida products, 
it was called upon to do so. Members of 
the association appeared before the Ways 
and Means Committee and filed briefs on 
Florida fruits and vegetables. The pres¬ 
ent duty of one cent (ic) a pound on 
citrus fruits will undoubtedly be con¬ 
firmed in the pending tariff bill* but it 
looks doubtful if the pineapple growers 
would receive the protection they are 
entitled to. Strong pressure has been 
brought to bear from the importers and 
canners of Cuban pineapples and it does 
not look hopeful for Florida pineapple 
growers, who are asking for a duty of 
y 2 z per pound on Cuban pineapples. 

In closing, let me request closer co¬ 
operation amongst the Florida growers in 
questions pertaining to the general good 
of all interests. It is not fair that the bur¬ 
den be borne by a few and not shared 
by all. In California the growers au¬ 
thorize the marketing organizations to de¬ 
duct a fraction of a cent per package from 
all products shipped as individual contri¬ 
butions toward a general fund to be used 
in securing equitable freight rates, proper 
tariff and correcting abuses and bettering 
conditions. 


Irrigation. 


By A. H. Bourlay. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I have been appointed to give an ad¬ 
dress on irrigation. My experience in this 
line is limited to the overhead system on 
vegetables. This is a more expensive 
system; to install than some others, and 
has not the advantage of drainage as well 
as irrigation which the subirrigation sys¬ 
tem has. I believe the subirrigation is by 
far the most preferable where it is prac¬ 
tical. 

Our land being a clay with only a few 
inches of top soil, we cannot lay tiling deep 
enough to allow cultivation, and when laid 
in the clay the water will not spread out 
through the soil, a few feet on each side 
only being dampened. 

We tried flooding but soon found 
where there was much fall our ground 
was washed and in small dips and hollows 
too much water collected and the crops 
were damaged more than by drought, 
where other spots did not get enough. 

Overhead or sprinklers would also have 
to be used where the subsoil of clay or 
marl is too deep down to hold the water 
and cause it to spread. 

With us no artesian water can be had 
and where clear water from the lakes is 
not available wells have to be sunk. I say 
clear because if the supply contains seeds 
or floating particles one has to use strain¬ 
ers, and strainers in the pipes cut down 


pressure and if strained at source of sup¬ 
ply, I find the strainers are continually 
clogged as the current draws everything 
towards them. With wells this trouble 
does not occur. We get water at a depth 
of 90 feet and upward but several wells 
have been sunk over 200 feet and no wat¬ 
er obtained, so it is as well to- be sure of 
water before doing anything. The amount 
of lift and location of supply being im¬ 
portant factors in the amount of power 
needed to get pressure. When buying an 
engine it is economy to get one larger than 
you think you will need; an engine not 
run to its full capacity will last longer and 
give better satisfaction, and allow for ex¬ 
tensions. With plenty of power so as to 
get 30 to 40 pounds to the square inch and 
nozzles two and one-half to three feet 
apart on the laterals, every forty-eight 
feet apart thorough wetting can be given 
in a few hours and followed, in a few 
days by a working, is better than frequent 
light wetting for vegetables. Sometimes 
one soaking is enough to make a crop, 
whereas without it there would have been 
a failure. 

The lay of the plant depends largely on 
the shape of the ground to be irrigated; 
one wants to have the rows or beds run 
with the fall of the land and the laterals 
should run the same way that it is the 
most desirable to run the rows or beds. 



52 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


We use live oak posts eight feet long* 
which place our lateral lines six feet 
overhead. The main can be overhead or 
laid underground with i 1-2 or 2-inch 
uprights to connect with laterals. It is 
possible to use the same lateral lines on 
both sides of the main by having the miain 
running through the center of the field. 
One of my neighbors has done this; it only 
taking himself and one man two days to 
move and set up two acres, thereby ir¬ 
rigating four acres with little more ex¬ 
pense than two. We use centrifugal 
pumps, as they give a steady pressure, but 
I know that others give good satisfaction. 


We find it best to water late in the aft¬ 
ernoon and at night, the water has time to 
soak in and there is no danger of scalding. 
It is thought that lake or pond water is 
preferable to well water, but I have not 
found this to be the case, there being no 
difference only with well water there is 
not the danger of the nozzles being 
stopped up by vegetable matter, etc. 

The cost per acre for pipe, posts, noz¬ 
zles, etc., is about $75; to this must be 
added cost of engine, water supply and 
main, which is governed by the number of 
acres. The larger the plant the less the 
cost per acre. 


By W. F. Holmes. 


Mr. President t Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The subject of irrigation in Florida 
presents a most interesting study. The 
different varieties of soil, the location and 
the source of supply form, the principal 
parts of this study. I shall only be able 
to touch upon this subject from an expe¬ 
rience with the flowing wells and a sys¬ 
tem that while in use in some districts, 
does not employ the same means of con¬ 
struction. Practical and (cheap has it 
proven to be. The expense of irrigation 
with any system, is no small matter and we 
are all interested in learning* of a cheaper 
way. 

A comparatively small area in Florida 
furnishes flowing wells. 

Quoting from Bulletin No. 1 of the 
Florida Geological Survey: 

There are two principal artesian areas : 
the East Coast area and the Southern 
Gulf Coast area. Flowing wells on the 


East Coast have been obtained as far 
south as Palm Beach, although the water 
in the well at this last locality was too salty 
for use. Flowing wells at or near the sea 
level have been obtained along the Pin¬ 
ellas Peninsula. 

The conditions which exist in central 
Florida are not favorable for obtaining 
flowing wells. The crest of the anticline 
lies not far from the center of the penin¬ 
sula. The dip from the crest is most rap¬ 
id to the east. Under these conditions 
pressure sufficient to cause a flow along 
the side of the anticline would result from 
the presence of an overlying relatively im¬ 
pervious stratum acting as a confining 
agent and preventing the escape of the 
water. 

The springs of Florida are famous for 
their volume of flow as well as for the 
clearness and beauty of their water and 
the beautiful scenery about them,. Many 
of these springs are used as health re-

sorts. The United States Geological Sur¬ 
vey volume on Mineral Resources reports 
the sale of mineral waters in Florida for 
1907 as 43,430 gallons, valued at $12,378. 

So much for supply. Now for the ap¬ 
plication. 

The system known as the Sanford sys¬ 
tem of subirrigation is the one in use here 
in Daytona and the one of which I wish to 
speak. The well or source of supply is 
turned into a main running across the 
field and at intervals of 25 feet the main 
is tapped by a head box furnishing an 
outlet for the water into a lateral laid 
with two or three-inch clay or cement 
tile. This lateral leading to the op¬ 
posite side of the field to a drain ditch, 
at which point stop boxes are set and by 
plugging the tile in the stop box the land 
could be very quickly wet enough for any 
purpose. During a wet season the water 
is turned off and the laterals open, which 
acts as drainage equally as well as for ir¬ 
rigation. If this does not furnish a per¬ 
fect system of irrigation I have never seen 
one. The land should be nearly level, if 
it is not the rows of tile 25 feet apart 
should be put in parallel with the slope 
so that the lower end should be only a few 
inches to the 100 vards lower than when 
the water is turned in. The water supply 
being at the highest point and by gravity 
running through the entire system and 
discharging into the drainage ditch at the 
lowest. The supply of water can be reg¬ 
ulated so as to irrigate the entire field 
at one time or confined to a single row 
of the tile or as many as desired. This 
makes it possible to grow in the same field 
a variety of crops, though some may re¬ 
quire a very wet soil and other the oppo¬ 
site. 


Where the field is only part level, one 
part being lighter and dryer soil a set of 
boxes may be placed between the ditch 
and the main at the line of demarkation, 
thus furnishing a supply to the level place 
without injury to the land and wetter 
part. 

We found it of advantage to run deep 
furrows in planting to come between and 
in the center of the 25 feet rows of tiling, 
making the field into beds, this in case of 
heavy rains provided another means of 
draining off the water. The advantage of 
being able to use the system to water a 
seed bed very wet and another bed com¬ 
paratively dry, can be appreciated at a 
glance and 1 the two dangers to farming, 
too much or too little water, are under en¬ 
tire control. 

We cannot say what the value of this 
system would be when applicable to other 
seeds and in other localities where water 
is scarce and expensive. 

One authority claim|s in addition to 
points named above that the tile drain 
carry warmth and air, or rather warm air 
to the roots of growing crops, and won¬ 
derfully quicken their growth, and that 
more than this, that the same crop has 
been grown on the same ground for a 
dozen years and with splendid results. 

Now a few words about the construc¬ 
tion and material used': Here in Daytona 
we have mostly cement. Plow and dig 
out your ditches. We have a machine 
placed in the ditch into' which we feed our 
mixture, and the tile is laid in one contin¬ 
uous piece across the field, slightly cover¬ 
ed as you gO' to hold it in place before the 
tiling hardens. Say 3 or 4 days when the 
ditch can be covered—before covering 
openings can be sawed into the tile, say 


r>4 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


every 3 feet, or as often as needed. If 
the mixture is just right, no openings 
need be made, as I have seen an opening 
made of both cement and day tile 
and watched one fill up as rapidly as the 
other when the water was turned on. 
With a supply of water, and the cement 


expense provided for, this system can be 
put iu at a less expense over clay tile of 
about 1-3 or about $100.00 per acre, every¬ 
thing hired. And with a man furnishing 
his own labor the cost can be reduced to 
figures much less scary than the average 
cost of irrigation. 


By H. B. Stevens. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When the subject of irrigation is men¬ 
tioned, to our mind at once comes the pic¬ 
ture of a large irrigation ditch, and 
ground, being flooded with water as we 
see accounts of its being done in the 
West; where their soil is firm and will 
permit of water flowing over without 
soaking in too fast. With a sigh we say to 
ourselves, but that is not for Florida. 

Yes, even that is possible in some parts 
of Florida. Other parts have sub-irriga¬ 
tion by means of tiling laid under ground, 
through which the water is turned. 

To most orange growers, the question 
is, can we have irrigation at all, when we 
cannot use ditches as is done in the West? 
If we turned to the dictionary we will find 
that the first definitions given for the 
word Irrigate, is “to water, to wet, to 
moisten, to bedew,” and surely we can do 
something along this line. Then the ques¬ 
tion at once comes, will this kind of irri¬ 
gating amount to enough to make it pay ? 

At times, yes, if applied properly and 
well followed up. When it is dry enough 
in Florida to> make watering necessary, 
and we begin to water, we must keep it up 
until sufficient rain falls to wet the ground 
deeper than we have been doing with our 


watering, otherwise the water we have 
been putting on will only serve to draw the 
fibre roots to the surface, to get the mois¬ 
ture. We stop watering, and not suffi¬ 
cient rain coming, these roots die, and our 
trees are worse off than if we had not be¬ 
gun the watering, but if the watering is 
well followed up, the benefit will show in 
the trees and crop. 

If trees are to be planted, then the irri¬ 
gating plant is very useful in pushing 
them along, and may be the saving of a 
good interest on its cost, in lessening the 
number of trees to be replaced the next 
year, so making a saving, in time, and 
cost of trees. 

If spraying is to be done the irrigating 
plant is a great help. 

If the whitefly is to be fought with fun¬ 
gus* the irrigating' plant can help to has¬ 
ten its growth by being used to moisten 
the leaves. 

The cost of piping a grove and keeping 
up a steam plant, deter many a grower 
from putting in one. To such as do not 
have to go too deep for water, I would 
recommend a plan that would lessen the 
cost. 

Instead of piping the entire grove, have 
a number of wells, at proper distances, 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


55 


and have the power and pump- mounted, 
either on a tram car, or on wheels, so it 
can be mo-ved from; well to well. Pump 
from each well, and from the pump lay a 
line of iron pipe coupled together with 
brass hose couplings, so that it can be 
coupled and uncoupled quickly without 
the use of anything but a hose spanner. To 
the end section, attach one length ot good 
'hose to- enable the water to be turned 
in any direction ; in this manner a grove 
can be very rapidly watered and at but 
little cost. 

The writer once fitted up an outfit of 
this kind that pumped from five wells and 
one pond, and watered a 125 acre grove; 
the entire cost of the outfit, did not ex¬ 
ceed $1,500 and did the work as well as 
another plant that was put in to water a 
200 acre grove and costover $12,000. 

To sum up, irrigation is not an absolute 
necessity in Florida as it is in some states, 
but can be made to serve a very good pur¬ 
pose if properly used'. 


Washington, D. C, May 8, 1909. 
Mr. E. 0 . Painter, 

Sec. State Horticultural Society, 
Jacksonville, Florida. 

My Dear Sir: 

A trip this month to the Southwestern 
States and Territories will prevent me 
from accepting your kind invitation to be 
present at the annual meeting of the Flor¬ 
ida Horticultural Society to be held at 
Daytona May 18 to 21. Our office will 
be represented by Mir. Milo B. Williams, 
who is in charge of irrigation in the hum¬ 
id regions and I trust he will be able to- 
convince your members of the necessity 
of a helpful co-operation between the 


fruit growers of Florida and the irriga¬ 
tion branch of this Department. 

Compared with the arid region the cit¬ 
rus districts of Florida have an abundant 
annual rainfall but since 'much of this is 
waste in run off during heavy down¬ 
pours, the amount which the roots of trees- 
can obtain is frequently below rather than 
above what is required. Then, too, long 
periods occur when little rain falls. The 
Weather Bureau records show that at Or¬ 
lando from November 1, 1906, to March 
31, 1907, a period of five months, the 
rainfall was only a trifle more than half 
an inch. The quantity of water required 
by the citrus orchards of Riverside, Cali¬ 
fornia, including both irrigation and rain 
water, averages about 3 inches a month. 
For the past nine years at Tampa, Flor¬ 
ida, the average rainfall during October 
and November has been only 1 1-2 inches 
per month and for more than half the 
year it is considerably below three inches 
per month. 

The preliminary investigations made 
by Mr. Williams in your State during the 
past winter have convinced him of the 
need of installing irrigation plants to sup¬ 
plement the natural rainfall and as an in¬ 
surance against crop failures during dry 
periods. The lakes, rivers and artesian 
basins of the Peninsula furnish abundant 
water supplies at low cost and the onlv 
questions that are deserving of careful 
consideration are the installation of the 
right kind of a pumping plant that will 
perform efficient service, the adoption of 
the hest distribution system when both 
economy and efficiency are the main fac¬ 
tors, and the application of water in such 
a way and by the use of such implements, 
as will best serve the objects sought.

This Office has been studying such 
questions in the West for the past ten 
years and if any of the experience thus 
gained or the data collected' will prove of 


service to your industry, we shall endeav¬ 
or to place both at your disposal. 

Respectfully yours, 

Chief' of Irrigation Investigations. 


By Prof. Milo B. Williams. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

In the advancements that are being 
made in the science of agriculture at the 
present day, the farmer is realizing more 
and more the value of being able to under¬ 
stand and control the factors entering into 
plant growth. 

Among the most important factors en¬ 
tering into plant growth is that of mois¬ 
ture, and therefore throughout the agri¬ 
cultural districts of the world a study is 
being made of moisture, its supply, and 
the demands of vegetation for moisture. 

Nature transports moisture from place 
to place on the earth’s surface, but her 
transportation service and supply is more 
or less imperfect to meet the demands of 
the up-to-date farmer. These imperfec¬ 
tions of nature can be perfected to a great 
extent by the application of one of the 
engineering sciences, drainage or irriga¬ 
tion, drainage where there is an excess 
of moisture for agricultural purposes and 
irrigation where there is a deficiency of 
moisture for agricultural purposes. 

During the past six months I have had 
an opportunity of studying the conditions 
in the state of Florida with regard to ir¬ 
rigation and I have prepared in this study 
a few charts in an attempt to picture the 
rain fall representative to Florida, so that 
I may see with you the imperfections of 


your moisture supply as given to you by 
nature. 

REFERENCE TO CHARTS. 

In referring to the charts the follow¬ 
ing points were brought out. 

Chart No. i : Showing the average 
rainfall per month froffi 1900 to 1908 
inclusive at Orlando, Florida. That the 
average rainfall for the mpnths of Novem¬ 
ber, December, January, February and 
April fell below three inches; that the av¬ 
erage rainfall for the months of March 
and October was less than four inches, 
making a period of seven months that the 
average of precipitation is light. That 
the extremes of the average monthly 
rainfall are from 1.14 inches in Novem¬ 
ber to 8.77 inches in June, bringing out 
the unevenness in distribution of the rain¬ 
fall throughout the years, as an average. 

Chart No. 2: Comparing the average 
monthly rainfall at Milan, Italy. The ob¬ 
ject in preparing this chart was to place 
before the people a picture of the precipi¬ 
tation in the district that has irrigated for 
a century so that the eye can draw a com¬ 
parison of conditions existing where ir¬ 
rigation has proven to be of value and the 
conditions existing in Florida. The most 
prominent difference in the comparison of 
Florida conditions with those of Milan, 
Italy is the unevenness of the distribution 
throughout the year in Florida, Milan 
showing a minimum of 2 1-2 inches of 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


57 


rainfall in any one month and a maxi¬ 
mum of 5 3-4 inches. 

Chart No. 3: Shewing the distribution 
of the rainfall in the year of 1908 as the 
best monthly distribution in any one year 
-since 1900. These guagings were taken at 
New Smyrna, Florida. The minimum pre¬ 
cipitation in any one month was .32 of an 
inch; the maximum was 21.49 inches with 
a total rainfall of 63.80 inches for the 
year. 

Chart No. 4: Showing the largest dry 
spell since 1900, coming in the twelve 
months between August 1, 1906 and Au¬ 
gust 1, 1907. Guagings were taken at Or¬ 
lando, Florida, September, October, Nov¬ 
ember and December, 1906, January, Feb¬ 
ruary, March, April and May, 1907, went 
below three inches of rainfall per month. 
In November and December, 1906, and in 
January, February and March, 1907, the 
total rainfall was only .53 of an inch in 
these five months. During this period Riv¬ 
erside, California, was using three inches 
of water per month to mature and set her 
orange crop. During this extreme dry 
period fruit was damaged and in some 
places almost a failure in Florida. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Temple—You state that in Cali¬ 
fornia they supplied three inches by irriga¬ 
tion. Did they put on three inches dur¬ 
ing July, August, etc., or did they vary 
the quantity applied to suit the season? 
The good Lord has varied the rain in 
Florida to suit the seasons and 1 it is during 
the dormant period with us that the dry 
spell comes while in the growing season 
there is plenty of rain, usually. What I 


mean to say is, did they supply the same 
amount of water or did they vary it to 
suit the requirements of the trees? 

Mr. Williams—They do. You may 
know better than I how their orange crop 
comes off with yours. Their trees are 
dormant nearly at the same time yours 
are. The point I wish to bring out is that 
during your dry period here they are sup¬ 
plying three inches of water per month 
to their trees. The condition of your 
trees runs somewhat parallel to those of 
Riverside. 

Mr. Member—Is it necessary for them 
to have three inches every month ? 

Mr. Williams—No, but it is necessary 
to have three inches of rainfall here when 
they are supplying the same amount there. 

Prof. Rolfs—Our trees are dormant a 
little later than their trees I think. It is 
not necessary for us to have three inches 
every month. It is more necessary that we 
have more than three inches this month 
and 1 every month when it is needed. 

Mr. Williams—We have not had time 
to study the conditions of citrus trees 
here, so we use the California irrigation 
as a basis. 

Dr.* Richardson—I think it is a good 
idea to explain to the Society the differ¬ 
ence in the seasons in California and here. 
Their rainfall comes in the winter, while 
with us the rain comes in the summer, and 
the dormant season usually comes in the 
winter. They get their rain during their 
dormant season while we get ours during 
the growing season in the summer. Con¬ 
sequently the conditions are radically dif¬ 
ferent. 

Mr. Bunch—Is three inches all that is 
necessary during any month ? 

Mr. Williams—'Approximately three 






58 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


inches of water per month is the amount 
that the records show the Riverside peo¬ 
ple use. Whether they are using too lit¬ 
tle or too much is for the horticulturalists 
to decide. 

Mr. Bunch—Those who study irriga¬ 
tion come to a proper understanding and 
knowledge and know just how much a 
tree should have for certain climatic and 
atmospheric conditions. Of course a per¬ 
son has to have a certain discretion about 
the amount of water to give to a tree and 
he must learn to judge accordingly wheth¬ 
er it has enough water or not. A young 
tree especially may be killed by using too 
much water and literally drowning it out, 
I have seen some persons who were so 
anxious to make the trees grow th&t they 
simply kept the trees soaked and the re¬ 
sults were far from satisfactory. 

Mr. Williams—The truthfulness of 
your observation has been brought out in 
arid districts very forcibly. As a matter 
of fact we always consider that after a cer¬ 
tain area has been opened up by irrigation 
that a drainage system will necessarily 
follow. One of the greatest faults of the 
farmer in the West is that if he can get 
the water he will over irrigate and under 
cultivate. 

In the question of rainfall, as to wheth¬ 
er or not irrigation is needed the total 

annual rainfall runs from fortv to sixtv 

✓ •* 

inches, but the bulk of this may come in 
just a very few months, leaving the bal¬ 
ance of the year void of moisture to sup¬ 
ply maximum plant growth. This period 
of deficiency of moisture often comes in 
and extends over the time of the year 
when it is of most vital importance that 
the orchardist have an abundance of 
moisture to insure a crop of good fruit. 


The way in which the rain comes and 
the character of the soil upon which it 
falls enter into conserving of the mois¬ 
ture. Florida receives most of her rain¬ 
fall in torrential storms, making the run¬ 
off heavy and beating down the surface 
of the ground. 

The sandy soil in the greater portion 
of the State is an aid to moisture recep¬ 
tion, but unless properly cultivated will 
prove a hindrance to the best of moisture 
retention. 

The natural resources for irrigation in 
Florida are very encouraging. Lakes, riv¬ 
ers, surface wells, artesian wells and seep¬ 
age and drainage waters furnish water 
supplies fairly well throughout the State. 
These supplies may be brought to the sur¬ 
face by pumping plants, flowing wells or 
gravity systems and then distributed to 
the orchards through piping, flumes or 
ditches. 

The methods of application must vary 
.with the varying conditions from furrows 
and checks to sprays. Sub-irrigation is 
not used extensively for orchards. 

Prof. Rolf—Is sub-irrigation not prac¬ 
tical ? 

Mr. Williams—It has been tried in 
California fora number of years. The 
greatest trouble is that the roots get into 
the pipes. However, their soil does not 
respond to lateral percolation as some of 
your soil will. 

In my short investigations in Florida I 
have noted many difficulties where at¬ 
tempts in irrigation have been made. The 
feature that strikes me most strongly is 
the great expense per acre the Florida. 
orchardist has gone to in distributing 
systems for applying water to his trees. 
It is probable that the Floridian is paying 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


59 


ten times as much per acre for his irriga¬ 
tion as the orchardist in the West. This 
is due to several interesting causes. The 
State of Florida has a soil that will not 
support water in ditches as Western soils 
will. Neither will it respond to the cheap¬ 
er methods of irrigation in all cases be¬ 
cause of its natural character. 

I have found in many places that poor¬ 
ly designed systems have been placed and 
sad engineering mistakes made, compell¬ 
ing the farmer to pay for more expensive 
material than was necessary to obtain the 
results he wished. 

The work the United States Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture wishes to do in your 
State is to make a fair comparison of the 
methods we find being used in Florida 
with the methods we find being used in 
the West and adapt the cheaper methods 
as far as possible, and modify the expen¬ 
sive methods when practicable. 

New implements for laying out and 
building ditches and cheaper water con¬ 
duits must be worked out, and laborers 
taught how to run water. It has been a 
great disappointment to many people who 
have made trips through the West and 
seen water running peacefully and smooth¬ 
ly over the surface to find that they are un¬ 
able to control water and get an even dis¬ 
tribution when trying the same methods 
in Florida. 

We feel that by co-operative work with 
your State Experimental Station and 
with individual farmers we can help you 
solve the irrigation problem! in Florida in 
a more economical way. As time goes on 
we will have more definite data to give 
you and hope to meet you with some 
pleasing results in the future. 

Mr. Member—What do vou think 

j 


of the overhead system as used in this 
State ? 

Mr. Williams—The system of over¬ 
head irrigation for citrus trees seems to 
us to be impracticable, although we are 
not prepared to condemn any system now 
being used in your state. It certainly 
seems as though there would be oppor¬ 
tunity for heavy evaporation losses and 
that there are better ways of irrigating 
than by throwing the water into the air 
and letting it come down in a large area 
on trees and earth. 

Mr. Van Dormer—How about irrigat¬ 
ing vegetables ? 

M,r. Williams—I think the people who 
are familiar with the growing of vege¬ 
tables in your State can tell you many ad¬ 
vantages in spray irrigation for vegeta¬ 
bles. However, I believe there is room 
for comparison with cheaper methods in 
many vegetable fields and 1 that more 
economical and simpler methods of appli¬ 
cation will be used after the comparison. 

Mr. Van Dormer—In our sandy soil 
there seems to be a hindrance to the ap¬ 
plication of water by letting it run on the 
surface. It will run into the soil so fast 
that it makes very little headway in the 
trench and one end of the trench will be 
soaking and the water not yet to the 
other end. 

Mr. Williams—Where the conditions 
are of that nature and it becomes abso¬ 
lutely impossible to supply water on the 
surface then you must resort to more ex¬ 
pensive methods. 

Prof. Rolfs—How far were you able 
to run water in the ditches that you made 
in the preliminary experiments? 

Mr. Williams—In our experiments we 
have not been able to obtain the head of 




60 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


water nor the body of water that we de¬ 
sired, but we ran water in furrows 600 
feet in length, getting a fairly good distri¬ 
bution where the furrows were laid out 
on a proper grade. I think, however, it is 
not advisable to run more than 400 feet 
unless ideal lay of the land would en¬ 
courage longer distances. 

Mr. Member—How much water 

were you running into the furrows? 

Mr. Williams—We were running 
about 15,000 gallons per hour and apply¬ 
ing it in three furrows. 

Mr. Gillett—-What is the nature of 
that soil, and is the ground fairly level or 
quite hilly ? 

Mr. Williams—The soil is representa¬ 
tive of that large area around Orlando. 
Just how would you classifv it. Prof. 
Rolfs? 

Prof. Rolfs—First-class pine land. 
Rather close. 

Mr. Gillett—It seems to me that in 
view of the three years drought which we 
have just passed through, this matter of 
irrigation is one of the most important 
matters which will be brought before this 
Association, and one which should be dis¬ 
cussed very thoroughly. It is of interest 
to every man who is growing citrus fruits 
as there is no doubt that every grower in 
the State has suffered more or less every 
year, but especially in the past two or 
three years because of lack of moisture. 

I have had considerable experience 
with irrigation and have tried to do what 
Prof. Williams says he is doing. I, how¬ 
ever, failed when I tried to run water in 
ditches on high pine land, and I do not 
agree with him that this method will be 
eventually adopted, as I am strongly in 
favor of a sprinkling system. When we 


tried to run water in ditches before the 
stream got far enough away from its 
source to> do any good it disappeared en¬ 
tirely, and where we put water enough in 
the ditch to carry it any great distance 
the force of the stream tore the ground 
all to pieces and it was simply impossible 
to maintain a ditch in our loose sand. 

I have seen a good deal of irrigation in 
California but it is impossible to compare 
their conditions with ours. As Dr. Rich¬ 
ardson has said, their rainy season comes 
in the winter while ours comes in the 
summer. Their soil is heavy and the 
water will percolate through it so that 
with two or three ditches between the 
rows they can thoroughly soak their land, 
which in our loose sand is an utter im¬ 
possibility. 

I have a brother in California who had 
charge for many years of a large grove, 
and I have visited him on several occa¬ 
sions and watched their irrigation meth¬ 
ods. During the growing season they 
water frequently, but along in October 
and November they take off the water 
and do not apply any more as they wish 
to keep their trees dormant, and the win¬ 
ter rains furnish all the moisture neces¬ 
sary. Their climate being much colder 
than ours the rain fall does not seem to 
affect the trees during the winter, and 
no matter how much it rains they con¬ 
tinue dormant. Just the reverse of this 
obtains in Florida, as if we have plenty 
of rain and a week or ten days of hot 
weather, the conditions for growth—heat 
and moisture, will start our trees into a 
growth which is easily caught by the 
cold. 

Judging from the methods I have seen 
employed in California and Arizona, and 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


61 


the experiments I have personally made 
in Florida, I am convinced that the only 
possible way to irrigate our groves, at least 
those located on high pine land, is by 
overhead distribution. It is, of course, at 
the start quite expensive, but I have tried 
it with hose and I know of many others 
who have done likewise and with 
very few exceptions it has been 
a failure. In the first place, hose are ex¬ 
pensive, and our experience was that they 
went to pieces in one or two years. It 
took a large number of men to operate 
this system, and it was my experience 
that just at the time we wanted to irri¬ 
gate we were very busy with other work 
and we would look at the sky and make 
up our minds that it was going to rain in 
a few days, saying to ourselves if it did 
not we would irrigate. Perhaps it might 
rain a little shower which did no good, 
and thinking that perhaps the drought 
had broken we would continue putting it 
off until when we finally decided we had 
to do it the ground had become so dry it 
took an immense amount of water to do 
any good. 

In our part of the State around Winter 
Haven, where my grove and nursery are 
located, it has been so dry for the past 
three years that on many occasions it 
would seem that the trees would burn had 
you touched a match to the leaves. I have 
often expected to see the whole crop of 
leaves drop off and while this did not 
take place and while the trees managed 
to pull through, there is no question but 
what they sustained a terrible shock from 
want of moisture, and while in this weak¬ 
ened condition insects and disease of all 
kinds are much more apt to prey upon 
the trees. 


I am figuring on putting in a system of 
irrigation in a new nursery I am starting, 
and I am adopting a plan which I think 
will be thoroughly effective. The trouble 
with most people when they start to irri¬ 
gate is that they want lots of water but 
expect to get it through small pipes, and 
invariably the pipes are altogether too 
small. I have seen as high as ten inch op¬ 
enings on a i 1-4 inch pipe, and of course 
this was an utter failure. 

The idea of irrigation it seems to me 
is to get water and plenty of it, and un¬ 
less you do this it is money thrown away. 
My plan for irrigating a ten acre tract is 
to run a 6-inch main through the center. 
My trees will 24 fee apart. I will run 
a 2 1-2 inch lateral every 48 feet and this 
will take care of a row of trees on each 
side of it necessitating but one lateral be¬ 
tween every other two rows. I will put a 
cross in this lateral opposite the trees in 
each of these two rows and run a 3-4 inch 
pipe from the lateral to within one 
foot of the tree, which will allow room for 
the growth and expansion of the trunk. I 
will then run a pipe over the top of the 
tree, putting thereon some first-class spray 
nozzle. This pipe will be six or seven feet 
high and I will wire it to a good, solid 
stake until the tree gets large enough so 
that it can be fastened to the limbs. As 
the tree grows this pipe will be extended, 
always keeping it well above the top of 
the tree. 

There will be a valve on each of these 
laterals close to the main. As many lat¬ 
erals will be opened as the pump can sup¬ 
ply with water, and as fast as the section 
covered by the opened nozzles is thor¬ 
oughly wet down these laterals will be 
closed and others opened. My engineer 


62 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


tells me that I can easily distribute one to 
one and a half inches on five acres of land 
in twelve hours, and I will expect to do 
this at night when there will be practical¬ 
ly no evaporation, and when the water on 
the leaves of the trees will not be liable 
to scald them from the heat of the sun. 

While the first cost of this plant will be 
considered exceedingly heavy it must be 
taken into consideration that it is all op¬ 
erated by one man—it is practically auto¬ 
matic. As long as the engine is kept sup¬ 
plied with gasoline and the valves on the 
laterals are kept open the water is bound 
to flow. 

I have seen groves irrigated with a hy¬ 
drant in the center of each square but this 
is objectionable because the pipes are al¬ 
ways in the way and are frequently run 
over or broken off in cultivation, and are 
badly in the way if you wish to mow the 
grove. 

There is still another advantage in this 
overhead system. As you all know, we 
are bothered more or less during dry 
spells with the red spider. Just as soon 
as the rains come, however, this pest dis¬ 
appears. Now, with the overhead sys¬ 
tem you wet the trees thoroughly and at 
the same time wet the entire ground and 
it has the same fatal effect on the spider 
as though you had the rain. 

My experience is that it is much bet¬ 
ter to wet the entire ground rather than a 
little space around the trees, because 
the roots which are outside of this little 
belt you cover must necessarily suffer. 

There was a grove at Lake Weir, 
where I formerly lived, irrigated with a 
hydrant in the center of each square. The 
trees were purchased from a relative and 
this small grove was the same age and 


size as another one when the irrigation 
plant was put in. Inside of three years 
the irrigated grove was 'bearing from 15 
to 18 boxes per tree while the other grove 
never bore over five, and the irrigated 
trees were three times as large as the oth¬ 
ers, and although standing in ordinary 
pine land the foliage was as dense and 
as daik green in color as I have ever seen 
ill the richest hammock. 

Now, it strikes me that this was a pre¬ 
fect system except, as I have before stat¬ 
ed, the hydrants are very much in the 
way, and it seems to me it is much bet¬ 
ter to have the pipe directly over the tree 
where it is entirely out of the way, and 
where the water while wetting the ground 
thoroughly at the same time washes the 
leaves, cleaning them from the dust 
which accumulates from cultivation, and 
also getting rid of the red spider. 

Mr. Henderson—I want to suggest 
another advantage of overhead spraying. 
Besides keeping out the red spider it will 
be of great benefit to our friendly fungi. 
We are beginning to depend a great deal 
in Florida on the fungi for San Jose 
Scale, whitefly, etc., and the overhead 
spraying is one of the best things to in¬ 
crease the fungi. Sometimes we have a 
long dry spell and the whitefly gets ahead 
of us. If we had the overhead system of 
spraying we could supply the moisture 
which is necessary for their best develop¬ 
ment. 

Mr. Temple—May I ask what this plan 
is going to cost per acre for pipes, power 
station, etc. ? 

Mr. Gillett—I have two or three firms 
figuring on it now and have made a few 
figures myself, but as in many other cases 
I find the “doctors disagree.” One man 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

tells me I can only run one line of my 
laterals at a time unless I shut off the 
supply so that I only get a fine mist. Oth¬ 
ers claim I can run three or four laterals 
very satisfactorily. 

The cost of a plant of this kind de¬ 
pends very largely on conditions. In the 
first place, the distance from water must 
be considered. My land is located about 
300 feet from a large lake. I am going 
to use a 6 inch main and a 50 horse power 
gasoline engine with the best pump I can 
get for the purpose. There are 40 acres 
in this tract. I am starting on ten acres 
and the best figures I have had make the 
cost in the neighborhood of $5,000.00. 
The other 30 acres, however, will cost 
very much less as the engine and pump 
with the expensive mains have already 
been paid for, and I think the cost for the 
other 30 acres will not exceed the cost of 
the first five. Roughly speaking, I expect 
it will cost about $10,000.00 to irrigate 
the whole tract. When it is done, how¬ 
ever, I will be in absolute control of grow¬ 
ing conditions. It has happened this year 
in my nursery work that we had so little 
rain it is almost impossible to make buds 
live. The trees would start from some 
light shower which we had, but before 
the bud would take the drought would 
prevail again and most of them would 
die. With the system I have outlined I 
can fertilize my ground, cultivate it 
thoroughly, and every night give it an 
inch of rain, and within a week it will be 
getting the benefit of the fertilizer, as I 
can irrigate the ten acres in two nights at 
a cost of one man’s time and not over 
$5.00 worth of gasoline, and I can well 
afford to wet it down thoroughly every 
fifteen days; and you all know that with 


a good rain every two weeks our trees 
could not possibly suffer. 

Another great advantage which I 
would accomplish would be this: Hav¬ 
ing absolute control of the moisture I 
believe I can keep the fruit from splitting 
in the fall of the year It frequently hap¬ 
pens that after the rainy season comes to 
an end we have a dry spell lasting four to 
six weeks, followed by excessively heavy 
rains. The trees have become very thirs¬ 
ty and take up this excess of moisture 
greedily with the result that within three 
or four days a great many oranges split 
and fall to the ground'. Now, if the trees 
had been given a moderate amount of wa¬ 
ter during this dry spell they would not 
have been in this thirsty condition, and 
my opinion is that they would only have 
taken a normal amount of moisture which 
would not result in loss of fruit. 

For these and many other reasons I fa¬ 
vor overhead distribution if done thor¬ 
oughly, and while the first cost is great, 
when you consider that it will last prac¬ 
tically forever and cost very little to op¬ 
erate I believe it is economy to irrigate in 
this way. 

Mr. Temple—You speak of giving an 
inch of water in a very little time ; an 
hour or so. Do you contemplate giving 
that inch of water all over your ten acres 
at one time ? 

Mr. Gillett—Not at all. The main from 
whidli the laterals start, as I have before 
stated* runs through the center of the 
ten acres dividing it into two five acre 
tracts. There will be thirteen lines of 
pipe on each five acre tract. My engineer 
tells me I can distribute 350 gallons of 
water every minute from one of these 
lines, and that this will give over an inch

of water on the land. He says I could 
open four or five lines but would lose my 
pressure and could not get more water. 
I will be entirely satisfied, however, If I 
can deliver an inch per hour, as in 
thirteen hours I could cover each of the 
thirteen lines, and by beginning about five 
or six in the evening I could finish by 
seven in the morning, and I would have 
thoroughly wet down five acres of land, 
and the next night I would repeat the op¬ 
eration. 

Mr. Temple—What is the size of the 
the uprights ? 

Mr. Gillett—One engineer said an inch 
pipe was absolutely necessary, while 
another told me that 1-2 inch pipe would 
do the work. I made an experiment myself 
using a 3-4 inch hose on my line. I then 
tried the same spray with a 1-2 inch hose 
and could see no difference in the amount 
furnished, although I had no way of cor¬ 
rectly measuring it. We all understand of 
course, that with a long stretch of 1-2 
inch pipe the friction would be tremendous 
and a great deal of force or pressure would 
be exhausted in that way. Several com¬ 
petent authorities who have figured on the 
matter say that a 3-4 inch pipe will be 
ample. Before putting in the system I 
wish to make a series of experiments and 
these should demonstrate conclusively the 
size of pipe needed. My personal opinion 
is that it is just as well to water the 26 
trees on one line thoroughly in an hour as 
it would be to put a fine mist over 100 
trees and run it four or five hours. 

Prof. Williams—What kind of pipe are 
you going to use ? 

Mr. Gillett—This matter of pipe is 
something on Which I would like to have 
some information. The dealers as a rule, 


tell you to buy galvanize.! pipe, telling 
you that it is cheaper in the end. At the 
present time pipe is cheaper than it has 
been for many years, as it is at least 22 
per cent, below the ordinary price. 

In a former irrigation plant I had some 
pipe that was under the ground eleven 
years. It was steel pipe, and before lay¬ 
ing it I painted it carefully with hot coal 
tar and when it was taken up at the end of 
eleven years it was apparently just as 
sound as when it was put down. If any¬ 
one else has had experience along* these 
lines I would like to hear from you. 

Mr. Dade—I think you will find that 
the cast iron will not rust in the ground. 

Mr. Temple—For your information on 
this pipe question I will say that I was in¬ 
terested in a series of experiments costing 
a great deal of money, and these ex¬ 
periments showed that for underground 
work where steel will last as one, wrought 
iron will last as three, and cast iron will 
last as five. Wrought iron is practically an 
impossibility today; you may buy it and 
pay for it, but you will get steel just the 
same. 

As to galvanized pipe lasting longer 
than the plain pipe, I have some galvaniz¬ 
ed on my place that has been down for 
ten years and is perfectly sound, while I 
have some, made extra heavy, that in five 
years was entirely gone. I have seen some 
black pipe painted with hot coal tar and 
care taken in its preparation and laying 
that will out last any galvanized pipe that 
can be put in. I have seen the black cast 
iron pipe painted and laid that for certain¬ 
ly nearly thirty years was in nearly as 
good condition as when put down. The 
wrought iron blackened pipe will last a 
long time, but not nearly so long as the 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


65 


cast iron pipe. Cast iron you may say 
lasts two or three times as long as the 
wrought iron. Lasting qualities are main¬ 
ly a question of putting it in place and 
proper care taken for its preservation. I 
have seen some common, cheap, spirally- 
welded pipe that was blackened and that 
must have been down fifteen or eighteen 
years, and there would be little patches 
here and there perfectly good while other 
portions had ceased even to be rust and 
had been absorbed by the ground. 

As to the size it is not a paying proposi¬ 
tion if you get less than three mch cast 
iron pipe. 

Mr. Stevens—I had an experience in 
laying steel pipe in 1890. We had to lav 
seven inch mains with three inch laterals. 

I stood up the pipe, sealing one end and 
filled it full of hot coal tar so that it 
touched every part of the interior, and 
then drained and laid away to cool. It 
coated that pipe so thoroughly that when 
the pipes were taken up ten years later 
they were sold for practically new pipe. 
The person who bought them made no 
complaint about paying a good price for 
them. I paid no attention to the outside 
whatever; only the inside. 

Mr. Temple—If you use the lake wat¬ 
er, of course that is high in tannic acid. 

Mr. Waite—All your lake waters cor¬ 
rode worse than the artesian waters, 

Mr. Temple—I have had no experience 
with the artesian waters, but I know the 
lake waters are very hard on pipes. 

Prof. Williams—What make of nozzle 
and what pressure do you have in your 
mains, Mr. Gillett? 

Mr. Gillett—I cto not know exactly 
what pressure my engineer is figuring on. 

My recollection is that he would have to 


maintain a pressure of 60 to 70 pounds. 
They had two or three nozzles there but 
I have not decided which I will use. 
The one I fancied most I do not know the 
name of. Never saw one just like it be¬ 
fore. 

Prof. Williams—Was it the Fish Tail? 

Mr. Gillett—Yes, I think it might be as 
it looks like that. 

Prof. Williams—In measuring the 
quantity of water that will come from the 
individual sprinklers, we find there is a 
great range in them and we are going to 
have some very interesting experiments. 
We will have that information out in the 
next four or five months. We measure the 
pressure at the sprinkler and measure the 
quantity of water that goes through at 
that pressure, and then measure the even¬ 
ness of the distribution under it. 

Mr. Penny—How much above the 
ground will you run your pipe? 

Mr. Gillett—That will depend upon 
how fast I can make the tree grow. 

Mr. Penny—How will you support this 
pipe ? 

Mr. Gillett—The first pipe I put in I 
will support with a strong stake driven 
down by the side of it and wire the pipe 
to it. Then as the trees throw out their 
branches I will fasten it to the tree. 

Mr. Temple—I like this plan as I think 
it is just as essential to put water on the 
leaves as it is on the ground. 

Prof. Williams—How far apart are 
your trees, Mr. Gillett? 

Mr. Gillett—They are 24 feet apart in 
squares ? 

Mir. Temple—It has been suggested 
that I ask Prof. Rolfs if it is not possible, 
in accordance with Mr. Gillett’s idea that 
he would wash the red spider off, that by 


5 











66 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


putting on strong power it would also 
wash off the honey dew of the whitefly. 

Prof. Rolfs—Yes, I think it would be 
washed off, but if you get a spray of this 
kind and get your trees in a thoroughly 
healthy condition it is going to be very 
hard on the whitefly. That nice, cool 
condition with lots of humidity in the 
atmosphere is very bad on his health. 

Dr. Richardson—Poor fellow ! 

Mr. Gillett—On behalf of the Society, 
then, I wish to ask the whitefly’s pardon. 

Mr. Meade—Has Mir. Gillett ever used 
this irrigation to protect from cold at 
night ? 

Mr. Gillett—No, sir The Bourlin Bros, 
at Citra had a big irrigation system on 
their place, using a large fire hose with a 
fire hose nozzle to distribute the water, 
and they had such power behind this 
stream that they could wash a tree out of 
the ground with it. When their trees were 
threatened in ’94 they experimented by 
spraying them. The result was that they 
had a beautiful crop of icicles. If I were 
going to use the water, however, in case 
of cold I should not care to have it above 
the trees but would prefer to have it near¬ 
er the ground. However, I wish to say in 
this connection that at Winter Haven we 
never have any cold. 

Mr. Harrington—I am a little familiar 
wjith the locality where Mir. Gillett is 
about to start his plant, and heard the dis¬ 
cussion about an inch of water on the 
ground being too much. I want to say that 
at one time we had a fall of five inches in 
one hour and fifteen minutes; ten min¬ 
utes afterwards there was practically no 
water in sight. 

Mr. Mead—I had an acre of young 
trees covered in and nozzles that threw 


water in a circle 40 feet in diameter. I 
found I could keep the temperature up to 
48 or 50 degrees when it was below freez¬ 
ing outside when it was covered up tight. 
However, the draw bars gave away at one 
corner where the cold could come in and 
the result was a crop of ice the next morn¬ 
ing. I took a photograph of this and the 
next week took another showing not a 
leaf or fruit in the enclosure. I think I am 
the only man who made anything out of 
that freeze, for I sent photographs up to 
an editor and he sent me a check for them 1 . 

Mr. Hart—I would like to inquire as 
to the effect of artesian water on the soil; 
whether it is injurious or not. At Day¬ 
tona they have been using artesian water 
for thirty years. I know about fifteen 

or twenty years ago Mr. -gave up 

the use of it and quite a number of others 
along the coast gave up the use and are 
using fresh water. It is long enough now 
for them to get results and I would be 
glad to hear from you. 

Miss White—I would say that artesian 
water is mighty good for crops. My fath¬ 
er had a good deal of experience along 
the East Coast and when we went to 
Hastings he said “Let’s take this little 
patch of ground and drive artesian wells 
and when we plant our Irish potatoes in 
December the first time it comes off cold, 
we will turn on the water and save our 
potatoes. Well, the cold wave came and 
we turned on the water and covered the 
field entirely with water. We kept it on 
for two days. The results were that there 
was a nice crop of potatoes in the adjoin¬ 
ing field. 

Dr. Van Dormer. I have had no prac¬ 
tical experience with artesian water here. 
Artesian water is usually hard water; 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that means it has in solution quite a quan¬ 
tity of mineral matter such as lime, so¬ 
dium and other salts. However, there is 
one great danger which I can anticipate 
in this sulphurated water. The sulphur 
in the water might become sulphuric acid 
and have a tendency to sour the land if 
continuously used. However, this can be 
found out only by experience. Another 
thing in connection with artesian water 
that may be mentioned in comparison 
with water that comes from lakes and 
creeks. The surface water contains quite 
a good amount of ammonia salts or nitro¬ 
gen ; not enough to do any harm to the 
person who drinks it, but enough to be 
appreciated by the plants. These are not 
contained in the artesian water which is 
practically free from nitrates or nitrites. 

Mr. Gillett—We do not have arte¬ 
sian water, but presume a good many 
people here in this section do. I had some 
of the water to drink last night and 
would like to know if the flavor of the 
fruit is influenced at all by the flavor of 
the water. 

Mr. Christiancy—I think My. Gillett’s 
method, as I have tried it, is a failure. Mr. 
Allen, when he started irrigating 
three of his groves, tried running the 
water through furrows after the Califor¬ 
nia method and failed with it, and then he 
piped it. He put clown a three inch main 
and put down five artesian wells to supply 
the water and then put a standpipe in ev¬ 
ery center; the trees were some 20 by 20 
and some 25 by 25. He never had any 
success. 

I think it would be a good idea to let 
the artesian water run to waste and I 
would have a subirrigated grove. In one 
of those three groves I have never been 


c“ 

able to neutralize the soil by the use of 
any amount of ashes or fertilizer, and I 
suspect it is the sulphuric acid. I took up 
the pipes and we started in last spring and 
replaced the system intended to use hose. 
The pipe that had been used was wrought 
iron pipe and buried about eighteen inches 
and' showed no rust on the outside and on 
the inside a coating which the plumber 
said was caused by artesian water. The 
pipes that were about nine inches of the 
surface were rusted from the outside but 
not from the inside. The inside had the 
same coating caused by the artesian water. 

Mr. Mead—Speaking of the two wat¬ 
ers ; I would be in favor of the pond wat¬ 
er because you get more or less organic 
matter in it. 

Mr. Waite—I would like to ask the 
gentleman who spoke of the continuous 
pipe what proportion of cement and sand 
he used in making that pipe where it was 
used as a drain or sub-irrigation. 

Mr. Williams—To make pipe that is 
entirely water proof so that the water 
will not seep through, I use three parts of 
sand to one of cement. 

Dr. Richardson—Will that porous pipe 
permit roots to obstruct it ? 

Mr. Williams—<No sir. 

Mr. Waite—How far apart should 
those pipes be in clay soil and sandy soil ? 

Mr. Williams—In different soils, of 
course it would vary. The usual practice 
here is to put them about twenty-five feet 
apart. In soil very sandy and porous it 
would be far better to put them not to ex¬ 
ceed fifteen feet apart. 

Dr. Berger—I would like to have one 
question settled. The statement was 
made that the leaves of the tree absorb 
moisture. Now, will someone who real- 







68 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ly knows, answer this if they can. I 
am of the opinion that the leaves them¬ 
selves do not absorb moisture. 

Mr. Gillett—I think I made that state¬ 
ment. Of course, you know I am a lay¬ 
man and do not pretend to scientific 
knowledge. Let’s hear from the profes¬ 
sor. 

Dr. Richardson—I take it from the 
gentlemen who made the remark that 
the water as applied to the foliage washed 
off the dust and dirt and permitted the 
leaves to have healthy action. It simply 
put the leaves in condition so that they 
could discharge their proper functions. 

Mr. Temple—I cannot give you the 
book, page or paragraph where the re¬ 
mark was made that the overhead spray 
would feed the tree so much water, but 
I turned to Mr. Stevens and said that the 
scientists agree that the leaves of the tree 
do not absorb any moisture; that the)? 
simply breathe for the tree. I am sure 
authorities on the subject raise no ques¬ 
tion about this. 

Mr. Member—Well, it seems to me 
that if the leaves do not absorb moisture 
that it would be better to supply the 
water through laterals. It takes power 


to put water up fifteen feet in the air. It 
certainly would be cheaper. 

Mr. Gibbs—The practical effect of put¬ 
ting water up in the tree is just as good 
and as great a benefit to the tree whether 
the leaves absorb the moisture or whether 
it protects the leaves and enables it to 
hold its tree moisture from evaporation. 
The benefit is just the same in either 
case, so what’s the odds? 

Dr. Berger—I would like to briefly 
sum up some advantages in applying the 
water to the leaves. In the first place, it 
washes the tree; that has been admitted 
to be one advantage. It will, no doubt, 
wash off some of the soot in case white 
fly is present. It will, no doubt, also 
destroy the red spider. It will retard 
the development of fungus diseases, of 
scale insects and whitefly. So we have 
four advantages in applying the water to 
the leaves. 

Mr. Gillett—I am the one who made 
the statement that the trees absorb water 
through the leaves, and am free to ad¬ 
mit that I am ignorant on the subject. At 
the same time, I still contend that clean¬ 
ing the leaves off must be of great ad¬ 
vantage to the tree. I know I had much 
rather take a bath all over than to dip 
only my feet in the water.

DERANGEMENT OF THE ENZYMES OF PLANTS. 


By E. S. Hubbard. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When blood coagulates, a self generat¬ 
ed ferment separates it into two parts: 

First, a clot called fibrin caused mainly 
by the breaking down or sticking together 
of the coruscles with fibrinogenagers or 
para globulin, corpuscle products, and 
second, a watery portion called serum 
which contains the tissue nutrients elab¬ 
orated by the red corpuscles, the alexins 
or anti-toxins of the white corpuscles, 
and if venous blood, also the waste pro¬ 
ducts of the tissues that have been neu¬ 
tralized by the white corpuscles and are 
finally split up and excreted as tauric and 
uric acids from the liver and kidneys and 
carbonic acid gases from the lungs. 

This simple looking, natural reaction 
is a type o<f the composition of the vital 
fluids of all organic cellular life, the se¬ 
rum of blood corresponding to the enzy¬ 
mes of plants. Now fellow members, I 
approach the subject of this short paper 
with great diffidence. 

The question of nutrition is vast and 
specialized, with much conflicting evi¬ 
dence caused by the rapid advance of ex¬ 
perimental knowledge and the various 
conclusions drawn by different observers 
from similar experiments. I have only a 


superficial and incomplete unprofessional 
acquaintance with this work. Many con¬ 
clusions must be drawn from the analogy 
of animal and bacterial research and the 
subject, now in its infancy, bears about 
the same relation to plant feeding with 
fertilizers that the empirical practice of 
materia medica did to diseases before the 
establishing of the germ theory. 

However, as many members have doubt¬ 
less given little attention to the ques¬ 
tion, I trust the elementary generaliza¬ 
tions I present will be of interest to the 
Society. 

Pasteur, the noted French chemist, es¬ 
tablished his reputation and blazed the 
way for further similar work by investi¬ 
gating yeasts for the German brewers. 
The brewers had been troubled with bad 
tasting, bitter beer, poorly fermented beer 
and yeast that would not give uniform re¬ 
sults. So they finally called in the chem¬ 
ist with his culture tubes and microscope. 

Pasteur practically had to begin at the 
beginning. First, he had to find out why 
sprouted 1 malt would ferment and un¬ 
sprouted barley would not. These studies 
showed that in sprouting the life germs of 
the barley generated and excreted a ni¬ 
trogenous fluid, a ferment or enzyme that 
is called diastase. He next found this en- 




70

zyme changed the soluble starch stored 
up in the kernel to a fluid form as mal¬ 
tose, a kind of glucose or grape sugar. 

In normal growth the fluid solution of 
maltose is formed into a sprout, the 
sprout into a plant, while the plant ful¬ 
fils its destiny by perfecting seed, and this 
fixing of the fluid sugars in the sap into 
woody tissue and starchy grain is per¬ 
formed by another enzyme with an oppo¬ 
site function called invertase. There are 
a great number of yeasts or saocha- 
romyces, so-called because they thrive best 
in sugar or starch solutions. 

Pasteur studied about a dozen and front 
some of them got the bad results the 
brewers complained of. He finally iso¬ 
lated and made pure cultures of two 
which are called high and low yeasts on 
account of the temperatures at which they 
thrive 'best. The low temperature yeast be¬ 
ing easiest to keep pure. The yeast cells 
during their multiplication and growth 
split up the sugars into carbondioxide 
gas and alcohol by excreting ferments 
that are of a similar nature to the enzy¬ 
mes of plants or diastase of malt but with 
different functions. Every variety of 
plants seems to have its own peculiar en¬ 
zymes. See report of J. Wolff. *(E. S. 
R. Vol. XIX, page 808.) 

From a summary of recent experiments 
on the phenomena of liquefacation and 
coagulation of starch the conclusion was 
reached that the principal factors which 
come into play are the physical state of 
starch and the reaction of the salts which 
accompany it. Experiments are reported 
on the action of malt diastase at 65 de¬ 
grees C. on starch of different sorts. The 

*Note —E. S. R. and C. refers to Experiment 
Station Record. 


lowest amount of starch inverted. 25.4 
per cent, was noted with rice and the high¬ 
est value 99 per cent., with white Cuzco 
corn. 

“In these experiments 25 cc. of 10 per 
cent, malt extract were used with 3 grains 
of the raw starch. The microscopic ex¬ 
amination of the various samples shows 
nothing abnormal morphologically. Thus 
we see that the physical properties of raw 
starch may be very different, even for 
varieties of the same species. This more 
or less great resistance of raw starches 
toward diastase does not therefore suffice 
to class the species in such and such* 
category since they may vary with 
the climate, but it permits us to ex¬ 
plain how in the aerial organs of the same 
plants, starch may be found in greatly 
different physical states/’ This would go 
to show that the healthy enzymes might 
be found in the top of a foot rot orange 
tree, while at the place of gumming near 
the ground the enzymes have lost their 
power and cannot change the sweet gum¬ 
my sap into stored up starch or woody tis¬ 
sue but allow it to accumulate and burst 
the bark as gum. To show the complexity 
of this subject I quote from a report of 
“Fermentation Investigations”—(E. S. 
R. XV. Jan. ’04) L. Matruchot and Mal¬ 
lard. “In addition to the fermentation pro¬ 
duced by yeast and similar organisms the 
authors following investigations by Pat¬ 
ens Le Chartier and Bellamy show that 
there is a fermentation which takes place 
in fleshy fruits, tubes, etc., that is inde¬ 
pendent of yeasts or other foreign organ¬ 
isms. The methods of the experiment are 
described in detail—fruits of pumpkins 
and apples, onion bulbs, beet roots, etc., 
being kept under aseptic conditions for a

considerable time and the alcoholic fer¬ 
mentation and carbondioxide evolution 
determined. In this connection I wish to 
call attention to the probable reason of 
sulphate of ammonia being a healthful 
stimulus to the enzymes of oranges that 
sweeten the fruit by quoting frbm “the 
chemical nature of diastase.” T. B. Os¬ 
borne, (E. S. R. No. 3,1895. page 182.) 

The method used for preparing the en¬ 
zyme which differs from the one usually 
employed was to “first separate the pro- 
teids from the carbohydrates and other 
soluble substances by saturating the ex¬ 
tract with ammonium sulphate, thereby 
precipitating the ferment and proteid's to¬ 
gether ; next to remove this proteid exist¬ 
ing as globulin by dialysis; and then if 
possible to separate the albumin and pro- 
teids by fractional precipitation with al¬ 
cohol. In following this method a meas¬ 
ured quantity of malt extract was saturat¬ 
ed with ammonium sulphate, the precipi¬ 
tated proteid matter was filtered out, dis¬ 
solved in water and the clean filtered solu¬ 
tion made up to value of the original ex¬ 
tract. This solution was found to have the 
same diastatic power as before precipita¬ 
tion, thus showing that ammonium sul¬ 
phate had not injured the diastase.” 

I would further call attention to a fact 
I have often mentioned by quoting an ex¬ 
tract from a report of work by G. Lieb- 
sc'her, (E. S. R., Vol. 7, No. 8,1896, page 
665,) “as regards the contents of phos¬ 
phoric acid it appears that the solubility 
is of more significance than the total 
amount present. With a high content of 
of sesquioxides a soil will show great need 
of phosphatic fertilizers, although it al¬ 
ready contains a high per cent, of phos¬ 
phoric acid.” 


As a citrate solution is generally used 
in analyses to determine the percentage of 
reverted phosphoric acid it would seem 
orange trees ought to have greater pow¬ 
ers of assimilation of phosphoric acid 
than other plants. 

Experiments by P. Kassovich (E. S. 
R. XVI, No. 2,1048, July, ’05,) show 
that the amount of carbon dioxide set 
free 'by the roots was about twenty times 
greater than would have been required to 
render soluble all the phosphoric acid as¬ 
similated by the plants if it were supplied 
in an insoluble form. Still further, A. 
Quartarali (E. S. R. XVII, No. 5,449, 
Jan. ’06, shows “That the organic acids 
which usually occur in plants first render 
insoluble phosphates soluble and then 
convert them into di-hydrogen phos¬ 
phates. Any free phosphoric acid which 
may be produced is converted in the plants 
into a di-hydrogen salt. This is explained 
by the lower acidity of organic acids as 
compared with phosphoric acid and by 
their greater affinity as compared with 
acid phosphates. 

D. N. Prianishni kov (E. S. R. XVI, 
No. 6,538) shows “that ammonium salts, 
especially ammonium sulphate, exert an 
important influence in rendering the phos¬ 
phoric acid of mineral phosphates avail¬ 
able to higher plants, while sodium nitrate 
exerts no such influence. For this reason 
ammonium sulphate is designated “Physi¬ 
ologically acid” and sodium nitrate “phy¬ 
siologically alkaline. A series of sand and 
water cultures with barley, oats, buck¬ 
wheat, flax, peas and vetches to determine 
the status of ammonium! nitrate with 
reference to acidity or alkalinity as thus, 
defined is reported. The results show that 
this salt is intermediate in its action be- 


72

tween 'ammonium sulphate and sodium 
nitrate and indicates that it may, under 
certain conditions, be physiologically acid. 
It was shown to increase the assimilability 
of the phosphoric acid of insoluble phos¬ 
phates even in sterile cultures where nitri¬ 
fication did not occur. 

O. Schreiner and H. S. Reed (E. S. R. 
XIX, No. 9,822) show evidence that 
roots possess well defined oxidizing pow¬ 
ers due principally to enzymes. Certain 
substances used as fertilizers promote the 
activity of roots, and root oxidation is 
more active in fertile than unproductive 
soils. 

O. Schreiner and M. X. Sullivan (E. 
S. R., same page) found that “water in 
which seed has germinated and seedlings 
had grown apparently contained toxic 
properties which interfered with the 
growth of a second crop in the same solu¬ 
tion. F. Fletcher (same page, E. S. R.) 
made investigations showing the excre¬ 
tions of toxic substances of an alkaloidal 
nature by plant roots. Phosphoric acid 
when assimilated by plants is mainly in 
the form of di-hydrogen phosphate incor¬ 
porated in the protoplasm of the living 
plant cells. I have often called attention 
to the fact of a suspicion that 
iron solutions from iron impregnat¬ 
ed soils which the plants must 
transpire in making growths evidently 
have a depressing effect on the plant 
protoplasm equivalent to phosphate rever¬ 
sion thereby deranging the enzymes that 
make growth and delaying or even stop¬ 
ping the maturing of the plants. 

Most organic poisons are classed as al¬ 
kaloids and generally speaking alkaloids 
are albumens or proteids split up into low¬ 


er molecular forms and given stability by 
association with alkaline salts. 

The most familiar alkaloids are those 
used in medicine—quinine, morphine, 
strychnine, atropine, etc., which are de¬ 
posited as useless or waste nitrogenous 
substances in the bark or tissue of certain 
plants. 

In most plants after the protoplasm cells 
are exhausted from excreting enzymes 
the broken down or split up remains dis¬ 
appear probably as root excretions. The 
process is shown in a study of maize and 
dates by H. S. Reed (E. S. R. XVI, No. 
5,443,05.) “It was found that in the rest¬ 
ing condition the secreting cells of both 
maize and dates are crowded with rela¬ 
tively small proteid granules, as secretion 
begins these granules gradually disap¬ 
pear. In maize the disappearance coin¬ 
cides closely with the consumption of the 
endosperm. In the date however, the gran¬ 
ules disappear long before the endosperm 
is dissolved. 

The chromatin of the nuclei is small 
in amount at the beginning of secretion 
and increases as germination progresses. 
The nucleolus diminishes with the pro¬ 
gressing of germination. These changes 
are more noticeable in the case of maize 
than in the date. There is no evidence that 
solid matter is excreted from the nucleus. 
At the end of secretory activity the proto¬ 
plasm of the secreting cells breaks down 
and the products of disintegration disap¬ 
pear from sight.” L. Lutz (E. S. R. 
XVII, No. 2,348, Dec. ’05,) believes it is 
practically demonstrated that many or¬ 
ganic nitrogenous substances are directly 
assimilated by plants, and the common be¬ 
lief that ammoniacal fermentation takes 
place first followed by nitric fermentation

is not in accord with what actually occurs 
in the plant. 

The confirmation of this long suspected 
fact in the use of organic fertilizers would 
show there is a possibility of plants ab¬ 
sorbing so great a quantity of the poison¬ 
ous alkaloids of quickly decaying animal 
or other organic fertilizer's as to' derange 
the enzyme-producing functions and 
healthy growth of plants for it is a fact 
that the alkaloid's or toxins may produce a 
destructive breaking down of plant pro¬ 
toplasm that is as rapid in its way as the 
transformation by diastase of starch into 
glucose. As an analogy witness the study 
of the effects of the tetanus or lockjaw 
bacillus toxin by N. Tiberti (E. S. R. 
XVII, No. 8,804, April, 06.) In the 
author’s experiments it was found that in 
guinea pigs and rabbits the ischiatic nerve 
may absorb the tetanus toxin and trans¬ 
port it to the nerve centers when the tox¬ 
in is applied to the cut end of the nerve. 
When the tetanus toxin is injected into 
the muscle it spreads about and comes in 
contact with the nerve fibres by which it 
is absorbed. If tetanus anti-toxin is inject¬ 
ed into a nerve trunk and toxin injected 
later into the corresponding muscles, the 
anti-toxin will prevent the toxin from 
reaching the central nervous system. 

In this disease the germs, in the early 
stages at least, remain in the wound and 
the symptoms are caused by the digestive 
and waste poisons they produce in mul¬ 
tiplication and growth. The anti-toxins 
that are secured from the blood of animals 
that have been vaccinated or have recov¬ 
ered from infectious diseases do not 
act directly on the organism of other ani¬ 
mals or in a chemical sense, but their 
chief action is a partial neutralization of 


toxins. It has been shown that a mixture 
of a toxin and anti-toxin is not strictly 
neutral, and portions of both toxin and 
anti-toxin remain uncombined, while the 
remainder of the toxin and anti-toxin 
combines and becomes neutralized in 
varying degrees. 

When it comes to applying the princi¬ 
ples of the discoveries in the treatment of 
animal germ diseases tO' the diseases of 
plants we are all at sea for lack of suffi¬ 
cient investigation. That plants are at¬ 
tacked and suffer in a similar way to ani¬ 
mals from poison and diseases is a matter 
of common observation. When a soldier 
bug sucks a fast growing orange or other 
plant shoot and it quickly wilts we feel 
sure it has had the effects of a snake bite 
on an animal and is damaged by a similar 
alkaloid poison. I know common salt will 
defoliate an orange tree and that a hand¬ 
ful of arsenic or London purple will kill it. 
L. Montemartini (E. S. R. XVII, No. 
10,891. ’06.) Studying the physiology of 
diseased plants due to fungi and mites de¬ 
duced the hypothesis that the parasites 
may secrete some poisonous substances 
that stimulate the plant chiefly by increas¬ 
ed respiration during the early stages be¬ 
fore the depressing effects appear. 

The soft rot bacteria of vegetables ex¬ 
crete enzymes that break down the plant 
tissues in advance of the entrance of the 
germs and the same has been shown 
of fungi. 

S. A. Makrzhetski, (E. S. R. XVII. 
No. 10,959,) conducted a number of ex¬ 
periments in which he introduced arsenic, 
copper, sulphate, eosin and other poison¬ 
ous solutions into trees for the purpose of 
destroying parasites, but did not obtain 
any very satisfactory results. He then re- 



74 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


placed' the poisonous salts by nutritive 
ones and obtained interesting results in 
improving the 'condition of the trees. He 
had best results from dry fertilizer salts 
in holes 1-2 inch diameter, 1 inch deep 
covered with land plaster. The dry salts 
diffused through the trees in different 
wavs not only along vertical lines but 
some times in spirals. 

I. J. Sheviryev, (E. S. R. XVI, Decem¬ 
ber, ’04. 383) reports 10 years experi¬ 
ments in artificial nutrition of diseased 
trees, protecting from insects without kill¬ 
ing the trees. According to the author the 
investigations are based on the following 
facts: After the spring movement of the 
sap when the pressure inside the vessels is 
greater than that of the atmosphere, 
there follows in summer and fall a pe¬ 
riod of negative pressure. If the vessels 
at this time are brought into' communica¬ 
tion with the liquid, the latter enters and 
fills them under the pressure of the out¬ 
side air. For the successful introduction 
of liquids into the vessels of the tree it 
was found necessary to prevent the en¬ 
trance of air. The author attributes the 
failure of many experiments in impreg¬ 
nating live trees with solutions to the dis¬ 
regarding of this fact. In order to ex¬ 
clude the air the vessels are opened under 
a layer of liquid. For this purpose, if the 
trees do not exceed 31-2 inches in diam¬ 
eter their trunks are surrounded by a 
feeding funnel of aluminum fastened to 
the tree by means of cement. 

For larger trees only portions of fun¬ 
nels are fastened to the trunk. After the 
funnel is fixed in place the solution is 
poured in and a cut made below the level 
of the liquid through the thickness of the 
bark and part of the sap wood. The liquid 


at once begins to be sucked in and to' dif¬ 
fuse above and below the cut, a mariotte 
vessel provides for the automatic replen¬ 
ishing of the liquid as it is absorbed. The 
absorption of the liquid continues at the 
initial velocity for some time after which 
it slackens, being influenced by climate, 
season of the year and state of the weath¬ 
er. The absorption takes place more rap¬ 
idly in dry air at high temperatures and in 
strong sunlight. 

The absorption continues for about 5 
days, and the immediate cause of its ces¬ 
sation seems to be the choking up of the 
vessels through which the liquid enters 
the tree. This is shown by the vigorous 
renewal of absorption through new cuts 
made in the tree. 

In an experiment on an oak tree 7 
inches in diameter, 11.37 gallons of liquid 
was absorbed by the tree in 53 hours. 

Experiments with a number of solu¬ 
tions colored with eosin or methyl blue, 
showed that liquids diffuse both upward 
and downward, and also' horizontally. The 
diffusion in a horizontal direction seems 
to be along the rays, as the heartwood 
does not become colored. The colored 
liquid has been traced to the smallest 
branches and also to the leaves, and in 
the experiment with grapevines into the 
berries themselves. The diffusion into 
the roots does not seem as uniform as 
through the sapwood of the trunk. 

The author has not made much 
progress in finding substances which may 
be introduced in sufficient quantity to be 
destructive to parasites without being in¬ 
jurious to the plant but expects interest¬ 
ing results from experiments with certain 
barium compounds with which he is ex¬ 
perimenting. I give the report of these ex-

periments in detail as possibly opening- a 
profitable field for investigation in rela¬ 
tion to diseases of oranges and other trees. 

Tetanus for instance, among germ 
diseases has been successfully treated by 
injections of solutions of carbolic acid and 
glycerine as well as with anti-toxin. Now 
if the absorption process described by 
Sheviryev will work on orange trees will 
it not be possible to' discover and directly 
administer antidotes or even anti-toxins 
for such diseases as limb blight, 
die back, foot rot and wither tip ? As I 
understand the preliminary work of isola¬ 
ting and studying the enzymes of orange 
trees is only fairly started at our State 
Experiment Station under the provision 
of the Adams act for original investiga¬ 
tions we cannot look for immediate re¬ 
sults in devising remedies but it seems to 
me the time is coming when the diseases 
of trees will be as well understood as those 
of animals and when remedies will be 
directly introduced into the plant sap cir¬ 
culation. 

i 

In conclusion I will say that W. Welch- 


ard (E. S. R. XVII. No. 5,486) reports 
that from the flesh of guinea pigs dead 
from fatigue he was able to extract a 
body which injected into guinea pigs and 
other animals caused all the symptoms of 
fatigue. This body was isolated and found 
to be very unstable in character and the 
author considers it a true toxin. When 
injected into the circulation of horses an 
anti-toxin was produced which in vitro or 
in animals counteracted the toxins. As 
shown by a number of experiments the 
anti-toxin can be taken by man without 
harmful results. 

In connection with the report of the 
experiments the author discusses the char¬ 
acteristic symptoms of fatigue, its effects 
on the body temperature, the produc¬ 
tion of the anti-toxin in the body and re¬ 
lated questions. Further, I can only say 
I have made these dry subjects as untech- 
nical as possible and hope they will give 
an idea of the trend of future investiga¬ 
tions, but if anybody has that tired feel¬ 
ing I am sorry to say I have not yet se¬ 
cured and am unable to administer the 
anti-toxin for fatigue. 


SOME DISEASES OF CITRUS TREES. 


By H. S. Fawcett. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

You may picture to yourself an ideal 
orange grove; one in which the trees are 
perfectly healthy; one provided with all 
the conditions favorable to growth and 
the production of the maximum amount 
of fruit consistent with this growth; one 


in which there is nothing to induce disease 
of any kind. This would require just the 
right amount of plant-food, of moisture, 
of regulated temperature and of light; 
a suitable substance in which a tree could 
fasten itself by a root system; and free¬ 
dom from all attacks of injurious insects 




76 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


and parasitic organisms. But this is only 
a mental picture, for, as everyone knows, 
these conditions are never fully realized 
in any orange grove. A tree is continual¬ 
ly being subjected to conditions tending 
to directly injure it, or to slowly sap its 
vitality. It is subjected to improper 
amounts and kinds of plant-food; too 
much or too little moisture; too great or 
too sudden changes of temperature, such 
as frosts or burning heat; wind storms; 
improper kinds of soil; and also to a host 
of visible or invisible enemies that prey 
upon it from the outside. Many of these 
conditions are to a large extent under the 
control of the grower. With proper care 
and due expenditure, the plant-food and 
the moisture may be largely controlled; 
but the changes of temperature, the wind 
storms, and the nature of the soil, are 
mostly beyond the limits of man’s power 
to change. Parasitic enemies, as far as 
they are understood, are also largely un¬ 
der control of the grower; but there are 
many whose habits are not yet sufficiently 
known for us to get them under intelli¬ 
gent control. 

When, because of unfavorable condi¬ 
tions or attacks of parasites, a tree or any 
part of it ceases to function properly and 
begins to weaken, we say it is diseased. 
If we leave out of account the insect 
troubles, the diseases of citrus trees may 
be divided into two classes. (i) The 
physiological diseases due mainly to mal¬ 
nutrition, and (2) the diseases due to par¬ 
asitic organisms. In the first class, or 
those presumably due to mal-nutrition, 
are dieback, melanose, yellow spotting 
and frenching. In the second class, or 
those due to, or probably due to parasitic 
organisms are withertip, scaly bark, scab, 


gumming and blight. It is of this latter 
class that this paper will treat. The 
causes of some of the diseases here de¬ 
scribed have not yet been proved, but 
since their symptoms and mode of action 
are similar to those undoubtedly due to 
fungi or bacteria, they are included here. 

Most of the parasitic fungi that cause 
diseases in trees are invisible forms, or 
at least their seed-like bodies or spores are 
too small to be detected with the unaided 
eye. Just as the higher plants have dif¬ 
ferent ways of distributing their seeds, 
so these lower plants, the invisible fungi, 
have different means by which their 
spores are scattered. The seeds of the 
thistle and dandelion are carried by the 
wind to great distances; the seeds of the 
oxalis are shot out violently from the 
pods; the seeds of the mistletoe are car¬ 
ried by birds, and those of the burs by 
other animals. If we had microscopical 
eyes we would find that with these little 
fungus plants there are also various.meth¬ 
ods of spore distribution. Some spores 
are light and powdery, are blown off and 
float like dust in the air; others are moist 
and waxy and stick to the bodies of in¬ 
sects, the feet of birds, and the like. 

One kind of spore has hygroscopic 
movements, by which it moves on drying 
and being moistened again. Some are 
even shot out into the air as invisible dust 
particles. 

Most of the kinds of fungi, of which 
there are nearly 80,000 species described, 
are entirely harmless to a citrus tree, and 
many are even useful in keeping insects 
in check; but there are a few evilly inclin¬ 
ed individuals that make a great deal of 
trouble for the orange growers. It is 
only within comparatively recent times 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


77 


that the nature of these low fungi was 
known. Much advance has been made 
in their study and in finding means of 
controlling them, but there is yet much 
that is not understood. The advance in 
this line is slow, because of the extreme 
smallness of many of these minute forms, 
and the difficulty of keeping track of any 
one individual in its infection of a tree. 
When a new disease occurs, one may pos¬ 
sibly find a dozen different microscopic 
fungi growing upon or into a 
diseased area. It is necessary 
to isolate these fungi in the 
laboratory, and then to prove by inocula¬ 
tion experiments which kind, if any, is 
the cause of the disease, or whether the 
fungi are simply present as the result of 
an injury from some other source. The 
primary cause of a disease once being 
known, it is a simpler problem to discover 
a means of prevention or cure for it. 
One discovery of this kind may prove of 
vast value to a whole country, yet it can 
never be known beforehand how much 
time it will require to make the discovery. 

SCALY BARK. 

A disease that is confined almost en¬ 
tirely to one section of the State and has 
attracted considerable attention there, is 
that known as Scaly Bark. It is sometimes 
called by the growers “11180 or “nail- 
head rust.” This disease should arouse in¬ 
terest, not only in the section in which it 
is prevalent, but in other sections as well, 
because of the danger of its being intro¬ 
duced into new regions. The advantage to 
the grower of being able to recognize at 
a glance a new disease at its earliest start 
is great. For there are times when by the 
destruction of a single tree in the corner 


of a grove, or of one tree near a house or 
barn, into which a disease has been car¬ 
ried, an entire grove might easily be saved 
from being diseased. From, our study of 
this disease there is every reason to be¬ 
lieve that Scaly Bark is infectious, and 
that it may spread easily from tree to tree 
or from one grove to another. A history 
and description of this disease were given 
by the writer in the Proceedings of this 
Society for 1908, page 101. It has also 
been more recently described, with its 
remedies, in Bulletin 98 of the Florida 
Experiment Station. It has been estimated 
that the yearly loss of fruit from this dis¬ 
ease in one citrus-growing section of the 
State is near 20,000 to 30,000 boxes of 
oranges, and this is in addition to the con¬ 
stant weakening of the trees. The loss of 
crop in this region is anywhere from noth¬ 
ing up to 25 per cent, in good years, and 
in unfavorable years it may be as high as 
75 per cent, in badly diseased groves. 

Description— Scalv bark is primarily 
a bark and {rind disease of the sweet 
orange. The wood is only affected sec¬ 
ondarily, by poisoning due to the wither- 
tip fungus. The bark of the trunk and of 
branches of all sizes may be affected; but 
the greatest injury is done to the younger 
branches and twigs up to> about one-half 
inch in diameter, and to the fruit. 

On the branches and twigs there de¬ 
velop more or less circular or oval spots 
one-sixth to one inch across, rusty in col¬ 
or, and with well-defined margins. The 
bark becomes brittle, begins to crack, and 
forms small flakes or scales. These spots 
are at first scattered but may increase in 
number to such an extent as to became 
joined together. The branch is Tardy 
killed in the first year. During the second 





78 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


year, additional spots form between the 
old ones, and this may go on for several 
years until the branch is finally girdled 1 at 
some point and killed. 

This formation of rough scaly bark 
is also seen on the trunks of the badly 
diseased trees. As time goes on, the 
trunks present an extremely rough and 
shaggy appearance. Pieces of bark one- 
half inch or more in size are pushed up, 
sometimes over areas of several inches in 
diameter, or a continuous surface of rup¬ 
tured bark is formed. New bark arises 
under the old, and only rarely do dead 
areas on the trunk result from this dis¬ 
ease. The exudation of gum is a usual 
accompaniment. 

On the rind of the fruit the spots de¬ 
velop somewhat similarly to those of the 
small branches. The disease affects only 
the outer portion of the rind. The spots 
start either as rings, like those on the 
small branches, or as round yellowish 
areas. These usually begin to appear on 
the fruit in July and August. As the 
fruit approaches maturity, and while it 
is still green, the rings become sunken 
and brown, because of the entrance of the 
withertip fungus, while their central por¬ 
tions remain green. The fruit then col¬ 
ors rapidly, the portion inside the ring 
sometimes remaining green for a short 
time. The center is finally broken down 
by the withertip fungus, and the whole 
spot becomes brown. Some spots are 
formed which are not ringed. Fruits 
spotted by scaly bark color prematurely, 
and drop before the picking season. Oc¬ 
casionally gummy exudations occur at the 
spots on the fruit. 

Cause —A careful study has been made 


to determine just what the cause is. It 
is now believed that the trouble is due to 
a minute microscopic fungus that makes 
its way through the bark from the out¬ 
side and grows just under the outer cells. 
The disease is quite slow in its develop¬ 
ment. It develops so gradually into its 
destructive form that the grower is scarce¬ 
ly aware of its importance until it has 
been present for several years. 

Remedy —-Experiments for the control 
of the disease have been systematically 
carried on at Bayview for the past two 
years. The nature of the disease and its 
slow development upon the limbs and 
trunks, make the effect of any line of 
treatment slow in showing itself. As the 
development of the disease to its destruc¬ 
tive form is slow, so the recovery of the 
tree after the source of infection is cut 
off requires a long time. We cannot ex¬ 
pect to see the beneficial effect of any 
treatment on the branches in much less 
time than eight to ten months. Twenty 
experiment plots, each receiving different 
treatment, were laid out. These have 
been continuously under observation, and 
from the basis for the remedies which 
are here suggested. 

Top Working —Grapefruit, manda¬ 
rins and tangerines appear to be nearly 
immune to scaly bark, even when sur¬ 
rounded by badly affected sweet orange 
trees. Diseased trees may, therefore, be 
topworked to one of these varieties. At 
first sight this would seem to- be too se¬ 
vere a remedy; but, as a matter of fact, it 
can be carried out without serious loss at 
any one time. This can be done by treat¬ 
ing only alternate rows. In this way the 
untreated trees will be found to produce 
a much larger crop, and this will in a 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


79 


measure compensate for the loss of crop 
on the top-worked trees. 

Top-working has already been prac¬ 
ticed by some growers. As a further pre¬ 
caution, the trunks and branches may be 
treated with carbolineum as suggested be¬ 
low. When these top-worked trees be¬ 
gin to produce a fair crop, the untouched 
trees may be treated in the same way. 

Heading Back— During the dormant 
period, preferably in December or Janu¬ 
ary, cut out the top, leaving only the 
trunk and the stubs of the larger branch¬ 
es. Then paint the entire bark and the 
cut surfaces with one part of carbolineum 
to one part of water. In our treatment 
of this disease in this way, which began 
in February, the bark assumed a dark- 
red color. In a few weeks, as the grow¬ 
ing season came on, the tree put out new 
shoots, and by the end of summer had 
grown a vigorous, healthy top. By that 
time the old scabs had disappeared, and 
the bark had become smooth and free 
from flakes. The carbolineum, far from 
injuring the tree, appeared to stimulate 
it to increased vigor. Unless the entire 
grove is treated in this way the young 
growth should be protected by spraying 
with one per cent, solution of carbolineum 
in May or June, when the wood will have 
hardened. 

Bordeaux Mixture— The use of Bor¬ 
deaux mixture has been attended with 
beneficial results in diminishing the num¬ 
ber of spotted fruits, but with bad re¬ 
sults in allowing the increase of scale in¬ 
sects. A thorough test was made as to 
the effects of this spraying mixture at 
different times of the year, and with dif¬ 
ferent numbers of sprayings throughout 
the year. The most marked result has 


been the diminished number of spotted 
oranges on the sprayed plots, as com¬ 
pared with the unsprayed plots. This 
test was repeated the second year on the 
same plots and in the same way as at first. 
During the first year some effect was no¬ 
ticed, especially on those plots where the 
spraying had begun in the early summer, 
but the results were not pronounced. Dur¬ 
ing the second year a great diminution of 
spotted fruit was seen in nearly all of 
the sprayed trees. The amount of fruit 
however, was considerably diminished on 
the plots sprayed at or near the blooming 
season. Our experiments indicate that 
one thorough spraying at any time be¬ 
tween November and February is almost 
as efficient in diminishing the amount of 
spotted fruit in the following crop, as 
three or four sprayings during any other 
part of the year. It is also attended with 
a smaller increase in scale insects. 

Extreme caution must be taken in us¬ 
ing Bordeaux mixture for orange trees, 
since it kills the fungi that are useful in 
keeping scale insects in check. If Bor¬ 
deaux mixture is applied, it should be fol¬ 
lowed by a good insecticide, or twigs 
from unsprayed trees bearing the proper 
fungi should be hung in the tops of the 
sprayed trees a week or two after the 
treatment. 

WITHERTIP. 

Withertip is a disease which is very de¬ 
structive at times, especially when an or¬ 
ange tree is subjected to unfavorable 
conditions. The primary cause of this 
disease was carefuly studied and worked 
out by Prof. P. H. Rolfs several years ago 
while holding the position of plant path¬ 
ologist at the sub-tropical laboratory at 


80 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


r 


Miami. He proved by experimental meth¬ 
ods that by spraying the spores of a cer¬ 
tain fungus upon the young orange and 
lemon trees in the greenhouse he could 
cause the disease known as Withertip. It 
was demonstrated in this way that the 
disease was caused directly by the fungus 
known as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. 
It was further shown that other effects 
were due to the same cause, such as blos¬ 
som-blight, leaf-spot, tear-staining of 
fruit, lemon spot, and other troubles. Dr. 
Ernst A. Bessey, in carrying this work 
further, demonstrated that the same fun¬ 
gus which causes withertip of orange *n 
its various manifestations, also causes 
blossom-blight, leaf-spot and fruit-rot of 
mangoes and avocadoes, and leaf-spot 
and fruit-rots of various other plants. 

Withertip has so many different ap¬ 
pearances and symptoms according to 
what part of the tree is affected and at 
what stage of development it is found, 
that it is almost impossible to give a de¬ 
scription of it by which it can be identi¬ 
fied at all times. The fungus causing 
withertip appears to be an ever-present 
one, and the disease breaks out in its de¬ 
structive form as the result either of the 
action of virulent strains of the fungus, 
or from unfavorable conditions that ren¬ 
der the tree less resistant to the growth 
of the fungus into its tissues, or from both 
causes. Withertip often accompanies or 
follows other troubles. It is almost in¬ 
variably found as a secondary agent in 
trees suffering from scaly bark. It ap¬ 
pears that the scaly bark disease was pres¬ 
ent for years, and only developed in its 
present destructive form after the ad¬ 
vent of the Withertip in the State. Prof. 
B. F. Floyd has observed that it nearly 


always follows the yellow spotting of 
citrus leaves. The resistance which a 
strong healthy tree presents to this fungus 
is probably lessened materially through 
the influence of yellow spotting and the 
fungus can then enter the weakened tis¬ 
sue. There are certain effects of fertil¬ 
izers that appear to increase the liability 
to this disease. Prof. Floyd in his experi¬ 
ments with the physiological effects of 
certain kinds and amounts of fertilizers 
on young trees, found that by increasing 
the amount of nitrate of soda till a poi¬ 
soning effect on the wood tissue resulted, 
a condition was produced suitable to the 
rapid development of Withertip. In 
cases where amounts of phosphoric acid 
or potash were used sufficient to poison 
trees to the same degree, the Withertip 
was not observed to develop to the same 
extent. 

What usually puzzles the grower is 
that often there are individual trees, and 
even individual limbs of the same tree, 
that are severely attacked; while other 
trees of the grove and other limbs of the 
diseased tree remain uninjured. This 
difference in the action of the fungus to¬ 
ward different limbs of the same tree is 
probably due to a difference in the vitality 
of the individual limbs. Any cause ren¬ 
dering a branch somewhat weak, such as 
a previous heavy load of fruit, or the ad¬ 
verse conditions mentioned above, would 
most probably render that branch sus¬ 
ceptible to an attack of the fungus. The 
same would doubtless be true in regard 
to the susceptibility or immunity to the 
disease of the different trees in a grove. 
Cases occur, however, that seem to be 
accounted for only by considering trees 
as individuals, each slightly different

from the other. One tree, apparently 
just as healthy as another, is for some 
cause not yet understood, less resistant to 
this particular disease, and is therefore 
attacked; while the tree next to it may 
remain uninjured. 

Treatment —The treatment for this 
disease must vary according to the phase 
of the disease present. Blossom blight 
and dropping of young fruit may largely 
be prevented with Bordeaux mixture 
properly applied. In case of blossom 
blight one must spray directly into the 
bloom. The accepted belief is that Bor¬ 
deaux mixture will knock off the fruit if 
sprayed into the bloom, but in case of 
blossom blight one will do more good than 
harm by using it. Though it may knock 
off some fruit it will save more than it 
will injure. When the disease has gotten 
thoroughly into the tissues and is begin¬ 
ning to kill back the branches and to 
poison the wood tissue, more drastic 
measures must be employed. Prof. 
Rolfs’ experiments showed that the dis¬ 
ease could be best controlled at this stage 
by pruning out. This should be done by 
cutting out, not only the dead branches, 
but also the diseased weak branches for 
some distance back of the apparently af¬ 
fected wood. The poisoning effect of 
this fungus may extend to a considerable 
distance beyond the place where the fun¬ 
gus may be found, and it is advisable to 
get rid as far as possible of the poisoned 
wood. 

This treatment should be accompanied 
by a process of building up the trees to 
make them resistant to the further at¬ 
tacks of the fungus. Spotting of the 
fruit in the fall may also be prevent¬ 
ed by spraying. If it be near the season of 


the ripening of the fruit it is advisable to 
use the ammoniacal solution of copper 
carbonate. In using fungicides on or¬ 
ange trees one must bear in mind that 
one is also killing the fungi that keep 
down the scale insects. One must be 
ready to follow with an insecticide, or 
hang pieces of bark containing the scale 
fungi in the tops of the sprayed trees. 
These should be put in several weeks aft¬ 
er spraying has been done. 

foot-rot. 

Nearly every citrus district in the world 
has been troubled by the foot-rot. It is 
one of the oldest diseases of citrus trees. 
In Europe its history extends back as far 
as 1845. In Florida, according to Prof, 
Hume, it was first noticed about 1879. 
The disease is well described, and effec¬ 
tive methods of cure are given by Prof. 
P. H. Rolfs in Press Bulletin 96 of the 
Florida Experiment Station, as follows: 

“The first symptom of the disease that 
is noticed is the oozing of gum from 
wounds occurring near the ground. Later 
on, the gumming ceases and the 
bark dries, the portion that has become 
diseased breaking off. These foot-rot 
wounds, after they begin to heal, are so 
characteristic, that when once seen thev 
are rarely mistaken. The extent to which 
the wounds spread depends on a variety 
of circumstances. Sometimes they are 
very small, being not more than a frac¬ 
tion of an inch in diameter and more or 
less circular in outline; while at other 
times they may extend nearly or quite 
around the tree at the ground. In such 
cases the wound is of an irregular shape. 

“Remedy —Since we have known that 
the disease is infectious and understood 


6 





82

the conditions which favor its spread, a 
remedy 'can be much more successfully 
applied. The following brief rules, if 
followed carefully and conscientiously, 
will eliminate the disease from a grove, 
and in many cases save trees that other¬ 
wise would be lost. 

“i. Remove the soil from about the 
crown and the crown roots, at least as 

far back as any disease occurs. 

A very small, even an invisible amount, of 
virus is capable of starting the disease 
in a new place; consequently, any tools or 
implements used about a foot-rot tree 
should be thoroughly disinfected before 
being used on a healthy one. 

2. After the soil has been removed 
from the crown, cut out the diseased 

parts.The bark should be cut away 

as far as the disease occurs, which can 
be easily told by a yellowish or dark dis¬ 
coloration of the inner bark. As the dis¬ 
ease rarely penetrates into the wood, it 
will be sufficient to remove the bark. 

3. After the diseased part has all been 
cut out, apply an antiseptic wash. One 
of the most readily obtainable, and also 
one of the best, is crude carbolic acid— 
using one part of the acid to one part of 
water. .,. . . .When the disease makes its 
appearance early in the year, it may be 
necessary to repeat this operation a sec¬ 
ond time, or even more frequently. 

4. After the above remedy has been 
applied, .and no mew cases of foot-rot 
have been discovered for a period of two 
or three months, the following wash may 
be applied to the trunks of the trees and 
to such larger roots as are exposed: 
three parts of slaked lime, mixed with one 
part of flowers of sulphur. The ingre¬ 
dients may be easily mixed by passing 


them through a sieve, or by working 
them on the floor, very much as fertiliz¬ 
ers are mixed. After they are evenly 
mixed, place the powder in a tub or 
barrel, and add enough water to bring 

it to a consistency of paint.The 

trunks of the trees and all of the exposed 
roots should be given a thorough coating 
of this material. In groves where foot- 
rot is just starting and where the wounds 
are all very small, this wash alone will 
frequently be found sufficient. In groves 
where foot-rot occurs on a considerable 
percentage of the trees, it will be best to 
apply the wash to the trunks and larger 
roots of all the trees—those that are not 
affected as well as the diseased ones.” 

GUMMING. 

A disease known as gumming of cit¬ 
rus trees is becoming a serious trouble in 
many localities of the Stace. It has brok¬ 
en out in some groves to an alarming ex¬ 
tent. 

Description— The gumming areas 
are usually at considerable distances 
from the ground on the trunk and larger 
limbs. This point of difference distin¬ 
guishes the diseases from the foot-rot. 
The bark cracks, and gum oozes out in 
large quantities. When the bark just 
adjoining the affected area is cut off, it 
is seen to be yellowish inside, and the 
bark tissue has a sour odor as if fermen¬ 
tation had set in. The diseased areas as 
they enlarge may reach one-half to three- 
quarters of the way around a large limb. 
In some cases the limb or trunk is girdled. 
Where the case is not too severe, new 
bark tissue is formed underneath the old, 
and the surface of the diseased area be¬ 
comes characterized by ridges, warts and 







FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


83 


resinous looking deposits from the hard¬ 
ening of the gummy exudations. The new 
bark may sometimes heal over; but fre¬ 
quently it dies after a while, and the 
wood usually decays inward, often de¬ 
stroying the tree. 

The cause of the gumming disease is 
not known. The writer is taking up a 
study of this trouble, with the view of 
discovering the cause, if possible, and 
finding a good remedy. Dr. Ernst Bes- 
sey, in his report for 1907, says: “In 
some cases it seems to be due possibly to 
the unfavorable effect of the stock on the 
scion, for it is far more abundant in 
those trees where the scion is larger than 
the stock.” In California a disease called 
“Qummosis,” which causes a gumming 
of citrus trees, has been thought to be 
a physiological trouble. 

Remedy— Gumming has been success¬ 
fully checked in some cases by scraping 
the diseased areas, and painting over the 
wounds with some disinfectant. Carbo- 
lineum, one part to one part of water, 
may be used. Prof. R. E. Smith of the 
California Experiment Station, recom¬ 
mends the following remedy for the 
Gummosis found in that State: Peel off 
the bark without scraping the wood un¬ 
derneath, and cover the wound with a 
kind of grafting wax prepared by melt¬ 
ing four pounds of resin, one pound of 
beeswax and one pound of raw linseed 
oil. This is put on with a brush while 
warm and liquid. 

BLIGHT. 

This is one of the most dreaded, and 
probably most destructive diseases of 
citrus trees in Florida. How many thou¬ 
sands of dollars are annually lost by 


blight, it is difficult to estimate. I11 1895 
Profs. Swingle and Webber estimated the 
loss from this disease at from one hun¬ 
dred to two hundred thousand dollars an¬ 
nually, and it is probably more than that 
now. Blight is one of those diseases that 
is extremely hard to diagnose. Even aft¬ 
er years of experience a grower will tell 
you that he cannot tell at once when a 
tree is struck by blight. It often comes 
on so gradually, without any definitely 
marked symptoms, that one can only be 
sure of a tree having the blight after the 
disease has progressed for some time. 
The disease was first fully described by 
Profs. Swingle and Webber in 1895. It 
usually appears on trees that have pre¬ 
viously seemed healthy and in good bear¬ 
ing condition. It often takes the largest 
and best trees in a grove. The first in¬ 
dication is usually a wilting of the foli¬ 
age, as if the trees were suffering from 
lack of moisture. Most often this occurs 
in early spring, and at first appears most 
pronounced on dry, hot days, but later 
this wilting is seen to persist even through 
the wet or damp weather. The whole 
top may show the disease at once, but 
often a single limb will first show signs 
of wilting. As the disease progresses and 
the rainy season comes on, numerous 
water sprouts are put out from the trunk 
and large limbs. These look healthy at 
first, but finally sicken and die. 

Much technical study and many exper¬ 
iments have been devoted to this disease 
in order to discover the cause and to find 
a remedy. Profs. Swingle and Webber 
did a large amount of work upon it. Their 
work was brought to a sudden end by 
the freezes of 1894-95. Since then, Prof. 
Rolfs, while at the sub-tropical laboratory 




84 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


at Miami continued the study of this 
mysterious trouble, but its cause has not 
yet been determined. Between $30,000 
and $40,000 has been expended upon it, 
and while much information as to the 
development and nature of the disease 
has been collected, most of this has been 
of a negative character as far as prac¬ 
tically useful results are concerned. There 
is need for a more thorough investigation 
of this trouble carried on regularly and 
systematically for a number of years. 
The investigation of a disease of this na¬ 
ture presents unusually great difficulties. 
The fact that it apparently takes at least 
seven years for a tree to develop symp¬ 
toms of the disease, and that blight oc¬ 
curs usually in large bearing trees, makes 
the investigation difficult. The amount 
of time needed for working out this prob¬ 
lem and the difficulties in the way, make 
the field a rather uninviting one for the 
scientist. A sufficient amount of money 
and a sufficient number of years for the 
working out of such a problem are things 
that it is almost impossible to secure un¬ 
der present conditions. We are expected 
to show results at once. What politician 
is willing to trust a scientist to work ten 
years before calling upon him to show 
them? Yet this time would probably be 
needed to attain definite results with 
citrus blight. 

In some respects the disease resembles 
peach yellows, and everyone who has fol¬ 
lowed the investigation of that disease 
knows that a great amount of money has 
been expended and years of study have 
been given to this trouble, but as yet 
there is no remedy discovered except the 
complete destruction of diseased trees. 
This too, is the only remedy yet known 


for blight, also called “wilt/’ of orange 
trees. The only treatment is to dig up 
and destroy the trees as soon as they show 
clearly that they are affected with blight. 
It is dangerous to dally with this disease; 
for while one is trying to cure one tree, 
the disease is likely to spread to others 
adjoining. 

BUCKSKIN. 

Grapefruit often develops a peculiar 
thickened and roughened appearance of 
the rind which is known by growers as 
buckskin or sharkskin. The rind be¬ 
comes abnormally thick and presents a 
scurfy rough appearance well character¬ 
ized by the word buckskin. This trouble 
was quite serious in (some places ilast 
season. It renders the fruit very infer¬ 
ior, and in many cases almost worthless. 
This trouble is probably due to some sur¬ 
face-growing fungus that works upon the 
outer cells and irritates the rind in such 
a way as to cause abnormal thickening. 
The real cause of the trouble is, how¬ 
ever, yet to be determined definitely. The 
trouble has not been sufficiently studied 
for us to be able to give any remedy 
based on experiments. The fact that the 
trouble appears to be due to a surface¬ 
growing fungus would indicate that Bor¬ 
deaux mixture would be an efficient pre¬ 
ventive. A few years ago a series of 
spraying experiments for the control of 
this disease was made by Prof. Rolfs in 
an orange grove where buckskin fruit 
had been abundant the year before. After 
the spraying had been done it was found 
that the buckskin did not appear that 
year even on the unsprayed plots, so that 
it was impossible to get any information 
from the experiment. This disease ap-

pears to be one of those minor troubles 
that come and go. Some years it is quite 
bad, while other years it is scarcely at all 
noticeable. We are now making a study 
of this disease. 

scab. 

Scab is a disease which is ordinarily 
of rather minor importance, but which 
may at times break out upon young 
leaves and fruits of lemons, grapefruit 
and satsumas, in a very destructive way. 
It is sometimes known as “sour scab,” 
because it is so invariably found upon 
sour oranges and lemons. It is probably 
found on sour oranges in almost every 
citrus-growing district in the State. 

The earliest infections are on young 
leaves about one-tenth full size, as mi¬ 
nute, light-brown or cork-colored points. 
Soon the spots become depressed on one 
side of the leaf and raised on the other. 
Older spots become dark brown and 
sometimes pinkish in color. The sep¬ 
arate spots coalesce as they enlarge, form¬ 
ing irregular corky scabs. The leaves 
are contorted, twisted and warped. The 
fruit, when affected, presents a warty 
appearance. 

The disease is caused by a minute fun¬ 
gus (Cladosporium citri) that grows into 
the tissue of the leaves. The spores of 
this fungus are so small that it would 
take about 8,000 side by side to measure 
one inch. Pure growths of the scab fun¬ 
gus were obtained in a nutrient jelly by 
sowing some of these minute spores, and 
a study was made of the fungus as it 
grew on this jelly. When the fungus had 
grown sufficiently to produce a good crop 
of spores, these were sprayed on to small 
sour orange trees that were in the green¬ 


house and were free from scab. In a 
few days the characteristic scab spots ap¬ 
peared, proving that this fungus was the 
real cause of scab, and that the infection 
came from the growth of the spores that 
had been put upon the surface of the 
leaves. 

Treatment —Sometimes the disease 
breaks out early in the year, on quite 
young leaves and fruits, and in a very 
severe form. The only known preven¬ 
tive of its spread is Bordeaux mixture 
applied early in the year. The same care 
should be used in applying the Bordeaux 
as when spraying to cure withertip, or 
its application will be followed by an in¬ 
crease of scale insects. 

SMOKY FUNGUS. 

The smoky appearance of the orange 
caused by the smoky fungus (Leptothy- 
rium pomi?) is not to be confused with 
the blackening due to the sooty mold 
which accompanies the whitefly. The 
smoky fungus may occur when the white- 
fly is absent. It causes no noticeable in¬ 
jury to the fruit itself. It does, however, 
mask the bright color of the fruit by a 
layer of dark-colored, mycelial threads, 
which spread over the surface of the 
rind. It may be rubbed off with the fin¬ 
gers, and so is attributed by some growers 
to the accumulation of dust from the air. 
It is most apt to occur in moist groves, 
late in the fall, and on oranges that have 
remained on the tree after they are ripe. 
The selling quality of the fruit is natur¬ 
ally somewhat impaired by the presence 
of this fungus. 

Remedies —>(i.) The smokiness may 
be readily removed from the fruit by 
putting it through a washer like those 


86 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


used for freeing fruit from the sooty 
mold fungus. (2.) In the course of our 
investigations on the scaly bark disease 
it was noticed incidentally that Bordeaux 
mixture was effective in preventing the 
appearance of the smoky fungus, if ap¬ 
plied at the proper time of the year. One 
spraying, about the first of October, kept 
off the smoky fungus and did not cause 
sufficient increase in scale insects to injure 
the appearance of the fruit. Two or 
three sprayings, however, during the 
summer, caused such an increase in the 
number of scale insects as to materially 
injure the fruit, leaves and small branch¬ 
es. This increase in scale insects was 
due to the Bordeaux mixture having 
killed the fungi that were parasitic upon 
them, thus giving them immunity from 
their fungus enemies. When spraying 
ro prevent attacks of smoky fungus it 
may be suggested that the solution should 
be applied, as far as possible, only to the 
x ruit. The spray should be kept away 
from the larger limbs and the trunk, 
where the beneficial fungi are usually lo¬ 
cated in considerable .abundance. A weak 
mixture, consisting of three pounds of 
quicklime and three pounds of copper 
sulphate to 50 gallons of water may be 
used. 

CONCLUSION. 

After all has been said in regard to 
diseases and their treatment, it remains 
true, as is well known, that a grove prop¬ 
erly cared for is not half as liable to 
disease as one that is neglected or mis¬ 
treated. Just as good sanitation and 
more healthful surroundings have been 
found to cut down the death-rate in a 
community of people, and prevent to a 


great extent, the spread of contagious 
disease; so the proper treatment of a 
grove will have a similar effect on the 
health of the community of citrus trees. 

The year after a vigorous grove of 
trees has borne an unusually large crop of 
fruit, is the time when the trees are 
quite apt to become diseased. At sucn ^ 
time a grove should receive unusual care 
because of the strain that was put upon 
it the previous year. Some diseases at¬ 
tack even the most vigorous trees in a 
grove; but the rule is, that weakness 
from any cause predisposes a tree to the 
attack of parasitic fungi or bacteria. The 
old saying, “An ounce of prevention is 
better than a pound of cure,” could be 
re-stated by the citrus grower as. “An 
ounce of brains, scattered through an 
orange grove is worth more than a pound 
of Milestone put on as Bordeaux mix¬ 
ture.” Yet there are times when the 
pound of bluestone may be necessary to 
correct conditions over which the ounce 
of brains has had no control. 

Prof, fawcett (In reply to ques¬ 
tions)— 

It is very important to remember, 
that scaly, bark was with us for forty 
years, as near as we can find out from the 
old growers, but did not cause much 
trouble until the withertip made its ap¬ 
pearance. 

I think you all recognize the fact that 
a tree that is well cared for is more resis¬ 
tant than a tree carelessly cared for. 

The first year we used .Bordeaux Mix¬ 
ture the scale came up by the thousands, 
but the second year we put on limbs bear¬ 
ing the scale fungi about four or five 
days after the spraying was done. During 
the second year very few scale insects

87 


developed and it was remarkable to see 
how free from scale the groves kept. 

We used the red-headed, the white- 
headed and the black-headed fungi. I 
have used all three. The diminution of 
scale may have been due to some other 
cause; it may have been the lady birds, 
but it appeared to be the use of the fungi, 

I think that some of the people in the 
State are calling the gum disease scaly 
bark. The true scaly bark is found very 
little, if at all, outside of Hillsborough 
County. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Temple—You say it takes seven 
years for this disease blight to develop 
in the tree after the seed is sown. Then 
you say it is contagious. When does the 
contagion take place; before it is shown in 
the tree from which the disease is taken, 
or afterwards? Suppose I have a tree 
I suspect of having blight. If I immediate¬ 
ly destroy that tree, root, branch and all, 
are the trees already infected or does the 
infection not take place until there is a 
further state of development of the dis¬ 
ease in the tree I have destroyed. 

Prof. Fawcett—I don’t know. Pos¬ 
sibly I have mis-stated that a little. Pos¬ 
sibly it is that the tree must be seven 
years old before it can take this disease. 
What do you think, Prof. Swingle? 

Prof. Swingle—I don’t know, either. 
As far as means of contagion are con¬ 
cerned, it has been suspected that the 


tree may have been infected through the 
flower. 

Now, before we adjourn I wish to say 
just one word about the blight. Next to 
the whitefly I don’t think anything is 
more generally feared in this state than 
the blight, for the reason that it does not 
spare an orange grower. He may be 
ever so careful about his method of fer¬ 
tilizing and treatment of the trees but 
still the blight comes, and it is most dis¬ 
couraging to find symptoms of this seem¬ 
ingly incurable disease. I wish merely to 
point out the fact that you have in this 
State a man who is eminently capable of 
treating just this disease. Now, you 
know how the government demands re¬ 
sults almost immediately after they have 
appropriated money for a certain pur¬ 
pose. Some sort of result must be shown 
in a specific time. It is entirely out of 
the question to get results on the blight 
in a short time. It simply can’t be done. 
I do believe, however, that the way is 
open. In case it is not found possible 
for a committee of this state to obtain 
the money from the department, I would 
suggest the possibility of utilizing the 
Adams fund. This is granted by the 
government for scientific research. They 
are not supposed to show immediate re¬ 
sults for the Adams fund. This is a sum 
of money exempt from the pressing de¬ 
mands for results. 

You understand I am speaking in a 
private capacity but have reason to be¬ 
lieve if a syndicate could raise as much as 
$2,000 or $3,000 per annum it would be 
possible to secure a grant from the Adams 
fund enough to get a man like Prof. Faw¬ 
cett, and he would have the liberty to 
work this problem out in his own good, 



88

thorough time. Of course, you must re¬ 
member that a man doing this work must 
be paid a good salary and it means the 
expenditure of a large sum of money and 
I would suggest that if the orange grow¬ 
ers can secure from the state legislature 


or underwrite it themselves, it would be 
possible to draw upon the Adams fund 
for a considerable amount, and I am sure 
both the federal and state authorities will 
co-operate with them. 


YELLOW SPOTTING OF CITRUS LEAVES. 


By B. F. Floyd. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

A greasy yellow spotting of citrus 
leaves has been reported to the experi¬ 
ment station from numerous localities in 
the citrus-growing belt of the State. In 
some cases, it apparently caused much 
damage. An investigation of this trouble 
was started in the laboratory of plant 
physiology in January, 1908. A close 
study has been made of the distribution 
and prevalence of this disease in Florida, 
and of its gross effect upon the affected 
trees. Its effect upon the leaf has been 
studied in the laboratory. Numerous at¬ 
tempts have been made to isolate organ¬ 
isms that might be the cause of the mal¬ 
ady. 

Very little is known of the history of 
this disease. It has been known for sev¬ 
eral years, but there are no reports of its 
presence previous to the freeze of 1894- 
95. There is no evidence that the disease 
originated in any particular part of the 
State. It may almost entirely disappear 
in localities where it has been present 
for many years, and appear again after 


an interval. This is perhaps due to vary¬ 
ing climatic conditions. 

From the evidence which has been col¬ 
lected, this disease belongs to the same 
class as Frenching, Melanose, Dieback, 
and Blight; all of which are due either to 
unfavorable soil conditions, improper 
treatment, or to as yet unknown causes. 

DISTRIBUTION. 

The Yellow Spotting of citrus leaves is 
met with in the State from the East Coast 
to the West Coast. It has been reported 
from Lake City in the North and from as 
far South as Miami. 

Its prevalence varies considerably in 
different groves in the same locality. In 
some groves or parts of groves, there 
may be only a few leaves affected on any 
tree, mostly in the upper portion of the 
tree. There may be many trees in be¬ 
tween the diseased ones, upon which no 
spotted leaves can be found. Other 
groves close by may have nearly eveiy 
tree affected, and on many trees a healthy 
leaf may be hard to find. 

In November, 1908, a careful survey

of the groves in one locality was con¬ 
ducted to see if the disease was limited 
to any particular soil or method of treat¬ 
ment. The disease was found to be pres¬ 
ent upon all soils in that section. The 
soils were mostly hammock or high pine 
land. The disease was equally present 
in groves that had received clean culture, 
in those that had no cultivation, and in 
those that had been more or less culti¬ 
vated. The disease was equally preva¬ 
lent in a shedded grove and in one that 
was not shedded, the two being located 
side by side. 

In the shedded grove, where sections 
of the roof had been removed, so as to 
expose to direct sunlight portions of 
trees that were previously shedded, the 
spotting was found to be more plentiful. 

Very few trees under three to four 
years of age were diseased. In the ma¬ 
jority of cases, the disease was most pre¬ 
valent upon trees that had recently borne 
a heavy crop of fruit. This would sug¬ 
gest a relation of the disease to the weak¬ 
ened condition of these trees. 

The spotting was found to be worst in 
the upper branches of the trees. When 
present on the lower branches it is usually 
thinly scattered. It often happens that a 
particular branch or twig may have the 
majority of its leaves affected, whereas 
the leaves of neighboring branches are 
perfectly healthy. This is particularly 
noticeable in trees that are only slightly 
diseased. Since these branches seem 
equally strong, there is presumptive evi¬ 
dence that the origin of the disease is 
within the plant, or in the soil. 

The disease is not confined to any par¬ 
ticular variety of citrus. It is most evi¬ 
dent on the grape fruit, on account of 


the larger size and deeper color of its 
leaves; and it is least evident upon the 
tangerine, on account of the smallness of 
the leaves. The disease is equally harm¬ 
ful to all the varieties of citrus which 
may be affected by it. 

SYMPTOMS. 

The symptoms of the Yellow Spotting 
of citrus are confined to the leaves. A 
spotting of the fruit resembling the spot¬ 
ting on the leaves, has been noticed in 
only one case. 

There are many variations in the gross 
appearance of the spots, thus making it 
difficult to give an exact description of 
them. These variations are evidently due 
to the different reactions of the leaf-tissue 
to the disease stimulus. The typical spots 
on the leaves are yellowish to golden-col¬ 
ored areas, a fraction of an inch or more 
in diameter. They usually occur be¬ 
tween the main veins and extend through 
the substance of the leaf. The areas dif¬ 
fer in appearance on the upper and un¬ 
der surfaces. On the upper surface, the 
yellowish or golden color is more notice¬ 
able ; the central portion of the area is 
often darker in color than the margin. 
It often presents a shiny, dark-brown ap¬ 
pearance. The discolored area is not 
raised above the surrounding surface of 
the leaf. The surface of the spot on the 
lower side of the leaf is often rough and 
projecting. It usually has a dull, greasy 
look, and a yellowish-brown or olive-green 
color. The surface in old spots may be¬ 
come dark colored and melanose-like.

leaf when studied under the microscope, 
shows the leaf to be made up of layers 
of cells, Fig. i. The upper surface of

the leaf consists of one layer of cells, 
known as epidermal cells. Just beneath 
the epidermis lie two layers of cells that 
are much longer than broad, and are ar¬ 
ranged as so many columns standing side 
by side, giving the appearance of a pal¬ 
isade. These cells are known as the 
palisade cells. Beneath these there are 
several layers of loosely arranged cells. 
These form arches and columns, leaving 
considerable air-spaces in between them. 
These cells constitute the spongy tissue of

the leaf. Beneath the spongy tissue is 
the lower surface of the leaf, which con¬ 
sists of one layer of epidermal cells, with 
openings for air, etc. 

Cross-sections of the yellow spots, 
when studied under the microscope, show 
the cells of the spongy tissue to be so 
swollen that the air-spaces between the 
cells are completely filled, Fig. 2. This 
swelling also causes a pushing out of the 
lower epidermis making the spot project. 
A brownish gum-like substance occurs 
at intervals between the cells. This is a 
secretion from the cells. In Fig. 2 this 
substance is shown in the shaded portion. 
A brownish deposit also fills the upper 
epidermal cells. It is this that gives the 
dark color to the center of the spot on 
the upper surface of the leaf. 

Corky tissue also develops, particularly 
in late stages of the spotting. It is the 
formation of this cork that gives the 
areas their melanose-like appearance. The 
corky tissue usually develops only on the 
lower surface of the leaf. It arises by 
division of the epidermal cells, Fig. 1. 
The corky tissue may also develop on the 
upper epidermis, taking its origin by di¬ 
vision of the upper epidermal cells. 


OTHER CASES OF YELLOWING OF CITRUS 

LEAVES. 

There are several different yellow ap¬ 
pearances on citrus leaves that may be 
confused with the yellow spotting. The 
yellow spotting differs in gross appear¬ 
ance from these by its dull greasy look 
and slight projection on the under sur¬ 
face, Fig. 2. 

The most common yellowing with 
which the yellow spotting may be con-

fused is that produced by the presence of 
insects such as the purple scale (Mytilas- 
pis citricola), on the lower surface of the 
leaf. In this case, there is only a loss of 
green color, and usually the insect or its 
remains may be found on the lower sur¬ 
face of the leaf. Again, unless the tree

is severely infested with the scale, the af¬ 
fected leaves are confined to the lower 
branches. 

There is often a yellowing of the 
leaves on trees badly diseased with die- 
back, which much resembles the yellow 
spotting, on the upper surface of the leaf; 
but these yellowed leaves lack the greasy 
projecting appearance on the lower sur¬ 
face that is characteristic of the yellow 
spotting. The yellow spotting has been 
found to occur upon trees diseased with 
dieback, but the yellow spotted areas are 
readily distinguishable from the yellow¬ 
ing due to dieback. 

When trees are being starved, espe¬ 
cially with regard to ammonia, there is a 
yellowing of the leaves. But this should 
not be confused with yellow spotting, 
since this yellowing is merely a loss of 
green color, and does not occur in round¬ 
ed areas. 

A yellowing of the leaves similar to 
that produced by starvation, is caused by 
the withertip fungus (Colletotrichum 
gloeosporioides). It is almost impossible 
to give a description from which a branch 
diseased with the withertip fungus may 
be recognized. Besides the yellowing of 
the leaves which is caused by a poison se¬ 
creted by the fungus, the bark of the 
branch will usually have a dry, dark, iron- 
gray or steel-gray appearance. The whole 
branch will appear decidedly unhealthy. 
The withertip fungus also attacks the 
leaves, producing rounded areas of an 
ashy-gray appearance, covered with mi¬ 
nute black specks. These specks are the 
portions of the fungus that bear the spores 
by which the disease is spread. This is 
the spotting described by Prof. Hume in

his book “Citrus Fruits and Their Cul¬ 
ture/’ 

EFFECTS UPON THE PLANT. 

Healthy leaves are the digestive or¬ 
gans of the plant. They manufacture the 
plant-foods, starch and sugar, from wat¬ 
er brought up from the soil, and from 
carbon dioxide obtained directly from the 
air. When the working surface of the 
leaf is greatly reduced by any cause, 
there is a reduction in the quantity of 
food manufactured. By the swelling of 
the cells in the spongy tissue, the air¬ 
spaces between the cells become closed 
up. This interferes with the entrance of 
air into the interior of the leaf. The de¬ 
velopment of corky tissue also excludes 
the air from the leaves at these points. 
This reduces the supply of carbon diox¬ 
ide from which the starch is manufac¬ 
tured. 

The leaves are also the breathing or¬ 
gans of the plant. The energy with 
which the plant works is supplied by this 
respiration. The reduction of the air- 
supply thus weakens the plant by cutting 
down its supply of energy. 

If only a few leaves on a tree are affect¬ 
ed, the normal processes of the plant are 
not interfered with. But when the ma¬ 
jority of the leaves are diseased, the life- 
processes will be enfeebled, and a per¬ 
ceptible weakening of the tree will result. 
Herein lies the chief harm the disease 
does to the tree. This reduction of the 
vitality of the tree allows the withertip 
fungus to gain entrance. 

The withertip fungus is peculiar in 
that when the tree is of its normal 
strength, this fungus is unable to gain en¬ 
trance into the wood. But immediately 


the vitality of the tree is reduced at any 
point, particularly in the region of the 
young tissue, this fungus bores its way 
into the plant. Once within it secretes a 
poison that further weakens the tissue, 
and allows the fungus to proceed farther 
inwards. When the fungus reaches a 
point in the tree where its vitality is 
equalled by that of the tree, it is unable 
to proceed farther. At this point, the 
branch will form a callus which may be 
seen as a ring. 

Though in many places the yellow spot¬ 
ting has been seen associated with die- 
back, yet there is no proof that there is 
any relation between the two. 

Very often the disease is accompanied 
or followed by melanose. This is partic¬ 
ularly so if the trees have not been 
strengthened by proper care and fertiliz¬ 
ers. 

The leaves on trees that are badly 
spotted are usually undersized. This 
stunted growth is probably due to the 
starting of the disease before the leaves 
were fully developed. 

CAUSE. 

In searching for a cause for a disease 
one must distinguish between those fac¬ 
tors that influence it, and those that cause 
it. For example, certain forms of fer¬ 
tilizers or certain methods of treatment 
of the trees may be an aid to the disease 
in its spread. Yiet these are not the 
causal factors. 

As yet no cause has been found for 
this disease. There is some evidence from 
field observations that it is transmissible, 
but attempts to transmit it by inoculation 
have given negative results.

TREATMENT. 

Not knowing the cause a specific rem¬ 
edy cannot be recommended. But inas¬ 
much as the chief harm appears to be due 
to the withertip fungus that follows the 


spotting, the recommendation for dis¬ 
eased groves is to strengthen and build 
up the trees by cultural methods, so that 
this weakening may be counteracted; and 
the withertip fungus thus shut out. 


WHITEFLY RESOLUTIONS. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Prof. Hume—If this is considered by 
you a suitable time at which to do so, 
I should like to introduce a set of reso¬ 
lutions directed to the Secretary of Ag¬ 
riculture, in the interest of whitefly 
control. Many efforts are being set 
forth at this time, looking to the control 
of this menace to our citrus industry, 
and good work is being done in work¬ 
ing out methods by our Experiment 
Station workers and by the Bureau of 
Entomology experts. Much has been 
added to our knowledge of control both 
by fungous enemies and by fumigation 
and these methods properly handled 
will go a long way toward abating the 
nuisance. 

But the fungous enemies do not hold 
control without interruption. Fumiga¬ 
tion in some sections is not practicable 
and besides there are localities where 
re-investation would be impossible to 
guard against. 

Now, in this connection, I believe 
there is another method of control 
which deserves careful investigation. 
The native home of the whitefly is said 
to be in China, and there is no reason 
to doubt but that it is there, held in 
check by natural enemies, the most im¬ 


portant of which are doubtless insects. 
These we should have and since the na¬ 
tive home is known, the task of secur¬ 
ing the insect foes should not be a dif¬ 
ficult one. What is needed is the serv¬ 
ice of one or two expert men acquaint¬ 
ed with insects, and having a knowl¬ 
edge of the whitefly. The introduction 
of efficient insect enemies would be of 
immense importance not only to our 
state but to California and all other 
citrus districts of the country as well. 

Therefore be it resolved that we ap¬ 
preciate the work which is now being 
done looking to the control of the 
whitefly in this state, by the Bureau of 
Entomology, and the Florida Experi¬ 
ment Station. We express our approv¬ 
al of these lines of investigation which 
have already resulted in much good to 
the citrus industry both in this state 
and elsewhere in the United States 
where Citrus fruits are grown. 

Resolved that in furthering this con¬ 
trol work we believe the native home of 
the whitefly should be thoroughly in¬ 
spected to secure the natural enemies 
of the insect. 

Resolved that we earnestly petition 
the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
Bureau of Entomology or other divi- 




94 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sions of the Department of Agriculture 
to send to the native home of the white- 
fly investigators and explorers to se¬ 
cure the natural enemies, insect and 
fungous, of the whitefly and introduce 
them into this country to further assist 
in reducing its numbers and the damage 
which it does. 

Mr. Temple—I think in my own case 
and most of the other growers who have 
that foe to deal with, we find that he is 
the most active “bird” we know anything 
about. The people in charge of the va¬ 
rious stations with their fungus, Dr. Mor¬ 
rill with his fumigation, other people with 
their various sprays that I have tried in 
the most thorough and systematic manner 
possible; all have some way to combat 
this pest, and while they are all good to a 
certain extent, yet they offer only tempo¬ 
rary relief. Fumigation I know by ex¬ 
perience is good, because I fumigated one 
of my groves and it killed everything that 
way in there, but in thirty days the grove 
was infested again with the whitefly. The 
methods now employed might be used to 
advantage if the whitefly was only a local 
nuisance but there isn’t much use in go¬ 
ing to all the trouble and expense to 
fumigate and spray when the first wind 
that blows will bring in a fresh swarm 
from an adjoining grove. My home place 
is on a lake and when the flies are on the 
wing and the wind happens to be in the 
north, they come across in swarms like 
blind mosquitoes. As they are not the re¬ 
sult of spontaneous generation, they must 
come from somewhere. They have a hab¬ 
itat somewhere; Prof. Hume says 
China; if that is true we should dislike 
China more for her whitefly peril than 
her Yellow Peril. We must get at some 


method of controlling permanently this 
menace, some whitefly evil that will sub¬ 
ject it before it subjects us, and I think 
the people who suffer from! it feel as 
strongly as I do. Now, you people who 
haven’t the whitefly, don’t feel slighted; 
you’ll get it. You are just as much in¬ 
terested in this, because you are going to 
find out why we feel so strongly. 

Mr. Hart-—I also wish to second these 
resolutions most heartily. It is work 
along the lines I think will be most ef¬ 
fective. Mr. Temple has expressed my 
sentiments in regard to it exactly. I be¬ 
lieve to obtain permanent relief we will 
have to depend on the natural enemies. 
It is not only on our groves but all about 
us on other places. If the department will 
make an effort and it is successful, in a 
short time I am satisfied it will cause the 
whitefly to drop back as a minor trouble. 
I am sure the department will assist us in 
this matter if we go at it in the right 
way, and I will be willing to contribute 
liberally to send a horticultural explorer 
finomi this state. I heartily second the 
resolution. 

Mr. Temple—I will be glad to be a sec¬ 
ond member of Mr. Hart's syndicate to 
under-write it. 

Mr. Parker—I also wish to heartily 
second this motion. I have several times 
made a statement to different parties that 
I thought the time was at hand to locate 
the home of the whitefly and its natural 
enemies, and I think the time is now. 
Fumigation, sprays and fungi are all do¬ 
ing good work. Fumigation and spraying 
are artificial means and fungi are the 
natural means, but we need all the help 
we can get. 

I understand our worthy President is 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

going abroad and expects to spend some 
time in the eastern countries. I am sure 
he will be interested in hunting up or 
finding whiteflies there, and probably 
sending them 1 to us after he is sure they 
are all good and dead, for comparison. 
He must be sure they are dead, though, 
for we want nothing imported but “good” 
whiteflies. 

Prof. Swingle—I am glad this matter 
has been brought up because I believe no 
one subject is of more general interest. 
I do not think it is generally understood 
the numerous difficulties that stand in 
the way of fumigation in this State. The 
mere mechanical means of handling tents 
is a serious matter. Then there are peo¬ 
ple who' do not and will not fumigate and 
we know the whitefly can migrate rapidly 
to considerable distances aided by a fa¬ 
voring wind. 

If it is found impossible, as it often is 
to secure government aid, because the ap¬ 
propriations are made two years in ad¬ 
vance, I would suggest co-operation with 
the orange growers of Texas and Califor¬ 
nia because it is a great menace in both 
of these States, and I am sure the grow¬ 
ers there will be glad to assist you. 

Mr. Painter—Would it not help us to 
obtain an agent from the government by 
our offering to contribute towards that 
expense, showing that we are willing to 
do our part towards accomplishing the 
end we seek? If it will, I want to be one 
of the number to help. 

Pfrof. Swingle—I do not think the 
matter has ever been adequately present¬ 
ed. It is not realized that fumigation is 
not a, complete remedy. They should 
have the matter presented to them by 
someone who is thoroughly familiar with 


conditions and has the whole situation at 
his finger’s ends. 

Mr. Hart—If we could get help by 
sending a delegation to Washington to 
bring the matter before committees there, 
it would be given much more attention 
than anything we could write out and 
send them in the form of a resolution. I 
think action in that line would be good. 

Mr. Painter—If the people will offer 
to pay half or more of the expenses of 
such an agent, the Department would 
take to it quicker than if we send a re¬ 
quest to them to send an agent. 

Dr. Richardson—It sometimes hap¬ 
pens that we think we experience religion 
early in life, but we find that we do not 
really get down to an enjoyment of its 
full beauties until we get pretty near the 
end. I think we have got down now to 
the most vital matter yet presented to this 
Society. I think the Department at Wash¬ 
ington should take this matter up; inde¬ 
pendent action may do us some good. 
There is always a danger, you know, of 
the introduction of enemies to bring 
something worse than the pest; therefore 
it should be a thoroughly competent man 
who would not do that thing. You re¬ 
member the story about the two Germans 
who wanted to go out on a coon hunt and 
borrowed a neighbor’s dog. Finally the 
dog treed something and Max said 
“Hans, hadn’t I better go up the tree and 
shake him down?” So he went up the 
tree and almost immediately a most tre¬ 
mendous racket commenced. Hans yelled 
“Max, do you vant me to come oop and 
help you hold him:?”’ “No, Hans,” said 
Max, “but come up and help me turn 
him loose.” He had got hold of a wild 
cat instead of a coon. Now, in our busi- 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


96 

ness, we don’t want to* get hold of any 
wild cat that we can’t turn loose. There 
is considerable danger of it. I know of one 
man who tried a harmless (?) remedy in 
his fly infested grove, and it has nearly 
destroyed his grove. Now, we want to- 
send some man who is willing to take 
this matter up thoroughly and do* it in an 
intelligent manner. No doubt you appre¬ 
ciate that fact 

Now, so far as your President going 
abroad, he is going merely as a superfic¬ 
ial observer. I will not have time or abili¬ 
ty to take up this subject, but of course 
I will observe carefully and do what 
I can for you. 

I think this resolution is one of the 
most important things that has been be¬ 


fore us and I hope it will be adopted. 

Motion made, seconded and carried 
that the Committee sent to the American 
Bornological Society, namely, Messrs. 
Tabor, Hume and Painter, visit the De¬ 
partment and submit this resolution in 
writing. 

Prof. Swingle—I wish to make a mo¬ 
tion that our retiring president be ap¬ 
pointed an official representative of this 
Society on his trip and that any courtesy 
extended to him will be appreciated by 
the Society. I have had experience, and 
I think something official will aid him in 
getting access to gardens, both private 
and public and get him facilities that a 
strictly private citizen might not be able 
to secure. Motion seconded and carried. 


Report From Committee Visiting California. 


By W. S. Hart. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I am a little afraid that our members 
present may be disappointed in the val¬ 
ue of my report of the visit to California, 
for the reason that I did not know until 
this morning that a report was expected. 
If the convention had been held a week 
or ten days later so that more of the 
members of that committee could have 
been present, then we might have had a 
very important and valuable report, I am 
sure. Since my return I have not really 
had time to give a thought to the matter 
much less to get our experiences and im¬ 
pressions up in a systematic form. If 1 
miss any points, just fire the questions at 
me and I will do my best to answer them. 

In the beginning let me say that this 
party started out, not for a pleasure expe¬ 
dition, but for business. It is true that 
we had every courtesy shown us, every 
comfort that modern convenience could 
supply in the way of Pullman cars, din¬ 
ers, observation car and a club car; three 
cars being devoted to our exclusive use, 
and on the way back there was as much 
of this as we needed, though part of our 
party was left on the way. We stopped at 
the Grand Canyon on our way out and the 
Pullmans were kept there for us. As we 
went to Los Angeles the next day and 
while still in the desert a committee came 
out to meet us from San Bernardino, 


bringing flowers and fruits and in that 
party were fruit growers, bankers and 
others who could answer intelligently al¬ 
most any question we might ask of,them. 

When we got to Los Angeles, the 
Chamber of Commerce gave us the Direc¬ 
tors’ room in which to hold our meet¬ 
ings, which was most excellent for that 
purpose. The California Fruit Ex¬ 
change invited us to be present at their 
business meetings so that we might 
see the inside workings of their system 
and they showed us their books and 
gave us every opportunity possible to 
study the marketing system of Cali¬ 
fornia which is, no doubt, the best in 
this country. If their method of 
handling fruit can be adapted to our 
state so as to meet the needs and require¬ 
ments of at least a large portion of the 
shippers, as I am sure it can be, it will 
mean a saving of hundreds of thousands 
of dollars every year. 

Leaving our baggage at Los Angeles, 
Messrs. Powell and Burton conducted our 
party to Garina, Azuso, Pomona, San 
Dirnas, Riverside, Redlands, San Ber¬ 
nardino and other places and for two 
days we were taken through die groves, 
through the packing houses and through 
the most beautiful spots of one of the 
most beautiful countries in the world. 
We were given every opportunity of 


7 



98 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


studying their system of packing and 
handling fruit. At Riverside we were 
taken to the top of cpiite a high moun¬ 
tain, standing alone in the valley, where 
we could look down upon twenty-five to 
thirty thousand acres of thrifty orang'e 
groves with the San Bernardino range 
of snow-clad mountains to shelter them, 
and form) a noble background for this 
beautiful picture. 

Leaving Los Angeles, we continued on 
to San Francisco, then to Chicago where 
we were taken all over the city in an 
automobile, through the wholesale fruit 
districts, etc., then home. 

I hardly know where to commence; 
there is so much material I can only give 
you a little smattering. 

The president suggests that I give you 
an idea of the size of the groves, trees, 
etc. I will say that the trees, many of 
them, are not large; perhaps they may 
average something like ours, but I was 
taken through one grove, Mr. Powell's 
grove, at Azusa, where the record returns 
for California were -made. In one crop 
they made $5,000 off two acres. These 
trees were large and being budded at Va¬ 
lencia late, the fruit comes to market in 
the summer and fall and meets m> compe- 
tion. Further north, in Tulare County, 
large areas are being planted and a great 
many young groves are coming on. They 
tell me they are planting very heavily 
around that point. I am, told that the 
fruit raised is of a much finer quality, be¬ 
ing more like a Florida orange. I saw 
some of them at San Francisco, that were 
really very good fruit. 

Some of the California handling and 
packing system can be adopted and ap¬ 
plied by the large growers here in this 


state, but I want to tell you that the Cali¬ 
fornia orange will stand treatment that 
would put a Florida orang'e out of busi¬ 
ness. Take for instance, just the mere 
method of putting on the covers. They 
fill their boxes full of oranges level to the 
top, then they put on another layer. It is 
then put under the press and the cover 
brought down and nailed. Suppose we 
tried that with our fruit. The person who 
did so would be soaking wet in five min¬ 
utes from the juice flying from the or¬ 
anges. Yet Mr. Powell who has done so 
much to improve the methods in Cali¬ 
fornia, told me that the top layer did 
not show decay as much as the middle. 

A great many of the packers and ship¬ 
pers think they are handling fruit very 
carefully and they are taking a great deal 
of pains to do so, but there are those 
in Florida who can discount them in the 
handling and grading of oranges. They 
really don’t know what really careful 
handling and packing is. Perhaps they 
do not need to, however, as their fruit 
will stand much rougher handling than 
ours. They have been held up to us as 
models and justly so in many ways and 
they have many methods that we might 
follow to our advantage, but they may 
also learn much from, a careful study of 
Florida methods and practices. 

Some of the packing houses are operat¬ 
ed by the independents, and some, the 
greater number, of course, are under the 
fruit exchange management. There are a 
great many different methods, but in a 
general way they resemble each other. 
In some, the fruit is first washed or 
brushed and then it goes on to the belts 
that carry it along to be graded. After 
grading it goes into the long sizers, thir-

ty-tvvo feet long, most of them. In some 
of the houses they use an electric sizer 
where the oranges are carried along on a 
belt until a certain size will trip a certain 
finger which causes it to be kicked off the 
belt into the packing bins. The fruit of 
California is all sized by the smallest 
diameter. Our fruit needs to be sized by 
the largest. Therefore, we have to have 
a different system, of sizing than they 
have there. They have a box-making and 
nailing machine that will nail from 1,200 
to 2,400 boxes a day. The machine turns 
them off very rapidly. One man to at¬ 
tend the machine can turn out 1,200 com¬ 
plete boxes or more; two men about 
2,400 boxes a day. Their boxes are made 
with two pieces on each side and this ma¬ 
chine turns them off complete. They use 
a fancy label that they paste on the head 
of the box, as you probably all know. 
Quite a number of packers of the state 
told me that they wish that they had nev¬ 
er been adopted, but still they look very 
pretty and they have a very great variety 
of designs. 

Instead of grading by number, they 
grade by brand and have a different 
brand' for each quality as put up. There 
is one packing house at Riverside that 
now stamps a little tag right onto the 
orange. When you unwrap the orange, 
there is a little elephant that stays right 
with the orange until it is eaten. The 
orange never loses its identity. Pre-cool¬ 
ing before shipping is being carefully 
tested there with very satisfactory results. 
The marketing system was explained at 
our last meeting. I will not attempt to give 
you that now, because I think most of 
you have had it through what Dr. In¬ 
man has said. 


Question—How far apart are the trees 
planted in the old groves and the new 
ones, and about what is the average crop ' J 

Mr. Hart—Well, the trees are planted 
at various distances as in this state and I 
think they will average about the same 
distance apart as on our hammock lands. 
I don’t think many of them are as far 
apart as in some groves on the pine land 
here. Those very large trees I spoke of 
covered only two acres and were much 
larger than any others I saw. I don’t 
know what their yield was in boxes but 
four, five and six boxes to the tree seems, 
to be about the average judging from 
what we could learn there. 

Ouestion—Tell us about the cleaning 
system: 

Mr. Hart—Most of the oranges are 
washed or brushed, although some are 
not. Where the fruit is clean and they can 
avoid it, many neither wash or brush it, 
while in other groves, all the fruit is 
washed. Some of it is run through a so¬ 
lution of permanganate of potash to kill 
all germs, but Mr. Powell told me that 
no chemical could be used that would 
kill the spores of blue mould. 

Dr. Richardson—Is that used in such 
strength as to color the orange any? It 
is one of the active discolorants of water 
and possibly it may color the fruit. 

Mr. Hart—No, I don’t think you can 
discover any effect of that kind on the 
orange. 

Dr. Richardson—It is used for the pur¬ 
pose of destroying germs, possibly. It is 
one of the best germicides known. 

Mr. Gillette—How does the quality of 
their Tardiff orange compare with ours? 

Mr. Hart—It is a thicker skinned 1 
fruit, and a darker red, but is not as 



100 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


heavy a fruit and I think will average 
smaller. 

Mr. Dade—Do they have rusty 

oranges there ? 

Mr. Hart—No, I don’t think they have 
the rust mite there. I talked with the 
horticultural commissioner about it and 
they thought they had, but the specimens 
they showed me did not show the effect 
of the rust mite. I think it must be 
something else. They have had a little 
touch of the whitefly but are confident 
that they have wiped it out. The commis¬ 
sioner told me he would give me $5.00 to 
find a whitefly. They exterminated it 
with fumigation; that is, they cover the 
trees with tents and treat them with gas. 
In California, that is a very much more 
(simple matter than in Florida. Where 
there is irrigation they can raise almost 
anything—orange trees, pepper trees, 
eucalyptus and roses galore; oh, such 
roses!—flowers of all kinds, but just out¬ 
side the line of irrigation there is noth¬ 
ing but sage brush or scrub; no timber at 
all, while in this country we have plants 
and trees that are host plants for the fly, 
scattered all over everywhere. Now if 
they can clean up a grove out there, the 
whitefly does not come in from outside. 
It is true orange groves there are all in 
one great body generally, but if they gas 
their trees and do it universally—(and 
they have laws there which make it com¬ 
pulsory—I don't see why they cannot just 
about exterminate him. With us it is en¬ 
tirely different and a far more difficult 
proposition. We have got a state full of 
china berry trees and all other kind of 
trees that harbor the whitefly about as 
well as the orange trees and when we fum¬ 
igate or spray to kill the ones that are in 


the grove, the ones from the outside sit 
around and wait until we have finished 
and then come right in and live with us. 

Their worst enemy seemis to be the 
black scale, which is confined largely to 
the coast. The purple scale, which with 
us is a minor trouble, seems to trouble 
them a great deal. They have a gum dis¬ 
ease among them. The gum will ooze 
from the limb or the trunk. They tell 
me the disease commences from the in¬ 
side of the trunk and in a little while the 
limib or trunk is dead. They have no 
treatment that they claim to be a posi¬ 
tive cure but several things are recom¬ 
mended for it. It very much resembles 
the foot rot on our trees only that it ap¬ 
pears higher up in the tree. The best 
remedy they have found is to dig out 
the dirt and expose the roots. Some ap¬ 
ply one or another application to it, but 1 
think that the most satisfactory remedy 
that they use is to just dig under the 
trees and expose the roots. 

Question—I would like to hear about 
the labor they have in picking and pack¬ 
ing fruit. How does it compare in intelli¬ 
gence and availability with ours and 
what do they have to pay for it. 

M,r. Hart—They use white help most¬ 
ly. The greater portion of their fruit is 
packed by white men and women. In 
some packing-houses they use the Chinese 
and I think they are found quite satis¬ 
factory help, too. They seem faithful 
and a number of growers to whom I 
talked seemed to think them very good 
help. There are not many Japanese em¬ 
ployed and as a rule they are not liked 
as well as the Chinese. 

Question—Did you see any paraffining 
process ? 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


101 


Mr. Hart—I did not. They have 
another trouble that looked to me very 
much like 'blight but when I asked about 
this tree or that tree that was suffering 
from it, they told me it was caused by 
gophers. Mr. Chase, who is one of the 
largest growers in California, told me it 
cost him $1,000.00 a year to fight goph¬ 
ers. 

Question—Why is it necessary to put 
the extra layer of oranges on top as you 
spoke of a few minutes ago? 

Mr. Hart—It is to make a full box. 
They claim that unless they pack very 
full the fruit gets into the market loose. 
In going through the fruit districts in 
Chicago 1 , I noticed the fruit coming from 
California showed full boxes. 

Mr.-Did they nail down 

the head at the center ? 

Mr. Hart—No, only at the two end's. 

Mr.-Mr. Chase has been 

introducing a bulge pack similar to the 
California pack. His man at Sanford 
started it first at Sanford. You know the 
pack I mean, do you not? 

Mr. Tabor—Did vou find out what 

j 

stock those trees were budded on, the 
ones that showed the gum disease more 
prevalent ? 

Mr. Hart—I do not think that the 
stock, so far as I could tell makes much 
difference because the disease is up above 
the bud or in the limb, so that so far as 
I could learn the stock made very little 
difference. 

Mr. Stevens—Have they a choice of 
stock ? 

Mr. Hart—They are getting seeds of 
sour oranges from this country and pre¬ 
fer the sour stock 

Mr. Tabor—Is it true in Florida and in 


Cuba that trees budded on lemon stock 
show gum disease much more than sour? 

Mr. Hart—I am not an authority on 
that. I have not had enough to do with 
the rough lemon stock to know of my 
own knowledge, but I have had exper¬ 
ience enough to make me dislike it, and I 
do not think I shall ever put any more 
in my grove. 

Mr. Quinby is present, and undoubt¬ 
edly he can answer a lot of questions that 
I cannot, and I think you had better ask 
him to talk a little. 

Mr. Gaitskill—Just a moment. Tell us 
before you go what they have out there 
in the line you have been talking about 
that is better than what we have that 
could be adopted here. 

Mr. Hart—I think the belt system of 
carrying the fruit along for grading will 
be adopted by a good many of the larger 
growers. It would not do where extreme 
care is taken, because the fruit is going 
along pretty rapidly, and if they miss a 
No. 2 or 3, it goes into- the No. i fruit. 

I do not think their nailing machine 
would answer for our boxes, because we 
strap ours while they only nail a little 
piece across each end of the cover, which 
is done when the cover is put on. They 
have a little device for holding the paper 
wrappers which they all use. It simply 
holds the paper in the tray when you are 
packing and keeps it from blowing about. 
They also use a “nail stripper” that is a 
help. There are small devices like that, 
some of which I have adopted and some 
I cannot. I am not the one to pass on the 
general packing-house outfit for the 
larger growers of the State, being only 
a small grower and requiring a totally 
different arrangement.

Mr. Gaitskill— I have found your sug¬ 
gestions good and anything that is good 
for you will be good for me. 

Mr. Hart—There is an orange clipper 
that they use in California, and here is a 
new one just gotten out which I will 
leave on the desk for you to examine. 

Mr. Quinby—I went with the Califor¬ 
nia party and gathered in a good deal of 
information while out there, and a lot of 
it would be interesting and doubtless in¬ 
structive to this audience. My voice is 
not at its best, but possibly it will improve 
the carrying quality of the Florida 
orange. 

I am connected with the firm of Chase 
& Co., of Jacksonville, who' market con¬ 
siderable of the Florida oranges and oth¬ 
er perishable products. We examined pret¬ 
ty thoroughly into' their marketing system 
while in California; in fact we went into 
the intricacies of it and there has been a 
time set on the ist of June at Tampa to 
bring in reports. 

When we arrived at Los Angeles, Dr. 
Inman called a meeting at the Chamber 
of Commerce, and we undertook to syste¬ 
matize the work for which we had gone 
there. The subject matter was divided in¬ 
to headings, such as packing* houses and 
their appliances, selling, government in¬ 
vestigations, and a number of various 
heads that we wanted to know about, and 
committees were appointed to take up 
specially the matter on which they were 
to be prepared to make reports to the 
meeting at Tampa on the ist of June. I 
was on one or two of these committees, 
and while I took copious notes I have not 
looked over them at all since I came back, 
and I don’t know that I can say anything 
in addition to what Mr. Hart has said, 


except to answer such questions as you 
may ask to the best of my ability. I would 
not undertake to go into 1 full and com¬ 
plete relation of what we saw and heard 
and learned while in California. 

It seems to have been the expectation 
of this meeting to have more or less re¬ 
ports from the committee who went to 
California in a formal way. It was sug¬ 
gested to me that if we passed a resolu¬ 
tion to incorporate into the report of the 
Society the reports and results of the 
meeting 'Which is to be held in Tampa 
next month, then it would be in print for 
the members of this Association and they 
would have the benefit of it in this way. 

I do not know your regular custom, but 
think it would be a good idea to pass a 
resolution now that the Secretary shall 
incorporate into the official report of the 
Florida State Horticultural Society the 
report that is made in Tampa on the ist. 
of June, and then you will have that re¬ 
port in full. 

Mr. Temple—Do you know how much 
their oranges cost them per box on the 
trees out there as a general thing ? 

Mr. Quinby—No, I do not know ; that 
is, interest on investment, working, fer¬ 
tilizing, etc. I should say it is just about 
the same as in Florida for the reason that 
they cultivate a great deal more and they 
spend a great deal more money on irriga¬ 
tion than we do- here, but they are almost 
free from having to' use fertilizer. That 
is almost unknown in California. Their 
oranges are grown on what I have known 
as clay soil. It has more or less of crush¬ 
ed granite and that keeps it loose. They 
do not let anything grow on it except the 
orange trees themselves, and cultivate all 
the year round. 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

- Mr. Temple—Do you know what they 
receive as a general thing for their 
oranges on the trees ? 

Mr. Quinby—They get about 90 cents, 
or $1.00 a box on the trees. This is clear 
of the packing-house charge ana' the mar¬ 
keting expense. 

Mr.--What variety do 

they grow principally out there? 

Mr. Quinby—We saw very few or¬ 
anges except the Washington Navels. 
There are a good many Valencias, but I 
think about 80 per cent, of the output 
of California is Washington Navels. Now 
what they are putting out in Tulare 
County, which is about 300 miles north 
of Los Angeles, I don’t know. They are 
planting very heavily there, however. 

Mr.-How does the price of 

box material compare with ours ? 

Mr. Quinby—It is cheaper than ours. 
They buy it by the wholesale. They have 
their own mills. They have cut loose from 
a lumber trust out there and have backed 
up certain independent mills that were 
about to go broke, and in that way have 
kept the mills running and have been able 
thereby to take about all the output of 
these mills. Their package is not as good 
material as ours; it would not do with us 
for shipments in less than carload lots. 
The bottoms and sides are slats, and the 
ends are solid. 

Mr.--—Is there much set¬ 

ting out of new varieties? 

Mr. Quinby—In Southern California 
proper, that is, those valleys lying around 
Los Angeles, there is a fair amount of 
setting out, probably just as much as in 
Florida today. In Tulare County there 
are a great many new groves being set 
out. I am not prepared to tell you wheth¬ 


er they are planting in the new groves 
a larger number of Valencias than the 
Washington Navels or not. 

As to the production of oranges, unless 
there are disasters to the groves, or crop 
disasters in the next six or seven years, 
the output of oranges will be almost over¬ 


whelming. We were told that there were 
20,000 acres of new grove property com¬ 
ing on in Tulare County alone. They are 
putting out groves in Arizona and Tex¬ 
as, and the increase in the Florida out¬ 
put in the next seven or eight years will 
be enormous. This fact is rather signifi¬ 
cant if you stop to 1 think about it. Of 
course we don’t know what disaster may 
happen to reduce that output. 

Mr. Christiancy—I understand 'the 
water supply is playing out on a number 
of large dams in Southern California. I 


spent 15 or 18 years in California, and 
know of two larg*e dams that went dry 
at one time, and they were a couple of 
years in getting water. 

Mr. Quinby—We did not look into the 
water supply. We know that the water is 
sold, and in some sections the water con¬ 
tracts are appurtenant to the lands. 

Mr.-Tell us the methods 

they use for getting their fruit into the 
market ? 

Mr. Quinby—That is a wide cpiestion,. 
and the meat in the cocoanut. To handle 
a Washington Navel orange, considering 
the geographic position that California 
occupies in relation to its consuming 
markets, I don’t know of any set of men 
who could improve on their system un¬ 
less they were all Solomons. Their system 
is something that has evolved itself. It 
is not the work of any one man or set of 
men. It is the result of experiments and 











104 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the natural evolvement to fit the condi¬ 
tions of California. The method is this; 
last year the exact figures that the Cali¬ 
fornia Exchange handled in oranges was 
5,440,000 and some odd boxes that rep¬ 
resented 56 per cent, of the total Califor¬ 
nia output as near as they could get com¬ 
plete record, and that would throw the 
crop between 9,000,000 and 10,000,- 
000 boxes. The estimate for this 
year is for a crop of 12,000,000 
boxes of or angles and they ' es¬ 
timate that the Exchange will market 55 
to 60 per cent. The officials of the Ex¬ 
change do not claim that their control 
will reach beyond 60 per cent., and Mr. 
Story, who is President of the Exchange, 
told me it was not wise for them to un¬ 
dertake to market more than this. He 
said that in order to make a success of 
this thing there must be competitive sell¬ 
ing, not competitive underselling, but 
competition to return a better price to the 
grower all the time. Competitive under- 
■selling, which means a cutting of prices, 
must be stopped. California has arrived 
at such a point that they are in condition 
to stop under quoting, and the Exchange 
desires to market no more than 60 per 
cent, of the crop, so that conditions may 
remain as they are today. Now the 40 to 
45 per cent, of fruit that is sold by the 
independents is marketed both by salaried 
associations and also agencies working 
by per box contract, and in some in¬ 
stances are affiliated with the Exchange; 
and most of it is marketed on f. o. b. or 
in transit basis or else a spot cash basis. 
This means that if a buyer is putting his 
money into the fruit, that fruit is go¬ 
ing where there is a demand. Under the 
system of cash buying and f. o. b. and in 


transit buying, that much of the goods 
takes care of itself, because it is going 
where there is a demand. Now the 60 
per cent, is the balance of the product, 
and it is up to the California Fruit 
Growers’ Exchange to take it and develop 
it into a paying proposition. Their num¬ 
ber of f. o. b. and in transit sales are al¬ 
most minimum. They have abandoned 
the f. o. b. and in transit sales almost 
entirely. They have the markets of this 
country extremely well guaged and they 
can sit in their offices and tell you just 
how many each market should take, and 
how .it will make the market waver if 
you give them any more, and how it will 
make the price come up if you give them 
a little less. 

Suppose the fruit goes to' Kansas City 
and the miarket is a little off. The buying 
trade is told the price is so-and-so. They 
look at the fruit and take it or reject it. 
If it is refused the man in charge of the 
selling end in Kansas City wires in to Los 
Angeles that the trade will not take it at 
the price he offered it to them. Then they 
may tell him to sell so many cars at the 
price he is offered and divert the other 
cars. Possibly they may divert the whole 
lot. They carry their goods all over the 
country, and the Washington Navel will 
stand it. There is no additional cost for 
freight. In other words, after the cars 
once get to Denver it costs no more to 
send a car to Boston than to Kansas City. 
In that way they distribute vast amounts 
of oranges, and at this present time it is 
a fact that they have every known market 
just about crowded without having to 
make /concessions on the price. They 
have studied this marketing question for 
years from every possible standpoint. It

is a wonderful thing to sit in their office 
out in Los Angeles and see how they 
know the exact condition of every mar¬ 
ket, how they can put their finger on ev¬ 
ery car that is between California and the 
Atlantic Ocean, guage almost to a car¬ 
load what this market will take withouv 
the price being lowered, and taking away 
a little here where there is too much, to 
hurry it across several states perhaps, 
where there is not cpiite enough. 

The Board of Directors are representa¬ 
tive business men from every orange 
growing section in California. 

Now, those people out there know that 
the quantity of oranges going into the 
markets is getting to be enormous. They 
know that in the next six or seven years 
the present output will be greatly increas¬ 
ed'; therefore their far-sightedness is such 
that they are already beginning to> work 
on the consumer. They have commenced 
newspaper and magazine advertising that 
will bring the matter right before plain 
John Smith and his wife, so that it will 
create a desire in them to have oranges 
on their tables. They took the State of 
Iowa and put aside $—*-for ad¬ 

vertising. They don’t work on the job¬ 
bing trade nor on the retailer. They went 
right to work on the consumer, and are 
making him desire it, and they have in¬ 
creased the consumption in the State of 
Iowa about 50 per cent, the first year. 
They have appropriated money out of the 
common fund to increase the consumption 
in that way. These people are right up- 
to-date—in this instance you might say 
they are ahead of time, and they know 
what judicious advertising does. 

It is going to take lots of time and 
long-continued efforts to bring order out 


of the chaos into which the Florida or¬ 
ange growers have fallen; perhaps it is 
not so much chaotic as lethargic. We have 
needed an awakening for some time; last 
winter’s prices showed how much. It is 
going to mean spending money; it is go¬ 
ing to mean co-operation, but for every 
cent that is spent I believe you will get 
a dollar in return. Above all things it 
means co-operation, one and all. 

Out theie they do business by encour- 
aging the small buyer just as much as anv 
other; they give him just as good price’s 
on a one-car lot as on several; they give 
him just as much advantage of market 
conditions and just as good grades and 
brands for the money as they give the 
twenty or fifty car man, because the 
small buyer is always ready to do busi¬ 
ness for a little less than the big one. 
Now about selling direct to the consumer, 
I have heard Mr. Chase talk about this.' 
1 think there is but one way to do this, 
and that is to go into the store business in 
every city. That would mean a good deal, 
and I don’t think we are prepared to' fol¬ 
low. The thing is to try to introduce the 
genei al use of the fruit into the small 
communities. Because a small dealer is 
poor is no reason why we should try to 
keep him poor. 

The independents use the auction to 
some extent. This is the final court of 
reckoning for all the California product. 
They may have peddled it across the 
country and finally wound up there. They 
never sell privately in any market, that 
is, the Exchange does not where there 
is an auction. In those markets where 
there is a fruit auction they do not sell 
outside.

Mr. Christiancy—Can you tell us how 
long it has been in this systematized con' 
dition ? 

Mr. Quinby—In 1892 they were just 
as disorganized as we are today and for 
ten years they had a terrible time and a 
terrible struggle. I11 1903 they began 
what was known as the Fruit Agency, a 
joint office of the Independents and the 
Southern California Fruit Exchange as 
it was then called 1 . This Agency ran from 
the 1 st of April, 1903, until the 31st of 
Aug'ust, 1904, and was a consolidation of 
all agencies into one selling office. There 
was only one office from which you could 
buy fruit. The fruit carried badly that 
year. They abandoned the Agency and 
now let the Independents compete with 
the Exchange, so that the grower has two 
strings to his bow, and a good many take 
advantage of it. Until after the season of 
1902-3 under the regime of the Southern 
California Fruit Exchange, was a hard 
time for California growers. There were 
individual interests fighting the Ex¬ 
change, marketing interests fighting it 
that were tied up with car lines, and cor¬ 
porations fighting it. From 1892 to 1903 
they were not making much of a success 
of it because they were fighting each oth¬ 
er. They fought so hard that they agreed 
to stop fighting. Now with the California 
Fruit Growers’ Exchange handling 55 to 
60 per cent, and the Independents the bal¬ 
ance, they have things in pretty good 
working shape, and it would be well for 
us to follow it as nearly as we can, adapt¬ 
ing it of course, to suit our different con¬ 
ditions. 

Mr. Christiancy—I have been told that 
on all fruit that goes out of Riverside the 


grower is paid the same price per box; 
that is, every man gets the same per box 
for his fruit whether he sent 39 or 3,900 
boxes. 


Mr. Quinby—That is true in Californ¬ 
ia except those growers who put up their 
own fruit. The grower does not know 
anything about the price per box. His 
fruit is weighed in at the packing-house 
and of course, he knows how much his 
fruit weighs. Then it practically loses its 
identity. It is graded and then it goes on 
the sizer belt. His fruit is entered upon 
the books of the association by its weight 
and the distribution of returns is made 
according to weight. He does not know 
how many boxes lie has, and it would 
take a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out 
what his fruit has brought him per box. 
His fruit loses its identity and individual¬ 
ity entirely after it is weighed. 


Mr. Christiancy—The officials of the 
Exchange then could spend a half million 
dollars of the money and the growers 
would not know it. 


M,r. Quinby—I must say that I don’t 
think there is any grafting going on in 
the Exchange. One or two' are said to 
have been made millionaires in the past, 
but I don’t think there is any of that now. 
I think they are holding back 10 cents, a 
box now to create a fund for advertising 
purposes and other things possibly. Their 
fruit is sold on the box basis and the 
returns come on that basis to the local as¬ 
sociations. There it is split up into 
pounds. The records on the books are 
generally in pounds and so are the credit 
to the individual growers. The distribu¬ 
tion is made in that way.

DISCUSSION. 

Ml. Penny—I make a motion that the 
California committee be requested to 
furnish a report to our Secretary so 
that it may be published in the proceed' 
ings of the Society. 

Dr. Richardson—You have heard the 
motion, which is to the effect that the Sec¬ 
retary of the Society be instructed to ask 
the Orange Growers’ Society for copy of 
the report of the California Committee 
with the idea of copying it, or such por¬ 
tions of it as the Secretary and Executive 
Committee may deem wise, in our print¬ 
ed journal. I presume that is the way you 
wish the motion put, Mr. Penny? 

Motion seconded and passed. 

Mr. Hart—I want to bring up the mat¬ 
ter of this trip to California before we go 
on to the next topic. On this trip, the 
greatest benefit I received was contact 
with the men who made up the party. 
They are men who are successful in the 
line of work they followed. Now, I want 
to urge upon the members of this Asso¬ 
ciation the importance of their going to 
Tampa to attend that meeting* there. It 
seems to me that the psychic moment 
for organization has arrived. Of course 
organization will not make returns of $2 
or $3 a box for poorly packed and poorly 
grown oranges, yet where fruit is prop¬ 
erly handled the grower will get better 
returns for his money invested, his work 
and trouble in growing the fruit and will 
not feel that orange growing is so much 
a venture but more of a legitimate busi¬ 
ness. I hope that every orange grower, 
in fact, everyone interested 1 in Florida and 
her future prosperity will attend the 
meeting and help in the work, and I think 


it will be a mistake if the orange growers 
especially, do not do so. 

Dr. Richardson—I most heartily agree 
with Mr. Hart. I feel strongly every word 
said in my address last night. I feel that 
the time is upon us now when we should 
demand and get our rights. This paper 
that has been read is of vast importance. 
It shows us what a small body of mien, 
comparatively speaking, have been able 
to do with the railroad situation, and this 
small body of men have prevailed upon 
the State Commerce Commission to save 
us a great many thousand dollars. If we 
all combined, what might we not ac¬ 
complish ? Our savings would mount up 
into the millions in a short time. 

This Orange Growers’ Association is, as 
I understand it, still in an embryonic state. 
There was a meeting called in Tampa 
some two or three months ago for the 
purpose of organization. The organiza¬ 
tion was not completed at that time. We 
decided that a committee should go to 
California and spy out the land and come 
back and report on the 1st of June to 
another meeting at which all orange 
growers and all men interested in horti¬ 
cultural and agricultural matters could 
come and be welcome. We hope you will 
all come; as a citizen of Tampa I invite 
you and as a member of this Society and 
as its President I urge upon you to come 
to that meeting. It did me good to go 
to the preliminary meeting. Mr. Hart 
says it did him good to be associated 
with men of their calibre, and I am sure 
Mr. Hart will permit me to say that it did 
them srood p e associated with Mr. 
Hart. No thanks are necessary sir, I am 
sure there are no growers in the State

who could not learn many things from 
you. 

You must wake up to the importance 
of organization. We have to do 1 it some 
time, and why not now ? Why wait 
another year and get returns that will 
barely pay the running expenses ; per¬ 
haps not that. These men in California 
are reaping a rich harvest as a result of 
their organization. We must take some 
decided action if we expect to get any¬ 
thing in the way of returns. 

I feel that it is incumbent upon the 
Chair to reinforce Mr. Hart’s and Mr. 
Quinby’s remarks. Get your local papers, 
if you can, to call attention to it and let 
it be the beginning of organization that 
will give Florida her rights which she has 
been denied so long. Who is to' blame for 
it? Who is responsible for the condi¬ 
tions that are existing today, where we, 
who grow the best oranges on earth, can 
hardly make the expenses necessary to 


grow them? You have m> one but your¬ 
self to blame. In your strenuous opposi¬ 
tion to each other you have forgotten that 
it is only in union that there is strength. 
Fighting each other, you are like the Kil¬ 
kenny cats; in joining forces you may 
assume proportions that will win you the 
victory over all opposition. Don’t let this 
matter fill you with enthusiasm for the 
time being, and then be forgotten. Join 
forces with the most influential men, the 
brainiest men, the most successful men 
and help them to make this thing a suc¬ 
cess. You have everything to gain and 
nothing to lose. 

Dr. Richardson—I have been testing 
these clippers. I don’t know what Mr. 
Hart intended to do for the people of 
California in bringing these as samples 
but have been testing them on some rose 
stems here on the desk. The clippers from 
California do not cut rose stems every 
time, while Mr. Hart’s clipper cuts them 
every time. 



Tropical Fruits. 


By E. N. Reasoner. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

From the latitude of Florida one would 
judge that sub-tropical plants would be 
the limit in tenderness that the inhabi¬ 
tants would try to grow; but its penin¬ 
sular position with large bodies of water 
surrounding the southern half of the 
State tempt us into growing entirely 
tropical plants, which from time to time 
are frozen back by the Northers sweeping 
down on us from “up country.” 

If Uncle Sam in his reconstruction of 
the map instead of considering a ship 
canal across the State would kindly look 
into the matter of building us a mountain 
range across the northern part of the 
peninsula we of South Florida would 
consider it much more to the point. With 
that protection we could grow nearly any¬ 
thing, even as it is we are able to raise 
a great many things of value; fruit trees, 
economic and ornamental plants, trees, 
vines, etc., of the more vigorous and 
hardy members of the Tropics. 

The most valuable have come to us 
from India, Mexico and the West Indies, 
and in fruit trees and plants the follow¬ 
ing find a congenial home along the coast 
and in the protected Lake regions of 
South Florida, where they are seldom in¬ 
jured by cold; the pineapple, the mango, 
the banana, the guava, the avocado, the 
sapodilla, the sugar apple, the custard ap¬ 


ple and a few less valuable, all being well 
known and grown on a commercial scale. 

The cultivation of each of these is 
being extended and the best varieties for 
Florida conditions are being tried and 
tested thoroughly. Much assistance has 
been given along this line by the Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture, especially through 
the efforts of the subtropical laboratory 
at Miami, where hybridizing pineapples 
and other work is progressing favorably. 
However the greater knowledge as to 
culture and shipment of these fruits has 
been worked out by individual growers 
so that now there is a substantial base to 
work from in selection of suitable loca¬ 
tion, soil, fertilizing, cultivation, frost 
protection, packing and shipping the 
fruit. 

The pineapple so far stands out pre¬ 
eminently as our most valuable tropical 
fruit and the plan of selling fruit through 
the association of growers is admirable. 
Pineapples are mostly grown in open air 
and the principal variety is the Red Span¬ 
ish. In localities where frost is more like¬ 
ly to occur, sheds have been erected over 
small areas and the more delicate va¬ 
rieties, notably the Smooth Cayenne, 
grown successfully. By cheapening the 
existing express and freight rates a great 
impetus would surely be given this in¬ 
dustry and the finer varieties could then 



110 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


be profitably marketed in large supply, 
the demand being almost unlimited. 

The mango requiring from three to 
five years to come into bearing has been 
grown in a limited way for years, but 
since the introduction of choice East In¬ 
dian varieties its cultivation has grown 
wonderfully and one kind has been fruit¬ 
ed sufficiently to create great enthusiasm 
among both growers and market men in 
the North. The fruit from seedling 
trees is very stringy and too' strong of 
turpentine scent and flavor for strangers 
to like, yet has been shipped sparingly for 
years being salable only in our southern 
coast cities, while the finer kinds grown 
from grafted trees find instant sale in all 
markets at excellent prices. The fruit of 
the best East Indian sorts is free from 
fibre, and is of a tender lusciousness only 
comparable to a perfect, dead-ripe, free¬ 
stone peach. If one intends growing a 
mango at all, by all means set a grafted 
tree as it requires no more care than a 
seedling and produces fruit far superior 
to any seedling two years from the graft. 
The Mulgoba is the oldest East Indian 
variety in the State, but we now have 
about forty other kinds, being the cream 
of East Indian varieties. A number of 
these were introduced by myself begin¬ 
ning in 1887 from seed of selected fruit 
grown at Saharanpur, Northwest Prov¬ 
ince of India where the finest mangoes in 
the world are produced. The cold weath¬ 
er of the next few years killed out these 
trees and then I began importing grafted 
trees from the same locality which are 
now well established; several have fruit¬ 
ed, all of excellent quality. One or two 
other enthusiasts have also imported 
grafted varieties and the Department of 


Agriculture has added considerably to 
the number, all of which are flourishing. 
The fruit of the mango must be shipped 
by express to ensure delivery in perfect 
condition, and may thus be sent to all 
parts of the country. I have personally 
sent mangoes to California, Colorado, 
Illinois, Ontario, New York and Wash¬ 
ington City in perfect order. Here 
again, as in shipping all our more deli¬ 
cate produce, comes in the matter of cost 
of handling by express, and it seems a 
great business may be developed in Flo¬ 
rida by the proper co-operation of grow¬ 
er and express companies. It may be 
that with installation of a Parcel Post 
service by the Postoffice Department 
such relief will be given the express com¬ 
panies that they can give adequate atten¬ 
tion to shipments of fruit at a lower rate 
than now exists. The people of Florida 
should feel especially interested in a 
Parcel Post service, but so far they have 
made little effort as compared with Pa¬ 
cific Coast people, to hasten forward this 
much to be desired institution. The pro¬ 
duction of mangoes can be profitably done 
in the open air all along the coasts of 
South Florida and in the interior of the 
State with slight protection, such as af¬ 
forded by cheap sheds or wind breaks 
supplemented by occasional firing. 

Bananas are very susceptible to dam¬ 
age by frost, but the more hardy kinds 
can be grown largely even where the 
leaves are frozen off every winter, the 
stalk being seldom injured and throwing 
up growth again quickly. The most val¬ 
uable sort for general growth are the 
Hart’s Choice, or Lady Finger, a very 
hardy and vigorous kind with delicious 
fruit. We have the Orinoco', or Horse 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Ill 


Banana, a kind of plantain, valuable for 
cooking, which is as hardy as the Hart’s 
Choice. The fruit of all bananas sells 
well in our local markets, but has not been 
grown to such an extent that shipping 8 
long distance has been found necessary. 
The Cavendish, or Dwarf, is more largely 
grown in extreme South Florida and is 
a valuable sort for the more protected 
coast regions, standing more severe winds 
than taller growers; its fruit resembles 
the Martinique variety so largely import¬ 
ed. There are but few others so far tried 
that seem to be valuable for Florida con¬ 
ditions, but testing is going forward. Ba¬ 
nanas may be grown in a large commer¬ 
cial way on proper soil in South Florida 
and the industry only awaits capital for 
further development. 

Guavas grow so readily in all parts of 
South Florida that they seem indigenous. 
The fruit varies in quality, but all are 
good to those who have acquired the taste, 
for cooking and for eating out of hand. 
The habit of the bush in bearing abund¬ 
antly for weeks, only eighteen months 
after being frozen to the ground, makes 
it extremely valuable for us. Orchards 
of the more acid sorts are being grown 
now for jelly making, an industry cap¬ 
able of great expansion. Selection of the 
best sorts should be encouraged, and 
every house lot should contain a number 
of bushes for home use. Cuttings of the 
guava may be rooted readily; use large 
wood, making cuttings a foot long in Au¬ 
gust preferably. In this manner the finer 
sorts may be raised. The Guinea guava 
seems to be the most free from seeds of 
any sort yet introduced, and is a thick 
meated, sweet fruit of good size. The 
Cattley and the Chinese are really semi- 


tropical sorts capable of standing consid¬ 
erable frost. They are fine evergreens 
and may be grown in hedges, being use¬ 
ful and ornamental. As a hedge plant 
the Cattley guava is superior to most sub¬ 
jects so far used in South Florida as it is 
free from insect pests; as a fruit its acid¬ 
ity causes it to be generally liked even by 
Northerners, but jelly made from it is 
not so fine as from the tropical forms. 

The Avocado has leaped into popular 
favor during the past few years and its 
fruit is the most valuable of any grown 
in Florida at present. The tree is a na¬ 
tive of Mexico and the West Indies, and 
stands a little more cold than the Mango, 
byit seedlings require from six to fifteen 
years’ time to produce their first crop and 
so their planting has been neglecteu. 
Large old trees are now producing won¬ 
derful returns all over South Florida and 
as the trees may be readily budded to 
fine varieties of known quality, ripening 
from early summer to January, a great 
impetus has been given its cultivation 
along our coasts. The budded trees bear 
in from two' to four years from the bud, 
and hence a planter may soon realize 
from his investment. The culture of the 
Avocado is bound to be one of our lead¬ 
ing industries very soon. 

Among the uncommon fruits that have 
proved to be a success in South Florida 
and which may be grown very easily are 
the following:—Kai-apple, (Aberia Caf- 
fra) of South Africa, and its relative (A. 
Gardneri) from Ceylon; both bearing 
when young and as with the guavas 
sprouting up when frosted down and 
bearing within a year. The Sapodilla 
(Achras Sapota), Cashew-apple (Ana- 
cardium occidentale), Custard-apple 



112 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


(Anona reticulata), Sugar-apple (Anona 
squamosa), Papaw (Carica papaya), 
Amatungula (Carissa arduina), White 
Sapota (Casimiroa edulis), Shakewood 
tree (Cecropia palmata), O'taheite goose¬ 
berry (Cica disticha), Sea Grape (Coc- 
coloba uvifera), Rose-apple (Eugenia 
jambos), Surinam cherry (Eugenia Mi- 
cbeli), Mammee-apple (Mammea 
Americana), Ginep, or Spanish Lime 
(Melicocca bijuga), Ceriman (Monstera 
deliciosa), Granadilla (Passiflora of 
sorts), Otaheite apple (Spondias dulcis), 
Hog-plum (Spondias purpurea), Tama¬ 


rind (Tamarindus Indica), Limeberry 
(Tripbasia trifoliata) etc., all of whicn 
may be grown with more or less profit in 
South Florida. 

An abundance of fruit in our diet is 
a necessity and owners of land no matter 
how small its area, should devote a little 
time and attention to this important mat¬ 
ter ; it would pay in both good health and 
money. Only lack of energy prevents 
any landowner in South Florida from 
enjoying a great variety of luscious fruits 
every day in the year. 


By R. D. Hoyt. 


A good many years ago someone 
stretched a line across our state and called 
it the frost line. We did not know its 
exact location but it was supposed to 
be somewhere about the 28th degree. 
South of this line we could and did, grow 
all kinds of tropical fruits galore. We 
had guava trees, good big ones that one 
could climb about in and while the sum¬ 
mer was guava season there was scarcely 
a day in the year that we couldn’t have 
a guava pie a foot thick if we wanted 
it. We didn’t have to plant guavas, they 
just came up spontaneously in fence 
corners and along the road and during 
the summer the razor backs waxed fat; it 
the fruit did not fall fast enough an old 
sow would get up on her hind legs and 
grabbing one of the lower limbs with her 
teeth shake vigorously, ^generally with 
gratifying results to the accompanying 
family. We had alligator pear trees 40 
feet high that produced big thick-meated 
fruits that sometimes reached two pounds 


in weight, have heard them drop at night 
with a mushy kind of thud which 
meant the breakfast salad was already 
prepared with the addition of a little salt. 

We had other tropical fruits too. Man¬ 
goes, Tamarinds Rose and Sugar Ap¬ 
ples, and others of less note but we ap¬ 
preciated them all and were foolish 
enough to think we would always have 
them or most anything else we wanted 
but one night in December, 1895, some¬ 
thing happened to the frost line, possibly 
a stray mule got tangled up in it, at all 
events it was broken as many of us re¬ 
member and regret, and for fourteen 
years we have been trying to pick up the 
loose ends and run in a splice, so far 
meeting with no success. 

The guava is very persistent and may 
be killed to the ground year after year 
and still keep coming and if fortunate to 
escape one winter it will produce a few 
fruit the following summer, but our once 
big trees are now but stunted bushes that

once in three or four years give us a lim¬ 
ited supply of fruit. All the other fruits 
are gone although for years we nursed 
and coddled them. 

I am speaking now of our own place 
which is situated on the Pinealas Penin¬ 
sula. There are some favored spots in 
this modern Garden of Eden that are pro¬ 
tected by a body of salt water between 
them and the break in the frost line, but 
these are much in the minority. 

Of course I am speaking of natural 


conditions, what may be accomplished 
with a little protection is wonderful, and 
if we make up our minds that we want all 
the good things our soil will produce we 
can have them just the same. After all 

it only means that we have to give up a 
warm bed and: turn out for one or two 
nights and burn up a little wood. Per¬ 
haps we will get the frost line mended 
sometime and get back to conditions as 
they were twenty years ago. 


TROPICAL FRUITS—HOW AND WHERE GROWN. 


By E. V. Blackman. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When I received 'notice it'hat I (had 
been appointed to write and read a pa¬ 
per before the State Horticultural Soci¬ 
ety on Tropical Fruits, I felt that the 
task was too great and that there are 
many members of the Society who are 
more conversant with this branch of hor¬ 
ticulture and have had many years more 
experience along these lines than I. This 
I felt was especially true in the case of 
M,r. Reasoner, the honored chairman of 
this committee. A few days since I receiv¬ 
ed a letter from Mr. Reasoner, asking 
that I prepare such a paper, I concluded 
to make an effort along the line and do 
the -best I could. 

In a paper which necessarily must have 
for its first essential briefness, it would 
be impossible to treat the almost number¬ 
less kind of tropical fruits, their value, 


commercially, and the methods of culti¬ 
vation, hence we shall speak of only a 
few of the most desirable sorts. 

First, let it be understood that w’e 
shall treat the growing of these desirable 
fruits in portions of the State where 
frosts and winter blizzards do 1 not come 
with sufficient force to destroy the trees. 
A large majority of the purely tropical 
fruit trees, are very susceptible to kill¬ 
ing frosts, indeed many of them are so 
tender that a frost that would seriously 
kill tomato vines would damage the trees 
to a greater or less degree, yet there are 
some that have great vitality and when 
cut down by cold, sprout from the roots 
and soon come into bearing again. In sec¬ 
tions where this condition is likely to oc¬ 
cur, I would not advise planting tropical 
fruit trees commercially; but if I lived in 
a part of Florida where these frosts occur 


8 






114 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


only at periods covering several years, 
there are varieties or kinds of tropical 
fruit trees which I would plant for family 
use, taking every precaution in case of 
cold to protect them. The four kinds I 
especially call attention to is the Avocado, 
Mango, and Paw-paw and Bananas, four 
of the most valuable fruits known to hor¬ 
ticulturists, not only for the family table, 
but commercially, the commercial orchard 1 
being of the greatest moment. 

WHERE GROWN. 

Dade County and the Florida Keys, 
so far as I know are the only places wnere 
these fruits are grown commercially, in 
the State. In this I may be mistaken as I 
am not familiar with the country on the 
southwestern coast of Florida and the 
adaptability of either soils or climate for 
the production of these fruits on a com¬ 
mercial scale. If I am wrong it is an er¬ 
ror of ignorance, not willfulness. 

THE AVOCADO. 

( P.gratiasima .) 

Thirteen years ago when I came to 
Dade County, the Avocado was found 
growing luxuriantly around the homes 
of the early settlers in the rocky lands 
and in the sand lands in the northern por¬ 
tion of the county. The fruit was then 
unknown in the northern markets but 
was highly esteemed by the native popu¬ 
lation for food. We have heard it said that 
many of the natives made their breakfast 
entirely upon the Avocado, accompanied 
with a small piece of bread and a cup of 
coffee. It is claimed that it contains a 
larger amount of nourishment, than any 
other fruit known. As people came in 
from the North, they soon became as fond 


of the Avocado as the natives and each 
settler proceeded to plant a few seeds, to 
produce fruit for home use. Trial ship¬ 
ments were made to northern cities, es¬ 
pecially to those which had a large Latin¬ 
speaking population and it was soon 
found that there was a good demand' for 
the fruit and each year the demand has 
increased. The great difficulty found in 
marketing the Avocado, was, that the 
trees were all seedlings and while the 
great majority of fruit was good and 
could be classed as better, best, (none 
poor) there were no two 'trees which 
grew exactly the same kind of fruit, in 
size, color and value for eating purposes. 
The more advanced horticulturists rec¬ 
ognized the fact, that in a great measure 
the seedling Avocado was like the seed¬ 
ling orange or apple and efforts were be¬ 
gun to produce “known varieties.’’ An¬ 
other difficulty the pioneer had to en¬ 
counter was that the maturing season did 
not cover sufficient time to make growing 
the Avacado, a commercial success. Mr. 
George B. Cellon, of Miami, who owns 
the only purely tropical nursery in the 
State, has the honor of discovering and 
propagating in large quantities, an Avo¬ 
cado known as the “Trapp.” The original 
tree was found on the Trapp place at 
Cocoanut Grove. The distinctive value 
of the Trapp, is that it ripens late in the 
season. This year a few specimens were 
exhibited at the Dade County Fair in 
March. This makes the Trapp the most 
valuable Avocado grown and the only 
variety that has been known to hold its 
fruit so late in the season. The prices re¬ 
ceived for the Trapp from December to 
the last of February are almost prohibi¬ 
tive to persons of ordinary means. To 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

illustrate, Mr. Cellon has in his nursery 
rows a large number of young trees that 
are holding some fruit every season. For 
the past two or three seasons, he has had 
sale for all his fruit at home, at from 50 
to 75 cents and sometimes reaching $1.00 
each, the parties driving to his place two 
and one-half males from the city for 
them. This was the price unpacked and 
unwrapped at his door. Mr. S. B. Bliss, 
who owns the largest 'budded Avocado 
grove in the world, sold his Trapps this 
season at from $12.00 to $17.00 per crate 
of four dozen f. o. b. and did-not have 
nearly enough to supply the demand. Mr. 
W. E. March, who was among the first to 
plant the Trapp disposes of his fruit to 
Hicks & Son, New York, for which lie re¬ 
ceives fabulous prices with a constant cry 
for more Avocados. Dr. Wetzel, of Co- 
coanut Grove, informed Mr. March that 
he received instructions to bill his Trapps 
out at one dollar each. Among the other 
{valuable varieties grown here are the 
Pollock, which was originated by Mr. S. 
H. Pollock, of this city. Many of this 
variety weigh two and one-half pounds 
and some specimens have weighed three 
pounds. The fruit matures from July to 
October. The Rico, originated by Capt. 
C. J. Rose, Cocoanut Grove, season from 
August to November. The Blackman, or¬ 
iginated by the writer. Samples of this 
fruit were sent to the Agricultural Depart¬ 
ment, Washington, D. C., and after a 
thorough test were pronounced the best 
Avocado ever tested by the department 
and was named after the originator. 
Season from November to December. 

SOILS. 

The Avocado will thrive well on any 


well drained soil, whether it be sand or 
rock. Those who are anticipating planting 
Avocados should remember this and not 
plant on low, wet ground. In the vicinity 
of Miami, the commercial orchards are 
planted on the rocky lands. 

FERTILIZING. 

The Avocado is a gross feeder and will 
utilize almost any kind of fertilizer manu¬ 
factured, cotton seed meal or stable ma¬ 
nure. On the rocky lands which are lack¬ 
ing in humus, perhaps well rotted stable 
manure is preferable, but this cannot be 
procured in quantities sufficient for 
growing a commercial orchard. The na¬ 
tive people never used a fertilizer of any 
kind for their Avocado trees but experi¬ 
ments have demonstrated that a tree well 
fed and cultivated produces more and bet¬ 
ter fruit and of uniform size. We would 
emphasize the fact that the Avocado< tree 
revels in high fertilization and as before 
noted, does not seem particular as to the 
kind of fertilizer used or what it is com¬ 
posed of. Generally speaking, in the 
rocky soils of Dade County, cotton seed 
meal is not considered a safe fertilizer, 
but the Avocado thrives on it when used 
in quantities. 

MANGOES, 

(Mm 1 gifera In die a,) 

Mango trees were among the first fruit 
trees planted in this tropical section. The 
first settlers came from Cuba, Nassau 
and other islands bringing with them 
seed which they planted in profusion 
around their new possessions. It was 
found that the mango made a more rap¬ 
id growth, came into bearing earlier 
than on the islands, and that the fruit was 





116 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


of better quality. Nearly or quite all of 
the original trees were produced from the 
wild jungle seedlings and were known as 
the turpentine mango. They were of va¬ 
rious sizes, colors and shapes, the large 
flat seed encased with a mass of fiber, 
making the eating process a most dis¬ 
agreeable one, yet the jungle mango is a 
most delicious and palatable fruit. The 
writer has never yet tasted a poor mango 
and when the proper method of prepar¬ 
ing the jungle mango for table use is fol¬ 
lowed, it is highly prized. For fear we may 
forget, we will give the method used' in 
preparation for the table in our home. 
Peel the fruit, and then with a sharp, 
thin knife slice the mango very thin, 
sprinkle with sugar and place in the re¬ 
frigerator for two hours before serving. 
Great luscious Crawford peaches sink in¬ 
to significance beside a dish of mangoes 
prepared in this manner. The new comers 
to this southern section soon become as 
fond of the mango as the natives. Ship¬ 
ments 'began in a small way to the north¬ 
ern markets; but it was found that the 
fibrous conditions of the fruit was a 
great detriment to it and that unless a 
variety could be produced without fiber, 
the mango would never become a pop¬ 
ular market fruit. The Agricultural De¬ 
partment at Washington, has taken a 
great -interest in securing this kind 
of fruit, without the fiber, and all mango 
countries have been scoured and rescour¬ 
ed to secure choice market varieties with¬ 
out fiber. In this the Agents of the De¬ 
partment have been highly successful. 
Among the choice varieties imported 
which have been fruited are the Bennett, 
which was introduced in 1902, from In¬ 
dia, the Gordon, from Trinidad, West In¬ 


dia, the Mulgoba introduced in 1889, the 
Sundasha, a later importation. The latter 
has been fruited in the United States 
Tropical gardens at Miami. All of these 
varieties have proven to be most excel¬ 
lent fruit, and practically fiberless. 
Among the native varieties is the Perrine, 
originated by Mr. James F. Roberts, of 
Perrine, Florida. There are a number of 
others which have been originated in this 
section, which have proven to bear fruit 
of exceptionally good quality. The orig¬ 
inal Miulgoba tree was sent to Mangonia, 
from which tree the greater portion of 
trees which are now bearing have been 
budded. 

SOIL AND CULTIVATION. 

The mango is a most hardy tree and 
flourishes on any well drained soils. At 
Mangonia, Palm Beach and other points 
in Palm Beach County the soil is light 
and sandy and whenever weather condi¬ 
tions are right the trees flourish and 
bear immense quantities of fruit and of 
splendid quality. In Dade County, where 
the soil as a whole is very rocky, the 
mango makes a phenomenal growth and 
is a heavy bearer. Budded trees are ex¬ 
pensive and the average farmers who are 
planting the budded varieties, are anxious 
to get the best possible results, giving 
the young trees extra good attention and 
fertilizer. Here is where a great mistake 
is made and it is safe to' say that the 
greater portion of budded trees that have 
been lost by the planters have been lost 
by over fertilization. Experience is teach¬ 
ing the fact that budded mango trees for 
the first few years develop more rapidly 
when they are seemingly neglected. When 
thoroughly rooted a mango enjoys high

fertilization as well as any tree that we 
have planted. Hard wood ashes have 
proven with us the best fertilizer for the 
young buds and this applied only in lim¬ 
ited quantities. 

THE MANGO AND AVOCADO. 

These are the coming fruits for sec¬ 
tions where they can be safely grown. 
We do not advise planting these fruits in 
portions of the State, where frosts are 
liable to come; but in all portions where 
the weather conditions are right, a com¬ 
mercial orchard of these fruits will pro¬ 
duce more cash to the acre, than any 
known fruit. It is not to be expected that 
in years to come, Mangoes and Avo- 
cadoes will bring the fabulous prices that 
are maintained now, but the fact is there 
are such limited areas of Florida, where 
these fruits can be safely grown, that 
the demand will always be greater than 
the supply and 1 consequently high prices 
will be the rule. 

THE TROPICAL PAW-PAW. 

(Carle a Papaya.) 

This at present is one of the least 
known fruits that is grown in this south¬ 
ern section and when its value as a fruit 
is understood, will make an unlimited de¬ 
mand for it, both as a table fruit and for 
medicinal purposes. 

The paw-paw is really a melon that 
grows on a tree,' with the fruit attached 
to the body. One of the greatest difficul¬ 
ties in growing the paw-paw is that there 
is no way of distinguishing the male 
from the female tree, until it begins to 
bloom. Apparently there are many more 
male than female seeds in the fruit. I 
have been growing the paw-paw for the 


past several years and have had one or 
two male trees bear small fruits of good 
flavor. The trees fruit in about eighteen 
months after planting and continue to 
bear for several years, ripening one fruit 
at a time. 

, The paw-paw will grow on any soil 
that is well drained. Last year the writer 
lost two large trees by an overflow of salt 
water. Other trees standing by were not 
damaged, but have been fruiting through¬ 
out the entire season. 

This fruit has only to be known in the 
northern states, when the demand for it 
will be greater than the supply. 

THE SAPADILLO. 

t (A Sap at a.) 

The Sapadillo is another of the tropi¬ 
cal fruits which in years to come will be¬ 
come popular in the markets of the 
North. So far there has been no attempt 
to improve the varieties and all trees ‘are 
grown from the seed. It adapts itself to 
any kind of soil and is a free bearer. The 
skin is of russet color, some kinds having 
a tinge of re 1 on one cheek. This is 
another fruk for which one must edu¬ 
cate the taste before it becomes really en¬ 
joyable, but when once the taste is ac¬ 
quired there Is a continual desire for 
more sapadillos. It is a good shipper, 
standing long journeys well. 

THE BANANA. 

{Musa.) 

In this Southern portion of the State, 
the banana is being grown to a consider¬ 
able extent commercially. For many years 
the people living on the Florida Keys 
have been growing this fruit quite largely 
for market purposes, their only market 



118 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


being Key West, where the fruit brought 
remunerative prices. Since Miami has be¬ 
come a city of commercial importance, 
the growers have found a splendid 1 mar¬ 
ket for the output here. The soils on the 
Keys are, as a rule, very rocky. Indeed 
so much so that they are not cultivated as 
a whole. The rock formation is what is 
known as the “pot hole formation,” the 
plants being set in the holes or cavities 
where there is some soil. 

Since the extension of the Florida 
East Coast Railway to Miami and South, 
banana growing is assuming greater pro¬ 
portions and many have, and are planting 
for commercial purposes. One planter in 
the Homestead country has less than an 
acre planted from which he has sold this 
season four hundred bunches at one dol¬ 
lar per bunch. 

SOILS WHERE GROWN. 

Perhaps there is no other tree or plant 
which will flourish on all sorts of soils, 
from the richest mulck to the most ordi¬ 
nary pine lands, as the banana. Seeming¬ 
ly it rejoices in a rich, black alluvial soil, 
yet at the same time on the poorest sand 
lands, by the aid of fertilizers and water 
it seems to flourish equally as well. The 
dwarf or smaller varieties thrive better 
on the sand lands than the larger and 
coarser kind's. It is believed from the 
experiments thus far made, that banana 
growing in the near future will become a 


most important factor in this Southern 
clime. Cotton seed meal or almost any 
kind of well balanced fertilizers are uti¬ 
lized readily by these plants. 

OTHER TROPICAL FRUITS. 

There are a large numiber of other 
kinds of tropical fruits which have been 
and are being grown in this Southern 
territory which so far have not proven of 
commercial value; but many of them 
should be planted for the fruit for home 
use and for decorative plants. Among 
these are the Kai-apple, (Aberia Caffra,) 
Carissa, (Carissa pappaya,) Star-apple, 
(C. Cainito,) Cocoa-Plum, (C. Niger,) 
Sour Sop, (A. Muricata,) Rose Apple, 
(E. Jambos,) Sea Grape, (C. uvifera) 
Barbados Cherry, (M. glabra) Maumee 
Sapota, (L. Mammasoa,) Ceriman of 
Trinidad (M. deliciosa.) This is but a 
small list of the real tropical fruits which 
may be grown in the portions of the State 
where frosts do not occur. Nearly all of 
the above list are being grown in the vi¬ 
cinity of Miami and several of the most 
rare kinds of these fruits were exhibited 
at the Dade County Fair which was held 
in March last. While many of these fruits 
will never be of commercial value, they 
are very palatable and should be grown. 

The pineapple, guava and other fruits 
are not mentioned in this paper as they 
are being grown extensively in many por¬ 
tions of the State. 


Economic Value of Birds to Farmers and Fruit 

Growers. 


By Prof. Wm. F. Blackman. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

There are four chief reasons why the 
lives of our birds ought to be protected. 

The first of these reasons is urged by 
the poets and the preachers—the birds are 
beautiful to look at and lovely in song, 
and hence should be cherished; the second 
reason is urged by the sportsmen—game 
birds must be protected in order that they 
may be reasonably abundant during the 
shooting season. The third reason is 
urged by the tourist and those whom he 
supports and enriches—birds along our 
seashores, lakes and river courses, espe¬ 
cially such as are tropical or semi-tropical 
in plumage and habit, give a charm to the 
Florida landscape which is unique; as a 
valuable asset to the hotel keeper, to the 
railway and steamboat company and to all 
those whose livelihood is derived in con¬ 
siderable measure from our winter vis¬ 
itors we should not permit the process of 
extermination of our plumage birds whicn 
has already gone to so deplorable a length 
to continue. 

These three reasons for the protection 
of our Florida birds, are good, all of 
them. But there is a fourth reason, to 
which attention is perhaps less often 
called, but which is no less cogent than 
the others. I refer to the economic value 


of our birds to the farmer and fruit¬ 
grower. It is to this matter that I wish 
to call your attention for a few minutes 
this evening. 

There are three ways in which birds 
perform services of incalculable import¬ 
ance to the tillers of the soil. In the 
first place, they help to keep down nox¬ 
ious weeds; in the second place, they de¬ 
stroy injurious insects; and in the third 
place, they devour rabbits, mice and other 
rodents, which infest and injure the fields 
and the orchards. 

i. Take the matter of noxious weeds 
first. How many plows, harrows, hoes,, 
rakes, darkeys, mules and dollars are ded¬ 
icated to the doleful business of killing 
weeds? How we sweat and groan over 
the task, which forever renews itself^ 
year after year! How do these weeds; 
tempt to profanity? How do they test 
our faith in the divine order of the world? 
Why, we ask, did a good God create “pus- 
ley” and sandspurs? Meantime, millions 
of feathered field-hands are working tire¬ 
lessly from dawn to dark every day to 
“down” these weeds in the gardens; in 
the plowed fields, in the pasture lands 
and ranges, in the woods, everywhere, 
they are at work with keen eye and swift 
wing and sharp bill and voracious appe- 






120

tite, destroying the seeds which other¬ 
wise would cover the earth and quintuple 
the farmer's toil—and the mule’s. 

Take the quail, the bobwhite, for exam¬ 
ple. Dr. S. F. Judd of the biological sur¬ 
vey reports having examined the stom¬ 
achs of thirteen quail, and that these 
contained 5,584 weed seeds; he also re¬ 
ports that on another occasion 801 stom¬ 
achs of these birds were examined, gath¬ 
ered from twenty-one different states, it 
being found that slightly more than one- 
half their contents was composed of 
seeds, chiefly of weeds, some sixty differ¬ 
ent species being represented. It was 
found that not less than 1,500 such seeds 
had been devoured at a single meal, and 
that some stomachs contained as many as 
3,000 or 5,000 seeds. A thousand crab- 
grass seeds were found in the stomach of 
a single quail, and 10,000 pigweed seeds 
in that of another. Dr. Judd computes 
that the bob whites in Virginia consume 
not less than 573 tons of weed seeds in a 
single winter. 

The mourning dove is also a valuable 
assistant to the farmer in this regard. 
An examination of hundreds of stomachs 
showed that from 60 to 70 per cent of the 
food of this graceful and grieving bird 
is composed of the seeds of weeds; “in a 
single stomach were found 7,500 seeds of 
the yellow wood sorrel, in another 6,400 
seeds of barn grass or foxtail." The lin¬ 
net, which is accused, and not without 
reason, of eating and injuring fruit, 
nevertheless was found to have 80 per 
cent of its stomach contents composed of 
the seeds of weeds, most of them nox¬ 
ious. The food of the red winged black¬ 
bird is chiefly the seeds of weeds, as is 
that of the sparrows, of which there are 


some forty varieties. Mr. F. E. L. Beal of 
the Biological Survey, once computed 
that a single species of sparrow, the tree 
sparrow, in a single state, Iowa, consumed 
1,750,000 pounds, or 875 tons, of weed 
seeds in a single season. 

Now, how many field hands, working 
with the hoe at $1.5° P er day, would be 
required to exterminate the miserable 
harvest of 875 tons of weed seeds in the 
state of Iowa if any considerable portion 
of these had sprouted and grown? And 
how much, then, do the farmers of Iowa, 
owe the tree sparrows of that state for a 
single season’s service? And if they can¬ 
not, and need not, pay this debt in coin, 
what measure of gratitude and of protec¬ 
tion do they owe these feathered friends, 
of this and other varieties. 

2. A still more important service to 
our farmers is rendered by the birds 
through the destruction by them of in¬ 
jurious insects. 

I hold in my hand a letter from Dr. 
T. S. Palmer of the bureau of biological 
survey at Washington, regarding the re¬ 
port which is now being prepared for the 
National Conservation Commission, and 
which is soon to be published, on the in¬ 
jury done our agricultural interests by in¬ 
sects. Dr. Palmer states that Dr. L. O. 
Howard, chief of the Bureau of Ento¬ 
mology, estimates “the total annual loss 
of all kinds caused by insects, including 
injury to crops, garden truck, forests, do¬ 
mesticated animals and health,” at the 
stupendous figure of $1,200,000,000. An 
annual loss on account of insect depreda¬ 
tions of above $13 for every man, woman 
and child in our population; a loss each 
year exceeding by more than 25 per 
cent the total public debt of the United 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


121 


States, or the joint capital of all our na¬ 
tional banks; a loss greater than the en¬ 
tire annual expenditure of the federal 
government, including the cost of the 
army, the navy, pensions and interest on 
the public debt; a loss equal to the value 
of all the merchandise imported annual¬ 
ly into the country, and nearly seven times 
the total receipts of the postoffice de¬ 
partment, or the salaries of all the teach¬ 
ers in our public schools—this is the al¬ 
most incredible estimate of our annual 
loss through beetles, bugs and their kind, 
which the Washington savants ask us to 
accept. 

Whether the estimate is exact or not, 
we have only to remind ourselves of the 
havoc wrought by the boll-weevil in the 
cotton fields of the south and the Hes¬ 
sian fly in the wheat fields of the north, 
by the scale and whitefly in our orange 
groves, and the curculio, the cankerworm, 
the codling moth, and the tent caterpillar 
in the orchards of other sections, and by 
the Colorado potato bug everywhere be¬ 
tween the oceans ; of the prairies devastat¬ 
ed from time to time by hordes of grass¬ 
hoppers ; of the forests infested with cat¬ 
erpillars and borers; of the cattle infect¬ 
ed with Texas fever by ticks; of the men 
and women infected with various grave 
diseases by mosquitoes and house flies, 
and of how many hot days and dear dol¬ 
lars we have all spent in warring against 
these pests—we have only to remind our¬ 
selves of these things in order to gain 
some sense of the burden imposed upon 
us by these hosts of hostile insects. 

How shall they be kept in check? How 
shall this drain on our resources be di¬ 
minished? We resort to insecticides— 
sprays, poisonous fumes, what not—and 


these afford some relief. Meantime, 
there is fighting for us, day and night, 
if we stop to 1 think of it, a countless and 
patriotic army of birds, swift and skill¬ 
ful and untiring, and amazingly hungry. 
Among these are some forty varieties of 
woodpeckers; how marvelously acute the 
ear which hears the movement of the 
grub buried within the tree and accurately 
locates it, how astonishing the muscular 
power which drives the sharp bill into the 
wood again and again, with almost un¬ 
believable rapidity and precision of 
stroke; how wonderfully fashioned as a 
spear the barbed tongue which pulls the 
borer from his hiding place! Examine 
the stomach of a woodpecker, and you 
will find ants, grubs, caterpillars and scale 
insects in great numbers, most of them 
the farmer’s foes; 5,000 ants have been 
found in the stomach of a single “flicker.” 
How wonderful the chemistry by which 
the cardinal turns “adult beetles, grass¬ 
hoppers, crickets, flies, ants and their 
larvae” and rose bugs into brilliant feath¬ 
er and ecstatic song. Mr. E. IT. Forbush, 
ornithologist of the Massachusetts State 
Board of Agriculture, has recently report¬ 
ed some experiments with a number of 
chicadees which frequented an old apple 
orchard in that state. In the stomachs of 
four birds there were counted more than 
1,000 eggs of the canker worm; and in 
addition to this it was estimated that each 
chicadee devoured daily during the early 
spring, on an average, thirty female cank¬ 
er worm moths, each containing in her 
body more than 5,000 eggs, so that each 
bird destroyed more than 140,000 unlaid 
eggs, besides those already deposited, dur¬ 
ing the twenty-five days in which the 
cankerworms were creeping up the tree 


122

trunks. Was there ever another such 
omelet ? 

The Biological Survey examined the 
stomachs of 420 kingbirds and reported 
insects, mostly noxious, as constituting 
90 per cent of their contents. In the case 
of the phoebe, the percentage was even 
larger, and included klick beetles, May 
beetles and weevils, wasps, flies, bugs and 
spiders. The stomach of a cuckoo was 
found to contain 250 tent caterpillars and 
another 217 heads of the fall web worm; 
the stomachs of 155 cuckoos contained 
2,771 caterpillars, largely of the hairy va¬ 
rieties, which most birds refuse. The 
blue jay, that burly, self assertive, squal¬ 
ling, pugnacious and rapacious, though 
handsome rascal, who sometimes no doubt 
destroys the eggs of other birds, has been 
shown to be the devourer of large quan¬ 
tities of harmful insects; even the thieving 
and omnivorous crow, whom nobody 
seems to love, eats beetles, grasshoppers, 
cutworms, and other caterpillars, chiefly 
noxious, in great numbers. More than 
one-half the food of the meadow lark is 
composed of beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, 
caterpillars and a considerable portion of 
the remaining part of noxious weed seeds. 
All the several species of swallows, the 
scurrying cavalry of this beneficial army, 
live chiefly on winged insects, of which 
they devour immeasurable quantities. 
More than 60 per cent, of the stomach 
contents in the case of the brown thrasher, 
more than 70 per cent in the case of the 
blue bird and more than 90 per cent in 
the case of the house wren have been 
found to consist of insects. More than 
fifty species of birds are known to prey 
on the boll weevil, that implacable 
scourge of our Southland. 

And so the merry and tuneful warriors 


wage battle against the invading army of 
bugs all day and every day, especially 
during the breeding season, in the upper 
air, among the branches of the trees and 
up and down their trunks, in the field, in 
the swamp, and by the roadside. Nor 
does this battle cease as most battles do, 
with the coming on of darkness, for then 
the night hawk, or bullbat, takes up the 
assault—Tie most voracious perhaps of 
all the insect eating birds. Its stomach is 
enormous, aldermanic, and it is seldom 
empty. Mr. Beal, of the Biological Sur¬ 
vey reports the results of an examination 
of the stomachs of 100 bullbats; in one 
of these some 1,800 ants were found, in 
another the remains of thirty-four May 
beetles, and in another Colorado potato 
bugs, squash bugs and leaf hoppers. One 
stomach contained portions of seventeen 
different species of insects. Myriads of 
mosquitoes, among them the fever-carry¬ 
ing kind, are destroyed nightly by this 
winged and grunting board of health. Yet 
there are farmers who look on smiling 
while uninstructed boys amuse themselves 
by shooting bullbats in the twilight. 

To be sure, certain species of birds, 
like the cherry bird, the blue jay, the 
crow, the rice bird, the red winged black 
bird, the crow black bird, the linnet, the 
sap sucker, the robin and the cat bird are 
accused of eating and perforating fruit 
and stealing grain, and no doubt justly so; 
probably some birds help to spread scale 
insects from tree to tree, but I am con¬ 
vinced that all of these, taking the matter 
“by and large,” are far more beneficial 
than harmful and deserve our thanks and 
protection. Is not the laborer “worthy 
of his hire?’ 

3. A third service to the farmer is ren-

123 


dered by such predaceous birds as feed 
on mice, rabbits and other injurious ro¬ 
dents. In some countries, as in Austra¬ 
lia, these rodents inflict almost incalcul¬ 
able damage upon agriculture, and every¬ 
where they are harmful to the nursery, 
the orchard and the field. It is to the keen 
eye, the swift, strong wing and the sharp 
and cruel beak of hawk and owl that we 
must chiefly look for protection against 
these gnawing nuisances. There are in 
the United States above seventy species 
of these birds, and they all have excellent 
appetites. Now and then no doubt they 
snatch a chicken from the barn yard; no 
doubt they destroy numbers of our 
smaller and useful birds; but we know 
that their chief food is not these. Here 
is one report among many, made by the 
experts: “In the stomachs of forty-five 
rough-legged hawks (Archibuteo lago- 
pus sancti-johannis), taken in several dif¬ 
ferent states, were found 128 harmful 
rodents, one weasel, one schew and sev¬ 
enty insects. The rodents (besides nine¬ 
teen which could not be determined spe¬ 
cifically from the remains) consisted of 
one gopher (salamander), two rabbits, 
four house mice, four white-footed mice, 
and ninety-eight meadow mice. No traces 
of birds or poultry were found in any of 
the forty-five stomachs.’* I once saw a 
shrike drive his beak into the skull of a 
sparrow; this was a single instance, but 
how many hundreds of noxious animals 
and insects have we all seen impaled on 
orange thorns by these bloody butchers 
of vermin? Yet I still recall vividly the 
sense of noble achievement I felt, as a 
boy, when I succeeded in kiliing a hawk 
or an owl; I ought to have been spanked, 
but there have been state legislatures fool¬ 
ish enough to offer bounties for the de¬ 


struction of these good friends of the 
farmer. 

This, then, is the service which the 
birds render to us farmers and fruit 
growers—they are incessantly at work 
decimating the army of noxious weeds, 
insects and vermin, which is ever swarm¬ 
ing across our fields—creeping, jumping, 
burrowing, flying—and which except for 
the protection afforded by the birds would 
devour all our substance. 

It is computed by some experts that 
the number of these friendly birds, tak¬ 
ing the whole country together, has been 
diminished in recent years by some 50 
per cent.; be this as it may, I think that 
all observers will agree that they are not 
so numerous as they formerly were, or 
as they ought to be. 

I appeal to you on behalf of our feath¬ 
ered friends. Seven things you can do 
to protect those we have and to increase 
their number—you can refrain from 
shooting or trapping them, or allowing 
them to be shot or trapped on your prem¬ 
ises ; you can provide for them safe breed¬ 
ing places and an occasional lunch about 
your door; you can prevent your boys and 
others from destroying or robbing their 
nests; you can see that the children are 
properly instructed in home and school 
concerning this matter; you can assist in 
preventing the passage of unwise game 
and bird laws, and in securing the passage 
of such as are good and wholesome; you 
can help provide for the appointment of 
a suitable number of suitable persons as 
wardens, state and county, and, lastly, 
you can encourage the Florida Audubon 
Society, of which it is my privilege to be 
a vice president, in its crusade for bird 
protection, by becoming members or by 
contributing to its treasury.

TRANSLOCATION OF PLANT FOOD CONSTITUENTS IN THE 
PLANT AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN DEVELOPING AND 

MAINTAINING. GROWTH. 


By J. S. Carroll. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Once upon a time, it is related that a 
priest was called upon by his parishioners 
to pray over their lands and bless them in 
order that they might yield abundant 
harvests. As he passed' from place to 
place pronouncing his benedictions upon 
the soil he came upon a very unpromising 
field. Surveying these barren acres with 
great despair, he exclaimed: “Ah! breth¬ 
ren, no use to pray here; this land needs 
manure.” 

From the writings of the earliest inves¬ 
tigators we find that it was the custom 
of man to assist nature in yielding abun¬ 
dant harvests by applying to the soil va¬ 
rious substances called manure. Little did 
he know or understand at that time the 
fundamental principles underlying their 
use, for little work of any consequence 
had been undertaken to pry into nature’s 
secrets or to attempt to interpret her im¬ 
mutable laws. As the years moved on¬ 
ward man became more interested in the 
processes of nature and many learned in¬ 
vestigators devoted years to the study of 


plant growth, the composition of plants, 
their food and sources of food supply, 
thereby laying the foundation and paving 
the way for our present knowledge of 
chemistry in its relation to agriculture. 

While the beginning of true scientific 
agricultural chemistry may be dated from 
important discoveries during the latter 
part of the 18th century by such scientists 
as Priestly, Scheele, Lavoissier, Caven¬ 
dish and Black, yet it is interesting to 
pause a little while to note a few theories 
advanced by some of the early writers as 
to plant growth. 

It was believed by the alchemists that 
manure acted in some mysterious way— 
that “spirits” left the decaying* manure 
and entered the plants producing a more 
vigorous growth. The worthless character 
of leached manure was attributed to the 
fact that the “spirits” had departed from 
such manure. From this source we have 
handed down to us such expressions as 
“spirits of hartshorn,” “spirits of nitre,’ 
and many others, showing the ideas then 
entertained as to the composition of mat¬ 
ter. 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

Early in the 17th century van Helmont 
undertook to solve the problem of plant 
growth and proved to his satisfaction that 
all the products of plant growth were de¬ 
rived from water. 

Some fifty years later Digby (1660) 
attributed the growth of plants to a kind 
of “Balsam” which the air contained. 

A theory advanced later by Jethro Tull 
was to the effect that the food of plants 
consisted of soil particles and that these 
soil particles must be rendered very min¬ 
ute before they could be absorbed by the 
rootlets. This theory is of interest since 
the importance of good tillage is empha¬ 
sized in crop production. 

The first contribution of importance to 
the subject of plant nutrition was made 
by a Swiss naturalist, Bonnet, during the 
18th century. He found that air is the true 
source of carbon which forms so large 
a part of the plant substance. 

The first work written in the English 
language on Agricultural Chemistry was 
in 1795 by a Scottish Nobleman, the Earl 
of Dundonald. His teachings were that 
plants ‘are composed of grass with a small 
proportion of calcareous matter.” 

DeSaussure in 1804 gave to the world 
the most important contribution to science 
up to this time. He was the first to call 
attention to the mineral or ash constitu¬ 
ents of plants and maintained that these 
ash ingredients were essential, for with¬ 
out them plant life was impossible. 

* 

In the early part of the last century 
Sir Humphry Davy published a series of 
lectures on Agricultural Chemistry which 
added to the knowledge of the composi¬ 
tion and functions of the soil. 

Boussingault in 1838 was the first 
chemist to carry out elaborate experi¬ 


ments to determine the question whether 
plants could assimilate the free nitrogen 
of the air. 

It was not until 1840 when Liebig pub¬ 
lished his celebrated work “Organic 
Chemistry in Its Application to Agricul¬ 
ture and Physiology” that the new science 
of Agriculture was inaugurated. In his 
preface he states that “perfect agriculture 
is the true foundation of all trade and in¬ 
dustry, but a rational system of agricul¬ 
ture cannot be formed without the appli¬ 
cation of scientific principles, for such a 
system must be based on an exact ac¬ 
quaintance with the means of nutrition 
of vegetables and with the influence of 
soils and actions of manures upon them. 
This knowledge we must seek from chem¬ 
istry which teaches the mode of investi¬ 
gating the composition and of studying 
the character of the different substances 
from which plants derive nourishment.” 

Chemistry tells us that the materials of 
which all matter is composed consist of 
some seventy distinct elementary forms 
of matter known as chemical elements. 
It is by means of chemical analysis that 
we are able to determine the elementary 
composition of the earth and its life. 

Less than one hundred years ago it was 
learned that plants are built up from ma¬ 
terials from the air and soil, water being 
one of them. The number and kind of 
elements that have been found to be ab¬ 
solutely essential to the growth of plants 
are ten—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitro¬ 
gen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, sulphur and iron. These are 
called plant food elements and all healthy 
plants must contain them, and' in the ab¬ 
sence of one of them, the plant cannot 
make a normal growth.

Plants derive their food from the air 
and the soil. The air supplies direct 
chiefly the element carbon, although it is 
the original source of hydrogen, oxygen 
and nitrogen. Hydrogen and oxygen are 
supplied mainly through the soil in the 
form of water. 

About 95 per cent, of the total dry 
matter of plants comes from the air; the 
remaining 5 per cent, is in the incombus¬ 
tible or ash constituents which are sup¬ 
plied exclusively by the soil. These ash 
constituents are indispensable for without 
them the carbon of the air, the hydrogen 
and oxygen of the water and the nitro¬ 
gen of the soil and air could not enter in¬ 
to plant life. 

The plant takes its food througii the 
leaves and roots which are called the or¬ 
gans of nutrition. 

The chlorophyll or green coloring mat¬ 
ter in the leaf-cell plays an important 
part for it is in these leaf-cells that the 
carbonic acid of the air is decomposed 
through the influence of light and heat, 
the carbon being retained while the oxy¬ 
gen is given off. This process is called 
assimilation and takes place during the 
daytime, while at night the food made 
during the day is changed, whereby it 
can be transferred in solution wherever it 
is needed. Iron as well as daylight is nec¬ 
essary in the formation of chlorophyll. 
The carbon absorbed by the plant and the 
hydrogen and oxygen taken up by the 
roots in the form of water meet in the 
leaves of the plant and are formed into 
starch, sugar, fat, etc., and the same ele¬ 
ments together with nitrogen and a little 
sulphur form the albuminoids. 

The manner in which the roots take up 
food 1 is very different from that of the 


leaves, for the surface membranes of the 
roots are not full of holes and solid mat¬ 
ter cannot pass through. Therefore, the 
food must be in solution and its absorp¬ 
tion by the rootlets is obtained by means 
of diffusion or “osmosis.” The food de¬ 
rived from the soil is not taken up as in¬ 
dividual chemical elements but chiefly in 
the form of acids or salts. Thus nitrogen 
is combined with oxygen to form nitric 
acid and when united with bases like po¬ 
tassium or calcium forms potassium ni¬ 
trate or calcium nitrate. These weak so¬ 
lutions taken up by the roots are concen¬ 
trated in the upper part of the plant ow¬ 
ing to rapid evaporation by the leaves 
and are used in the formation of new tis¬ 
sue. 

While considerable research has been 
given to the work of determining the 
functions performed by the different con¬ 
stituents taken into' the plant, yet there is 
very little definite knowledge on this 
subject at the present time. 

As the material furnished by the air is 
supplied freely and abundantly to' every 
plant it will not be necessary to devote 
any time to it but we will turn our atten¬ 
tion to the substances furnished by the 
soil. The soil does not always supply the 
plant with sufficient material for its 
growth and as these deficiencies must be 
made good by man before he can hope 
for abundant harvests we will consider 
for a few moments the part they play in 
plant life. 

Of the elements supplied by the soil as 
plant food, magnesium, iron and sulphur, 
and sometimes calcium, are usually found 
to exist in sufficient quantities to supply 
the requirements of plants. Potassium, 
phosphorus and nitrogen, and some-

times calcium 1 , are not always present in 
sufficient amounts in an available form to 
supply the needs of the growing plants. 

Sulphur occurs in plant tissue in com¬ 
paratively small amounts. It is taken into 
plants in the form of sulphates, as potas¬ 
sium sulphate, calcium sulphate, and oth¬ 
er sulphates, and plays a very important 
part in the formation of albuminous mat¬ 
ter of plants. These albuminoids move 
about in the plant, principally towards 
the grain and fruit. In some plants sul¬ 
phur is a constituent of the essential oils 
and can be detected by the odor such as 
in the onion, garlic, horseradish and oth¬ 
ers. 

While iron is necessary for plant 
growth and is always present in plants, it 
occurs in about the smallest amount of 
any of the ash elements. The function of 
iron is to assist in the formation of chlor¬ 
ophyll or the green coloring matter of 
plants. It is not known yet whether iron 
enters into the chemical composition of 
chlorophyll or is merely associated with 
it.. 

Magnesium occurs in much smaller 
amounts than calcium does although it is 
stored up in the seeds about three times 
more liberally than is calcium. Magnes¬ 
ium assimilates more slowly than any of 
the other ash constituents of plants. It en¬ 
ters into the chemical composition of the 
chlorophyll although plants do not re¬ 
quire much magnesium until the period 
of formation of the seeds. It has been 
found that plants grown with an incom¬ 
plete supply of magnesium frequently 
have sterile seed. 

Calcium is always present in the ash 
material and plants cannot reach full ma¬ 
turity without it. In fact some crops, such 


as clover, peas, alfalfa, require so much 
calcium that they are called ‘dime 
plants.” The special function of calcium 
is in assisting in the construction of the 
cell walls, and no new plant cells can be 
formed without it. Calcium, is found in 
the leaves of plants at all stages of growth 
and is very essential for their full devel¬ 
opment. It has been stated that calcium 
compounds are necessary for the conver¬ 
sion of starch into cellulose. 

When the growth of a plant has been 
checked by withholding calcium, the 
plant will show increased vigor within a 
few hours after supplying it. Calcium un¬ 
like magnesium is assimilated in the early 
stages of the plant’s growth, for example 
in wheat 80 per cent, is assimilated before 
the plant heads. It does not accumulate 
to such an extent in the seeds as do- some 
of the other ash elements for only about 
i-io of the amount removed by grain 
crops is in the seeds, the remaining 9-10 
being distributed throughout the straw. 

It is probable that more work has been 
devoted to the study of nitrogen as a 
food for plants than to any other element. 
This is a specially interesting subject for 
the reason that plants are surrounded by 
an atmosphere of nitrogen and it was to 
determine whether it was possible for 
plants to use the nitrogen direct from the 
air. It has been found that there are only 
certain plants called legumes that have 
the power of utilizing this nitrogen for 
food by means of nodules or tubercles on 
their roots. Nitrogen is taken up by the 
roots of plants in the form of nitrates and 
combines with carbon, hydrogen and oth¬ 
er elements to form the nitrogenous com¬ 
pounds so largely present in plants. In 
the absence of nitrogen a plant makes no

appreciable growth and when there is an 
insufficient supply of this element the 
plant's foliage does not develop a rich 
green color but takes on a yellowish 
tinge. 

Phosphorus occurs in parts of the 
plant in the form, of phosphates. These 
phosphates play a very important part in 
the development of the young plant at 
the time of germination. 

Phosphoric acid is one of the constitu¬ 
ents of chlorophyll and is necessary ft li¬ 
the building up of every plant cell. It is 
not only important to young plants but is 
necessary at all stages of the plant’s 
growth. 

The chief function of phosphorus 
may be said to be to aid in the production 
and transportation of the proteid sub¬ 
stances. These proteid bodies which are 
produced in the leaves are finally trans¬ 
ported to the seed where they accumulate 
to the greatest extent. From 60 to 75 per 
cent, of the total phosphates removed in 
a crop is found in the seeds. 

The translocation of phosphoric acid 
in the plant is very interesting. It is the 
most mobile substance of all the inorgan¬ 
ic constituents of plants. It is continually 
moving from the lower to the upper part 
of plants, and a large percentage of phos¬ 
phoric acid found in the grain was moved 
from the leaves and stems of plants even 
after it had once come to a rest in these 
organs. 

In speaking of the function of potassi¬ 
um Prof. Harry Snyder in his excellent 
work on “The Chemistry of Plant and 
Animal Life” says: “Potassium is one of 
the most important and least variable of 
all the elements found in the ash of 
plants. It is quite evenly distributed 


throughout the growing plant and gener¬ 
ally occurs in the entire plant in the larg¬ 
est proportion of any of the essential ash 
elements. It is taken up in the early 
stages of plant growth and is always 
present to the greatest extent in the 
active and growing parts as in the 
leaves where the production of plant tis¬ 
sue occurs. Potassium is one of the ele¬ 
ments most essential for the plant’s de¬ 
velopment. 

“The function of potassium is appar¬ 
ently to aid in the production and trans¬ 
portation of the carbohydrate com¬ 
pounds, as starch and sugar, and thus in¬ 
directly in the formation of all organic 
matter. In sugar and starch-producing 
crops, as sugar beets and potatoes, it 
takes an important part in the growth and 
development. Potassium doubtless has 
much to do in the way of regulating the 
acidity of the sap by forming organic 
salts such as potassium bitartrate in 
grapes. At the time of seed formation 
there is a slight retrograde movement of 
the potash, in some cases a small part be¬ 
ing returned to the soil. The supply of 
available potash in the soil has great in¬ 
fluence upon the vigor of plant growth. 
Weak and sickly plants are always defi¬ 
cient in potash. Some crops require more 
growth than do others and some experi¬ 
ence difficulty in obtaining it. Some 
plants contain such large amounts of pot¬ 
ash that they are called ‘potash plants/ ” 

All research shows that in the higher 
order of plants potassium; cannot be re¬ 
placed or substituted by any other ele¬ 
ment 

It is a common fact to all plants that 
the various constituents move about in 
the plant during its growth.

The leaf of the plant is its laboratory 
where food is prepared for the support of 
the parts of the plant. But when the 
leaf has grown old and the purpose of its 
existence has been performed, it gives 
up its life and substance to 1 perfect tffe 
parts of the plant and 1 finally to the per¬ 
fection of the seed whereby the plant 
may perpetuate itself. 

It is known that plants do not have the 
same chemical composition at different 


stages of growth and it is due to the dis¬ 
covery of this scientific principle that we 
have been taught some highly important 
lessons as to the times and seasons at 
which crops may best be harvested. 

There is yet much work to 1 be done in 
adding to our present knowledge of the 
special functions of different plant food 
constituents and no field of research offers 
better opportunity to our scientists than 
investigations of this character. 


THE STATE CHEMIST'S AID TO THE FARMER. 


By B. H. Bridges. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Having been placed on the committee 
to report on Fertilizers, and being fa¬ 
miliar with the control of the state’s 
supply, I have decided to devote my pa¬ 
per to the discussion of the fertilizer 
trade, paying special attention to the past 
year. 

At the outset, I may say that the fer¬ 
tilizer found upon the market during the 
past year has fully met, and on the aver¬ 
age been above, the standard represented 
by the analysis on the tags. It is my be¬ 
lief that no manufacturer of a commo¬ 
dity in this country is so careful as to 
the quality of his goods as is the manu¬ 
facturer of fertilizers. 

In this day when the spirit of com¬ 
mercialism has permeated every endeav¬ 
or we may justly ask the question if it is 
business for the manufacturer of fertil¬ 
izer to try to defraud the consumer of 


fertilizer. Those who are not intimately 
acquainted with the facts might say that 
any manufacturer will defraud the con¬ 
sumer when he can. I do not believe this 
to be so for the reason that it is not to 
the best interest of the manufacturer to 
practice fraud. And the reasons why it 
is not to the best interest of the manu¬ 
facturer to defraud the consumer is be¬ 
cause there is a true co-partnership rela¬ 
tion between the consumer and the man¬ 
ufacturer; and second, because of the en¬ 
forcement of the fertilizer law by the 
state authorities and the exercise of the 
privilege of the special sample by the citi¬ 
zens under the law. 

It is an unquestioned fact that a ma¬ 
jority of the fertilizer sold, is sold on 
time, i. e., the manufacturer receives his 
pay for the fertilizer when the consumer 
has received payment for his crop. Now 
if the manufacturer sells his customer a 


9 




130 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


bill of fertilizer and depends on the suc¬ 
cess of his crop for his pay, does this not 
establish just as true a co-partnership re¬ 
lation between the farmer and the manu¬ 
facturer as exists between Smith and 
Brown who sell dry goods in co-partner¬ 
ship? The manufacturer who sells goods 
on time is interested in the success of the 
farmer because he has money invested 
there. If the farmer fails, then there is 
hardship on him to pay his fertilizer bill, 
and hence the pocket of the manufactur¬ 
er is touched. Mr. F. B. Dancey, in a 
paper delivered in Atlanta, a few months 
ago, said that as a farmer followed his 
wandering boy because his heart was 
touched, so the manufacturer of fertil¬ 
izer follows his wandering dollar because 
his pocket is touched. 

If the average farmer could once un¬ 
derstand that it is not profitable for the 
manufacturer to practice fraud there 
would be a better understanding of the 
manufacture, control and demand of this 
indispensable commodity—fertilizer. No 
man can judge accurately as to the qual¬ 
ity of a fertilizer by the senses of ap¬ 
pearance, smell and touch. There is one 
and only one way to test fertilizer and 
this is the chemical laboratory. For this 
reason, not many years ago, there was 
perhaps more sophistry practiced in com¬ 
mercial fertilizer than any other manu¬ 
factured product. The average farmer 
bought Brown’s fertilizer because he 
heard some one say Brown’s was good. 
Gradually conditions have changed. More 
farmers are buying fertilizer on a guar¬ 
antee basis, the same as the manufactur¬ 
er does. What manufacturer would 
purchase a cargo of Brown’s potash, 
without knowing how much potash was 


in it? There is more competition in the 
manufacturing industry and our manu¬ 
facturers are nearer home where we can 
get at them should they attempt decep¬ 
tion. And again, as stated above, the 
saying that honesty is the best policy 
was never truer relative to any business 
than when applied to the fertilizer indus¬ 
try. 

It is not my intention to discredit our 
state control department in the least, nor 
to minimize the importance of this 
branch of government. Were it not for 
the state laboratory the consumer and 
the honest manufacturer would suffer at 
the hands of the dishonest manufacturer. 
It seems to be an universally recognized 
fact that the farmer does not get his 
share of this world’s goods. So if it 
were not for the control afforded by the 
state laboratory the honestly inclined 
manufacturer would be compelled to 
seek dishonest methods in order to suc¬ 
ceed in business, and hence the farmer 
would be the ultimate loser. The com¬ 
missioner of agriculture in his report for 
the years 1907 and 1908 says: “The 

people as a whole reap more direct bene¬ 
fit from the proper application of the 
stock feed and fertilizer laws than from 
any other statutes that mark the pages of 
our law books.” 

The fertilizer law is enforced by the 
taking of what we designate as official 
samples, and analyzing the samples so 
taken, and publishing the results in the 
Florida Quarterly Bulletin. These sam¬ 
ples referred to are taken by the state 
chemist himself, or by other sworn in¬ 
spectors of the department. There has 
never been a complaint, so far as I know, 
of a manufacturer or consumer, that we 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


131 


did not procure a fair sample of any 
goods. The law itself designates how 
samples shall be taken and inspectors com¬ 
ply with its requirements. 

Nearly all the states have a fertilizer 
law which embodies about the provisions 
of our official sample, but very few have 
the special sample. Under the Florida 
law, the consumer may, under proper 
safeguards, have samples of his goods 
analyzed by the State chemist. We think 
this provision of the law affords an addi¬ 
tional protection to the honest manufac¬ 
turer and to the consumer, which can 
not be had by the official sample alone; 
and accounts in a good measure for the 
excellence of the fertilizer sold in this 
state during the past years. 

Another fact which contributes to the 
efficiency of the fertilizer law is the rep¬ 
resentatives of /the different fertilizer 


companies. If there are goods on sale 
below the analysis printed on the guar¬ 
antee tags, agents of other companies are 
quick to dscover it and take advantage 
thereof. 

Finally, as evidence of the status of 
the fertilizer trade during the year 1908, 
I incorporate in my paper the facts set 
forth in the annual report of the state 
chemist, wherein he says: “The average 
of 127 complete fertilizers was: 

Ammonia .3.82 p. c. 

Available Phos. Acid (P2O5). 6.94 p. c. 
Potash (K2O) .7.08 p. c. 

The average state value of the 127 sam¬ 
ples of complete fertilizer was $28.82 per 
ton. The average price of the various 
brands sold throughout the state was 
$33.04 per ton an excess over state val¬ 
ues of $4.22 per ton.” 


CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT FOODS. 


By Mrs. N. M. G. Prange. 


I am asked to continue an account of 
my study of plant foods and to tell how 
it has benefited me practically. I can 
not tell just how much practical good I 
have gained. The greater benefit from 
such things conies in indirect ways and 
I know my life is broader, my enjoy¬ 
ment has been greater, my interest keen¬ 
er—all my faculties more alert, because 
of this study, and a wide-awake person 
is likely to get his share of the dollars 
and cents. I have not tried to become 


a scientist, nor have I experimented with 
the idea of “adding (?) to the world’s 
knowledge.” This last is a dangerous 
and expensive proceeding for a beginner. 
My aim is first to learn and understand 
things that have been learned by others, 
to acquire what I can of what has been 
gathered through many years, by many 
men of many minds; after which I hope 
to use some judgment in selecting the 
methods that are adapted to my situation. 

He who criticizes “book farming' 







132 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


should remember the good he has gained 
from other books. Take geography, for 
instance, he would feel it to be unwise to 
depend entirely upon his own explora¬ 
tions, and also would find it hard to tell 
where his study of geography has added 
to his dollars, still he recognizes its need; 
and it is just such a need that I feel for 
all information pertaining to plant foods, 
especially as applied to citrus culture. 

My first problem was the K2O used as 
standard for potash. I do not buy pot¬ 
ash any cheaper because of tracing it 
out through chemistry as follows: The 
least part of a substance which retains 
the identity of that substance is called a 
molecule. Each molecule is composed of 
a definite number of atoms. An atom is 
the smallest part of an element. An ele¬ 
ment is a substance that can not be di¬ 
vided into other substances and is rep¬ 
resented by a symbol—a letter or letters 
from its English or Latin name—stand¬ 
ing for one atom of that element. Each 
compound has, in chemistry, a formula 
showing how many atoms of certain ele¬ 
ments are found in each molecule of this 
compound. The K2O is the formula of 
pure potash, the K standing for kalium, 
the latin name for potassium, and the 2 
showing there are two atoms of potas¬ 
sium, and the O indicating one atom 
of oxygen. The chemical name is oxide 
of potassium. No, I don’t buy potash 
for any less money and it doesn’t do my 
trees any more good, but I do feel more 
self-respecting when I talk about it, and 
besides, doesn’t one stand a better chance 
to choose a suitable method of cultiva¬ 
tion and fertilization if he understands 
just what his plant foods are, just what 
changes must take place to make them 


available to the plant, and just what con¬ 
ditions will facilitate or retard those 
changes ? 

The question that naturally comes next 
is, “What is sulphate of potash?” It is 
not the fault of the kali works if one 
lacks information about potash. In their 
“Stassfurt Industry” we find “Sulphate 
of potash is simply actual potash com¬ 
bined with sulphuric acid.” What is an 
acid? “Something sour?” Well then 
what makes things sour? “The acid in 
them of course” And there we are, in 
a neat little circle. 

Chemistry tells us “An acid is a com¬ 
pound formed by the union of a non- 
metal with hydrogen and usually oxy¬ 
gen.” When formed of two elements it 
is a bin ary acid and when formed of 
three elements it is a tern ary acid. Web¬ 
ster ends his definition with “and in its 
compounds ’exchanges its hydrogen for 
a metal.” It is this quality of exchang¬ 
ing its hydrogen for a metal that gives 
to us our chemical fertilizers. When the 
metal acts thus it is in the form of a hy¬ 
droxyl, that is, is combined with hydro¬ 
gen and oxygen, and is called a base. 
When the change has taken place we have 
neither acid nor base, but a salt and 
water. 

Binary salts, that is, salts made from 
binary acids, are named by adding ide 
to the name of the non-metal. Ternary 
salts are named from the acid that forms 
them. If an acid ends in ic the salt ends 
in ate . Nitric acid (HNO3) makes ni¬ 
trates. If the acid ends in ous the salt 
ends in ite. . Nitron acid (HNO2) 
makes nitric. 

A ternary acid ending in ic is far 
stronger than one composed of the same 


i 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


elements ending in oils but the only dif¬ 
ference in the formula is that it has one 
atom more of oxygen. 

The name “Sulphate of potash” tells 
us it is a salt formed by the hydrogen 
in sulphuric acid being displaced by the 
base KOH. We wonder how it “works 
out” so turn to acid formulas. Sulphur¬ 
ic acid is H2SO4 and we write out our 
example: 

H2SO4 * 2 KOH = K2SO4 + 2H2O 

Sulphuric Potassium Sulphate Water 

Acid Hydroxyl Potash 

It would take too long to explain 
why we take KOH twice but there is a 
reason given in chemistry under the head 
of “valence.” 

What we buy as high grade sulphate 
of potash is guaranteed to be from 90 
to 95 per cent chemically pure and to 
give 49 per cent K2O. Let us reckon it 
out. An atom is so inconceivably small 
it cannot be weighed and the calculation 
must be made by proportion. As hydro¬ 
gen is the lightest substance known, oth¬ 
er atoms are said to weigh “so many 
times as much as hydrogen.” We turn 
to the table of atomic weights and find 
two atoms of potassium weigh 78.2, one 
atom of sulphur, 32, and four atoms of 
oxygen, 64; making the molecules 
K2SO4 an d K2O weigh 174.2 and 94.2 
respectively. Therefore in 174.2 ounces, 
pounds or tons of sulphate of potash 
(K2SO4), 94- 2 ounces, pounds or tons 
would be pure potash (K2O). We have 
to buy 193.55 lbs, of 90 per cent sul¬ 
phate, or 183.36 lbs. of 95 per cent sul¬ 
phate to get 174.2 lbs. of pure sulphate 
(K2SO4). Our 94.2 lbs. K2O is 47.63 
per cent of the former and 51.3 per cent 
of the latter, so we are sure of our prom¬ 
ised 49 per cent, and we see all these for¬ 


133 

mulas and per cents that have seemingly 
been so intricate are readily mastered 
when given a little thought. But—do I 
hear not one but many ask what is that 
10 per cent of the high grade and 52 per 
cent of the low grade sulphate of potash 
that is not sulphate of potash chemically. 
It is a variety of natural salts formed 
with the sulphate of potash and not en¬ 
tirely removed because of the expense. 
They do no damage and indeed many 
consider the large percentage of sulphate 
of magnesia found in the low grade a 
decided advantage. 

Though we do not use muriate of pot¬ 
ash on our trees, as we were looking at 
the acid formulas, we wondered what el¬ 
ement gave it the name “Muriate” and 
glanced down the list but did not find it. 
It was some weeks before we stumbled 
across the statement that “Sulphuric 
acid is often called ‘oil of vitriol’ and 
hydrochloric acid is generally known as 
‘muriatic.’ Muriate of potash then would 
really be chloride of potassium, (Kcl), 
but why called ‘muriate’ ?”. A good friend 
tells us the name has its origin from the 
Latin “muria” meaning salt, because the 
acid was commonly made from salt or 
brine. We find salt is chloride of sodium 
(NaCli). Its chlorine is made to unite 
with hydrogen to form hydrochloric or 
“muriatic” acid (HCli). No wonder we 
are cautioned against the use of muriate 
of potash when chlorine will hurt the 
proposed crop—for nearly one-half of 
it is chlorine! 

Sulphate of ammonia ( 2 NH 4 ,S 04 ) 
should be called sulphate of ammonium. 
There is one atom more hydrogen in 
ammonium (NH4) than in ammonia 
(NH3). By far the greater portion of 






134 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


this salt is a by-product of coke and gas 
works. Coal contains from i 1-5 per 
cent to 1 3-5 per cent nitrogen, or from 
24 lbs. to 32 lbs. per ton. Upon reck¬ 
oning the atomic weights of the formula 
2NH4,S04, we find 28 lbs. nitrogen 
makes 132 lbs. sulphate of ammonia. 
When we read that 20 lbs. to 22 lbs. of 
the sulphate is considered a fair yield per 
ton of coal, at either coke or gas works, 
and that comparatively few works try to 
save any at all, we think it would be well 
for some genius to perfect machinery for 
this purpose. 

Nitrate of soda, or properly, nitrate 
of sodium (NaNC>3) shares honors with 
sulphate of ammonia as a source of 
nitrogen for plant food. It is found in 
Chili and like the sulphate and muriate 
of potash from Germany is made by the 
great chemist, Nature, but is as truly 
formed as described as though the nitric 
acid and sodium were mixed with human 
hands. 

Guano is another valuable source of 
plant food, giving us some of all three 
essentials. There are many different de¬ 
posits but in our market we hear only 
of Peruvian guano from the islands off 
the rainless coast of Peru. It is formed 
by sea birds, seals, etc., during life and 
after death. The deposit is often over 
100 feet deep. The lower layers are so 
fossilized as to be “rock guano.” Above 
this have been found seal fur, and some¬ 
times petrified birds’ eggs are taken 
from a depth of from two to twenty-five 
feet. One kind of egg is filled with 
pearly crystals, but you may be sure no 
such curios find their way into a fertiliz¬ 
er sack. Being of such origin the con¬ 
stituents of guano vary greatly and each 


lot must be analyzed. It used to be high 
in ammonia content but now is often 
classed as a phosphatic fertilizer. It con¬ 
tains plant food in many different com¬ 
binations and is especially fitted to some 
lands; but like all good things it has its 
place, so make sure whether your land re¬ 
quires it, for it costs high. And, too, 
make sure you get it when you do buy it. 

I may as well confess right here that, 
thinking it as well for the consumer as 
the manufacturer to be “up-to-date,” I 
subscribe for a magazine published for 
the fertilizer trade. From it I learn 
some points that otherwise I might not 
come across. One thing I noticed was 
the way garbage, leather and wool waste, 
etc., are treated. From them can be and 
is made a very good substitute for gu¬ 
ano when put in a ready mixed fertilizer. 
It is good, and such things should be 
utilized, but it is not guano, and when 
we buy it we do not want to pay for 
guano! So let us be thankful for our 
fertilizer laws and LOOK AT THE 
TAG. 

As we study the sources of phosphoric 
acid, we remember the contents of Farm¬ 
ers’ Institute Bulletin No. 1, and decide 
to skip “dissolved bone,” “boneblack,” 
etc., and learn all we can of plain acid 
phosphate. We find the largest fields of 
the best phosphate here in our own fair 
Florida. From them is shipped 80 per 
cent, of the world’s product. It is sold 
under a guarantee of minimum 77 per 
cent phosphate of lime and maximum 3 
per cent oxides of iron and aluminum. 
This standard is far higher than the Eng¬ 
lish products, yet Griffiths says in his 
“Manures”: “It would be well if the 
prejudice against manures containing

mineral phosphates were stamped out, 
for even measured by a standard of pur¬ 
ity, minerals can hold their own against 
bone phosphates/’ Let us see exactly 
what acid phosphate is. The chemical 
formula of the pure tri-calcium phos¬ 
phate is Ca 3 P 208 . By recokoning atomic 
weights we find the proportion to be— 
120 lbs. calcium, 62 lbs. phosphorus, 
and 128 lbs. oxygen. Though there is 
a excess of lime, the impurities in the 
Florida rock are of no moment except 
the oxides of iron and aluminum. These 
are kept at an extremely low per cent by 
careful washing, after which the rock 
must be well dried. The process of mak¬ 
ing soluble phosphate is based on the 
stronger attraction for lime, sulphuric 
acid (H2SO4) has over phosphoric 
acid (H3PO4). The sulphuric acid 
used is very weak—only about half 
strength, for the water is needed to fa¬ 
cilitate the chemical process. While 
Voorhees ignores the fact that one 
thinks of the “parts” as being equal 
when told that a substance is divided into 
certain parts, he has made the change 
very clear to one’s mind by describing the 
rock as three parts lime to one part 
phosphoric acid. Just the right amount 
of sulphuric acid is added to combine 
with the other constituents and leave one 
part lime with the phosphoric acid, in 
which combination the phosphoric acid 
is easily dissolved. So were our acid 
phosphate pure and well made it would be 
a phosphate of lime mixed with sulphate 
of lime or gypsum. The making is mere¬ 
ly a matter of fine grinding and thorough 
mixing with the proper amount of acid. 
Things easily done in these days of first 
class machinery and skilled chemists. The 


acid, weak as it is, costs $6 per ton while 
the phosphate rock is worth less than $8, 
and it takes 63 lbs. of acid for each 100 
lbs. of pure tri-calcium phosphate. We 
can readily see that it behooves the manu¬ 
facturer to look well to the economical 
using of his acid. This same question of 
cost insures us of his being most exact¬ 
ing about impurities, for sulphuric acid 
will combine with the oxides of iron and 
aluminum before it will with the lime. 
Every 100 lbs. iron oxide will take 184 
lbs. acid and 100 lbs. alumina absorbs over 
285 lbs. of acid. The manufacturer can 
not afford impurities. Another safe¬ 
guard is the ease of detecting a poorly 
made or impure acid phosphate. If an 
excess of sulphuric acid is used it com¬ 
bines with so much lime as to leave free 
phosphoric acid. I underscore phosphor¬ 
ic, because so many think the “free acid” 
they hear about is sulphuric. The free 
phosphoric acid attracts moisture from 
the air and the fertilizer containing it is 
a damp luntpy mass. Too little sulphuric 
acid leaves some of the phosphate in the 
di-calcium, which is the same as the “re¬ 
verted” state. Too high a percentage of 
impurity makes a sticky product, high in 
insoluble phosphoric acid. We are well 
protected. It is cheaper for the manu¬ 
facturer to make a good article, and be¬ 
sides a poor acid phosphate proclaims it¬ 
self. So now we understand quite clear¬ 
ly, just what we are feeding our orange 
trees, and our next step is to learn just 
how this food reaches them and is as¬ 
similated.

FORMULA WORF 


By Mrs. N. M. G. Prange. 


Before presenting this work, I wish to 
assure those who are chafing at the 
thought of being bored by figures, that 
X shall give but two illustrations. 

All will please remember that these are 
fanciful formulas and are newt recom¬ 
mended for use. In my grove I use the 
standard formulas of trade, considering 
my conditions are in no way so peculiar 
that they cannot be met by some of the 
various formulas on the market. Know¬ 
ing these formulas are the result of years 
of patient study and trial to supply the 
needs of trees at all seasons and in all 
parts of the State, I feel it needless for 
me to go back to the beginning, trying 
perhaps what others before me have al¬ 
ready found lacking. Rather would I 
benefit by what they have learned and 
spend my time in a careful selection from 
what has proven to be of value. 

I use this formula work simply to as¬ 
certain the market value orf the plant 
food offered in a formula and trust oth¬ 
ers will do the same. 

As simple a formula as we can find can 
be made from sulphate of ammonia, dis¬ 
solved boneblack and high-grade sulphate 
of potash. We write its name “Fruit and 


Vine” at top of sheet, its percentages, 
3-6-12, at left hand corner and the cata¬ 
logue price at right of name. Our next 
step is to write the name of materials to 
be used in a column, leaving space at left 
for the number of pounds, and spaces at 
right for content in pounds of ammonia, 
phosphoric acid, and potash—for price 
per ton and for cost of quantity used, 
making in all seven different columns. 

Ammonia 3 per cent, gives 60 lbs. in 
a ton. In the State Chemist’s report we 
find sulphate of ammonia contains 25 per 
cent, ammonia and is worth $74 per 
ton. Since there are 25 lbs. Ammonia in 
one hundred pounds of the sulphate, it 
will take as many hundred pounds to sup¬ 
ply the 60 lbs., as 25 is contained in 60 
which is 2 2-5; equalling 240 lbs., or we 
can add two ciphers to the 60 and the 
answer will come in pounds—that is 25 
will go in 6,000, 240 times. We write 
“240 lbs.” before the item “Sulphate of 
Ammonia,” “60" in the column for am¬ 
monia content in pounds and $74.00 in 
column for prices per ton. The easiest 
way to reckon the cost of an irregular 
number of pounds is to multiply cost of 
one thousand pounds, or one-half ton, by 






FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


number of pounds taken and point off 
three figures—240 lbs. of sulphate of arm 
monia at $37.00 per thousand amounts to 
$8.80, which we write in the last column 
on the right. 

Dissolved boneblack contains 17 per 
cent, phosphoric acid and is worth $24 
pier ton. We need 120 lbs. available 
phosphoric acid to make 6 per cent. By 
annexing two ciphers to 120 and dividing 
by 17 we find it takes between 705 and 
706 lbs. boneblack. As we believe in 
good measure we take 706 lbs. which 
gives 120.02 A. P. A. and costs $8.47. 
We put all these amounts in their proper 
columns on the boneblack line. 

HHgh-grade sulphate of 'potash con¬ 
tains 48 per cent, potash and 1 costs $50.00 
per ton. We need 240 lbs. potash which 
necessitates buying 500 lbs. high-grade 
sulphate of potash. As 500 lbs. is just a 
quarter of a ton, we divide $50.00 by four 
and get $12.50 to complete our cost col- 
umjni. Oh no—not “complete" for to 
have our per cents right we must have a 
bulk of 2,000 lbs. and to get this we add 
554 lbs. land plaster at $12.00 per ton 
which amounts to $3.33. Then we allow 
$1.50 to pay for mixing and bagging and 
find the total cost to be $34.60. 

Do not object to that land plaster. You 
need it and it is worth the $12.00 per ton, 
but DO notice what you are buying and 
get your fertilizer for what it is worth. 

Probably the hardest formula to figure 
is one made with Peruvian Guano as a 
base. We will call this Peruvian manure 
and have our per cents, run 4-6-2-S; but 
in figuring the formula we count all the 
phosphoric acid together for one never 
tries to get a certain per cent, of insol¬ 
uble. Whatever insoluble matter there 


i ?.l 

is in any formula naturally accompanies 
the soluble matter or in treated goods is 
proof that no “free acid’’ exists. Besides 
the guano we will use nitrate of soda, 
sulphate of ammonia, ground bone and 
sulphate of potash. Guano varies in its 
percentages and is bought on its analysis 
so we find no standard price and content. 
For our purpose today, we will take fig¬ 
ures from a trade list that is out of date—* 
ammonia 31-2 per cent., phosphoric acid 
16 per cent, potash 2 per cent., price 
$32.00 per ton. We have been told that 
900 lbs. guano is a good foundation so we 
start with that:—900 lbs. Guano gives 
31.50 lbs. ammonia, 144 lbs. phosphoric 
acid and 18 lbs. potash and costs 
$14.40. We write all these amounts in 
their proper columns. 

As we are to get the rest of the phos¬ 
phoric acid from ground bone we make 
that the next item. Its content is am¬ 
monia 4 per cent and phosphoric acid 22 
per cent, and its price is $32.00 per ton. 
As we need 16 lbs. more phosphoric acid 
we take 73 lbs. ground bone which gives 
us 16.06 lbs. P. A. and also 2.92 lbs. am¬ 
monia and costs $1.17; all of which we 
enter in the proper places. We still lack 
45.58 lbs. ammonia. We will use 100 lbs. 
sulphate of ammonia to give 25 lbs. and 
to cost $3.70 ; and 122 lbs. nitrate of soda 
which contains 17 per cent, ammonia and 
costs $60.00 per ton; therefore from the 
nitrate we got 20.74 lbs. ammonia at a 
cost of $3.66. 

Our guano gave 18 lbs. potash and 
547 lbs, L. G. sulphate of potash analyz¬ 
ing 26 per cent. K2O, price $30.00 per 
ton supplies 142.22 lbs. potash and costs 
$8.20. Our ton is completed by the addi¬ 
tion of 258 lbs. land plaster for $1.55, 





138 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


and mixing and bagging $1.50 making 
a total of $34.18. If the catalogue price is 
much in excess of this we shall look for a 
lower priced dealer for we are buying 
standard materials and there is no effi¬ 
cacy in the name on the bag. Still we 
must remember a ton of this analysis of 
these materials 'costs the manufacturer 
some more than we have figured for he is 
obliged to give excess over guarantee to 


make sure the analysis will actually test 
as guaranteed and besides he has to deal 
in round numbers and cannot weigh out 
these odd amounts as we have figured. 
However, all manufacturers have to meet 
these conditions so our work is as fair to 
one as another and does very well for 
what we intend it. When completed it 
should look like this:

PRODUCTION OF PHOSPHATE ROCK IN FLORIDA. 


By E. H. Sellards, State Geologist. 


The first attempt to use Florida phos- 
Pha tes as a fertilizer, so far as the writer 
has been ahle to learn, was made by Dr. 
C. A. Simmons, of Hawthorne, Fla. Dr. 
Simmions is said to have recognized the 
phosphatic character of certain deposits 
lying near Hawthorne as early as 1879, 
and to have operated a mill for grinding 
pebble phosphate for direct application to 
soils as early as 1883 or 1884. In 1880 
Professor E. A. Smith collected samples 
from a quarry being operated for build¬ 
ing stone by Dr. Simmons. Analyses of 
these samples made at Washington under 


the direction of the Census Bureau 
showed this building- rock to contain 12 
to 13 per cent, phosphoric acid.* 

*IIawes, G. W.j Nat. Mus. Proc., 1883. Smitk, 
E- A., U. S. 10 th Census, Vol X., 1883 . 

The mill operated by Dr. Simmons was 
subsequently abandoned, and the produc¬ 
tion of phosphate on a commercial scale 
is commonly accepted as dating from the 
first shipment of river pebble from Peace 
River in 1888. 

The phosphates of Florida are known 
in the market as hard rock phosphate^ 
land pebble phosphate, and river pebble

phosphate. The plate rock phosphate 
now being mined near Anthony is includ¬ 
ed in this paper with the hard rock. The 
soft phosphate of which there is a con¬ 
siderable quantity intermixed with other 
phosphates is, under present methods of 
mining, unfortunately not recovered. 

The hard rock is a high-grade phos¬ 
phate. Most of it is sold under a guarantee 
that the entire shipment will average 77 
per cent, calcium phosphate (“bone phos¬ 
phate of lime;”) that iron and alumina 
combined will not exceed 3 per cent.; and 
that the moisture content will not exceed 
3 per cent. The hard rock which is now 
being mined occurs along the gulf side of 
the Florida peninsula from Suwannee 
and Columbia Counties on the north to 
Citrus and Ffernando Counties on the 
South. It lies in pockets of irregular oc¬ 
currence and extent and rests usually up¬ 
on limestone of Vicksburg (Lower Oli- 
gocene) age. 

The land pebble deposits are of Plio¬ 
cene age, and are less irregular in their 
manner of occurrence than are the hard 
rock phosphates. The chief land pebble 
region lies to the South of the hard rock 
region. The deposits being worked lie 
in Polk and Hillsboro Counties. Most of 
the land pebble is sold under a guarantee 
of 68 per cent calcium phosphate, iron 
and alumina not to exceed 3.5 per cent, 
to 4 per cent, and moisture not to exceed 
3 per cent. 

River pebble has been produced chiefly 
from Peace River and its. tributaries. The 
usual guarantee is 60 per cent, calcium 
phosphate; iron and alumina 3 per cent, 
and moisture 3 per cent. 

Phosphates varying in quality and in 
quantity, mostly low-grade and at pres¬ 


ent undeveloped are found at numerous 
other localities in Florida from the Apa¬ 
lachicola River on the West to Lee Coun¬ 
ty on the South. 

The production of river pebble, the 
first of the Florida phosphates mined, in¬ 
creased gradually from 1888 to 1893 
when the maximum production of 122,- 
820 tons was reached. From the year 
1893 to the present time there has been 
with some fluctuations a decrease in the 
output of river pebble, the total for 1908 
being 32,950 tons. 

The discovery of hard rock phosphate 
was made soon after the beginning of 
mining of river pebble. The first ship¬ 
ment of hard rock was probably made in 
1890. The output of hard rock phos¬ 
phate has gradually increased from the 
beginning of mining to the present time. 
The total hard rock mined during 1908 
was 768,011 long tons, which is a con¬ 
siderable increase over the production of 
any previous year. 

The first shipment of land pebble was 
probably made in 1891, although develop¬ 
ment began somewhat earlier. In 1892 
the production amounted to 21,915 tons. 
The rate of increase of land pebble was 
at first gradual, but in late years has 
been very rapid. In 1906 the output of 
land pebble for the first time exceeded 
that of hard rock. The amount of land 
pebble mined during 1908 is greatly in 
excess of that mined during any preced¬ 
ing year, falling little if any short of 1,- 
150,000 tons. 

The total amount of phosphate mined 
in Florida during 1908 was 1,950,961 
long tons. At the present rate of in¬ 
crease Florida, five years hence, may be 


140 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


expected to be producing 2,000,000 tons 
of phosphate annually. 

Practically all of the hard rock phos¬ 
phate produced in Florida is exported, 
the home consumption of this grade be¬ 
ing insignificant. During 1908 only 9,- 
900 tons of hard rock was consigned for 
use in the United States, 6,000 tons of 
which is reported as having been used in 
Florida. The river pebble, although not 
used in Florida, is used entirely within 
the United States, no part of the 1908 
output having been exported. Of the 
land pebble output for 1908, 150,377 
tons is reported as consigned for use in 
Florida. Of the total amount marketed 
the remainder was approximately equally 
divided between domestic and foreign 
ports. 

In the United States, Tennessee and 
South Carolina are, next after Florida, 
the largest producers of phosphates. Oth¬ 
er states which in 1907 produced a lim¬ 
ited amount of phosphate were: Ar- 
kasas, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. The 
deposits of the western part of the United 
States although as yet undeveloped are 
reported to be very extensive. The re¬ 
cent withdrawal from settlement by ex¬ 
ecutive order of large tracts of public 
lands will somewhat delay the exploita¬ 
tion and exhaustion of these western 
phosphates. The United States is now 
supplying almost two-thirds of the total 
phosphate produced in the world. Of the 
total for the United States, Florida pro¬ 
duces more than one-half, and of the to¬ 
tal for the world approximately one- 
third. 

LOSS OF PHOSPHATE IN MINING. 

That there is considerable loss of phos¬ 
phate in mining is well known. Practi¬ 


cally all deposits contain along with oth¬ 
er material more or less phosphate in a 
soft or pulverulent condition. Under pres¬ 
ent methods of mining, this “soft” phos¬ 
phate is necessarily lost in the process of 
washing, being carried to the dump along 
with the sand, clay and other ingredients 
of the matrix. The amount of phosphate 
thus discarded may be expected to vary 
with different deposits and under differ¬ 
ent conditions. After reaching the dump 
there is also more or less mechanical sep¬ 
aration, so that samples taken from one 
part of a dump may be found much rich¬ 
er in phosphate than samples from some 
other part of the same dump. Samples 

• 

taken by the writer somewhat at random 
from the dumps in the hard rock region 
gave the following results: Sample No. 1 
is from mine No. 5 of the Cummer Lum¬ 
ber Company, at Newberry; No. 2 is from 
the dump of the Camp Phosphate Com¬ 
pany, five miles southeast of Dunnellon.

Mr. Jumeau estimates that in this plant 
approximately four tons of material are 
handled in order to obtain one ton of 
high grade rock phosphate (77 per cent). 
In other words, of the material taken 
from the pit three-fourths carrying 
about 27 per cent calcium phosphate goes 
into the dump, while one-fourth carry¬ 
ing 77 per cent calcium phosphate is 
saved. It is thus seen that of the total 
phosphate taken from the pit in this in¬ 
stance fully one-half goes into the dump.

Chaux des Etats-Unis, Paris, 1906. 


From these analyses it is apparent that 
a very large amount of Florida phos¬ 
phate is being lost annually. Methods 
of utilizing these floats, or of reclaim¬ 
ing this waste if such can be devised are 
clearly of the greatest importance both 
to the phosphate producers and to the 
agricultural interests. Phosphoric acid 
is a soil essential, and any permanent 
system of agriculture must provide a 
phosphoric acid supply. With the ex¬ 
tension of agriculture necessary to sup¬ 
port increased population, together with 
and naturally rich soils there arises in¬ 
creased demands upon the phosphate sup¬ 
ply. At the present time this demand is 
coming chiefly from the older countries 
of Europe. The time is not far distant, 
however, when an equally strong demand 
will come from the exhausted soils of 
our own country. 








Peaches and Other Deciduous Fruits. 


By W. L. Floyd, M. S. 


The cultivation of peaches as a com¬ 
mercial crop seems to be on the decrease. 
One reason for this is the competition of 
cantaloupes which have become an im¬ 
portant crop in the South in recent years. 

There is an average crop on the trees 
this year, but the quality is not satisfac¬ 
tory because of more worms (curculio 
larvae), in them than usual. Our grow¬ 
ers need to be impressed more fully with 
the importance of gathering up and de¬ 
stroying all fruit that falls to the ground. 
Old settlers tell us that the peaches of the 
pioneer days were almost free from 
worms. To-day they are abundant in all 
orchards, and are increasing because the 
number of trees planted has increased the 
food supply. Prices this year for good 
early fruit promises to be quite satisfac¬ 
tory. 

The selection of the proper variety for 
planting needs re-emphasis. Representa¬ 
tives of outside nurseries are coming 
among us and by persuasive voice and at¬ 
tractive illustrations are selling kinds that 
do well in states near by, but to the north 
of us, but which will not do well in middle 
and South Florida. The derivatives of 
the Peento and Honey groups for com¬ 
mercial planting, and some varieties of 
the Spanish for the home garden are all 
we can expect to grow with success here, 
certain varieties of these are specially 


suited to certain localities. Our people 
need therefore to observe closely what 
succeeds about them then buy from a 
reliable nearby nursery what has proven 
good. 

The San Jose scale is being held in 
check in some of our largest orchards by 
the red-heated fungus (sphaerostilbe 
cocophila) and black fungus (myrian- 
gium duriaei). Our climatic conditions 
are peculiarly favorable to the growth of 
these fungi and when applied at proper 
time and in proper manner are quite ef¬ 
fective. 

The growing of the peach on Pasco 
plum roots in order to avoid root knot is 
reported a success in some places. Many 
of us are trying this and can report more 
fully as to its value later. 

Pears are of but little commercial im¬ 
portance, and their planting in the home 
garden is decreasing because of blight. No 
preventive has been found for this bac¬ 
terial disease, pruning off diseased branch¬ 
es back to the healthy wood is the best 
thing we know to do. Beware of the 
agent who offers a blight-proof tree, we 
doubt if such a thing exists. The Su- 
wanee pear is a new variety now being in¬ 
troduced by a prominent nursery of the 
state, which promises well, its advantages 
over the LeConte and Keiffer need yet 
to be proven.

Plums of the pure-bred Japanese va¬ 
rieties seem to be unsatisfactory in Flori¬ 
da, the cross-bred kinds especially the Ex¬ 
celsior and Terrell do well. Florida 
Queen and Howe are two new varieties 
that deserve a trial. 

Of apples there is little to be said. The 
Jennings does reasonably well in some 
places in the northern and eastern part of 
the state. The settler who has come here 
from an apple-growing region, and de¬ 
sires to grow a few apple trees for old as¬ 
sociation’s sake we think will find this 
the best to plant. We have heard of the 
successful growing of apples on a haw 
(crategus) stock but have not tried it nor 
seen it tried. 

Figs, grapes and Japan persimmons 
may properly come under the subject 
given. There are varieties of each that do 
fairly well in Florida and should be given 
a place in the home fruit garden, we rec¬ 
ommend consulting a near by, reliable 
nursery if the planting of these is being 
considered and there is ‘doubt as to what 
will do well. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Henderson—This is the subject in 
whcli I am most interested. One thing 
about which I think growers of these fruit 
should be warned against is putting too 
much confidence in the nursery drummers 
who come down from the north. They 
come down with their nice cuts of fruit 
and show what nice fruit they produce, 
but when they are planted down here nine 
times out of ten they don’t bear fruit at 
all. The pictures are seldom a true repre¬ 


sentation of the fruit produced. There 
is an agent around Gainesville to-day who 
is selling peach trees at $i apiece from 
the book, that they can buy from the 
Florida nurseries for ioc. You never can 
get a peach from them that will bear 
fruit here. I have tried all those northern 
peaches, and you can’t grow them at all 
here. You never will get more than a 
half a dozen peaches to the tree, if that 
many, from the northern grown trees. 
The Peento and Honey varieties are the 
ones we have to depend on in Florida for 
our crop. South of Ocala we have to de¬ 
pend almost entirely on the Peento va¬ 
rieties such as Hall’s Yellow, Jewell, Bid- 
well’s Early and a few others practically 
of the same type. 

Now, as I have said, these agents come 
in and sell peaches, pears and plums abso¬ 
lutely worthless here. 

As to the apple, that may be grown for 
ornamental purposes and for old associa¬ 
tion’s sake. I went to the woods and took 
up a couple of haw roots about the size 
of my thumb and put apple graft in them 
and then put them in the ground and the 
first year the graft grew six feet high. I 
never saw such a growth. The third year 
it had a pretty nice crop of apples on it. 
Then the San Jose scale got on it before 
I learned how to kill it with fungus, and 
it never was any good after that. I be¬ 
lieve we can make a success of growing 
a few apples for apple pies around the 
home in Florida, but I don’t think it will 
ever be grown for commercial purposes. 

I think the fig is a coming fruit. I 
don’t think we have given enough atten¬ 
tion to figs. I have a fig tree in my yard 
that I would not take $50 for. It pro¬ 
duced enough for my own table, we put 




144 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


up about four gallons of preserves and 
gave our neighbors all they wanted. There 
are several varieties of figs that are very 
hardy and they are very easily raised and 
anyone who has a back yard can have a 
fig tree that will give him all the figs he 
wants. 

The pear tree, I am pleased to note, is 
recovering from the blight very rapidly 
in all sections of the country. The pear 
will not stand much cultivation and too 
much ammonia. In some orchards, the 
blight has almost disappeared. They 
need phosphoric acid and potash. I be¬ 
lieve the blight is caused by improper 
treatment and fertilizing with too highly 
ammoniated manures. 

I do not think the deciduous fruits are 
given the attention in this society that 
they should have. 

As to the decline of the peach business 
in Florida, possibly the San Jose scale 
has done as much to discourage it as any 
other one thing. It has gone all over the 
state. However, it is very easily over¬ 
come now by the use of red-headed and 
the black fungi. The curculio from the 
north is advancing very rapidly down the 
state. It is down perhaps to Ocala. Down 


about Lakeland and that country the 
worms have not appeared. It seems to 
be our most dangerous enemy to the 
peach. They have had it in Georgia since 
I was old enough to know much about 
worms. They have been trying to learn 
ways to fight it for the last twenty-five 
years. I know it will destroy the fruit, 
but don’t know how to destroy it. To the 
peach, it is worse than the whitefly to 
the orange. You can’t touch him with 
the spray, because when the spray hits 
him he curls up and drops off on the 
ground. You can’t hardly see him or find 
him. You simply have to burn him up 
with fire to get rid of him at all. 

Another thing I notice is that when 
peaches are stung by the curculio it does 
not necessarily ruin every peach, because 
hundreds of them that are stung make 
good peaches. Of course, you can see 
where they were stung, because a little 
bit of white wax comes out where it is 
stung. As I said before, I think we ougnt 
to give some attention to other things be¬ 
sides oranges. We spend two or three 
days talking about oranges, and then put 
off the other fruits with an hour or two. 
It isn’t hardly fair to those of us who are 
interested in other things. 


Ornamentals. 


THE PRINCES OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM IN OUR FLORI¬ 
DA GARDENS. 


By H. Nehrling. 


I. 

Palms! The very word creates vi¬ 
sions of beauty and magnificence in 
our minds. Groups of palms! Ave¬ 
nues of palms! Forests of palms along 
our streams and bordering our clear 
water lakes! Thickets of palms in our 
flat woods! Groves of Cocoanut Palms 
on the East Coast! Royal Palms on 
the borders of the Everglades! Florida 
is the land of palms. They are in¬ 
separably connected with this land of 
flowers, clear water lakes, invigorating 
breezes and bright sunshine. The 
word “palm” stands for all that is noble 
and grand in the plant world. Linnaeus 
called them the “princes of the plant- 
world.” And, indeed, they are a royal 
family, glorying in isolation, proudly 
waving their graceful foliage in the 
breezes of a tropical landscape. Not 
all the members of the tribe, however, 
show this nobility and grandeur. As 
in every-day life, they have—like 
many noble families—low connections 
and poor relations. It is only neces¬ 
sary to allude to our proud and elegant 


Cabbage Palmetto on one side and its 
congener, the lowly Saw Palmetto, on 
the other. Both reveal a very strong 
and unmistakable family likeness. But 
how very different are both! 

Systematic botanists tell us that in 
their external structure, as well as in 
their internal organization, palms ap¬ 
proach nearest the grasses—plants 
which have been termed by Linnaeus 
the “plebejans” of the order. Super¬ 
ficially viewed, this appears a rather 
distant relationship. In making com¬ 
parisons, however, we must not select 
the Cabbage Palmetto and the Bermu¬ 
da grass for examples, but, replacing 
the latter by the giant bamboo, we im¬ 
mediately see the truth of the above 
statement. And, indeed, palms and 
bamboos are the greatest attractions 
of our Florida gardens. Grown side 
by side, they create unique tropical 
effects, charming pictures of beauty 
and poetry not obtainable by other 
plants. 

The chief feature of the palms con¬ 
sists in the cylindrical trunk, crowned 
by a mass of either plume-like or fan- 


io 





146 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


shaped leaves. Our native palmettos 
belong to the last group, while the 
Date Palm, the Royal Palm and the 
Cocoanut Palm have pinnate or plume¬ 
like leaves. The different species vary 
in height from a few feet to a hundred 
and more. Some are stemless, but the 
great majority have slender tall trunks. 
In some species the diameter of the 
stem, which does not vary very much 
in its whole le ngth, is thick and mas¬ 
sive, in others, slender and polished, 
while some of the smaller species have 
trunks not thicker than a walking 
stick or a pen holder. Most of the 
palms have a single stem, not produc¬ 
ing any side shoots at all ; others send 
up quite a number of stems from one 
root-stock. The trunks are sometimes 
smooth or ringed, but more frequently 
they are covered with the old bases of 
the fallen leaves and sometimes they 
are armed with formidable spines. In 
some cases the leaves fall to the ground 
as they decay, leaving a clean scar, in 
most cases, however, they are persis¬ 
tent, rotting slowly away and leaving 
a mass of fibrous stumps attached to 
the upper part of the stem. This rot¬ 
ting mass next to the trunk forms an 
excellent material, a kind of a peaty 
soi 1 , for ferns, orchids, many tillandsias 
and arads, which form an exceedingly 
decorative feature on what would oth¬ 
erwise be an unsightly object. Thus 
nature gives us a hint how to decorate 
the bare stems of our garden palms. 
The sheathing margins of the leaves 
often break up into a fibrous mass, 
sofetimes resembling coarse cloth and 
sometimes bast or even horse hair. 
The climbing palms are very remark¬ 


able. These are the Ratang Palms, 
which supply the rattan from which 
the seats, etc., of our cane chairs are 
made. Naturally very prickly, these 
stems, by means of reflexed hooks, 
with which the ribs of the leaves are 
provided, climb high up into the lof¬ 
tiest forest trees. All the species of 
the genus Calamus of the Old World 
and of the genus Desmoncus of tropi¬ 
cal America are climbing palms. The 
stems of these “vary in size from the 
thickness of a quill to that of a wrist, 
and where abundant they render the 
forest almost impassable. They lie 
about the ground coiled and twisted 
and looped in the most fantastic man¬ 
ner. They hang in frestoons from 
trees and branches, they rise suddenly 
through mid air up to the top of the 
forest, or coil loosely over shrubs and 
thickets like endless serpents. They 
must attain an immense age, and ap¬ 
parently have an unlimited power of 
growth, for some are said to have been 
found which were 600 or even 1,000 
feet long, and, if so, probably are the 
longest of all vegetable growths.” 
(Wallace on “Tropical Nature.”) 

The leaves of many palms are of im¬ 
mense size even under cultivation. A 
specimen of the Cohune (Attalea Co- 
hune) in Horticultural Hall, Fair- 
mount Park, Philadelphia, not yet hav¬ 
ing formed a trunk, has pinnate leaves 
30 feet long. Those of Manicaria sac- 
cifera of Para are 30 feet long and five 
feet wide. They are not plume-like, 
but entire and very rigid. Some of the 
pinnate leaved palms are much larger, 
those of Raphia taedigera and Maximih 
iana regia being both sometimes more

147 


than 50 feet long. The fan-shaped 
leaves of the West 1 , Indian Cabbage 
Palmetto (Sabal umbraculifera) are 
eight to ten feet in diameter. 

I11 tropical countries the uses of the 
palms are so exceedingly important 
and so varied that it would fill volumes 
to go into detail. Suffice it to say that 
they furnish everything to the inhabi¬ 
tants of the tropics: food, cloth, houses 
and ornaments. We all know some¬ 
thing of the uses of the Cocoanut Palm 
and the Date Palm, but these are only 
two species while there are hundreds 
of other useful kinds. Sugar of the 
best quality is made of the sap of the 
Sugar Palm (Arenga saccharifera) and 
the Indian Date Palm (Phoenix syl- 
vestris), the latter a most beautiful 
palm of our gardens. “The sap which 
pours out of the cut flower-stalk of sev¬ 
eral species of palms,” says Alfred R. 
Wallace in Tropical Nature, “when 
slightly fermented, forms palm wine 
or toddy, a very agreeable drink, and 
when mixed with various herbs or 
roots check fermentation, a fair imita¬ 
tion of beer is produced. Other arti¬ 
cles of food are cooking oil from the 
Cocoanut and Baccaba Palm, salt from 
the fruit of a South American Palm 
(Leopoldina major), while the terminal 
bud or 'cabbage' of many species is an 
excellent, nutritious vegetable, so that 
palms may be said to supply bread, oil, 
sugar, salt, fruit and vegetables. Oils 
are made from several distinct species, 
especially the celebrated Oil Palm of 
West Africa, while wax is secured 
from the leaves of some South Ameri¬ 
can species (Copernicia cerifera, etc.). 
The resin called 'dragon’s blood’ is the 


product of one of the rattan palms. 
The fruit of the Areca Palm (Areca 
Catechu) is the 'betel nut’ so universal¬ 
ly chewed by the Malays as a gentle 
stimulant and is their substitute for 
the opium of the Chinese, the tobacco 
of the European and the cocoanut leaf 
of South America.” 

The so-called vegetable ivory is sup¬ 
plied by a beautiful plume-leaved palm 
(Phytelephas macrocarpa) of South 
America. 

Many of the most beautiful and most 
impressive palms are at present culti¬ 
vated in the palm houses of our large 
cities. The "Palmengarten” in Frank- 
fort-on-the-Main has a world-wide 
fame, not only as a scientific institu¬ 
tion, but also as a resort of pleasure 
and recreation. The largest scientific 
collection is found at Herrenhausen, 
near Hanover, over which the cele¬ 
brated palm specialist. Hermann 
Wendland, presided for half a century. 
In our own land the rare collection 
of magnificent palms in Horticultural 
Flail, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, is 
undoubtedly the finest in the country. 
This palm house is almost seventy- 
five feet high and many specimens 
reach quite the top of the glass roof. 
When I first saw the tall and majestic 
specimens of Fivistonia sinensis, Cocos 
plumosa, Ceroxylon andicola, Phoenix 
Canariensis, Seaforthia elegans, Atta- 
lea Colnine and many others in com¬ 
pany of the Norfolk Island pine (Arau¬ 
caria excelsa) and the Bunya-Bunya 
(Araucaria Bidwilli), large clumps of 
bamboos, clusters of screw pines (Pan- 
danus), masses of bananas, huge tree 
ferns, immense specimens of the glossy

Cycas circinalis, I had the impression 
of being in a fairyland. The trunks of 
most of these palms were densely cov¬ 
ered with conspicuous tropical creep¬ 
ers, particularly philodendrons, an- 
thuriums, Monstera deliciosa, Pothos 
aurea and other arads. Underneath 
them were fine masses of the pretty 
flowering banana (Musa coccinea), al¬ 
most always in bloom and extremely 
showy; of garland flowers (Hedyc.hium 
Gardnerianum), of Pandanus Veitchii 
and P. caricosus, thickets of Bamboo 
Palms (Rliapis flabelliformis and Rh. 
humilis), clumps of fancy-leaved Cala- 
diums, spider lilies (Hymenocallis) and 
crinums, exquisite specimens of Ma- 
ranta zebrina, Phyllotaenium Lindeni, 
various Alocasias and of ferns and sel- 
aginellas. How often have I feasted 
my eyes on these tropical landscape 
idyls! How charmingly was Nature in 
her poetic beauty copied here by the 
artistic hand of the landscape 
gardener! There is no doubt that in 
our Florida gardens similar effects can 
be obtained by judicious planting—in¬ 
deed they have been obtained in many 
of our gardens. We have a large 
assemblage of highly colored and 
beautiful leaved plants and tropi¬ 
cal flowers at our command which 
form charming adjuncts to our garden 
palms, an advantage not found in any 
other part of our country, and we 
should make extensive use of them. 

Though mainly inhabitants of the 
equatorial regions of both hemis¬ 
pheres, there are quite a number of 
palms growing in high altitudes or 
overstepping their northern or south¬ 
ern limit. About 1,200 different spe¬ 


cies are known to science, their great¬ 
est abundance having been recorded 
by naturalists to be in the Amazon val¬ 
ley and adjacent regions. About 14 
species are indigenous to Florida. One 
is found in California and there are sev¬ 
eral species occurring as far north as 
South Carolina. Many of the strictly 
tropical palms thrive splendidly in 
South Florida, while many of the sub¬ 
tropical species find a congenial home 
all along the gulf coast. 

While I have seen grand specimens 
of the Canary Island Date Palm and 
the Cabbage Palmetto in New Orleans, 
it can be safely said that extensive col¬ 
lections can only be formed in Florida 
and California. These two states, 
however, have a very different climate. 
Florida is rather humid, but the soil is 
usually light and not rich, while Cali¬ 
fornia has a dry climate and a very 
heavy, rich soil. Florida has, during 
the summer, heavy rains, while in Cal¬ 
ifornia no rain falls during this season. 
For this reason it is evident that many 
palms, growing well in Florida, cannot 
be grown successfully in California and 
vice versa. Howeas (Kentias) and 
Arecas do very well in Southern Cali¬ 
fornia, but they are no success in Flor¬ 
ida, even under the most favorable 
conditions. On the other hand, such 
glorious palms as the Cocoanut, the 
different Royal Palms, Acrocomia To- 
tai and numerous other species do not 
seem to thrive at all in California. The 
richest collections of palms in the lat¬ 
ter state are found in Santa Barbara, 
Pasadena and Los Angeles. 

In our own state the late Mr. Ed¬ 
mund H. Hart, of Federal Point, has 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


149 


brought together a most beautiful col¬ 
lection of species. Mr. Theo. L. Mead, 
of Lake Charm, has experimented for 
years with a large number of palms, 
and Mr. George Abbott, of Orlando, 
has a very representative collection. 
Mr. J. F. Dommerich at Maitland has 
also a fine collection. In Orlando, the 
floral city of our State, there are num¬ 
erous large specimens in many gar¬ 
dens, notably in Mr. Overstreet's and 
Fuller’s, the latter planted by the late 
Mr. Geo. B. Breen, Bishopstead, is also 
replete with palms and bamboos. Mr. 
E. N. Reasoner, the introducer of hun¬ 
dreds of beautiful tropical plants adapt¬ 
ed to our soil and climate, has dissem¬ 
inated many fine and rare palms. 
There is a wealth of grand specimens, 
tall and majestic, in the grounds of the 
Royal Palm Nurseries. Many of them 
were planted by the late P. W. Rea¬ 
soner more than thirty years ago. 
Florida is a large state, touching al¬ 
most the tropics. Many species not 
hardy enough in the northern and cen¬ 
tral parts of the state can undoubted¬ 
ly be grown successfully in the ex¬ 
treme south—in places where the man¬ 
go, the sapodilla and avocado ripen 
their fruits. I am of the opinion that 
as yet we only have touched the fringe 
of what we may hope to achieve in the 
cultivation of tropical palms. What 
a magnificent sight do the groves of 
Cocoanut palms present at Palm Beach 
and elsewhere on the East Coast, 
where the glowing blossoms of the 
royal poinciana light up the landscape 
like fiery flames, where the leaves of 
the traveller’s tree attain gigantic pro¬ 
portions and where thickets of crotons 


abound in every good garden! The 
Royal Palms of Biscayne Bay and of 
Fort Myers are well known to all plant 
lovers who visited these places. Sea- 
forthia elegfans thrives splendidly in 
Bradentown. Elais Guineensis, the 
Oil Palm, is a feature in Mr. Chas. T. 
Simpson’s garden at Little River near 
Biscayne Bay. Why should not the 
magnificent Cohune, the various As- 
trocaryums and Raphias, Euterpes, 
Caryotas, Arengas and others thrive 
equally well in South Florida? Coper- 
nica cerifera, the Wax Palm of Para¬ 
guay and its near allies thrive splen¬ 
didly in Southern Italy, and I am sure 
these fine palms will do equally well in 
Central and South Florida. Mr. A. 
Fiehe under the late H. P. Plant—a 
real benefactor of Florida—landscape 
gardener of the Plant Railroad Sys¬ 
tem, set out years ago an avenue of 
the beautiful Cocos plumosa in front of 
the Tampa Bay Hotel. They are to¬ 
day about 50 feet high and bear fruits 
heavily. I have scarcely ever seen a 
more impressive picture. Then there 
are in the same grounds avenues of 
Cabbage Palmettos and fine bearing 
specimens of the Chinese Fan Palm 
(Livistonia sinensis). Cocos plumosa 
and C. flexuosa are successfully grown 
on Mr. Dommerich’s place, “Hiawa¬ 
tha,” at Maitland. Mr. E. H. Hart at 
Federal Point has successfully grown 
the beautiful! Diplothemium jCaudes- 
cens and D. campestre of Southern 
Brazil, the very beautiful Livistonia 
Hoogendorpii of Java, Livistonia oli- 
vaeformis (Corypha Gebanga) and the 
splendid Livistonia rotundifolia, also of 
Java, for many years. He wrote me 



150 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


that all these palms, Livistonia sinen¬ 
sis and L. australis included, need 
shade and very rich soil in order to 
grow them successfully. Many of the 
pigmies of the family, particularly the 
species of the genus Chamaedorea, 
Geonoma and others thrive well in 
sheds from which frost can be exclud¬ 
ed, and on verandas. 

I cannot refrain from mentioning in 
this connection, as a matter of fact, 
that the two Fan Palms from Lower 
California, Washingtonia robusta and 
W. Sonorae, thrive better in our state 
than they do in California. And I also 
want to impress on the mind of my 
reader that these two palms are the 
coming avenue palms par excellence 
for Florida, thriving as they do equal¬ 
ly well in Jacksonville and in Miami. 
Majestic specimens of these palms are 
met with all over the state, especially 
in St. Augustine in the grounds of the 
Ponce de Leon, etc., in Federal Point, 
Lake Charm and elsewhere. 

Florida, the home of so many wild 
species, should everywhere abound in 
groups and avenues of palms. They 
imbue dignity, beauty and an inde¬ 
scribable charm to every place where 
they have been rightly used. The Cab¬ 
bage Palmetto should always be plant¬ 
ed in groups or avenues while the mas¬ 
sive Canary Island Date or the Indian 
Date look very beautiful as isolated 
specimens on the lawn, the former hav¬ 
ing a spread of 30 feet in diameter. A 
group of the various species of hardy 
Cocos is very charming, particularly 
when magnolias, araucarias, cupressus 
torulosa and other evergreens form the 
background. 


Small palms are very cheap. Set 
out in rich soil and carefully attended 
to, they soon attain their unique beau¬ 
ty. They increase from year to year 
in beauty and in value. With a com¬ 
paratively small outlay the most ex¬ 
quisite landscape pictures can be creat¬ 
ed, the like not to be seen in any other 
part of our country. How barren and 
desolate do our small towns and cities 
generally look. It has always been a 
pleasure to me to return to Orlando 
with its beautiful garden homes. This 
state is pre-eminently the home of 
countless winter sojourners and pleas¬ 
ure seekers, not only from the north 
but even from Europe, people who are 
not only equipped with a full pocket- 
book, but also with a broad mind, an 
excellent education and a good taste. 
They will not stay in desolate places. 
In order to attract them many things 
are essential, but I think nothing is 
more imporant than to beautify our 
cities and rural homes with tropical 
vegetation. Every community in 
Florida, every city and town should 
not only embellish their homes but 
also should create attractive public 
places. Large and well laid out parks 
are a necessity ol every larger town, 
not only in an educational sense for 
the residents but primarily to attract 
the winter visitor. Such men like the 
late H. B. Plant, and in our days, Mr. 
H. M. Flagler, were well aware of 
this fact. There are thousands upon 
thousands every winter pouring to 
the East Coast, to St. Augustine, Palm 
Beach and Miami, because these places 
have a world-wide fame as points of 
beauty. And this beauty mainly con-

sists in the art of the landscape gard¬ 
ener. Particularly the palms, so lav¬ 
ishly planted around the great hotels, 
in connection with other tropical 
plants, are the foundation of this 
fame. Earthly paradises have been 
made out of sandy tracts and mosquito 
infected marshes. If Mr. Flagler had 
done nothing else in his life but to cre¬ 
ate these enchanting gardens, he would 
deserve an everlasting monument. 

The palm is a formal tree. No other 
plant can be used so advantageously 
in connection with classic architecture. 
While the Giant Bamboo, formal, too, 
in outline, is more a plant to hide un¬ 
sightly places and to overshadow the 
cabin of the simple dweller, the proud 
and majestic palm always heightens 
the effect of refined and beautiful arch¬ 
itecture. But palms never must be 
grown to the exclusion of other fine 
evergreens. Avenue of palms, groups 
of palms and single specimens look 
most beautiful when bamboos, mag¬ 
nolias, royal poincianas, rubber trees 
or banyans form the background. Es¬ 
pecially the bamboos are excellent 
companion plants of all palms. 

I grow over 70 different palms in my 
garden, the most tender and the shade- 
loving species under a lath shelter. 
Though this number may perhaps be 
reduced considerably from a strictly 
botanical standpoint, they are all dif¬ 
ferent horticulturally. 

It may be well to state here that 
hardiness is frequently a question of 
size, the larger ones passing a cold 
spell unharmed, while the small ones 
perish if not protected. Many palms 
also need protection from sun more 


than from frost. This particularly holds 
true in the case of Livistonia sinensis 
and L. australis, two very beautiful 
and imposing Fan Palms. The dwarf 
Bamboo Palms (Rhapis flabelliformis 
and Rh. humilis) and all the Chamae- 
doreas and Geonomas will only grow 
in the shade. Most all species of Co¬ 
cos, Phoenix, Sabal, Acrocomia, Ore- 
odoxa, Caryota, etc., revel in bright 
sunshine. 

The preparation of the soil preced¬ 
ing the planting is the most important 
point in the cultivation of palms every¬ 
where, but particularly in Florida 
where the sandy soil is very deficient 
in plant food. Undoubtedly, many 
palms will grow in rather poorly pre¬ 
pared soil, but they have to keep up a 
constant struggle for existence, grow¬ 
ing either very slowly or being at a 
standstill for an indefinite period. Such 
specimens never will reveal their beau¬ 
ty and are always a pitiful sight. 

In setting out palms it must be our 
aim to grow them into fine specimens 
as rapidly as possible. Only as 
such do they reveal all their elegance 
and grace, their refined and unique 
beauty. For all large growing palms,, 
such as Sabals, Phoenix, Washingto- 
nias, Acrocomias, Fivistonias, Cocos,, 
etc., it is necessary to dig' large holes 
—six feet deep and six feet in diameter 
is not too much. These holes should 
be filled two-thirds with rotten wood, 
pine needles, leaves, bones and stable 
manure, preferably cow dung. Bones 
and old tin cans should be placed at 
the bottom. The entire mass must 
be well trodden down and left to the 
elements, rain and sunshine for at least 



152

six or eight months. The upper third 
should be filled in when the planting 
is done. It should consist of a mixture 
of well rotted stable manure and sur¬ 
face soil. If there is no stable manure 
at hand, cotton seed meal may be used 
advantageously, but this must be ap¬ 
plied several months before planting as 
it would be injurious in a fresh state. 
It must be well mixed with the soil, 
but in every case planting must be de¬ 
ferred until this material has become 
well decomposed. After the hole has 
been brought into a good condition, 
plant your palm in the center, spread 
out the roots with the hand, fill in the 
-soil and tread it down with your feet; 
then apply water to settle the soil. A 
mulch of leaves, pine needles, or grass is 
the next procedure. Place it thickly 
around the plant. Later, when the roots 
have taken hold of the soil and a vigor- 
ous growth has followed, a mulch of 
stable manure is necessary. When this 
rots it should be dug in around the plant. 
Never burn old rotten wood, leaves or 
weeds, but dig them in around your 
plants. In order to keep up a vigorous 
and rapid growth and to obtain grand 
and imposing specimens, fertilizer and 
water are the most important factors. 
The far-famed specimens of beautiful 
palms in the Riviera every spring receive 
a one-horse cart of stable manure each 
In our soil two applications of fertilizer 
should be given—one in May or June, 
consisting of a thick mulch of stable man¬ 
ure or cotton-seed meal. In October 
this should be dug in and an application 
of commercial fertilizer, rich in potash 
and phosphoric acid, should follow. This 
will harden the plants sufficiently to with¬ 


stand our occasional cold spells. When 
setting out small specimens from pots 
just received from the nursery it is not 
necessary to prepare large holes. In 
this case it will suffice to dig holes 3 feet 
deep and 3 feet in diameter. 

In dry weather all newly planted palms 
must be well watered. Applications of 
manure water now and then also prove 
exceedingly beneficial. 

Our open air palms are rarely troubled 
with insects. Some time scale insects 
infests the leaves, but they are easily 
eradicated by spraying with soap water 
to which some kerosene oil has been ad¬ 
ded—about a cup of kerosene to a large 
bucket of water. The underside of the 
leaves particularly must be sprayed. 

Small palms are easily protected from 
frost, but banking with soil is of little 
use if we fail to protect the heart. This 
is best done by placing evergreen boughs 
over the center of the plant, followed by 
old bags, Spanish moss, paper and straw 
or hay. This material must be removed 
as soon as the cold wave has passed. I 
usually place over the center of my large 
tender palms bunches of excelsior and 
dry pine needles, followed by green pine 
branches and Spanish moss. Of late 
years I have never protected the tender 
Phoenix species or Da'e Palms, and they 
have not suffered in the lea r \ 

II. 

The following four genera ol rather 
tall-growing and hardy palms are the 
most important for our Florida gardens. 

Cocos, or Cococmut Palms. 

Phoenix, or Date Palms. 

Sabal, or Cabbage Palmettos.

W ashing tonia, or California Fan 
Palms. 

Among the palms suitable to our soil 
and climate, I must assign the first place 
to the genus Cocos. This consists of 
the true cocoanut; of the tender soft- 
leaved section, including the beautiful 
Cocos plumosa, C. flexuosa and C. Ro- 
manzoffiana; of the dwarf and elegant 
C. Weddelliana and, most important of 
all, the species of the C. australis group. 
They are not only the quickest growers 
and the most ornamental and elegant 
palms, but many of them grow faster 
and better in our high pine land than any 
other palm, being particularly adapted to 
poor and rather dry soils. On my 
place in the high, dry pine region, 
self sown seedlings come up everywhere 
without any care. This genus is pre¬ 
eminently American, being found in 
many species in Brazil and extending 
southward to Argentina. Mostly the 
species are gregarious, like our Cabbage 
Palmetto, growing together in large 
groups or groves. 

Cocos nucifera , Linn., the true Cocoa- 
nut Palm, is at present a cosmopolitan, 
being found in all tropical coast regions 
of the world, never occuring far inland. 
Very likely, an inhabitant of the Amer¬ 
ican continents in remote times, it has 
found since times immemorial a home in 
all warm parts of the world, the waves 
of the ocean having acted as a mean? of 
distribution. In Florida it has evident¬ 
ly been introduced from the West Indies. 
It is a common and most conspicuous 
palm all along the east coast from Palm 
Beach—this far-famed winter resort 
takes its name from the groves of Cocoa- 
nut Palms along its beach—southward. 


On the west coast it grows as far north 
as Punta Gorda. The large groves of 
these palms all along the ocean form 
very impressive and lasting pictures in 
the mind of the lover of the beautiful. 
They thrive like native plants, fruiting 
heavily and being rarely injured by frost. 
In one of his interesting letters, Prof. C. 
T. Simpson of Little River writes me as 
follows: “I wish you could sit here by 
me, in this pavilion eighty feet out in the 
bay, on the end of the wharf and enjoy 
the breeze and the lovely view over and 
down Biscayne Bay, with a peep out 
through the keys in the open Atlantic. 
Down the shore along Lemon City the 
growth is largely tall mangroves where 
they have not been cut away, and, where 
they have, everybody has planted Cocoa- 
nut Palms until they look like a forest 
along the beach, from twenty to fifty 
feet high. Away down at the lower end 
of Lemon City a few scattered, tall ones 
cut the sky-line with beautiful effect and 
they always look better that way than in 
groves or rows. 

The Cocoanut generally bears all the 
time here and I have seen trees with a 
two-horse wagon load of nuts on at one 
time, but I have seen Cocoanut trees 
twenty-five feet high so scorched by the 
freeze that for months I thought they 
were dead.” 

Stoddard, in his delightful book “South 
Sea Idyls,” calls the Cocoanut palms “the 
exclamation points in the poetry of the 
tropical landscape.” 

In Polynesia this is the most valuable 
of all plants, supplying oil, clothing, all 
kinds of important utensils, food, drink 
in the shape of Cocoanut milk, and an ex¬ 
cellent palm wine is made from the sap

by the Singhalese. Nowhere it thrives 
far inland and rarely specimens are seen 
in our large conservatories. The aid of 
the sea water, crushed shells in the soil 
and the sea weeds acting as a fertilizer 
are needed to grow them successfully. 
The Singhalese have a saying that the 
“Cocoanut trees do not thrive unless you 
walk and talk amongst them,” which in¬ 
dicates that they must receive loving care 
in order to supply the wants of the peo¬ 
ple. 

Everywhere along our coast this mag- 
nificant palm should find a place in the 
gardens and parks and should be largely 
planted. 

Cocos Weddelliana Wendl is one of the 
most popular palms for home decora¬ 
tion in all civilized countries, its easy 
growth, small size, elegance and beauty 
adapt it particularly for this purpose. It 
is a native of Braizl where it rarely grows 
taller than 6 or 7 feet. The delicate, 
glossy, deep, green, feathery leaves form 
a perfect circle of elegance. It is a shade 
and moisture-loving plant, growing fine¬ 
ly in plant sheds. In such plant sheds, 
which should be added to every good gar¬ 
den in Florida, it can be easily protected 
from sun and cold. My specimens have 
not been injured by a temperature of 26 
degrees Fahrenheit, but they were cover¬ 
ed with pine needles and green pine 
branches. In Orlando a specimen has 
borne good crops of seeds for several 
years. This shed, in which asparagus 
plumosus is grown for the market, is 
heated by stoves during very cold weath¬ 
er. It also makes a fine veranda plant. 

Cocos plumosa, Hook , is one of the 
most elegant and beautiful of all palms, 
and it has the additional good quality of 


being a very fast grower. Its native 
home is central Brazil, where it usually 
grows in rich, moist soil. This is one of 
the most important palms for outdoor 
culture, being hardy as far north as Or¬ 
lando and Lake Charm. Mr. Mead, the 
introducer of many a garden jewel, was 
the first who grew this and other spe¬ 
cies of the genus. When the great freeze 
of 1895 occurred, his tall and imposing 
specimen was killed outright. There are 
fine young specimens at Mr. Dommer- 
ich's place, “Hiawatha,” at Maitland. In 
the idyllic grounds of the Tampa Bay 
Hotel I feasted my eyes on a long avenue 
of these palms which are about 50 feet 
high. They have magnificent crowns of 
leaves, and ripen annually large bunches 
of fruit. The tallest and most impres¬ 
sive specimens of this palm I saw in the 
grounds of Reasoner Bros, at Oneco, Fla. 
Lofty and graceful, their magnificent 
crowns of feathery leaves, touched by the 
soft breezes, appeared to be pictured from 
dreamland. And near them grew large 
specimens of Acrocomia Totai, tall and 
massive Phoenix Canariensis, P. sylves- 
tris, Ph. reclinata, and nearby the finest 
and densest coniferous tree I ever saw, 
Araucaria Bidwilli. Gigantic specimens 
of feathery bamboos stood in the back¬ 
ground, swaying their leaf-masses in the 
breezes. In and near Orlando this palm 
needs, during the first few years, some 
protection from very cold weather. It 
should be largely planted where there is 
a chance that it may prove hardy, because 
it is one of our noblest palms and has a 
beauty and elegance entirely its own. 

Cocos flexuosa, Mart , is another of the 
of the feathery soft-leaved species from 
Brazil and in its young state is scarcely

distinguishable from the former., In older 
specimens the leaflets along the midrib 
stand more closely together and the entire 
aspect, though not easy to describe, is 
somewhat different. It is also a much 
hardier plant, a slower grower and not so 
tall. I have a specimen 8 or 9 years old 
that has been outgrown by 3 year old 
plants of Cocos plumosa. 

Cocos Romans of liana, Chamisso., an 
exquisite palm closely related to the two 
former. It is hardier than both, more 
massive and very ornamental. The 
trunks attain a height of 30 to 40 feet 
and the leaves are 15 to 20 feet long. It 
is a common palm in Southern Brazil 
near the sea and is largely planted in the 
parks and streets of Buenos Ayres and 
other places of Argentine, where magni¬ 
ficent avenues of it form the delight of 
travellers. Unfortunately, it has not yet 
gained a foothold in our gardens, young 
specimens only being known and these 
look very much like those of the two pre¬ 
ceding species. There is no doubt that 
it will be hardy in Central and South 
Florida. My young specimens have not 
suffered from frost during the past few 
winters. Seed can easily be imported 
from Buenos Ayres. 

Cocos coronata, Mart., another Brazil¬ 
ian species which has been disseminated 
by Reasoner Bros, of late years, looking 
very much like C. plumosa in its young 
state. 

We now come to the most important 
members of the genus,—important be¬ 
cause they all revel in rich and rather dry 
soil, are perfectly hardy as far north as 
Jacksonville, bear immense quantities of 
plum-like, intensely fragrant, juicy fruit 
and are comparatively rapid growers. 


Their leaves are mostly bluish-green, 
hard to the touch and recurved in out¬ 
line. All my specimens, with a few ex¬ 
ceptions, were raised from seed which I 
mostly obtained from Southern Brazil, 
Blumenan, Porto Alegre and other Ger¬ 
man settlements. Some came from the 
Riviera, where these elegant palms form 
a most charming feature in the sub-trop¬ 
ical gardens. None of these species are 
adapted to moist flat-woods soil, but they 
are easily grown in high hammock and 
pine lands. When planting young spe¬ 
cimens, set them in depressions at least 
half a foot deep. If set too high they will 
not have a tight stand and are easily 
blown over when large. The seeds of 
all species of the genus have the charac¬ 
teristics of the true cocoanut—in fact they 
are cocoanuts in miniature. This class, 
known as the Cocos australis group, has 
the leaf stems nearest the trunk provided 
with blunt spines. 

Cocos australis, Mart., the Pindo Palm 
is a native of Paraguay, Southern Bra¬ 
zil and Argentine, where it occurs in a 
wild state on rather high river banks, 
and in mostly immense groves to the 
exclusion of almost every other taller 
plant. The glossy, bluish-green, pin¬ 
nate leaves are recurved and very ele¬ 
gant. It is one of the fairest palms 
known, and of a charm entirely its 
own. The flower-spathe is long, point¬ 
ed on both ends, club-like in the center 
and contains a spike of yellowish-red 
flowers. The fruit is not produced in 
such quantities as in some other spe¬ 
cies, usually only a hundred reddish- 
yellow, fragrant, cherry-like fruits on 
a spike, but often much less. Dr. T. 
Morong says, that the fronds are 


156

largely used in Paraguay in the decora¬ 
tion of churches, dwelling-houses on 
festive occasions, and that on Palm 
Sunday crowds may be met on the 
streets bearing the green fronds in 
their hands. He also asserts that it 
makes a beautiful shade tree, being a 
great ornament in the parks and gar¬ 
dens of Asuncion. 

Cocos Datil, Drudc , the Entre Rios 
Palm, the most masssive of all the spe¬ 
cies, rivalling in this respect almost the 
Canary Island Date, though the leaves 
are much shorter. In mature speci¬ 
mens the trunk is about 30 feet high. 
I have a few fine photographs of these 
palms, said to have been taken by Dr. 
G. Niederlein in the Missiones, Ar¬ 
gentine, which exhibits quite large 
dense forests of tall specimens grow¬ 
ing in rather rocky and stony soil. I 
have only one specimen now, about 15 
feet high with a very thick and massive 
trunk about seven feet high. Ferns 
(Phlebodium aureum) grow all around 
it in dense masses and form a beautiful 
decoration on the rough stem which is 
still provided with the old leaf-bases. 
The magnificent crown of stout, al¬ 
most upright leaves, overtopping the 
sturdy trunk, make the specimen an 
exceedingly stately one. Each year it 
matures about eight to nine fruit- 
bunches, weighing from 35 to 50 
pounds each. Each fruit, of a light or¬ 
ange color, is as large as a plum, very 
rich in sugar, juicy, intensely fragrant, 
like a combination of bananas and 
pineapples, and edible. The fruits are 
as closely set as a bunch of grapes, f 
have counted over 1,000 in one cluster. 
Idle large divided flower-scape is en¬ 


closed in a very massive spathe of the 
size and form of a baseball club, or, as 
a visitor expressed himself, of a “huge 
Hercules’ club.” An excellent wine, 
jam and jelly can be made of the 
fruits. It grows freely in rich, dry 
pine land soil and, like all the other 
species of this group, it does not seem 
to require much attention. To Mr. 
Theo. L. Mead belongs the credit of 
having introduced this palm into cul¬ 
tivation, but I think his specimens on 
rich, moist land all have perished. It 
is perfectly hardy and should be 
grown everywhere in the state and all 
along the gulf coast where the soil is 
suitable. 

Cocos eriospatha , Mart ., From South¬ 
ern Brazil where it attains a height of 
20 to 25 feet. A particular character¬ 
istic of this palm is the very recurved 
leaves—more recurved than in any 
other species. The trunk is short and 
thick and the flower-spathe is large and 
club-like. This usually bursts open 
with a loud crack, and reveals a verv 
large and much branched flower-truss 
of a deep violet-red color which soon 
becomes darker yellow. The flower- 
spathe, as well as the flower-stem, is 
thickly covered with a mealy powder. 
The fruit is almost as large as a good 
sized plum and of the form of a peen- 
to peach, i. e., flat on both sides, and 
when ripe, of a deep yellow color. It 
is very juicy and so full of sugar that 
it becomes very sticky when fully ripe. 
It is strongly aromatic and of a delic¬ 
ious flavor. The bunches weigh from 
25 t° 35 pounds and consist of about 
500 fruits. This is the best fruiting 

o 

kind and, next to Cocos Datil, the most

prolific, outrivalling all others in qual¬ 
ity. I have already alluded to the fact 
that the nomenclature of these garden 
palms is in a chaotic condition and it 
will require the painstaking study of a 
trained botanist to clear it up. Like 
almost all the other species, this is also 
a very elegant palm and perfectly 
hardy all over the state and along* the 
gulf coast. 

Cocos petraea , Hort. also comes from 
Southern Brazil. It is a very distinct 
plant with rigid leaves not as numerous 
as in other species. Their color is 
glaucous green. The long petioles are 
provided with blunt spines. My speci¬ 
men has not yet flowered. 

Cocos campestris, Mart. Stem slen¬ 
der and leaves short—not more than 
four feet long, very numerous, which 
gives the plant a dense aspect. This 
palm attains a height of only eight or 
nine feet and is well adapted to be 
planted in the foreground of palm 
groups. The fruit is creamy in color 
and not larger than a pea. About ioo 
to 150 are contained in one bunch. It 
is a fast grower and does well in the 
shade of tall trees. A specimen near 
a camphor tree and several magnolias 
has outgrown all others standing in 
full sun. Native home, Southern Bra¬ 
zil. 

Cocos Gaertneri, Hort. This is one 
of the very best of our garden palms, 
a fast grower, very elegant, with a 
dense leaf crown of rather erect 
fronds. My specimen is about fifteen 
years old. I raised it from seed which 
was sent me by the late Mr. Gaertner 
from Southern Brazil. He wrote me 


that the stems in its native habitat 
were mostly decorated with ferns and 
bromeliads and not infrequently with 
clusters of a fine cactus (Epiphyllum 
Gaertneri). The trunk is at present 
six feet high and is covered all over 
with several species of orchids, brome¬ 
liads, cacti, (Phyllocactus latifrons), 
ferns (Phlebodium aureum). It bears 
heavily and I have counted as many as 
980 fruits in one bunch. They are 
closely packed, of the size of a small 
plum, orange-yellow with a red cheek, 
very juicy, intensely fragrant and of 
an apricot flavor. Chickens and chil¬ 
dren are very fond of them, and so are 
opossums, raccoons, squirrels and blue- 
jays, not to mention the very injurious 
fish crows which mostly in swarms set¬ 
tle in the trees and destroy the entire 
crop in a very short time. This is a 
most beautiful palm, reminding in its 
shape very much of C. Datil, but it is 
not so massive. The leaves are about 
ten feet long. 

Cocos Yatay, Mart., with a trunk of 
about 10 to 15 feet in its habitat, South¬ 
ern Brazil. The beautiful, gracefully re¬ 
curved leaves are abount nine or ten 
feet long. Dr. Udo Dammer, the 
greatest living authority on garden 
palms, states that the leaves in full- 
grown specimens are 4.25 meters 
(about 13 feet) long. The spines on 
the leaf-stems are described as black, 
but in my specimens they are, like the 
entire leaf-stem, deep violet purple and 
the leaves arch gracefully to all sides. 
This species grows extremely well un¬ 
der the shade of oaks, grevilleas, mag¬ 
nolias, gordonias and bamboos in my 
garden. It has not yet flowered. 




158 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Cocos Blumenavia Hort. This very 
fine and elegant palm comes from 
Blumenau, Southern Brazil. The stem 
of my largest specimen, about fifteen 
years of age, is about six feet high, 
surrounded by a dense crown of arch¬ 
ing* glaucous fronds, about seven to 
eight feet long. At first sight it seems 
to resemble Cocos australis, but it has 
a much denser leaf-crown. The small 
cherry-like fruits are produced in dense 
clusters almost all the year round, as 
in C. Gaertneri. 

Cocos Bonneti, Hort. From the Ri¬ 
viera. There is a great confusion 
among most all the species of these 
garden palms and quite a number, dis¬ 
tributed at present from the Riviera 
and Southern Italy, may have originat¬ 
ed through accidental cross pollina¬ 
tion. This variety is very likely such a 
chance hybrid. It reminds very much 
of the former, but the leaf-crown is 
more open and altogether less beauti¬ 
ful. The lower leaves die off much 
quicker than is the case in other spe¬ 
cies. It ripens large bunches of strong¬ 
ly aromatic fruits the size of a hazel¬ 
nut. 

Cocos argentea, Hort. This is one of 
the most striking and beautiful of all my 
palms, the leaves being very long, quite 
erect and the lower ones gracefully re¬ 
curved and of a very striking, silvery 
whiteness. The fronds are about 12 feet 
long and the trunk is at present 5 feet 
high. It has not yet flowered and I have 
seen this most impressive palm nowhere 
else. The seeds were received from 
Hoage & Schmidt, Erfurt, Germany, in 
the fall of 1891, who had imported them 
from Southern Brazil. 


Cocos Nehelingii, Hort. This name 
was given to this most singular palm 
provisionally by Mr. George Abbott, the 
palm specialist of Orlando and Philadel¬ 
phia. He was so struck with the inde- 
scrible beauty and elegance of this Cocos 
that he insisted upon naming it after the 
author in order to distinguish it from 
other kinds. It is the fastest grower of 
all the species of this group, my largest 
specimen being about 16 feet high and a 
little more in diameter. It was raised 
from seed ten years ago. They came 
from Blumenau, Brazil. The trunk is 
about 15 inches in diameter, densely cov¬ 
ered with fibrous masses of brown bast. 
The lower leaves are about 15 feet long, 
gracefully arched and touching the 
ground while the central ones are more 
erect. The color is a deep glossy green 
with a slightly glaucous hue, and the un¬ 
derside is more silvery. The flowers ap¬ 
pear early in the season, often in Jan¬ 
uary. The spathe is very slender, thin, 
sharply pointed and about 3 to 4 feet 
long. The flowers are very different 
from all others, the scape being much 
branched, of a deep purplish color and the 
flowers are very conspicuous violet or 
lavendar and very ornamental. Only 
about fifty fruits are usually scattered 
over the large scape. They are as large 
as a hazel nut and of a very striking red 
color with a small green apex. When 
ripe they are glossy red with a small 
greenish-yellow point. They are quite 
dry and of little aroma. This exquisite 
palm grows vigorously on high, dry pine 
land. As it ripens about ten spikes of 
fruit annually, I hope to be able to dis¬ 
tribute it over the entire State. The two

last named species are the finest of the 
genus in my garden. 

Cocos Meadiae, Hort. This name I 
apply to a very distinct, small-growing 
Cocos which was introduced by Mr. 
Theodore L. Mead of Lake Charm. It 
is a dwarf-growing species with short, 
much recurved fronds, about 3 feet long. 
The color is a very striking bluish-green. 
The young leaves when unfolding are 
provided with brown filaments which are 
very brittle and drop when the full 
growth is finished. The stem is short 
and stout. At present my two specimens, 
about seventeen years old, are scarcely 
more than 5 feet high. They have not 
yet flowered. 

Cocos Alphonsei Hort., the Belair 
Palm common in our gardens. Large 
specimens of this fast growing kind I 
examined years ago in the once famous 
grounds of the late General Sanford at 
his place, Belair, near Sanford. They 
were about 50 feet high with tall, slen¬ 
der trunks and rather small, thin crowns 
of leaves. At the time they did not 
strike me as particularly impressive, and 
I must admit that I was quite disappoint¬ 
ed when I saw them. It seems to me that 
this palm grows better on low, moist 
ground than the other members of the C. 
australis group. A few specimens in my 
collection, about thirteen years old, are 
not more than 3 or 4 feet high, though 
they look quite healthy. I think they 
are the least beautiful of all the varie¬ 
ties of Cocos I so far have seen. As the 
Belair specimens have ripened seed for 
many years, this kind has been widely 
distributed over the State. 

“Fortunately for horticulture,” says 
the late Mr. E. H. Hart, “there are many 


species of palms in existence capable cf 
enduring the asperities of winter in 
Florida without material damage. When 
these shall have been collected and nat¬ 
uralized here, it will be possible for us to 
achieve scenic effects in landscape gar¬ 
dening that would have thrown Charles 
Kingsley into raptures,” and I add, all 
other lovers of beautiful and refined 
tropical plants also. The species and var¬ 
ieties of Cocos described in these lines 
take the lead among hardy palms. 

The next most important group for the 
embellishment of our gardens are the 
members of the genus Phoenix, or the 
Date Palms. They are all inhabitants of 
the warm regions of Asia and Africa, 
and, while a few occur in swampy places, 
the majority is found in rather high and 
dry ground, some even in the driest and 
hottest regions of the world, where 
scarcely any other form of vegetation 
exists. About twelve to fifteen well de¬ 
fined species are known to science, and 
all of them grow well in our climate. 
They vary considerably, and there are 
quite a number of distinct local forms 
all placed under one name, though differ¬ 
ent in a horticultural sense. In the Ri¬ 
viera where most of the species are ex¬ 
tensively grown in gardens, and whence 
most of the seeds come, they cross freely 
amongst themselves and many hybrids 
have been produced. This also ocurs in 
mv garden, where most of the different 
species ripen abundant crops of seeds. For 
this reason the cultivated species of Phoe¬ 
nix are the most difficult to define. All 
the species are dioecious, that is, male 
and female flowers are borne on different 
plants. They differ from all pinnate 
palms in having the leaves folded up-

wards, lengthwise, and in the peculiar 
form of their seeds, as seen in the com¬ 
mon Date Palm stones. Some of the 
species, like the Canary Island Date and 
the Indian Date, have solitary trunks, 
very massive and of great height, while 
others are tufted, producing suckers free¬ 
ly, like Phoenix reclinata, etc. Most of 
the latter group are small, some of them 
belonging to the smallest and most 
charming of pot palms, like Phoenix 
Roebbeleni, Ph. rupicola and others. The 
tall growing kinds usually have very 
rigid leaves, their bases being provided 
with very long and formidable spines, in¬ 
flicting severe wounds when carelessly 
approached. The leaves of the small¬ 
growing species are often very soft to the 
touch, and the spines at their bases are 
not quite so sharp and dangerous. They 
all require a very rich soil and during 
their growth an abundance of water. 

While all the Cocos species spread their 
roots along the surface soil and are easily 
blown over if not set deep in planting, 
the Date Palms send their long rope-like 
roots to a considerable depth. It is not 
unusual to find roots of the Canary Is¬ 
land Date Palm twenty feet deep in the 
soil. All the tall growing species look 
very imposing as avenue trees, of which 
fine examples can be seen in the Tampa 
Bay Hotel grounds, on Fort George Is¬ 
land and elsewhere, they ought not to be 
used indiscriminately. Many years ago, 
the late P. W. Reasoner gave the follow¬ 
ing advice, which is worth repeating: 

“In planting out large and extensive 
grounds one mistake is commonly made, 
that of dotting the trees around at reg¬ 
ular distances apart, giving the appear¬ 


ance of a checker-board in a great degree. 
A group here and there, with now and 
then a single specimen apparently plant¬ 
ed indiscriminately, but really with an eye 
to the future and general effect, will make 
a great difference in the beauty of the 
picture. No rules can be laid down, 
however, upon this subject, but good 
taste, common sense and general fitness 
of things should go hand in hand with 
careful thought of how it will look in the 
future in laying out such grounds.” 

The Date Palms for horticultural pur¬ 
poses can be divided into two groups: 

1. Tall growing species, hardy all over 
Florida. 

2. Tufted and tender species, hardy 
in the orange belt only. 

Phoenix dactylifera , Linn, the Com¬ 
mon Date Palm, is, after the Cocoanut 
Palm, perhaps, the most useful fruit 
tree of the world, and the most celebrat¬ 
ed palm in existence. It is the palm 
tree of the Bible, and Palm Sunday has 
been named in honor of it. Enormous 
quantities of fruits are harvested in 
North Africa and in Persia, supporting 
whole populations of those dry and hot 
desert countries with food. Immense 
quantities are annually exported to Eu¬ 
rope and America. Although growing 
very well in Florida, the fruit of the 
Date Palm is valueless in humid clim¬ 
ates. In the dry and hot regions of 
Southern Arizona and California it 
grows and fruits, however, very satis¬ 
factorily. For this reason the Bureau 
of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of 
Agriculture has sent an expert, Mr. Wal¬ 
ter Swingle, to the home of the Date 
Palm to collect the best varieties and to

introduce them to our extreme south¬ 
western border.* 

It requires a very dry and hot atmos¬ 
phere to mature its delicious fruit 
bunches. The Arabs have a saying that 
the “Date Palm must have its head in 
the fire and its feet in wateF’in order to 
be a success as a fruiting tree. Volumes 
have been written on the uses of the Date 
Palm. There are numerous distinct 
varieties of dates grown, all readily dis¬ 
tinguished by the Arabs and provided 
with names. These varieties are propa¬ 
gated by suckers which appear more or 
less numerously around the bases of the 
trunks. Many large Date Palms are 
found in the gardens of Florida, grown 
by the earlier settlers from the stones of 
commercial dates. Most of these, often 
quite tall, have only a scanty crown of 
light grayish-green leaves, while others 
are extremely dense and very beautiful, 
showing a much darker bluish-green 
color. They usually also produce num¬ 
erous suckers almost as large as the main 
stem, forming in this way frequently 
very tall and impenetrable thickets. 
When these side shoots are removed, the 
main trunk usually grows much faster. 
Years ago, I received seeds of a variety, 
Ph. dactylifera excelsa, from the Ri¬ 
viera, which is perfectly identical with 
many of the dense and darker green 
seedlings found in our gardens. Though 
well grown specimens of the Date Palm 
are beautiful, they cannot rival in beauty 
with the two next species. 

Phoenix sylvestra, Roxh. East Indian 
Wild Date Palm, Sugar and Wine Date 
Palm. This is one of the most beauti¬ 
ful and one of the grandest palms in ex-

istence. It is also one of the fastest 
growers with an immense crown of 
bluish-green leaves, having a spread of 
20 to 25 feet in diameter. This most 
exquisite palm should be grown every¬ 
where in the State, as it is hardy from 
Jacksonville southward. To do its best, 
it requires a rich—in fact a very rich—• 
soil and moisture. It will grow well in 
poor uplands, but then extra applications 
of fertilizer must be given. There are 
a few fine specimens in Florida, the most 
beautiful, I think, can be seen in the 
grounds of the late Mr. E. H. Hart, at 
Federal Point. I quote from one of his 
articles: “In the vegetable as well as in 
the animal kingdom, the most useful are 
not always the most beautiful, hence we 
need not be surprised at finding some 
palms whose fruit is comparatively worth¬ 
less to be the most desirable for orna¬ 
ment. Chief among such is Phoenix 
sylvestris, the Wild Date of India, whose 
rapid growth, hardy constitution and 
dense crown of elegantly curved leaves, 
densely set with narrow leaflets, espe¬ 
cially adapt it for decorative purposes. 
Although yielding a small and inferior 
berry, yet as an economic plant it stands 
in the foremost rank. In India it is ex¬ 
tensively cultivated for the sake of its 
sap, which, drawn off from the bud, is 
boiled down into syrup and sugar, or 
by distillation converted into arrack, a 
fiery tipple of the Orientals. The fresh 
juice in the early stages of fermentation 
becomes a pleasant and wholesome wine, 
and later on it furnishes a yeast of excel¬ 
lent leavening power * * * * It 

may surprise many in this hemisphere 
who love the drink which ‘gladdeneth the 
heart of man’ to learn that among the 




162

nations of the earth there is consumed, 
in the aggregate, a larger measure of 
wine from the palm than of the juice of 
the grape.” Mr. Hart describes a spe¬ 
cimen twelve years old in his grounds 
with a clean trunk of 7 feet, and with 
a very large and dense leaf-crown. 

In my grounds, there are two speci¬ 
mens fifteen years of age with immense 
leaf-crowns and a trunk 6 or 7 feet 
high. They grow on very dry and poor 
soil. In good, moist ground they would 
be at least double that size. The most 
beautiful specimen I have seen was near 
the office of Jessamine Gardens, in Pas¬ 
co County. The leaves were deep bluish- 
green. There are tall wild Date Palms 
in the Royal Palm Nurseries at Oneco 
and at Mr. Mead’s and Mr. Hart’s 
places. This extremely magnificent palm 
should find a place in every garden in 
Florida. 

Phoenix Canariensis, Hort. (Ph. te¬ 
nuis. Verscli., Ph. Jubae, Webb). This 
is a most glorious palm, and no garden 
is complete without it. It is the noblest 
of all Date Palms and one of the most 
majestic palms in cultivation. No other 
palm thrives so well in this State, and 
none other is so massive and full of gran¬ 
deur. On high, dry land it suffers very 
much from drouth, but if the ground is 
made deep and rich and kept moist, it 
will even here form fine specimens, but 
it takes much longer than on naturally 
rich and moist soils. In all the large 
gardens of the State the Canary Island 
Date is cultivated and there are every¬ 
where magnificent specimens. It makes 
a fine and imposing avenue tree and sin¬ 
gle specimens with their huge crowns of 
spreading leaves, often 30 feet in diame¬ 


ter, are often seen. It is also fine in 
groups. In Orlando may be seen large 
and massive specimens in company of 
large masses of bananas and clumps of 
bamboo, and this combination is extreme¬ 
ly effective. In order to grow this state¬ 
ly palm well, a deep, rich soil, much water 
and regular applications of stable manure 
and commercial fertilizer are necessary* 
On dry land, mulching is a very import¬ 
ant point, particularly when the plants 
are young. Frequent applications of 
manure strong in nitrogen, and irrigation 
will help them along wonderfully. As 
in most Date Palms, the strong spines 
along the leaf-stems nearest the trunk are 
dreadful weapons, therefore, great cau¬ 
tion in handling them is necessary. All 
the old leaves should be cut off with a 
sharp pruning knife or a clipper as near 
to the trunk as possible. 

The Canary Island Date is a hardy palm, 
the hardiest of the genus. I have seen 
large specimens in St. Augustine, Jack¬ 
sonville, Pensacola, Mobile and New 
Orleans, where the mercury quite often 
drops to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, and now 
and then even to 10 degress Fahrenheit. 
The leaves are bright, deep, glossy green 
—a very peculiar tint and difficult to de¬ 
scribe—and the midrib has a somewhat 
yellowish cast. The outer ones are 
gracefully arched, while the central ones 
stand upright. The crown often con¬ 
sists of over 100 leaves, each one being 
from 12‘to 15 feet long. Planted to¬ 
gether with other palms, tall, tufted bam¬ 
boos and magnolias, it creates wonderful 
scenic effects. Young plants are very 
cheap and no garden, large or small, 
should be without one or more specimens. 
In New Orleans I saw a specimen in a

park with a leaf-crown fully 30 feet in 
diameter. Seats were placed all around 
the massive trunk, and I was at once 
convinced of the fact that it makes an 
ideal park tree for sub-tropical regions. 
Phoenix tenuis seems to be a more slen¬ 
der form of this palm. I have a few 
hybrids between this species and Ph. 
dactilifera which I raised from seed com¬ 
ing from the Riviera. They are quite 
massive, bluish-green, with a wreath of 
small suckers all around the bases. Hy¬ 
brids of this palm and Ph. sylvestris are 
very massive, but also very variable, no 
two being alike. 

We now have to consider the tender 
species of Date Palms. The very beau¬ 
tiful and more elegant, they cannot com¬ 
pare in massiveness and grandeur with 
the hardy species. They all can be 
grown successfully in the orange belt. In 
my garden the entire leaf-crowns of most 
all the species are now and then cut back 
by frost when the thermometer falls to 
20 degrees Fahrenheit. Though the 
heart is in such cases usually lost—I 
have frequently pulled it out as a rotten 
mass—they soon recuperate, forming a 
new crown in a short time. 

Phoenix reclinata, Jacq. Of this fine 
African species there are quite a number 
of distinct varieties in cultivation which 
have not been admitted to specific rank 
by botanists. It is now generally con¬ 
ceded that Phoenix spinosa, Schum. and 
Ph. Zanzibarensis, Hort, belong to this 
species, though these and several others 
have to be considered as distinct local 
forms. Some of these varieties are sin¬ 
gle stemmed, others show a more tufted 
growth, often five or six stems springing 
up from one root-stock. Not quite as 


hardy as the large growing species, Ph. 
reclinata is found in magnificent speci¬ 
mens in the gardens of Mr. E. H. Hart, 
at Federal Point and in the grounds of 
Mr. Theo. L. Mead and my own. Beau¬ 
tiful specimens also can be seen in sev¬ 
eral gardens of Orlando. The long 
plume-like leaves are so much reclined 
that they gracefully hang down, the lower 
ones almost touching the ground. The 
finest specimen which I ever saw grows 
in Mr. E. N. Reasoner’s nursery at 
Oneco, Fla. It is about 30 feet high 
and a picture of tropical beauty. Young 
plants are easily lost by a strong freeze. 
Therefore a protection of pine-needles 
is necessary, or pine-boughs must be 
placed over young and newly set spe¬ 
cimens. Soil banked around such 
plants also proves an excellent protec¬ 
tion. 

Phoenix Senegalensis, Van Houtte, as 
growing in my garden, is certainly not 
synonymous with the former, being en¬ 
tirely different in habit and growth. It 
is a very dense, soft-leaved, deep-green 
Date Palm, growing in very large and tall 
clumps or tufts. A specimen in my gar¬ 
den, about twelve years old, has reached 
a height of about 20 feet with very thiick 
stems about 8 feet high. The spatlie 
and flower-spikes are bright yellow. 
While the former species comes from 
South Africa, this one has been intro¬ 
duced from the region of the Senegal 
and other tropical places of Central 
Africa. It is very tender, but is well 
adapted to all the gardens of the orange 
belt. 

Phoenix Leonenesis, Lodd, another 
palm from tropical Africa, is one of the 
most distinct and beautiful of the fam- 




164

ily. Though said to be identical with 
Ph. reclinata, my specimen is very dis¬ 
tinct. It is the fastest grower of all 
Date Palms, very massive,* with a 
dense crown of long, glossy, green 
leaves. The leaflets along the midrib 
are arranged in two’s and sometimes 
three’s and stand close together. The 
flower-spathes appear in March in a 
circle all around the upper part of the 
stem. I counted twelve of them at one 
time. They are about two feet long 
and are of a beautiful orange-yellow 
color. The spike is much branched 
and of the same color. The fruit is 
deep purplish-brown, as large as the 
common date and very sweet. None of 
my Date Palms have grown so rapidly. 
The trunk of the specimen, which is 
about twelve years old, is about seven 
or eight feet tall and there are cpiite a 
number of small suckers all around the 
base. It is easily hurt by a strong 
freeze but soon recuperates. 

Phoenix padulosa Roxh., from In¬ 
dia, is a fine tufted palm with long, 
gracefully arched, spreading leaves 
eight to ten feet long; trunk 12 to 15 
feet high. The leaves are whitish be¬ 
neath. Rare. 

Phoenix rupicola , Anderson. The 
Sikkim Date Palm from the Himalav- 

j 

as, from whence so many beautiful 
magnolias (M. Campbelli, Talauma 
Hodgsonii), tree rhododendrons and 
elegant bamboos come. It is an ex¬ 
ceedingly graceful and elegant palm, 
having a slender stem 12 to 20 feet 
high. The numerous, glossy, green 
leaves are all on one plane. It is very 
tender and must be protected a little 
in very cold weather, especially in its 


younger state. I have only seen young 
specimens in our gardens, but all are 
perfect pictures of health and beauty. 

Phoenix pnsilla, Gaertn. (Ph. Zey- 
lanica, Hort., Ph. cycadifolia, Hort.). 
This is also a tender and beautiful spe¬ 
cies from Ceylon, reminding, in the ar¬ 
rangement of its flat leaflets, of cer¬ 
tain species of Cycas. Though a very 
slow-growing palm in my garden, it 
attains a height of 10 to 15 feet in its 
native home. The foliage is deep, 
glossy green, with a yellowish midrib. 

Phoenix . farinifera, Roxh. From 
Ceylon and India. A shrubby palm 
with very rigid leaves and strong 
spines. The leaves are covered with 
a whitish powder. As in most species 
of the small and tufted Date Palms, the 
leaf-stems of this species at their bases 
are provided with long, stout spines, 
which make it impossible to walk 
through clumps of it, and it is always 
necessary to be careful when working 
among them. It would make a fine 
hedge-plant, as neither man nor beast 
can penetrate thickets of it. It never 
grows tall. 

Phoenix humilis, Royle, from India 
and its variety, Ph. humilis Hanceana, 
Beccari, from Southern China, are ex¬ 
tremely handsome and elegant tender 
palms, never growing very tall. 

Phoenix Roehheleni, O’Brien, from 
Assam and Cochin China, is also closely 
allied to the former. It is such an ele¬ 
gant small palm that it has become a 
rival of Cocos Weddelliana in pot cul¬ 
ture. 

Phoenix Loureiroii, from Hong Kong 
Ph. peduncalata, from Khasya, and Ph. 
Onselyana, from Central India, have

all been reduced to varieties of P. hu- 
milis by Beccari, though in a horticul¬ 
tural sense they prove distinct enough 
to deserve a place in all our gardens. 
They are all charming little palms and 
are particularly adapted to small gar¬ 
dens where the massive growing spe¬ 
cies cannot be grown. They are all 
hardy in South Florida and in rich soil 
soon form very graceful specimens. 

Phoenix aculis , Burch is a stemless 
Indian species, with leaves five to six 
feet long and upright. 

Phoenix glaxtca, Hort. I received 
the seed of this Date Palm from Haage 
& Schmidt, of Erfurt, Germany, about 
twelve years ago. It has formed a 
very slender stem seven feet high, with 
long, arching leaves of a glaucous 
color. Quite a number of strong suck¬ 
ers are found around the base. The 
flower-spathe is greenish-white and the 
flower-scape, sulphur-yellow. The 
small fruits, the size of a coffee-bean, 
are deep red. This is one of the most 
distinct and elegant of all my palms. 

Phoenix tomentosa , Hort , in my gar¬ 
den seems to be identical with Ph. 
farinifera. 

All the foregoing palms belong to the 
feathery or pinnate-leaved section. The 
members of the following two genera 
have all beautiful fan-shaped leaves. L 
shall first call the attention of my read¬ 
ers to the genus Sahal, the Cabbage 
Palmettos. The genus is strictly 
American. Our native Cabbage Pal¬ 
metto is fully described in a previous 
paper. 

Sahal Mexicana, Martins , Mexican 
Cabbage Palmetto, closely allied to 
our native species. It is found in ex¬ 


treme Southeastern Texas and in Mex¬ 
ico, where it forms a beautiful feature 
in the landscape, often growing to¬ 
gether in immense numbers. Up to a 
height of 15 to 25 feet, the bases of the 
old leaf-stalks remain on the trunk 
adding much to its picturesqueness,, 
precisely as in our Florida Cabbage 
Palmetto. As this species has been 
distributed for quite a number of 
years, all over the state, there must be 
large specimens in many gardens, 
though there is a possibility that they 
may be confounded with the native 
species. Both are, however, easily told 
apart. The Mexican Cabbage Palmet¬ 
to is more robust, has a broader and 
denser leaf-crown and grows much 
quicker. The entire aspect is quite dif¬ 
ferent. The trunk attains a height 
of 50 feet and is two feet in diameter. 
The leaf-blades are very large, some¬ 
times six feet long and seven feet wide, 
‘"divided to the middle in verv narrow 

j 

two-parted segments, which are fila¬ 
mentous near the margin.” It grows 
easily and should be found in all gar¬ 
dens where the beauty of palms is ap¬ 
preciated. 

Sahal Blackhurniana, Glazehrook, 
Bermuda Cabbage Palmetto. There is 
some confusion about this species. The 
seeds from which my specimens were 
grown came from Bermuda, the botan¬ 
ical authorities give the West Indies 
as its habitat. I call special attention 
to a very fine article on the subject in 
that fine publication of Prof. C. S. Sar¬ 
gent, “Garden and Forest” (Vol. IV., 
page 307), where a full description 
and an illustration is given. I have 
quite a number of specimens in my 








166 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


garden, but they are all very slow 
growers. The leaves are flat, divided 
into about forty lobes. Where the 
rather short leaf-stem joins the blade 
there is a triangular, greenish-white 
spot. It is a large and distinct palm, 
and closely allied to our native species. 
See “Garden and Forest/’ Vol. IV., 
pages 302 and 307 for further informa¬ 
tion. 

Sabal umbraculifera, Mart ., Jamaica 
Cabbage Palmetto, Palmetto Royal, 
Giant Fan Palm, Big Thatch Palm of 
Jamaica. Some botanists have made 
this species synonymous with the 
former, but it is decidedly distinct from 
the palmetto coming from Bermuda. 
A magnificent palm, very massive and 
noble in appearance. The trunk at¬ 
tains a height of 90 to 100 feet, and ac¬ 
cording to Sir D. Morris, the leaves 
are five to six feet across. “This palm,” 
he continues, “is essentially gregari¬ 
ous ; it is found covering several thou¬ 
sand acres, literally forming extensive 
groves in the Pedro Plains * * * 

They occupy, chiefly, dry, elevated 
banks and dry strips of land between 
numerous lagoons and morasses—the 
haunts of turtles and alligators. Seen 
across one of these lagoons, the ef¬ 
fect produced by a view of this palm 
forest is indescribable. The tall, 
straight, cylindrical columns sur¬ 
mounted by their globular masses of 
fronds, often 25 to 30 feet across, are 
seen to rise out of the sea of green 
sedges and grasses, and as no other 
growths intervene the result—merely 
as a matter of scenery—is well worth 
a visit to the tropics to behold. Un¬ 
der such circumstances even the most 


sceptical would admit that palms are 
rightly named ‘the kingly race of 
plants.’ Riding underneath nothing 
could surpass in grandeur and beauty 
tall stems, canopied by immense fan¬ 
shaped leaves rustling and rattling 
against each other in the refreshing 
breeze.” The very word of these lines 
fits our native Cabbage Palmetto as 
seen in groves in many places of our 
beautiful state, the Jamaica Royal Pal¬ 
metto is much larger in all its parts. 
Of the economic use of this species, 
mention may be made of the leaves, 
which form the only thatching ma¬ 
terial of the houses of the region for 
both negro and European. Mats, ropes, 
hats and baskets are made and the 
hollowed trunks, cut into short 
lengths, make admirable bee-hives and 
are even used as flower pots. 

I have fine specimens of this grand 
palm in my collection, and I have 
found that they are entirely hardy. 
They were raised from seed received 
from Mr. Wm. Fawcett, Director of 
Public Gardens and Plantations, Ja¬ 
maica. Only the following species 
seem to have larger leaves. On my 
young specimens they are 8 to 10 feet 
in diameter. There are quite a num¬ 
ber of fine specimens growing in vari¬ 
ous gardens in Florida. Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead, at Lake Charm, has a magnifi¬ 
cent specimen on his place, fully 30 
feet high, with a very broad and im¬ 
posing leaf-crown. Like all the Cab¬ 
bage palmettoes it is perfectly hardy 
in the orange belt, growing with great 
vigor in rich, moist soil, but when well 
cared for, it also grows finely on high 
pine land. Several palms in my gar-

den grow under the names of Sabal 
princeps and S. Ghiesbreghtii seem to 
be identical with this species. The 
Sabals develop slowly, and it does not 
seem unlikely that one or the other 
may prove distinct when fully grown. 
This species has the habit of flowering 
and bearing fruit when just commenc¬ 
ing to form a stem. I have quite a 
number of such specimens in my gar¬ 
den. Neither S. Palmetto nor S. 
Blackburniana show this trait. The 
berries are as large as a grape and deep 
bluish-black. 

Sabal mauritiae forme, Griseb, and 
Wendl., Savana Palm, is common in 
the West Indies, and is very likely 
identical with Sabal Havanensis Lodd., 
S. glaucescens Lodd., or these latter 
may be merely local forms of it. Ac¬ 
cording to Mr. E. N. Reasoner, it is 
the largest of all palmettos, having 
gigantic leaves 12 feet across. My 
specimens are all small, but they have 
proved to be perfectly hardy. It 
grows best in rich, moist soil, but can 
also be grown on higher and drier land 
if kept moist and well fertilized. Palms 
give dignity and an indescribable 
grace and glory to every garden, and 
the Sabals can be particularly recom¬ 
mended to all lovers of the beautiful. 

There are quite a number of dwarf 
stemless species, such as Sabal Adan- 
sonii, S. Mocini, S. longipednacalata, 
etc., which are only valuable for large 
collections, being far less ornamental 
than many other small growing palms. 
All are perfectly hardy. Dr. Wm. 
Trelease, Director of the Missouri Bo¬ 
tanical Garden, decribed a tall growing 
species new to science, from Mexico. 


This may be a valuable addition to our 
garden palms. Its scientific name is 
Sabal Uresana, Trelease. 

The next most important group of 
Fan Palms for our gardens are the 
species of Washingtonia, the Califor¬ 
nia Fan Palms. They are all large 
growing species with massive trunks 
and beautiful leaf-crowns. Three dis¬ 
tinct species have been described. 

Washingtonia Ulifera, Wendl. (Bra- 
hea filamentosa Plort., Pritchardia fili- 
fera Wendl.), the California Weeping 
Palm. It has a cylindrical trunk, 
much enlarged at the base with a 
crown of large fan-shaped leaves pro¬ 
vided with numerous threads or fila¬ 
ments. It is not rare in the foot-hills 
of Southern California bordering 
the desert. Where it is found, the soil 
is usually black and it always grows— 
mostly in groups—where it can ob¬ 
tain a constant supply of water. In 
the high pine lands of Florida this, the 
most hardy species of the genus, can¬ 
not be successfully grown, and the 
lower leaves always get yellow. I have 
a specimen twelve years old, growing 
near several Phoenix and Cocos spe¬ 
cies, but it is still dwarf, overtowered 
by all the rest. There are, however,, 
magnificent, tall specimens in St. Au¬ 
gustine, on the place of the late Mr. E. 
H. Ffart and elsewhere, but they al¬ 
ways grow in rather rich, black soil 
which is always moist. 

Washingtonia robusta Wendl. In 
aspect and growth this beautiful palm 
is decidedly different from the former. 
It was first discovered near the coast 
of Western Mexico in the vicinity of 
Guayamas. In California it is much 









168 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


grown and is the more satisfactory of 
the two. Mr. Ernest Braunton, one of 
the leading authorities on California 
horticulture, says that it grows four 
times as fast as the former. “Grown 
under identically the same conditions, 
this species, at twenty years of age, 
had made 40 feet of solid (matured) 
trunk, while the more common spe¬ 
cies had made 10. The deeper and 
more constant green .of W. robusta is 
a strong point in its favor as a decora¬ 
tive plant.” It also differs from the 
former in its shorter leaf-stalks and 
more compact habit—the darker color 
in all its parts. The base and edge of 
the petiole are light brown in W. fili- 
fera, but violet-black in W. robusta. 
The latter also has a much darker col¬ 
ored trunk, and the seeds are only half 
as large as those of W. filifera. With 
the exception of Cocos plumosa, this 
is the fastest grower of all garden 
palms, and it has the great advantage 
of being hardy in all parts of Florida 
where Sabal Palmetto is found wild. 
Though preferring moist, rich soil, it 
grows tolerably well on high pine land, 
provided the soil is made very deep and 
rich and kept moist. Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead has a wonderfully glorious speci¬ 
men on his place “Wait-a-bit” at Lake 
Charm. It is so noble and distinct in 
aspect, so immense and majestic on the 
side of Sabal umbraculifera and Phoe¬ 
nix Carnariensis that it arouses the en¬ 
thusiasm of every passerby. This palm 
must be about 40 feet high and has a 
broad, spreading crown. Mr. C. T. 
Simpson, of Little River, near Miami, 
writes me that these Washingtonias 
“are going to be the avenue palms 


here” (at Miami). This and the fol¬ 
lowing species should be largely plant¬ 
ed everywhere in the state. They look 
very beautiful in groups of a few to 
even a dozen or more; they are fine as 
single specimens on the lawn, and they 
are exquisite as avenue trees. 

Washingtonia Sonorae, S. Watson. 
This fine palm is a comparatively re¬ 
cent introduction from La Paz and Sail 
Jose, Mexico, promising to rival in 
beauty with the former. It has been 
much planted in Florida, seedlings 
having been distributed all over the 
state by Reasoner Bros., Oneco, Fla. 
This firm has also disseminated the gi¬ 
gantic Sabal umbraculifera and S. mau- 
ritiaeforme in large numbers over Flo¬ 
rida, and we may be sure to see a won¬ 
derful display of these large palms in 
our gardens in the near future. Of the 
Sonora Washingtonia I have only seen 
small plants, but they all grow beau¬ 
tifully, particularly in rich, hammock 
soil, and even in rich pine land. The 
trunk is said to grow 20 feet high, the 
leaves being* three to four feet in diam¬ 
eter. 

III. 

Other Hardy Palms. 

There are quite a number of most 
beautiful and elegant, hardy palms 
which are only rarely seen in our gar¬ 
dens. The cause of this singular fact 
is difficult to understand. It is true 
they mostly like shade and rich, very 
rich soil, but both can easily be pro¬ 
vided by a true lover of these royal 
plants. The palms in question belong 
to the following genera: 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


169 


Chamaerops. 

Trachy carpus. 

Livistonia. 

Rhapis. 

Erythea. 

Diplothemiuni. 

Jubaea. 

Though growing so easily the fact 
must always be remembered that while 
many palms will bear much neglect, 
yet the best results are only to be had 
by giving them plenty of nourishment 
and good cultivation. If this is kept in 
mind and carried out, most members 
of these genera will grow well here. 

Chamaerops humilis, Linn., the Eur¬ 
opean Fan Palm, is the only species of 
the genus, but it is split up in quite a 
number of more or less distinct varie¬ 
ties. It grows wild in Sicily, Spain and 
Northern Africa, where it is found in 
dry, uncultivated, sandy tracts in the 
same way as our native Saw Palmetto. 
This palm and its various forms are 
very distinct and beautiful and are well 
adapted to our soil and climate. They 
all are excellent palms for all parts of 
Florida and along the Gulf Coast west 
to Texas. They grow well and rapidly 
in good soil. I have a few specimens 
that are pictures of beauty, but they 
were cared for, while others that re¬ 
mained in the nursery rows are small 
and poor. All the varieties sucker very 
much. These should be removed if t 
single-stemmed specimen is desired. If 
carefully taken off they can be use 1 
for propagation. Mr. Theo. L. Mead 
has such a single-stemmed European 
Fan Palm with a beautiful round leaf- 
crown about 15 feet in height. In Feb¬ 
ruary, my plants begin to bloom, and 


this is noticed with surprise even by 
people who do not care for plants that 
do not furnish a money crop. We see 
now, densely attached to the stem, 
bright yellow sponge-like masses, 
looking like a large fungus. I grow 
the following varieties: 

Chamaerops humilis elegans, tufted, 
the stems growing about five feet high. 
Leaves very soft on long petioles 
which are, like all the varieties, pro¬ 
vided with short spines. 

Ch. h. argentea, with glaucous, 
scurfy foliage, deep green above, sil¬ 
very beneath. 

Ch. h. macrocarpa with black spines 
along the leaf-stems. 

Ch. h. arborescens, growing much 
taller than the other kinds. 

C. h. tomentosa, covered with a 
whitish powder. All these local forms 
or garden varieties are very elegant, 
and should be largely planted. They 
form fine groups by themselves or in 
connection with other • small palms. 
They do not always come true from 
seed. The best way is to propa¬ 
gate them from suckers, which appear 
numerously around the base of the 
stem. All grow very well on high, 
dry pine land, in fact they do better 
here than in moist black soil. 

The genus Trachycarpus consists of 
four species of hardy fan-leaved palms, 
two of them being indigenous to the 
Himalayan region, and two are found, 
respectively, in China and Japan. 
The last two have fine polished 
trunks, while the Himalayan kinds 
have their stems clothed with the 
old leaf-sheath. I have never seen 
the latter in cultivation in Florida, 





170

while the Japanese and Chinese species 
are only sparingly represented in our 
gardens. They require more care and 
attention during the first years, being 
easily lost if not attended to in a prop¬ 
er way. The soil should be very rich 
and rather heavy, and a little shade is 
necessary for young plants. Lack c<f 
water for any length of time proves fa¬ 
tal to them. When once well estab¬ 
lished and in full flourishing condition, 
they are all fine and elegant palms. 

Tr achy carpus Fortunei, Wendl. For 
tune’s Palm, is of unique interest as it 
is the hardiest of all palms, growing 
well in many parts of England in the 
open air. Its growth is rather slow, 
but eventually it attains a height of 30 
feet. This species should be planted 
everywhere in Northern Florida, in 
Georgia, South Carolina and West to 
Texas. It would undoubtedly look 
very well in groups and on the lawn. 

Trachy carpus excelsa Wendl., the 
Chusan Palm. In California, where it 
is one of the most common garden 
palms as far north as San Francisco, it 
is called the Chinese Windmill Palm. 
Though this species is said to have a 
smooth trunk, I have only seen speci¬ 
mens which had their stems clothed 
with a network of fibers from the old 
leaf-stalks. It is a very beautiful and 
distinct looking species, especially in 
a large state. As it comes from South¬ 
ern China it is perfectly hardy all over 
the state, and there are a few speci¬ 
mens found in several gardens. The 
finest Chusan Palm I saw in Florida is 
in the grounds of Mr. Wm. J. Ells¬ 
worth at Jessamine, Fla., a plant of 
very striking beauty and elegance. In 


my grounds there is also a fine young 
specimen with a trunk about three or 
four feet high. This palm should be 
planted largely in all our gardens and 

its hardiness, beauty and distinction 

* 

entitle it to a foremost place wherever 
these noble plants are grown. 

Trachy carpus Khasiana, Wendl., Hi¬ 
malayan Fan Palm. Major Madden 
found it at 6,500 to 7,800 feet altitude 
amidst rhododendrons, bamboos, an- 
dromedas, etc. “In damp, shady glens,” 
he writes, “on the north and southeast 
but chiefly on the northwest exposure, 
this palm is found in great numbers, 
forming clumps and rows, the trees 
rising from 30 to 50 feet high, each 
with a superb crown of large flabelli- 
form leaves, rattling loudly in the 
breeze. At six feet from the ground 
the stems are two feet in circumfer¬ 
ence, but become thicker above. The 
flowers appear in April and May, and 
the fruit, which is of a dark, glossy 
blue, about half an inch long, ripens in 
October and, at the time of my visit, 
(March 20, 1847) lay strewed in abun¬ 
dance at the foot of the trees.”* 

Trachy car pus Martiana, Wendl. An¬ 
other Fan Palm of the Himalayas, said 
to be very similar to the former from 
a botanical point of view. In fact, the 
two are united by recent botanists and 
the name “T. Martiana” is used for 
both. I am not aware that they are in 
culthation in Florida. I had them 
both raised from seen which was sent 
me from Darjeeling, but all the small 
plants succumbed to the heat on my 
dry pine land. Had they been planted

tory,” No. 65, May, 1853, pages 346-355.

171 


in sheds in moist cool soil they would 
undoubtedly have made a good 
growth. Palm specialists should again 
introduce these species. 

Another genus of palms, far too rare¬ 
ly grown in our gardens, are the Livis- 
tonias. This group consists of about 
fourteen well-marked species of stately 
fan-leaved palms, but only three or 
four are now and then found in our 
gardens. There are magnificent speci¬ 
mens in the late Mr. E. H. Hart’s col¬ 
lection, even a few of the strictly trop¬ 
ical species. Most people who only 
look at these palms superficially find 
them too much like our common Cab¬ 
bage Palmetto, and for this reason pass 
them by. But there is, however, a 
great difference, not only in aspect, in 
the foliage and flowers, but also in 
the short, dense fruit-clusters. In or¬ 
der to succeed with these palms, which 
are hardy in the orange belt, rich, 
moist soil and—in their young state— 
shade are essential requisites. On 
high, dry pine land not under constant 
irrigation they are a failure. Large 
and well developed specimens are very 
beautiful and show a grandeur entirely 
their own. 

Livistonia Chine nsis, R. Br. (Lan- 
tania Borbonica, Hort.), of Southern 
China, is one of the most numerous and 
popular Fan Palms in cultivation, be¬ 
ing undoubtedly the best commercial 
Fan Palm for pot culture. In all the 
large conservatories it is never absent. 
In Horticultural Hall, Fairmount 
Park, Philadelphia, there are several 
specimens 60 to 70 feet high—tall and 
imposing palms with slender, smooth, 
gray trunks and magnificent leaf- 


crowns. The leaves are flat and per¬ 
fectly fan-shaped, three to four and 
even six feet in diameter and of a beau¬ 
tiful light green color. The fans im¬ 
ported in such large quantities from 
China are made of the leaves of this 
palm. In Orlando, where particularly 
the older and more enthusiastic set¬ 
tlers planted many exotic trees and 
shrubs, this palm is scarcely met with. 
There are, however, noble specimens 
in Mr. Hart’s garden, at Federal Point, 
and in the grounds of the large hotels 
along the East Coast many good Chi¬ 
nese Fan Palms can be seen. I saw 
recently a few fine young specimens 
near the entrance of Tampa Bay Ho¬ 
tel: They are about 15 feet high, very 
dense and perfect in form, bearing- 
large bunches of nearly ripe fruit when 
I saw them—February 27, 1909. These 
home-grown fruits should be carefully 
gathered and planted, as they very like¬ 
ly will produce plants perfectly accli- 
limatized. This palm is a fast-grower 
in rich, moist soil, but it needs shade, 
particularly in its younger state. 

Livistonia australis, Mart. (Cory- 
pha australis, Hort.), the Australian 
Fan Palm, another exquisite and dis¬ 
tinct palm that should find a home in 
our gardens. The leaf-crown is some¬ 
what denser and the color a deeper 
green than in the former. It is perfect¬ 
ly hardy in Central Florida, being 
found in Australia as far south as Mel¬ 
bourne. It grows best in rich ham¬ 
mock and low pine land, where it nev¬ 
er suffers from lack of water. My 
specimens had attained the height of 
six or seven feet and the diameter of 
the leaf-crown was 10 feet. A dense 





172

and well-grown specimen is a very 
charming and refined object. It is very 
seldom seen in our gardens and should 
be largely planted. Baron Ferdinand 
von Muller, the great Australian bot¬ 
anist, described a number of other Au¬ 
stralian Fan Palms, which appear to 
be closely allied to this species. 

Livistonia Hoogendorpii, Hort ., from 
Java, a very striking and grand palm 
from Java, perfectly hardy at Federal 
Point. A large and broad specimen 
which stood the large freeze of 1895 al¬ 
most unharmed was the pride of Mr. 
Hart. It occasionally loses its leaves, 
but these are soon replaced by new 
ones. The leaves are four to six feet 
in diameter and their stems, being of a 
very conspicuous reddish-brown color, 
are three to five feet long and armed 
with stout spines. Shade and rich, 
moist soil is the secret of the culture of 
all Livistonias. 

Livistonia humilis R. Br ., another 
Australian Fan Palm, said to be identi¬ 
cal with Baron F. von Muller’s L. Ma- 
riae, has stems four to twelve feet tall 
and large fan-shaped leaves about three 
feet in diameter. It grows abundantly 
in North Australia and will undoubt¬ 
edly prove hardy in the orange belt. 

Livistonia rotundifolia, Mari. (Cham 
aerops Biro, Sieb.), one of the most 
popular pot palms from Java, is not 
quite as hardy as L. Hoogendorp II, 
but, if well protected when young, I 
believe it will be able to stand sharp 
freezes when it has attained a good 
size. There is no doubt that it will be 
one of the best garden palms for South 
Florida. I had planted out all these 
species, and also L. olivaefornfis. Mart. 


in my plant shed. They grew vigor¬ 
ously in the rich, moist soil in half¬ 
sheds, came through a number of win¬ 
ters unharmed, but were finally de¬ 
stroyed by the rise of the lake during 
my absence. Not the cold, but the 
water killed them. 

All the members of the genus Rha- 
pis are well adapted to our soil and 
climate, thriving admirably in rich, 
moist land and shade. There are five 
distinct species known to science all 
coming from Southern Japan and Chi¬ 
na where they are grown since time 
immemorial as decorative plants. As 
they are small and of an elegance and 
beauty distinctly their own, the Jap¬ 
anese plant them largely around their 
homes in company with Cycas revo- 
luta, Camellia Japonica and bamboos. 
They are among the few palms pro¬ 
ducing suckers at the base, thereby 
forming very beautiful, large clumps 
often 50 to 60 stems being counted on 
one plant. No other palms are so well 
adapted to ornamental plant-sheds as 
the Rhapis species. My specimens are 
growing together with ferns, fancy¬ 
leaved Caladiums, xanthosomas, colo- 
casias, alocasias, marantas, calatheas 
and similar shade-loving plants, and, 
among them, they form pictures of 
elegance and beauty. The leaves are 
small, much divided and fan-shaped. 
All the species will be hardy anywhere 
in Florida in sheds. Thev must be 

j 

handled with care as the leaf-stems 
are quite delicate and are easily brok¬ 
en. Good plants, about two-and-one- 
half to three feet high with two or 
three shoots, are usually sold at $5 
apiece, wholesale, while plants six feet

high and six feet in diameter can rare¬ 
ly be bought for less than $150 each. 
These beautiful palms are not easily 
obtainable, even in a small state, and 
lovers of palms should be on the look¬ 
out for them. Thousands are annual¬ 
ly imported from Japan, but the de¬ 
mand is always larger than the sup¬ 
ply. Propagation is effected by sever¬ 
ing side-shoots from the mother plants 
and potting them separately. This is 
a very slow process and it explains 
why these charming dwarf palms are 
more expensive than most others. 
Seeds are rarely produced and are rare¬ 
ly offered. 

Rhapis flabelliformis, L’Herit., com¬ 
mon Bamboo Palm, Ground Rattan 
Cane, from China and Japan where it is 
much grown. The most common spe¬ 
cies of all the Bamboo Palms, growing 
in large, dense tufts 7 to 8 feet high in 
moist, rich soil and in shade. Large, 
well-grown specimens are marvels of 
beauty. Shade, very rich soil and mois¬ 
ture are necessary for its well-being. It 
will not grow in the sun or in dry, high 
soils, but it is a most beautiful plant for 
shady nooks and corners near the house 
where it can have plenty of room to de¬ 
velop its charms. Full-grown stems are 
about as thick as a thumb and are cover¬ 
ed with the old leaf-sheaths. 

Rhapis humilis , Blum, from China and 
very likely also from Southern Japan, 
where it is much grown on account of its 
delicate beauty and density of form. It 
is smaller in all its parts, rarely growing 
more than 3 or 4 feet high, but in gener¬ 
al aspect it is similar to the former. 

Rhapis Cochinchinensis, Mart., from 
Cochin China. This species I have never 


been able to obtain. It is said to be the 
largest and most imposing of the genus, 
growing 8 to 10 feet high, and some au¬ 
thors say that it even attains a height of 
12 feet or more. There is a magnifi¬ 
cent clump of a Rhapis species in the 
grand collection of Horticultural Hall, 
Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, which I 
have always thought to be this species. 
It is at least 12 feet high and consists of 
a dense mass of perfect stems. It stands 
in the foreground and there are some 
tall plume-leaved palms, araucarias and 
rubber trees in the background—a very 
impressive combination. There are only 
a few gardens in Florida where these 
fine, small palms are grown. They de¬ 
serve a growing interest and many 
friends. 

Erythea, one of the Hesperides, Daugh¬ 
ter of Evening, is the poetical name given 
to a distinct genus of beautiful Western 
American Fan Palms by Sereno Watson. 
They are spineless, of robust growth and 
would be perfectly hardy all over our 
State if soil and climatic conditions 
would be to their taste. They like a 
rather heavy soil and a long, dry season. 
In Italy and the Riviera and in Califor¬ 
nia they belong to the grandest of all 
palms. Many years ago, I sent a large 
number of seedlings to my place in 
Orange County. They were set out on 
high, dry pine land and all pined away. 
A few years later I sent a few larger 
ones, but they also succumbed to our 
hot dry soil. Mr. George Abbott has a 
fine, healthy young specimen in his gar¬ 
den at Orlando, and I have been informed 
that there are a few others in various 
parts of the State. These palms are so 
charmingly beautiful and so distinct that 



174

they should be planted wherever palms 
are admired. In moist, rich soil—per¬ 
haps with a small admixture of clay— 
they will undoubtedly thrive just as the 
Washingtonias, from the same region, 
thrive with us. Only two species are 
known. 

Erythea armata, S. Wats., Blue Palm, 
California Blue Palm, in Italy mostly 
known under the name of Brahea Roezli, 
is a native of Lower California, where 
it is called “Palma azul.” It is one of 
the most glaucous palms known and de¬ 
serves its name, Blue Palm with perfect 
right. In its distribution it is strictly 
limited to the peninsula of lower Cali¬ 
fornia, making its first appearance about 
40 miles south of our boundary line, and 
ranging south to almost St. Lucas, always 
in the dry, mostly hilly and stony inter¬ 
ior, never near the coast. It is therefore 
essentially a palm of dry regions, con¬ 
trary to E. edulis, which effects moist 
canons. Under cultivation, the Blue 
Palms show a remarkable adaptability to 
better conditions, not even disliking irri¬ 
gated California gardens and parks, pro¬ 
vided the soil is well drained, and making 
a very fast growth when planted out. A 
specimen about 13 years old flowered for 
the first time in a Santa Barbara garden 
in 1895. It sent out three flower-scapes 
over 12 feet long, gracefully arching and 
of a feathery appearance, bearing myr¬ 
iads of exceedingly minute flowers. In 
California this magnificent palm is get¬ 
ting a feature of all the better gardens, 
why not in Florida? With a little ex¬ 
perimenting and coaxing it will undoubt¬ 
edly thrive. 

Erythea edulis, S. Wats., the Guade- 
lupe Palms, from the lonely and gloomy- 


looking island of Guadelupe, about 250 
miles south of San Diego, California. It 
was discovered by Dr. E. Palmer, who 
found it “frequently in deep, warm rav¬ 
ines * * * * It attains a height 

of about 40 feet, and 15 inches in diame¬ 
ter. Each tree bears one to four clus¬ 
ters of fruit, 4 feet in length and weigh¬ 
ing 40 to 50 pounds. The fruit is eaten 
by men, goats, birds and mice. In flow¬ 
er near end of March.” 

A recent writer states that it is the 
most elegant of all Fan Palms from 
North America—a fast grower, quite 
suitable to conservatories and the open 
air in the South, “where in a prominent 
place it is likely to thrive, also in regard 
to its fruits, which are similar in size 
and taste to prunes.” A peculiar char¬ 
acteristic of this palm is that the trunk 
is quite slender in comparison to its 
height and often is slightly bent at the 
base, so that it has nothing of the heavy 
massiveness of the Washingtonias and 
Sabals. The leaves do not stand stiff and 
rigid, as in other species of the temper¬ 
ate regions, but droop gracefully, owing 
to the length and flexibility of the petio¬ 
les. What adds much to the elegance of 
the plant is that the old leaves, when 
dead, do not remain to disfigure the up¬ 
per part of the trunk, but fall down by 
themselves. The flower stalks reach 
fully 6 feet in length, and they must be 
grand indeed, those huge bunches of 
fruit, quite black when ripe, weighing 
40 to 50 pounds. The fibrous expanse 
of the petioles, when the leaves die off, 
falls down in a sort of soft, thickly- 
woven mat—a splendid material for 
packing plants,—and it may also be used 
for other purposes. It grows abundant-

ly on the north side of the little island 
where the climate is quite foggy and 
humid. This is very likely a good palm 
for Florida. I have given as full an ac¬ 
count as is possible here, in order to in¬ 
duce all plant lovers to try this fine palm. 
No time and money should be spared to 
introduce it in large quantities. Its 
beauty, distinctness and utility deserve 
that every lover of the palms concen¬ 
trate his attention on this noble Erythea, 
which attains, when fully grown, about 
30 feet in height. 

Th eDiplothemiums form a small genus 
of about four dwarf palms, reminding 
somewhat of the species of the Cocos aus¬ 
tralis type. They are all inhabitants of 
Southern Brazil. Though of indescrib¬ 
able elegance and easily accommodated, 
they are- extremely rare in our gardens. 
Mostly stemless or developing only short 
ringed trunks, they can be easily protect¬ 
ed in severe weather. They all revel in 
sunshine, needing about the same treat¬ 
ment as the hardy species of Cocos. The 
late Mr. Edmund H. Hart was very fond 
of these palms and had fine specimens of 
about three species in cultivation. Of 
the four known species, two inhabit the 
coast regions of Brazil, the other two, the 
dry campos. These latter thrive well on 
high pine land, while the former need 
more water and richer soil. 

Diplothemium cdmpestre, Mart, is a 
common palm in the region of Blumenau, 
South Brazil, and is the best known spe¬ 
cies of the genus in Florida. In Mr. 
Hart’s garden at Federal Point, there is 
a fine large specimen which has proved 
entirely hardy and has never suffered 
from cold. It is almost stemless and 


consists of a number of short-stems 
flowering and fruiting regularly. 

Diplotkermum littorale, Mart., is also 
a species of the campos, like the former 
and would very likely prove equally 
hardy. 

Diplothemium maritumum, Mart, is a 
low-growing, fine, plume-leaved palm of 
the coast regions of Brazil, but I am not 
aware whether or not this has ever been 
introduced. 

Diplothemium caudescens, Mart., Cer- 
oxylon), is the most striking of all the 
species of this genus, being a common 
plant of the burning coast regions of 
Southern Brazil. The fruit hangs in 
yellow bunches just below the silvery 
undersurfaces of the leaves and the na¬ 
tives can easily refresh themselves with 
its sweet pulp, as the trunks never attain 
any great height. There was a fine 
young specimen before the freeze in the 
garden now known as “Bishopstead” in 
Orlando. When I saw it in November, 
1894, it was a picture of health and beau¬ 
ty—in fact, I have scarcely ever seen a 
more impressive and elegant palm. The 
arching pinnate leaves were about 8 to 10 
feet long and 2 feet broad and looked 
very massive and perfect. The upper- 
side showed a most distinct, deep glossy 
olive-green and the underside, a very con¬ 
spicuous silvery-white. The entire plant 
was about 10 to 12 feet high, but the 
trunk was only short and quite thick. 
There were other palms in this fine gar¬ 
den, but in point of beauty this was sec¬ 
ond to none. It was shaded by a large 
specimen of Bambusa spinosa, and near 
by was a large and dense specimen of 
Arabia papyri f era, the Japanese rice 
paper plant,, in full bloom. When I 



170 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


again visited the spot, several years later, 
all these plants were gone—whether de¬ 
stroyed by the freeze or removed to other 
quarters, I was unable to ascertain. To 
me, this palm looked as robust and hardy 
as Cocos Datil and C. australis. As all 
these palms will undoubtedly thrive in 
the orange belt, their introduction should 
be the aim of all lovers of palms and 
sub-tropical plants. They never grow 
tall and are, therefore, easily protected. 
A situation in full sun is essential to all 
of them. 

Jubaea spectabilis, Humboldt is the 
most southern of all palms, being found 
in Chili in latitude 40 degrees. This is 
the Coquito, or Monkey Cocoanut of the 
Chilians, and exceedingly massive and 
beautiful species in its young state, and 
one of the greatest ornaments of the gar¬ 
dens of California, Italy, Spain, Portugal 
and the Riviera, where it grows to per¬ 
fection. When grown to its full size 
it is, according to Darwin, who studied it 
in the highlands of the Andes, an ugly 
tree on acount of the very thick central 
part of the trunk. This palm is easily 
raised from seeds. Years ago, I plant¬ 
ed out quite a number of small plants 
with a lot of different species of Phoenix, 
Sabals and Cocos, but, while all the lat¬ 
ter have assumed glorious proportions, 
the Jubeas are still very small, though 
healthy. Those in full sun pined away, 
but others in rather shady positions un¬ 
der trees have remained perfectly healthy. 
The largest specimen is only 2j4 feet 
high. Perhaps, in richer and moister 
soils and in somewhat shady places, this 
palm, like the California Fan Palms, can 
be naturalized. 


IV. 

Tropical P'alms. 

I11 this connection I cannot refrain 
from quoting Charles Kingsley: “For it 
is a joy forever, a sight never to be for¬ 
gotten, to have once seen palms breaking 
through, and, as it were, defying the 
soft, rounded forms of the broad-leaved 
vegetation by the stern grace of their 
simple lines; the immovable pillar-stems, 
looking the more immovable beneath the 
toss, and lash, and flicker of the long 
leaves, as they awake out of their sun¬ 
lit sleep, and rage impatiently for awhile 
before the gusts, and fall asleep again. 
Like a Greek statute in a luxurious draw¬ 
ing room, sharp cut, cold, virginal, sham¬ 
ing, by the grandeur of mere form, the 
voluptuousness of mere color, however 
rich and harmonious; so stands the palm 
in the forest—to be worshipped rather 
than to be loved.” All the large palms, 
even our native palmetto, show this gran¬ 
deur. How I raved when I first saw the 
beautiful groves of palmettos on the far- 
famed St. John’s—called by the Indians 
more appropriately “Welaka”! How I 
I longed to own such a grove or to plant 
one with many different species when I 
meditated, in the cold winter days, of my 
northern home! And, since I have cast 
my lot on this peninsula, I have been 
fully aware of the fact that it can be 
done that there are many of the most 
beautiful and noble palms at our disposal 
to form earthly paradises. But palms, 
like princes, demand our attention and 
devotion, if they are expected to unfold 
all their beauty, elegance, grandeur and 
nobility. Plant them in your gardens 
and parks; surround your homes, be with

them, care for them in a proper way, and 
they will be a continuous source of the 
purest pleasure this life is able to give. 
They will be monuments to your memory 
long after you have gone and long after 
you have been forgotten. 

There are quite a number of tropical 
kinds that can be planted successfully 
wherever the orange, pomelo and lemon 
grow. I have already alluded to several 
such species, like Cocos plumosa, C. nu- 
cifera and others. The genus Acromia 
comprises a few such species which grow 
as far north as Winter Park and Lake 
Charm. They are all imposing and ele¬ 
gant palms, and the stems, as well as the 
leaves, are provided with numerous 
spines. All are common in the Amer¬ 
ican tropics and one species occurs as 
far South as Paraguay. This is Aero - 
comia Totai, Mart., a very fine and most 
elegant palm, being only sparingly found 
in a few of our best gardens. The first 
large specimens I saw in Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead’s garden, “Wait-a-bit,” at Lake 
Charm. The tallest and grandest are un¬ 
doubtedly found in the grounds of the 
Royal Palm Nurseries at Oneco, Fla. 
They are not quite as tall, but fully as 
beautiful as the tall specimens of Cocos 
plumosa standing not far from them. 
They have much more massive stems, 
however; the leaf-crown is denser and 
the leaves are shorter. I think Mr. 
Reasoner’s plants are about sixteen years 
old, having attained a height of about 
25 feet. They have grayish trunks, cov¬ 
ered with long, blackish, blunt spines, 
and the leaf-stalks, as well as the small 
leaflets, are covered on their underside 
with small, sharp, dark-brown thorns. 


This palm requires good, rich deep, ham¬ 
mock soil or flat-woods soil, but it will 
grow fairly well on high pine land if a 
rich compost and sufficient water is ap¬ 
plied. In Mr. Mead’s garden this spe¬ 
cies has endured a freeze of 18 degrees 
Fahrenheit, but it lost most of its fine, 
plume-like leaves, and, in my garden it 
has been subjected to almost the same cold 
without suffering much damage. It is 
one of the most common palms of Para¬ 
guay, where tons of its seeds are used 
in the manufacture of an excellent oil, 
and the meat of its nuts forms a favor¬ 
ite article of food among the Paraguay¬ 
ans. Mr. Mead deserves the thanks of 
all lovers of palms for the introduction 
of this fine species. Dr. Morong col¬ 
lected the seeds near Asuncion, and I 
think all our specimens were derived 
from these seeds. I do not think that the 
true A. Totai can be had in Florida to¬ 
day, but seeds could easily and in large 
quantities be imported from Asuncion, 
Paraguay. 

Aero comia sclerocarpa, Mart., the 
Groo-Groo Palm of the West Indies, is 
much more tropical and, therefore, very 
tender. Mr. Reasoner says that is is not 
hardy at Oneco, but it will unquestion¬ 
ably thrive in extreme South Florida. 
The same may be true of A. lasiospatha, 
Mart., the great Macau Palm of Vene¬ 
zuela, Colombia and Jamiaca. A. Mex- 
icana, Kano., from the cooler regions of 
Mexico up to 3,000 feet, will likely prove 
almost as hardy as A. Totai. It is a 
prickly palm, reaching 20 feet in height, 
growing in company of splendid Chae- 
madora Palms in the shade of oak- 
forests. (This may be identical with 
Astrocaryum Mexicanum, which see.)

Attalea. This genus of American 
palms comprises about twenty different 
species, but only two can be mentioned 
here, as they 'will very likely prove har¬ 
dy when having attained a certain size. 
These are large-leaved palms of noble as¬ 
pect when fully grown and very orna¬ 
mental when small. They are unarmed, 
with ringed stems and very long gigantic, 
plume-like leaves, the segments of which 
are regularly placed along the midrib and 
at right angles with it. There is a mag¬ 
nificent specimen of A. Cohune in Horti¬ 
cultural Hall, Philadelphia, which not 
yet has formed a trunk but with huge 
leaves fully 30 feet long, all pointing up¬ 
wards. The Attaleas require very rich 
and deep soil and a constant supply of 
water and protection from frost. 

Attalea Cohune Mart. Cohune. This 
is one of the most common as well as 
one of the most royal palms of the East 
Coast of Central America. The large 
seeds supply an oil of great purity and 
excellent flavor. Perhaps hardy from 
Palm Beach southward. 

Attalea compta, Mart., Pindova Palm 
a very common species in Southern 
Brazil, particularly near Blumenau 
where it is held in high esteem. It is 
a glory of the landscape and is called 
the Queen of Palms by the German 
settlers. Growing in the same region 
as Cocos Blumenavia, C. Gaertneri, C. 
Yatay, Diplothemium campestre and 
others, all perfectly hardy in our gar¬ 
dens, it will undoubtedly prove a most 
valuable acquisition to the orange belr. 
This beautiful palm should be intro¬ 
duced and largely planted in properly 
prepared soil in the full sun. A. Co¬ 
hune, which is one of Mr. Reasoner's 


stand-bys in his catalog, should also be 
experimented with more extensively. 
If well protected with moss and pine- 
boughs, particularly around the heart, 
it will endure an ordinary freeze of a 
few degrees unharmed. The stem 
should also be banked with dry soil. 
Older plants will very likely prove 
much hardier than small ones. Every 
effort should be made by our wide¬ 
awake nursery men to introduce the 
unrivalled A. compta. 

Astrocaryum is another genus of ex¬ 
quisite American palms, with long 
feathery leaves. They are all exceed¬ 
ingly spiny, the foliage even of young 
plants being covered on both sides with 
sharp spines. When large, every por¬ 
tion—the trunk, the leaves, the fruit- 
stalk and the flower-spathes—shows a 
thick covering of formidable thorns. 
But they all are extremely beautiful 
in spite of their repulsive armor. 

Astrocaryum Mexicanum, Liebm., is 
the only species that now and then can 
be bought in this country; all the 
others have to be raised from seed, 
which I usually receive in a fresh state 
from Hoage & Schmidt, Erfurt,' Ger¬ 
many. In its young state this species 
is quite tender, but when well estab¬ 
lished and in vigorous growth it can 
stand a few degrees of frost under a 
shed. My plant was raised from seed 
which ripened in Horticultural Hall, 
Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. It is a 
dwarf palm,from Mexico, the trunk 
never growing taller than four to six 
feet. On account of its small size it 
is easily protected in a severe cold. I 
hope that further experiments will 
show its adaptability to our soil and

climate. It may also prove hardy in 
dense hammock woods. 

In extreme South Florida the beau¬ 
tiful Muru-Muru Palm, Astro car yum 
murumuru, Mart., very likely will 
prove hardy in rich, half-shady spots. 
Like the Mexican species, it is a mar¬ 
vel of elegance, being of medium size— 
its ultimate height being about 12 to 
15 feet—and therefore easily protect¬ 
ed. The trunk is densely covered with 
stout black spines about six inches 
long. The fruit ripens in large bunches 
and the seed is enclosed in fleshy mass 
which is edible. In the different spe¬ 
cies this fruit varies from the size of 
a hickory nut to a hen’s egg. I had a 
few small plants, but they were killed 
outright in the big freeze of February, 
1895. 

.Acanthorhiza. Another genus of 
American palms with fan-shaped 
leaves. Only A. aculeata, Wendl. can 
be considered here. It is a native of 
Mexico and is quite hardy under ordi¬ 
nary circumstances and with slight 
protection during the winter months. 
It is easier lost during our drv sea- 
son than during the cold spells. The 
most conspicuous point in the charac¬ 
ter of this palm is the spine-like air- 
roots which are developed around the 
base of the trunk and which grow in 
an upward direction along the stem. 
Old trunks are entirely surrounded by 
a network of these spines which are 
of a blackish color. It will only grow 
in a moist soil, rich in leaf-mold, and 
in a rather shady position. This spe¬ 
cies is so interesting and unique in a 
collection that it should be introduced 
wherever choice palms are grown. 


Howcas. This genus is represented 
in our gardens by two species, usually 
known as Kentias, all from Lord 
Howe’s Island, namely Hozvea Balmo- 
reana, Becc. and H. Forsteriana , Becc. 
These two species beyond doubt are 
the most popular and satisfactory 
palms in the trade, being used largely 
for house-decoration in the north. Mr. 
J. D. Eisele, of the firm of H. A. Dreer, 
told me that they sow annually 75 
bushels of seeds of these two species. 
They seem to do very well in South 
California near the coast in shady po¬ 
sitions, but I have not been able to 
establish them in my garden. They 
g'rew for a while in my plant-shed, 
came unharmed through the winter, 
but were affected later with a fungus 
disease, and were pining away slowly. 
They are smooth-stemmed, pinnate 
palms of exceptional beauty'). The 
same applies to Hedyscepe Canter - 
bury ana, Wendl. and C lino stigma, 

Mooreanum, F. von Muller, coming 
from the same island. Mr. Theo. L. 
Mead tried to establish them in the 
shade of his hammock woods, 1 but 
without success. 

Ptychosperma. The palms of this 
genus were formerly known as Sea- 
forthias. They remind somewhat of 
the Kentias or Howeas but are taller 
and more massive, and they do exceed¬ 
ingly well in South Florida, at least the 
two species which are here only con¬ 
sidered. Years ago they were culti¬ 
vated to a greater extent than any 
other palms, but they have been su¬ 
perseded by the Howeas. They have 
beautiful, smooth trunks and magnif¬ 
icent crowns of long, feathery leaves. 





180 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Tall growing and fast growing species, 
they soon assume magnificent propor¬ 
tions. No other palms are used so 
much in pot and tub culture in Florida 
as are the Seaforthias, and they are en¬ 
tirely free of the fungus disease which 
makes the cultivation of the Howeas 
well-nigh impossible in our state. They 
need rich, moist soil and shady posi¬ 
tions. 

Ptychosperma C mining hami, Wendl., 
the real Seaforthia elegans, the Austra¬ 
lian Feather Palm, is perhaps more 
grown for ornamental purposes in 
Florida than any other palm—mostly 
in tubs. It is a native of East Austra¬ 
lia, as far south as Illawarra, thus being 
one of the most Southern of all palms. 
The beauty and grandeur of tall spe¬ 
cimens is indescribable. The experi¬ 
ments with exotic palms are still in 
their infancy in our state and, for this 
reason, specimen plants of Seaforthia 
elegans are very rare in the open air 
It is believed that it will not grow in 
Central Florida. There is a fine, tall 
specimen at Bradentown, south of the 
Manatee River. The Manatee at this 
point is about a mile broad and affords 

X 

excellent water protection for a host of 
tropical plants. Mr. Reasoner has 
hundreds of most beautiful plants of 
this species—all pot-grown—in his 
nursery at Oneco, many of them hav¬ 
ing stems six to ten feet high. He in¬ 
formed me that it is not quite hardy at 
Oneco, about six miles south of Bra¬ 
dentown. 

Ptychosperma Alexandrae, Ferd. 
von Muller, the Alexandra palm of 
Queensland, the tallest of the Austra¬ 
lian palms, and one of the noblest 


forms in the whole plant world. It 
attains to a height of ioo feet “and is 
likely destined to grace many shady, 
moist groves yet outside the tropics, 
so long as they are free from frost, as 
this palm seems less tender than most 
others.” This is undoubtedly a gem 
for such places as Palm Beach, Miami 
and other places in extreme South 
Florida. 

Elaeis. This genus of tropical, 
feathery palms is entirely thornless. It 
consists of about six or seven species, 
one from Western Africa, and the rest 
from tropical America. 

Elaeis Guineensis, Jacq., the Oil Palm 
of Western Africa, one of the most use¬ 
ful of all plants, has been ascertained 
to be hardy in South Florida, where it 
has withstood several degrees of cold 
unharmed. It does not attain any 
great height, not more than 20 or 30 
feet. The trunks are thick and are 
covered with the remains of the stalks 
of the dead leaves. Below the large 
tuft of prickly-stalked leaves are to be 
seen the dense heads of vermilion or 
yellowish fruits. The palm oil is ob¬ 
tained from the outer fleshy coating— 
not from the kernels—of the fruit, by 
boiling in water and skimming off the 
oil. It is of bright orange-red color, 
with the consistence of butter, and 
when quite fresh has a pleasant odor 
like violets. It is used in the man¬ 
ufacture of soap and candles and is 
exported in immense quantities. The 
very elegant, rather upright or slightly 
recurved, deep green leaves are 10 to 
15 feet long. In all its stages the Oil 
Palm is one of the most ornamental 
and lovely. 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

Mr. Charles T. Simpson of Little 
River, near Miami, writes me under 
date of June 27, 1909.. as follows: 
“Elaeis Guineensis, nine feet high and 
12 feet across, is now in bloom, male 
flowers in one head, females in anoth¬ 
er, as large as a child’s head. It is said 
to bear lovely red fruits.” 

This is very important news, show¬ 
ing that this exquisite palm is hardy 
and can be grown in the southern part 
of our state. Further investigation 
may prove that it can possibly be 
grown much further north. 

Copernicia. This is a small genus of 
fan-leaved palms allied to the Thrin- 
axes, all natives of Southern Brazil and 
Paraguay. They need for their culture 
a rich, moist soil in the full sun. 

Corpernicia cerifera, Mart., the Car- 
anda of Brazil, and the Palma negra of 
Paraguay, is a fine fan-palm, growing 
30 to 45 feet high with a full crown of 
distinct leaves. This species, known 
also as the Wax Palm, is hardy in the 
Riviera and will undoubtedly prove a 
valuable garden palm for the orange- 
belt, if seeds are imported from its 
southernmost habitat, Paraguay. It 
abounds there in great numbers along 
the banks of the Pilcomayo River, and 
throughout the Gran Chaco. When 
young the stem is covered below with 
the bases of the petioles, but these fall 
off at maturity, leaving the trunk bare 
and smooth. Wood dense, hard and 
black, forming a valuable timber which 
is used all over Paraguay for rafters 
and fence posts. The leaves are cov¬ 
ered with a white waxy substance, 
which is scraped or shaken off, and 
made into the well-known carnawba- 


wax. “This species,” says Dr. Mo¬ 
rong, “is considered, with good reason, 
one of the most valuable trees in Para¬ 
guay. Not only does it furnish strong, 
durable timber and wax, but its ber¬ 
ries are eaten by the Indians, the ten¬ 
der vertex of the caudex makes an ad¬ 
mirable cabbage and its leaves are em¬ 
ployed for various purposes, such as 
thatching, making fans, strawbraid, 
thread, fishing lines, cordage and the 
like.” 

I am not aware that this species is 
in cultivation in Florida at present, and 
the only specimen I ever saw grew in 
my own garden for about ten years. 
It was an exceedingly slow grower on 
high pine land, but would undoubtedly 
have grown much faster in rich, moist 
soil. To such a position I removed it 
in April—just at a time when the dry 
season held full sway—but I lost it. 

Dr. Morong describes two new and 
entirely distinct species from the same 
region— Capcrnicia alba , Morong and 
C. rubra , Morong. Both are beautiful 
and both will very likely do well in 
South Florida. The first one is a rath¬ 
er low palm, frequently not over 10 
feet high and seldom reaching a height 
of 30 feet. The crown is much larger 
than in C. cerifera, containing many 
more leaves. The wood is nearlv 
worthless. In C rubra the trunk is 
clothed nearly to the top with the old 
leaf-stalks, never smooth as in C. cer¬ 
ifera, and always much thicker. The 
leaf-crown is large and round and Aery 
beautiful. For ornamental purposes 
these two new species will be great ac¬ 
quisitions to our gardens and should be 
introduced.

Thrinax. Allied to the former. All 
beautiful and exceedingly elegant 
American fan-leaved palms of rather 
small size and slow growth, succeeding 
finely in South Florida, particulailv 
along the East Coast from Palm Beach 
southward. Of this genus about io 
species are known to science, six of 
them occuring wild in Florida. 

Thrinax Florid ana, Sargent, a slen¬ 
der palm, becoming about 30 feet tall 
and the trunk about six inches in diam¬ 
eter. The leaves are beautiful yellow¬ 
ish-green and lustrous above, silvery- 
white beneath. The flowers are pun¬ 
gent aromatic. It naturally grows 011 
the sandy shores and coral-ridges of 
South Florida and the Keys. 

Thrinax microcar pa, Sargent, also in 
dry coral soil of the same region, has 
leaves about three feet in diameter, 
pale green above and glaucous under¬ 
neath. It grows about 35 feet high. 
Also a very elegant palm. 

Thrinax Kcyensis, Sargent. In its 
native haunts, the Florida Keys, this 
fine species attains a height of about 30 
feet, “raised on a base of matted roots 
sometimes about one meter high/” 
Leaves longer than broad, about three 
feet in diameter, glossy yellowish- 
green above, and bluish-green and 
more -or less covered with silvery- 
white hairs beneath. Flowers faintly 
aromatic. 

Thrinax Garberi, Chapin. (Coccc- 
thrinax Garberi Sargent) common on 
dry coral ridges along Biscayne Bay. 
Almost stemless, with yellowish-green 
leaves, silvery underneath. 

Thrinax argentea Chapin, (Cocothri 
nax jucunda, Sargent). Also occurring 


on dry coral ridges of South Florida. 
Stem from 10 to 25 feet high. The 
crown consists of numerous yellowish- 
green, glossy leaves, glaucous on the 
underside. One of the most beautiful 
species of the genus, being also com¬ 
mon in the West Indies. These are all 
hardy in South Florida and are 
easily grown. There are very fine 
West Indian species which will do 
equally well where the others find 
soil and climate congenial. The fol¬ 
lowing are offered by Mr. E. N. Rea- 
soner, of Oneco, Fla.: Thrinax Bar- 
badensis, Lodd. from Barbadoes, “one 
of the handsomest of all small fan 
palms. Each specimen carries a full 
head of fine leaves and is always a fine 
object.” Never seems to grow tall. 
Thrinax excelsa, Lodd. from Jamaica 
and Thr. parviflora Swz., from the Ba¬ 
hamas. Both are very elegant species, 
the last named attaining a height of 10 
to 20 feet. Thrinax Morrisii Wendl., 
a native of Anguilla, is a dwarf, never 
over two and one-half feet tall in its 
native state. Very beautiful. Mr. C. 
T. Simpson, of Little River on Bis¬ 
cayne Bay, has all these species in cul¬ 
tivation and he writes that they are 
doing finely. 

Oreo do xa. The Royal Palms. “The 
American Palms,” writes Dr. Berthold 
Seemann, alluding* to the Oredoxas, 
“may be said, to have been anxious to 
appear to the best advantage, when 
they were about to form the ac¬ 
quaintance of those who were about 
to seek a new world in the west. They 
placed on the very threshold of their 
native country several representatives, 
which, in elegance and majesty of form

are equalled by few and surpassed by 
scarcely any of the whole order of 
palms. Even ere the anxious voyager 
has set his foot on shore, he has al¬ 
ready perceived their graceful foliage 
fluttering in the breeze, and waving, 
as it were, a hearty welcome to the 
newly-arriving steamer. Since the time 
when Columbus first discovered the 
West Indian Isles to the present day, 
these palms have been seen and ad¬ 
mired by all who possess an eye for 
the beautiful.” 

Oreodoxa regia , Kunth., the true 
Royal Palm, the Palma real of Cuba, 
is regarded the most beautiful, most 
imposing and noblest of all palms for 
ornamental planting in the tropics. The 
grand avenue of these palms at Boto- 
fago, the Botanical garden near Rio de 
Janeiro, has a world-wide fame. It is 
the avenue palm of Honolulu and other 
places in Hawaii, and figures in almost 
all photographs of the sceneries of 
these islands. It is likewise largely 
planted at Paradenyia, Ceylon, and at 
Buitenzorg*, Java—two of the world’s 
most famous botanical gardens. The 
Royal Palm is a native of Florida, be¬ 
ing found quite abundantly in the Ever¬ 
glades, where it forms trunks 50 to 60 
feet high, bearing magnificent crowns 
of very long feathery leaves. It is 
found sparingly along the lower Kis¬ 
simmee and on the Caloosahatchee, and 
is said to have grown as far north as 
the Manatee River. In fact the Royal 
Palm Nurseries at Oneco were named 
by the lamented Mr. P. W. Reasoner 
after these magnificent and beautiful 
palms. It is much planted around 
Biscayne Bay, at Fort Myers, Punta 


Gorda and Bradentown, and it invar¬ 
iably forms imposing specimens in a 
few years if planted on hammock and 
low land. It will not grow on high, 
dry pine land. Mr. E. N. Reasoner 
says “that it has immense, plumy, 
feathery leaves and a straight, white 
trunk.” “It is a good tree,” he con¬ 
tinues, “for extreme South Florida for 
avenue planting, and is valuable in all 
sizes, but especially when four feet or 
over in height.” The late Mr. P. W. 

Reasoner mentions in one of his arti- 

% 

cles a place which was known as Palma 
Sola, where two very tall and noble 
specimens grew which could be seen 
far out in the gulf. One winter a few 
vandals cut down these trees wantonly, 
which had been landmarks for centu¬ 
ries—the most northern of its habitat. 
In Orlando, where so many northern 
plant and flower-lovers have their win¬ 
ter homes, I have never seen the Roy¬ 
al Palm in the gardens, and I do not 
think that it will be entirely hardy so 
far north. It can, however, stand a 
few degrees of cold unharmed, suffer¬ 
ing less than the Cocoanut Palm, It 
is entirely smooth all over, being not 
provided with spines or thorns as many 
other palms. It also occurs abundant¬ 
ly in Cuba, Antigua, etc. 

Oredoxa oleracca Mart., the Royal 
Cabbage Palm, the Palmiste of Ja¬ 
maica, is one of the most common 
palms of the West Indies with trunks 
100 to 120 feet high. 

Oredoxa Borinquena, the Porto Rico 
Royal Palm, differs from the Florida 
species in being still more vigorous and 
more stocky. Mr. C. T. Simpson in¬ 
forms me that all these species do well

on Biscayne Bay, requiring hammock 
and lowland soil. 

Pritchardia. Most beautiful, medi¬ 
um-sized fan-leaved palms from the 
islands of the South Pacific. They are 
very tender and will not be hardy north 
of the most southernmost point of 
Florida. Mr. Chas. T. Simpson writes 
me that he has lost his small specimens 
so often that he is not much encour¬ 
aged. Perhaps they will endure such a 
freeze as may occur on Biscayne Bay 
without much harm, when they are 
larger. As far as I know, only the fol¬ 
lowing three species have been or are 
still in cultivation in South Florida: 

Pritchardia Pacifica, Seem, and 
Wendl ., from Samoa and Fiji. Trunk 
grows about 30 feet high. Pritchardia 
Gaudichaudii, Wendl , and P. Martii, 
both from the Hawaiian Islands, are 
rather small species, the first reaching 
ultimately a height of 20 feet, the sec¬ 
ond having a trunk not exceeding five 
to six feet ; all are exceedingly elegant 
and are well worth a little extra care 
to protect them from cold when neces¬ 
sary. They need rich, moist soil and 
some shade. The fierce rays of the 
sun are as obectionable to them as a 
cold spell. 

Licuala. An allied genus of most ex¬ 
quisite fan-leaved palms from the 
tropical islands of the Pacific, requiring 
the same care as the Pritchardias. 

Licuala grandis, Wendl., from New 
Britain, is one of the most beautiful 
palms in the world and without doubt 
the most royal of all fan-leaved spe¬ 
cies. It is not so long ago that a 
well developed speciman was sold in- 
England for $1,000. At present, seeds 


of this species, as well as of many other 
tropical palms, can be easily obtained 
from Trinidad. Mr. Eugene Andre, 
the celebrated naturalist and explor¬ 
er, grows quite a number of the grand¬ 
est tropical palms in his garden near 
Port of Spain. From him I received a 
few years ago, a number of seeds which 
all sprouted. The young seedlings 
have endured the cold of the two la^t 
winters without harm, and are now 
growing finely. They were protected 
during cold weather with pine boughs. 
This seems to indicate that this spe¬ 
cies and L. pelt at a , Roxb.. of India may 
grow out of doors in extreme South 
Florida. They evidently are small or 
medium-sized palms and the leaves are 
rather delicate and are easily injured. 

Brahea. Allied to the two former 
genera, but with much more rigid, fan- 
leaves and short, massive trunks. Bra¬ 
hea dulcis, Mart., Palma dulce of Mex¬ 
ico, where it ascends mountains up ’o 
4,500 feet, is perfectly hardy in the 
orange-belt of Flarida, and a very noble 
and distinct species. The stem in full- 
grown specimens is about 10 to 20 feet 
high, and the leaves are from 4 to 5 feet 
long. It demands a rich soil, mixed 
with some clay. I had a fine specimen 
about 5 or 6 feet high which grew in full 
sun in a rather dry place. It withstood the 
severe cold of 1899, but was destroyed 
by a forest fire. I have not been able since 
to replace it or to obtain any other of the

of spines that we have to handle them 
with care in order to avoid the serious 
injury that may be inflicted by them. 
Often they grow in tufts or big clumps, 
making it impossible to penetrate the 
forest. The genus consists of about a 
hundred species. Though many of them 
are ornamental and would form inter¬ 
esting objects in our sub-tropical gar¬ 
dens, they are little grown on account of 
their spines. They all have plume-like 
leaves. Many of the species are coarse 
in appearance and not worth growing, 
■others are extremely beautiful. They are 
found in all kinds of situations, wet and 
dry. Most of the species have their 
whip-like stems, as well as the leaves 
and flower-spathes, covered with spines. 
They are the terror of the naturalist 
who has to enter the undergrowth of 
the forest. I have only grown Badris 
Binoti, from South Brazil, and B. bacu- 
lifera, both seemingly horticultural names 
without botanical foundation. The most 
common species is B. horrida, Ocrst, 
from Nicaragua, a rather beautiful, 
small palm, growing in tufts about 6 to 8 
feet high. They have extremely spiny 
leaves, leaf-stalks, trunks and flower- 
spathes, and would make impenetrable 
live fences if it would prove hardy. 

I will close this chapter with one of 
the most beautiful and noble of palms, 
Areca Catechu Linn., the Areca or Betel- 
nut Palm, which has a lofty, straight and 
very slender stem. For this reason the 
Hindoo poets speak of it as “an arrow 
shot from Heaven.” 

“The flowers are deliciously fragrant; 


they are in request for all festive occa¬ 
sions and are also considered a necessary 
ingredient in the medicines and charms 
employed in the healing of the sick; their 
delightful perfume, together with a 
graceful, feathery foliage, borne on a 
slender and elegantly tapered stem, ren¬ 
ders this tree the universal favorite among 
the palm tribe.” (Hugh Low, “Sar¬ 
awak”). 

The fruit is about the size of a small 
hen’s egg, of an orange color, and hangs 
in large bunches below the dark green 
leaves. The outer part of the fruit is 
hard and fibrous, then comes the shell, 
enclosing the kernel of the betel-nut. It 
is for this that the palm is so extensively 
cultivated in the Malay Archipelago, and 
the practice of chewing it is universal 
amongst the natives. The nut is cut in¬ 
to narrow strips and rolled up with a lit¬ 
tle lime in the leaves of the betel pepper. 
The pellet, though acid to the taste, is 
aromatic and astringent and the mastica¬ 
tion is considered wholesome. The na¬ 
tives would rather forego meat and drink 
than their favorite Areca-nut. The 
commerce in the nut is enormous. 

I can only say that this glorious and 
celebrated palm may do well in extreme 
South Florida where the Royal Palm 
flourishes. I do not know whether or 
not an attempt has ever been made to 
introduce it to Florida, but is should be 
done. If it will succeed, it is an acquisi¬ 
tion of the greatest value, on account of 
its nobility and its extremely fragrant 
powers.

By Henry S. Pennock. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Most of the ornamentals used about 
Palm Beach are more or less of a trop¬ 
ical nature and so they suffer more or 
less when we have a freeze. The cocoa- 
nut palm which is used a great deal for 
avenue work and is a magnificent thing 
for such, suffers badly and so some 
people are planting the date palm in its 
stead, the particular variety being the 
canariensis. And another thing in favor 
of the date palm is, it is a slower grower 
and so does not have the long spindly 
trunk the cocoanut would have in fifteen 
or twenty years. The royal palm is used 
for single specimens and among the 
smaller the sago palm holds first place 
and I do not think there is anything 
finer than a large, handsome one placed 
by itself on a well kept lawn. The 
borbonica is used somewhat. 

Among the trees that are used are the 
Australian pines and oaks, the latter 
were planted along most of the streets 
of West Palm Beach a few years ago, 
they are doing quite well. I am trying 
a few trees of the California beefwood, 
in the description I read of them it said 
they would make a good growth in the 
poorest kind of soil, I thought they ought 
to suit me pretty well and also they would 
grow where the salt spray was blown on 
them. I got them last summer and so 
far they are doing all right. The two va¬ 
rieties I have are Casuarina Stricta and 
C. Equisetifolia. The sapodilla, rose 
apple, rubber tree, banyan, mango, avoca¬ 
do, umbrella tree and royal poinciana 
are all used singly and they all make a 


very nice lawn tree. Some consider the 
royal poinciana the handsomest tree 
that grows, it certainly is fine when it is 
in bloom with its bunches of scarlet 
flowers. 

Of the bushes the oleander and hibis¬ 
cus are seen the most, they are both such 
fine bloomers, the hibiscus is especially 
so, blooming all year. The oleander is 
used a good deal for windbreaks, it grow¬ 
ing fifteen feet or more high. The phy- 
lanthus or snow bush is the prettiest 
shrub that we have and it is used a great 
deal for walk borders, its red and white 
variegated and green and white leaves 
make a very dainty, delicate effect. The 
red variegated acalypha is liked very well 
too, it grows higher getting six and eight 
feet high. Crape myrtle, bamboos, dwarf 
hydrangea, cattley guava, sisil, panda- 
nus utilis and veitchii, auricaria and ca- 
rissa arduina are used singly and in 
groups. We have a few plants of the 
carissa arduina and we like it very well 
for a hedge plant, it grows well in poor 
dry sand and its glossy green leaves look 
well all the year, at this time of the 
year it bears a star shaped white flower. 
I think if it was planted close enough it 
would turn cattle as it is quite thorny. 

There is nothing that quite equals the 
bougainvilla among the climbers, with its 
masses of purple flowers it makes a mag¬ 
nificent sight. I was told by a gentleman 
living in Eau Gallie that he had one Out¬ 
side and that it was doing very well, 
everybody should have one. A bougain¬ 
villa on one side of a pergola or an 
arbor with an allamanda on the other 
makes an effect that is hard to excel, 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


187 


the yellow flowers of the alamanda and 
the purple of the bougainvilla go so well 
together. The rosa de Montana makes a 
very pretty thing with its pink flowers 
most all the year. The clerodendron 
balfouri, I don’t know any other name 
for it, is another very nice vine, it is a 
strong grower and has red and white 
flowers. 

Of the bedding plants the crotons are 
the most important, and what a hand¬ 
some bed you can make with them, there 
is such a great variety of shapes and col¬ 
ors. A bed of crotons not planted too 
close together with some thing green be¬ 
tween, something that does not grow too 
high, like sprengerii or the Boston ferns 
makes a very pretty bed and one that 
will almost take care of itself. The 
sprengerii and ferns are used a great 
deal for house plants, for jardinieres, 
there is nothing better though for this 
purpose than the pandanus veitchii with 
its long striped green and white leaves. 
I have heard it stated that a pandanus 
will stand more tough treatment than a 
mule. The New Zealand wax, wander¬ 
ing jew, poinsettia, dwarf hydrangea 
and crinum are some more very nice 
small plants. Prof. Rolfs told me he 
had seen the crinum as far north as Mel¬ 
bourne on the East Coast. It certainly 
is a thing everyone should have, it is a 
bulbous plant and is not particular as 
to soil, it is fine when in flower, the flow¬ 
ers are large and white of an umbel for¬ 
mation and the leaves are long and green 
usually drooping to the ground. 

I want to say a few words about some¬ 
thing that can hardly be called an orna¬ 
mental and that is the Florida packing¬ 
house. I have often wondered of the 
hundreds of packing-houses in Florida 


how many of them are a pleasure to look 
at, and yet why not ? Let us figure a lit¬ 
tle on how much more it#would cost to 
make the packing-house look good instead 
of looking bum. The roof and floor 
would be about the same in any case, so 
what we have to consider are the sides 
and ends. The cheapest way of making 
the sides, by using upright boards with 
or without battens would cost three to 
four dollars per square, next, using sid¬ 
ing would make it four to five dollars per 
square and if it is to last more than ten 
or twelve years it will have to be paint¬ 
ed every three years which will be a dol¬ 
lar and a half per square more each time. 
Now if shingles are used, number threes 
will last about fifty years on the side of 
the building, the cost would be with a 
little extras, like better fixed windows, 
about six to seven dollars per square or 
the difference between a bum looking 
packing-house and a good looking pack¬ 
ing-house would be about three dollars 
and a half per square; in a house 25x50 
where there are about thirteen squares the 
total difference would be fifty dollars. 
But if you want to really make it in keep¬ 
ing with the orange grove make it of ce¬ 
ment, this would cost from about fifteen 
to twenty dollars per square. 

Prof. Rolfs—We have to be chary 
about planting the sago palm because it 
is quite susceptible to a certain fungus 
which attacks it and causes what is 
known as “sun scald” to the leaves. This 
has happened quite frequently and you 
must go very slow unless you have close 
and compact soil in which to plant the 
sago palm. Of course, we all know it 
is not really a sago palm, as it belongs 
to an entirely different family. For this 
fungus disease there is no remedy.

SECRETARY’S REPORT. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Your secretary regrets to report that 
the number of renewals of membership 
has not been as great at the present time 
as in previous years. Owing to the fact 
that last year there were not sufficient 
funds raised to meet the expenses and a 
deficiency of $264.67 was carried over, 
which, taken from the amount already 
received leaves only a small amount in 
the treasury.

Since the meeting in 1908 the Society 
is greatly indebted to Mr. E. H. Mote of 
Leesburg, who took special interest in the 


society and sent in over one hundred new 
names from Leesburg and vicinity and is 
still showing his interest in getting many 
to renew this season. 

Mr. Howard Y. Stillman, chairman of 
the local committee in Daytona, has also 
done splendid work and has turned in 
seventy-one new names, and I understand 
there are still more to come. If he keeps 
up his present good work he will soon lie 
on a par with Mr. Mote. 

Your Secretary also wishes to report 
that the newspapers have as a rule, been 
very liberal in publishing notices of 
meeting and I wish to especially mention 
the Times-Union, The Florida Fruit and 
Produce News and the Daytona Halifax 
Journal. 

We have also received donations to¬ 
wards expenses from Mrs. Jane Cadliff, 
$1: John Kendig, $2; C. M. Griffin, $5. 
All of which is respectfully submitted. 

E. O. Painter, Secretary. 

Note: Since the meeting at Daytona, 
131 members have been added to our 
list and one life member, so that at 
the time of going to press our member¬ 
ship is as follows:

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The Executive Committee met in the 
Secretary’s office on July 8. Messrs. 
Rolfs, Tabor, Hubbard, Stevens and 
Painter were present. The Secretary re¬ 
ported a collection of $179 since the last 
meeting. Moved that the proceedings of 
the meeting held' in Gainesville last May 
be printed in the usual form. Bills for 
stenographer, printing, etc., were audited 
and ordered paid. Moved that the mak¬ 
ing up of the standing committees be re¬ 
ferred to the president and secretary with 
power to act. Meeting adjourned. 

The Executive Committee meeting of 
tne Florida State Horticultural Society 
was held at the Secretary’s office on 
March 5, 1909. Members present were 
Messrs. Stevens, Tabor, Hubbard and 
Secretary Painter. It was moved and 
seconded that Mr. H. Y. Stillman, of 
Daytona, be appointed chairman of local 
committee with three local members to as¬ 
sist him. He was requested to secure 
special rates for members to attend the 
meeting at Daytona. 


It was moved that the committee on 
legislation be notified of the desire of the 
society to have a bill presented before the 
legislature to have sufficient funds ap¬ 
propriated to print the proceedings and 
bear some of the expenses that will bur¬ 
den the usefulness of the society. The 
meeting adjourned. 

The Executive Committee met in ses¬ 
sion at Daytona, May 20, 1909; present 
Messrs. Hubbard, Stevens, Hart and 
Painter. The treasurer’s and secretary’s 
accounts were audited and found correct. 

The committee appointed Mr. W. S. 
Hart a committee of one to telegraph 
Hon. F. W. Sams and Mr. Thos. Palmer 
at Tallahassee to use their best efforts in 
securing an appropriation of one thou¬ 
sand dollars instead of six hundred dol¬ 
lars as had been reported by the senate 
committee. 

As shown by the treasurer’s and secre¬ 
tary’s reports, the amount of cash on hand 
is small and inadequate to print and dis¬ 
tribute our proceedings, but it is not 
thought best to ask members to make do-

nations towards the printing until it is 
ascertained what is done with the bill 
that is now before the senate. If the bill 
does not appropriate sufficient funds to 
take care of the publication, it will be 
necessary for the members to increase 


their contributions in order to furnish 
funds for publication. 

All of which is respectfully submitted, 

E. S. Hubbard, 

H. B. Stevens, 

G. L. Tabor. 


Necrology. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Your committee upon whom devolves 
the painful duty herewith furnished con¬ 
densed data in relation to esteemed mem¬ 


WM. H. 

Wm. H. Rankin was born in Spring- 
field, Ill., January 22, 1836. His early 
home was next door to that of the Lin¬ 
colns. He lived there until 1845 w h etl 
his family moved to Monmouth, Ill., 
where he gained his early education and 
later engaged in business, which he con¬ 
tinued until 1898, when he sold out and 
moved to Punta Gorda, Fla., where he

made his home until a few months prior to 
his death. He died in Chicago, on Feb¬ 
ruary 20, 1909, and was laid to rest in 
the cemetery at Monmouth, Ill. His 
wife, Mary T. Rankin, and four children 
survive him and this society joins with 
them in the sense of loss of an honorable, 
upright man. 


HERMAN LUBRECHT. 


Herman Lubrecht was born in Ger¬ 
many, 1847, an d died at Island Grove, 
Fla., in April, 1909. He came to Amer¬ 
ica in 1882 and was engaged in business 
in New York City. About 1890 he came 
to Island Grove, and with some New 
York parties started in the nursery busi¬ 
ness. He was much interested in citrus 
and other tropical fruits and carried out 
many experiments. He had started a 


fine citrus grove which was killed back 
by the cold during the winter of 1894 and 
1895. A s a means of protecting citrus 
trees against cold, he was the first to erect 
a shed over his grove. This shed covered 
four and one-half acres. 

Mr. Lubrecht was a fine type of Ger¬ 
man-American citizen and was highly es¬ 
teemed by all who knew him. He had 
never married.

WILLIAM THOMAS HILDRUP. 


William Thomas Hildrup was born 
January 6, 1822, at Middletown, Conn., 
where he spent the first 19 years of his 
life, and received his education. He 
started out in life as a carpenter, studied 
mechanics and rose rapidly from one po¬ 
sition to another. While still compar¬ 
atively young, he was made superintend¬ 
ent of the Bradley & Rice car works at 
Cape Cincent, N. Y. In 1852, he estab¬ 
lished a car wheel factory at Elmira, N. 
Y., and a year later, moved to Harris¬ 
burg, Pa., and organized a Harrisburg 
Car Manufacturing Company. During the 
war, he aided in supplying the govern¬ 
ment with horses. He also ran the first 
train over the Baltimore and Ohio Rail¬ 
road, after the battle of Antietam. He 
was active in the organization of the 
First National Bank and The Common¬ 


wealth Trust Company, of Harrisburg, 
and was a director in each of them. He 
was, for many years, a warden and ves¬ 
tryman of St. Stevens Episcopal Church, 
of Harrisburg. 

Mr. Hildrup had for some years past, 
a winter residence at Welaka, Fla., at 
which place he passed away on January 
21, 1909, at the ripe age of 87 years, 
and was interred in the family vault in 
Harrisburg, Pa. His wife Emma J. Hil¬ 
drup survives him. He was a man of un¬ 
usual ability and will be missed by a host 
of friends. 


All of which is respectfully submitted,

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

By E. H. Mote. 


Hon.- 

Washington, D. C.: 

Dear Sir—As our representative in the 
councils o'f our government, we wish to 
call your serious attention to the following 
preambles and resolutions, assuring you it 
is a matter of the utmost importance to all 
growers of the Citrus fruits in Florida, 
which is one, if not the most important in¬ 
dustries in the district you represent in 
Congress: 

Whereas, The orange growers of 
Florida are annually suffering the loss of 
many thousands of dollars in the reduc¬ 
tion of their fruit crop and still more in 
the market value of their groves through 
a disease knows as orange tree blight, 
which usually selects the largest and 
most productive tree for the attack; and 
Whereas, Though the disease has been 
carefully studied for many years by very 
able department experts, it is not yet 
well enough known to allow of its posi¬ 
tive identification, in many cases, before 
the second or third year after its appear¬ 
ance, while investigations pretty surely 
prove that the disease is contagious, which 
mlakes eadh diseased tree a nucleus from: 
which it is carried to others when caring 
for or working the grove; and 

Whereas, Progress has been made 
that encourages the belief that if addition¬ 
al help with special fitness can be sent here 
and allowed to devote their whole time 
assisting in this select work, we have rea¬ 
son to hope that the cause may be found 
for it; therefore be it 

Resolved, That the secretary of this 
society be instructed to correspond with 


the Florida representatives in Washing¬ 
ton and earnestly request them to call 
upon the Secretary of Agriculture, Hon. 
Wilson, and urge upon him the impor¬ 
tance of this work and the pressing need 
that we feel for further assis¬ 
tance from his department be it further 

Resolved, That each member of this 
society exert his or her influence as an in¬ 
dividual to secure increased appropriation 
for this work and its more vigorous prose¬ 
cution.” 

We wish to say further, relative to 
above actions of the Florida State Horti¬ 
cultural Society that this society, being 
composed largely of people who are ex¬ 
clusively engaged in cultivating the cit¬ 
rus fruits, have become alarmed at the 
persistence with which this new menace to 
our groves, defies our individual efforts 
to find a remedy that will check its further 
spread into- new territory, and finally 
eradicate it entirely. We are of the be¬ 
lief that this cannot be done by individual 
effort, owing primarily, to* the lack of au¬ 
thority of die individuals to push inquiry 
on the premises of those whose groves are 
affected, which is apt to be resented as a 
probable loss of value in grove property. 
We feel that we should move cautiously 
in the matter, so as not to bring unneces¬ 
sary hardship on the unfortunate grower, 
unless it be absolutely necessary to do so 
in the interest of the State at large. This 
action should properly be taken up' by the 
department of agriculture, competent 
experts should be sent here with authority 
to investigate exhaustively, the origin of 
this disease, whether it is curable where 




194 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


it already exists, and 1 preventable in 
groves not yet attacked and especially to 
determine authoritatively, if it is contag¬ 
ious. 

When this preliminary work is _done 
so as to give definite and authoritative 
basis to work upon, we will then invoke, 
through this State to carry into effect any 
precautionary or suppressive mease r ' 
that the Department of Agriculture may 
suggest for the extermination of this dis¬ 
ease. 

It may be possible the Department of 
Agriculture cannot take up this much 
needed work without a specific appropria¬ 
tion for the purpose. If this is true, we 
urge you to use every legitimate effort to 
have such appropriation placed in some of 
the pending bills now before this Con¬ 
gress, so that this work may start at the 
earliest possible date. 

In urging the consideration of our ap¬ 
peal for aid in this difficulty ; we respect¬ 
fully call attention to' the fact that some 
fifteen years ago- the orange industry sus¬ 
tained a crushing calamity that for the 
time amounted to the total destruction, 
when it was generally believed that the 
orange industry in Florida was perman¬ 
ently destroyed and would never again 
become a paying enterprise. While this 
calamity was State-wide, falling on. the 
rich and poor alike, and deserved to be 
classed with other “visitations of God,” as 
floods, conflagrations and earthquakes, 
that invariably call forth the sympathy 


and bounteous contributions not only of 
the charitable individuals and societies, 
but the generous and substantial find c A 
aid of the Government at Washington, it 
is a matter of pride to the people of Flor¬ 
ida that they never appealed to the citi¬ 
zens nor the Government for anything but 
sympathy, and even that appeal was si¬ 
lent and unspoken. Thousands of men, 
who had been reduced from moderate fi- 
uanlcial independence to beggary in aj 
single night, by an overwhelming disaster 
that no effort or foresight on their part 
could avert or alleviate patiently and 
uncomplainingly went to work to renew 
again their groves and bring prosperity 
again to* an industry that is rapidly build¬ 
ing up the waste places and adding several 
millions of dollars, as well as many thou¬ 
sand's of settlers to the State; which is 
rapidly taking rank and influence among 
the States in the production of world-wide 
necessities, as well as the luxuries of life. 

Such moderate aid as we now ask has 
been generously extended to California in 
the propagation of the fig and orange in¬ 
dustry and other States in the protection 
of peach orchards from destruction 
through contagious diseases that could 
not be controlled by individual effort, 
which, when backed by the police p wer c 
these industries and added immensely to 
the taxable values, and also to the peace 
of these States, has brought prosperity to 
and prosperity of the State.

FINAL RESOLUTIONS. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Whereas, The members of the Florida 
State Horticultural Society in its twenty- 
second annual session have been so well 
entertained and so well cared for by the 
citizens of Daytona and in view of the 
courtesies extended to us by the people of 
Daytona, 

Resolved, That we wish to thank the 
citizens of Daytona for our royal enter¬ 
tainment, for a very pleasant and enter¬ 
taining morning and the best of dinners; 
also to the good people of New Smyrna 
who aided in making the “clam chowder” 
lunch at the Sams House so thoroughly 
enjoyable and otherwise helped to make 
the occasion a pleasant one. 

Resolved Further, That we wish es¬ 
pecially to thank the ladies of Daytona 
for their very thoughtful and unique aft¬ 
ernoon’s entertainment of our lady mem¬ 
bers, our sisters, daughters and wives at 
the charming home of the Palmetto Club. 

Resolved, Further, That we wish to 
acknowledge the very efficient work for 
and interest in, our entertainment dis¬

Proceedings of the Twenty-third 
Annual Meeting of the Florida 
State Horticultural Society 


For the Twenty-third time, The Flor¬ 
ida State Horticultural Society assembled 
in annual convention, at the Gem City of 
Orlando, with headquarters at the San 
Juan Hotel. 

Orlando has entertained the Horticul¬ 
tural Society on two other occasions and 
this time the good people showed 
themselves no less hospitable and endeav¬ 
ored to make the Horticulturalists feel 
thoroughly at home and gave them such 
entertainment as the program and time 
allotted would allow. The special fea¬ 
ture of the entertainment was the auto¬ 
mobile ride in and around Orlando 
through the country to Winter Park and 
Maitland. 

The drive on the hard surfaced road 
between magnificent oaks and alongside 
of large orange groves was a very enjoy¬ 
able one. 

The party surprised Mr. W. C. Tem¬ 
ple at his Alabama Grove, but he was 
equal to the occasion and had the 
pleasure of showing some of the leading 
Horticulturists in the country a growth 
on Trifoliate stock that was even a sur¬ 


prise to the nurserymen who furnished 
it. The visit to the Winter Park 
packing house, which is said to be the 
largest in the world was of special interest 
in view of the fact that some of the 
methods for handling and washing fruit 
were entirely new in Florida. 

The visit to Rollins college where the 
members were heartily received by Prof. 
Blackman and his good wife was among 
the bright spots of the day. After a long 
ride and a walk through the packing house 
the cooling refreshments handed out by 
the young ladies of the college were very 
acceptable and heartily enjoyed by all. 
Many of the members had heard of Rol¬ 
lins college, but never knew before of the 
extent of its grounds, its numerous beau¬ 
tiful buildings and splendid equipment. 
All the members joined in hearty thanks 
to the president, faculty and the students 
for the very enjoyable hour spent within 
the walls of the college grounds. 

The regular routine of the meeting was 
carried through without very much 
change from the program. One of the 
very important things that took place at 









16 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the meeting was the naming of the place 
where the American Pomological Society 
would hold its next meeting. It will be 
remembered that at the Daytona meeting 
a committee was appointed to invite the 
American Pomological Society to hold its 
next bi-ennial meeting in Florida. The 
committee was successful in presenting 
their invitation and it was left to the Hor¬ 
ticultural Society to state where the next 
meeting should be held. 

Jacksonville and Tampa both put in 
bids, but Tampa won out as she had three 
delegates on the floor and they made 
promises that could not be overlooked and 
the Society voted on Tampa, knowing 
that she has never failed to keep her 
word. The meeting will convene on Jan¬ 
uary 31, 1911. 

The next place of meeting for the 
Florida State Horticultural Society will 


be in Jacksonville, where it will hold its 
regular annual session. The Horticul¬ 
tural Society, however, is expected to 
participate in the Tampa meeting and to 
be on hand to see that the American Po¬ 
mological Society members are well taken 
care of and are shown what Florida can 
produce. 

It is hoped and believed that the meet¬ 
ing at Tampa will be the largest and best 
attended and most interesting of any 
meeting previously held by the American 
Pomological Society, but whether it is or 
not is going to depend in a great measure 
on how our Florida members turn out 
and help. 

All of the members when leaving Or¬ 
lando did so with grateful hearts to the 
good people there for the kind hospitali¬ 
ty and entertainment extended to them.

Address of Welcome. 


Gen. Wm. H. Jewell. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen , 

Members of the Horticultural Society 

of Florida and of the Nut Growers' 

Association of Georgia and Florida : 

Orlando is proud and glad to welcome 
you here. We open to you the gates of 
our city and the doors of our homes and 
of our hearts. We hope that your stay 
with us will be profitable and pleasant. 
We are sure it will be profitable, and we 
sincerely hope that it will be pleasant. 

We remember that you were with us 
some years ago when we were barely 
emerging from that great disaster that 
almost seemed to mean ruin to us, when 
the chief source of our income and pros¬ 
perity was swept away in a night, and 
we suffered great loss of property as 
tvell as of our prosperity and of many of 
our people who were forced to go else¬ 
where to seek a livelihood, but we pre¬ 
sent to you a new and transformed Or¬ 
lando and Orange county today; we pre¬ 
sent to you one of the most beautiful, 
pleasant and healthful cities in one of 
the most beautiful and health¬ 
ful states of this Union. We 

show you our improved streets 

almost throughout the whole extent of 
our city and our principal streets, as you 
have noted, paved with the best modern 
material now known, vitrified brick, with 
many miles of sidewalks that seem like 


walking upon the mosaic floors of bar¬ 
onial halls or princely palaces, with our 
residential streets lined with umbrage¬ 
ous oaks. We show you one of the fin¬ 
est school buildings in the State, only re¬ 
cently erected but now too small for our 
necessities. We show you the lots and 
fields, once vacant and barren, now filled 
with homes; comfortable, pleasant and 
many of them even handsome, and we 
hope to show you something o*f the im¬ 
proved country roads 'that we have built, 
and to take you to see our suburb, Win¬ 
ter Park, and that magnificent model 
packing house built by that noble-spirited 
gentleman, Mr. W. C. Temple, your vice 
president, and we hope to show you that 
splendid institution for educational pur¬ 
poses known as Rollins College. We 
hope to show you these things and many 
more, which will add to your pleasure 
and be profitable as well. 

We are proud and glad to have with 
us such a body of men and women as 
compose your organization; people who 
are devoting themselves largely to the 
promotion of the material interests of 
this great State. 

While the great disaster to which I re¬ 
ferred swept away our orange groves, 
we show you today that Orange county 
is raising more oranges than ever before; 
that it is the largest orange growing 
county in the State of Florida ; that it 



FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


19 


has more orange trees than any other 
county in the State; but that we do not 
depend today as we did of yore upon 
any one thing for our living and pros¬ 
perity, for we can show you some of the 
finest truck gardens you ever saw, not 
only in Sanford but in Orlando and Or¬ 
ange county. We hope and expect, by aid 
of the labors of your organization, to 
double and treble and vastly increase 


the product of those groves and of those 
gardens. 

Again we welcome you to Orlando, and 
I am sure, although Orlando is not a 
town of “gush,” although we do not 
boast nor claim that we have a boom, we 
make no great promises, but what we 
say, we mean, and what we do, we do 
with all our hearts, and in that spirit we 
welcome you to the city of Orlando. 








Response to Address of Welcome. 


W. C. Temple. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of 

Orlando : 

We have listened with pride and ap¬ 
preciation to 'the very eloquent remarks 
of the mayor of this beautiful city, and 
we thank you for the cordial welcome. 

The mayor said we had met at Orlando 
before. That is true; we heard that re¬ 
mark last year when we were selecting 
a meeting place for this year’s conven¬ 
tion. There were other cities anxious to 
have us come to them, and we were ac¬ 
cused of getting the Orlando habit. 

We are glad Orlando is not tired of 
having us nor that we are acquiring the 


Orlando habit. We feel when we come 
to Orlando that we meet the cordial spir¬ 
it and warm heart of the true southern 
welcome. Other cities make us welcome, 
to be sure, and do everything in their 
power to make our stay with them pleas¬ 
ant, but Orlando is different, somehow. 
The people here are so truly glad to have 
us; they seem “home-folks” like, and 
make us feel like “home-folks.” 

And, members of the Florida Horticul¬

President’s Annual Address 


H. Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Upon this, the occasion of our third 
meeting to be held in Orlando, it may 
be interesting to take a general survey of 
our fruit plantings, their nature and ex¬ 
tent. That our present position in the 
world’s horticulture has been reached 
only after great efforts on the part of 
many workers, led on by hope, encour¬ 
aged by example and backed up by 
dogged determination, is apparent, even 
to the most casual observer, and from 
their work, and the heritage which is 
ours, we may learn some lessons of last¬ 
ing worth. 

When we pause to carefully consider 
the status of the fruit-growing indus¬ 
tries in this country, we cannot but be 
impressed both with their diversity and 
their magnitude. Owing to the extent of 
our territory north and south, east and 
west, the variations in altitude from sea- 
level to the tops of our highest moun¬ 
tains, our diverse soil-types, and climatic 
peculiarities, a larger number of differ¬ 
ent fruits can be and are grown on the 
mainland of the United States than are 
usually found within the confines of any 
other single country. 

Not only have our native fruits, in 
many important instances, been improved 
and brought into cultivation, but tribute 


has been laid upon every land which 
could add to the riches of our pomology. 

Grapes and apples from Europe, plums 
from Japan and Europe, pineapples from 
South America, figs from Smyrna, or¬ 
anges from the shores of the Mediterra¬ 
nean, China and Japan, mangoes from In¬ 
dia, avocadoes from Mexico and the West 
Indies, pears from France, England and 
the Orient, Kaki persimmons from 
China, Japan and Korea, the chestnut 
from Europe and Japan, the peach from 
China and elsewhere, bush fruits (rasp¬ 
berry, gooseberry and others) from Eu¬ 
rope, the banana from southern Asia, and 
many more from many, many different 
places. Every nook and corner of the 
earth from the land of the rising to the 
land of the midnight sun has given us of 
its fruits; the bleak, wind-swept steppes 
of Siberia and the steaming jungles of 
India have added to our lists. We have 
laid toll upon the island's beyond the seas 
and the oases of the desert. From bar¬ 
ren hillsides and fertile valleys, from 
dense forest and open prairie, from tiny 
island and vast continent have come 
these strangers to our shores to become 
a part of our national wealth. 

So nearly have we been able to meet the 
requirements of these immigrants that 
most of them have found a congenial 
home in some part of our land. In ad-

dition to this, the larger and more im¬ 
portant fact that these importations of 
foreign varieties have had and are hav¬ 
ing a value far beyond this direct and 
immediate use, must not be overlooked. 
They have served and are serving as the 
basis for further improvements, and 
when blended with other strains by cross¬ 
ing, the resulting fruits have, in many 
cases, far surpassed in value the varieties 
imported. These new fruits are adapted 
to conditions of soil, climate and use into 
which the foreign varieties would not fit. 
Hence, we have at this time, varieties of 
direct foreign introduction, varieties of 
straight domestic origin and varieties 
combining the parental characteristics of 
the two. Sectional differences, peculiar¬ 
ities and adaptabilities have been worked 
out until we can say with reasonable cer¬ 
tainty what strains of fruits will succeed 
in given areas. The peach orchards of 
New York and other northern states are 
planted with trees of the Persian and 
northern Chinese races, while the Flor¬ 
ida peach grower now plants his ground 
with Peen-to and Honey types. The 
vineyardist of the Chautauqua grape belt 
will be found growing northern Ameri¬ 
can grapes, such as Concord, or Niagara, 
or Delaware. The grape grower of the 
eastern Carolinas plants Muscadines and 
the California grower gives his attention 
to the wine and raisin grapes of Europe. 
The nut grower of the Pacific slope plants 
English or Persian walnuts and al¬ 
monds, if in the cotton belt he plants pe¬ 
cans, and in the northern states, chest¬ 
nuts and shell-barks. The California fig 
growers have at length succeeded with 
the Smyrna fig; while the grower of the 
Gulf coast will probably have to content 


himself, as he does now, with figs of an 
entirely different class. The date palm 
has been introduced and has found a con¬ 
genial home in Arizona and southern Cal¬ 
ifornia, Pineapples have thus far suc¬ 
ceeded only in Florida. Japan plums have 
succeeded over a considerable area but 
probably reach their greatest perfection 
on the Pacific coast. There too, in Oregon 
and California, is the land of the prune. 
In the central northwestern states, the 
native American plum has supplied the 
standard sorts for planting, and the Rus¬ 
sian apple seedlings have opened up a 
new apple field. Orange culture has 
reached its greatest development in our 
own State, in California and is now com¬ 
ing into prominence around the Gulf 
coast country. Of the newer fruits, the 
mango and avocado have great possibil¬ 
ities and open up interesting fields for 
further development. And we might go 
on calling attention to the different kinds 
of fruit which now engage the attention 
of our horticulturists. Truly our pomol¬ 
ogy is diversified. 

But turning from this side of the 
question to another, let us note that no 
other land produces fruit in such abun¬ 
dance, and I dare say, that in no other 
country outside the tropics does it enter 
into the everyday sustenance of the people 
to such an extent. Our vineyards and 
orchards are planted over immense areas. 
Fruit trees are set out by hundreds and 
by thousands. Vast areas of plain and 
valley and mountain slope are given over 
to the culture of single fruits, and as our 
population increases, greater efforts must 
necessarily be put forth to supply the 
increasing demand, for our people are a 
fruit-consuming people. Our products 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


23 


are marketed by carloads and trainloads. 
Think of our out-put of 45 or 50 thou¬ 
sand carloads of citrus fruits from the 
Gulf and the Pacific, 'trainloads of 
peaches from the orchards of Georgia, 
Texas, Michigan and Ohio, of strawber¬ 
ries from the Atlantic seaboard, of ap¬ 
ples from Colorado, New York and Ore¬ 
gon, of grapes from California, of pecans 
from the south and walnuts from the 
west. Truly these many strangers from 
many lands, the offspring of world-old 
races have amply repaid the care and at¬ 
tention they have received at our hands. 

Millions are invested in this branch of 
culture, vast auxiliary industries have 
sprung up and are dependent upon the 
fruit crops of the country. Think of the 
immense amount of labor employed in 
healthful occupation, of the great reve¬ 
nues gained by transportation companies, 
of the large amounts of wood, iron and 
paper used in packing and preparation 
for market; and we gain some slight idea 
of what fruit growing means to the coun¬ 
try as a whole. 

In no other land is fruit so abundant, 
in no other is it so cheap. Here it is 
within reach of even the very poor. More 
and more our domestic output has sup¬ 
plied our needs, and in proportion to the 
amount consumed, our imports in many 
directions have fallen off materially. We 
have been able to build up an export trade 
of no mean proportions and our resources 
of soil and brain and brawn are by no 
means exhausted. There are greater de¬ 
velopments yet to come, and looking 
down the dim vistas of the future, who 
can say to what proportions the pomology 
of America may yet attain? 


How has all of this been attained? By 
what paths have we reached our present 
state? What forces have been at work, 
and who have been the workers ? It is 
not our purpose to attempt to answer 
these questions in detail, but I do desire 
to direct your attention to one particular 
individual, the amateur fruit grower. To 
him belongs a measure of honor, a meed 
of praise so full that had his work been 
performed in other avenues of life, his¬ 
tory would have told of his achievements, 
and monuments would have been raised 
to his memory,—but since his tasks have 
been performed in what we have mis¬ 
called the lowlier walks of life, there has 
been no poet to sing his praise. But, 
who is he? What is he? What has he 
done ? When some day the history of 
American fruit growing is written as I 
hope it may be, we shall learn more of 
him, and of what we owe to his efforts. 

If I were to define the amateur fruit 
grower, I could not do better than to 
paraphrase the words of Prof. Hale: “An 
amateur is a man who works in the field 
of horticulture because he cannot help it. 
Because he would rather do such work 
than anything else in the world. And, 
therefore, cares little for hampering tra¬ 
ditions or for difficulties of any kind.” 

The impelling force is sheer love of his 
work. No thought of largess is his, 
love of plants to him is his reward. 

To him we owe the major portion of 
our finest fruits. Interested in his chosen 
field, he has been ever quick to note varia¬ 
tions in the plants grown under his 
watchful eye. The superiority of one 
over another, or maybe over all others, 
has not passed unnoticed. When plants 
were brought from foreign lands, his was 


24 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIET Y. 


the hand which received them and gave 
them kindly care, and when new fruits 
were brought to his notice, whether in 
our own country or in another, he has 
always been anxious to secure and test 
them. 

The tendency in our country is to limit 
our plantings to a comparatively small 
number of varieties, and this small num¬ 
ber is woefully small, when we compare 
it with the thousands of varieties which 
from the beginning have appeared in va¬ 
rious catalogues and lists. It is also small 
when we compare it with the number of 
varieties planted by the old world cultur- 
ist. Ait the present time, as in every oth¬ 
er period of our pomology, new varieties 
are being constantly introduced, and so 
well are these placed before the public 
with illustrated and descriptive matter, 
that many might be led to plant largely 
without sufficient knowledge of their mer¬ 
its. Moreover while one variety may be 
good in a certain given locality, its range 
of adaptability may be limited, and no 
one can say over what territory a variety 
will succeed, until it has actually been 
tested on the soil. Herein the amateur 
has performed an invaluable service. New 
things attract his attention, he purchases 
them, or secures them, plants and cares 
for them. After a number of years’ trial, 
under the vicissitudes of climate, of cold 
and heat, of rainfall and dry weather, he, 
more than any one else, is capable of 
passing upon the merits of the newer 
things. Not his, the attitude of the cold 
commercialist, whose only thought is of 
the gains he makes on his trees; and yet, 
the amateur oftAimes prevents this same 
commercialist from falling into errors 


which would be disastrous to the success¬ 
ful outcome of his business operations. 

Among our amateur growers, we may 
count not only our most worthy plant in¬ 
troducers and testers but also' our most 
noted plant breeders and improvers. The 
service which such men as Prince, Down¬ 
ing, Rogers, Bull, Budd and Stuart have 
rendered American horticulture in their 
several fields of activity cannot well be 
over estimated. Who> can count the val¬ 
ue of the work done by Sand ford, Ed¬ 
mund H. Hart, Phelps, Richards, Brown 
and Adams in the development of the 
fruit industries in this State? Their 
names will live long in the annals of 
Florida horticulture. 

It has, however, not been along these 
lines alone that they have rendered val¬ 
uable service. The fruit grower, to be 
successful, must wage war successfully 
against all the forces which oppose him. 
His is no one-sided study; and the ama¬ 
teur has played his part and played it 
well, in the control of plant diseases and 
insects. When new lines of fruit were 
introduced, their propagation, cultivation 
and general care require attention. These 
details have been mastered. Again when 
the fruits were ready to place upon the 
markets he has done his part in bringing 
them before the public. No phase of his 
work has been left untouched. He has 
given of himself and of his time without 
stint. All honor to the work he has done 
in the development of the enormous fruit 
industries of our country. Florida has 
had her full quota of amateur fruit-grow¬ 
ers, and their combined ability has not 
been surpassed by the combined ability 
of the fruit growers of any other region 
in our country. And today, the same

25 


spirit is abroad in the State. May it long 
remain. With it, our fruit trees and 
plants are living vital objects to draw 
forth from their caretakers the best that 
is in them. Without it, our occupation 
has become dead and inert, it has lost its 
best, vital uplifting force for man and 
plant. Not only does man cultivate his 
fruit trees, but if he approaches his work 
in the right spirit and in the spirit with 
which the amateur fruit-grower has al¬ 


ways approached his work, his fruit trees 
cultivate him. Thus we live for the best: 
that is in our work, and in so living, win 
from it a reward far above the monetary 
gain it brings us. And when we fold our 
cloaks about us, to lie down to our re¬ 
pose, may it be with the feeling that we 
have lived not unto ourselves but for the 
betterment of an occupation that means 
so much to our State, and which has. 
meant so much to us. 


Horticultural and Agricultural Education in Florida 


Prof. P. H. Rolfs. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Once in a while, we like to take a gen¬ 
eral survey; to get on the housetop, as it 
were, and look around over the country 
and see what is to be seen. We want to 
spend a few minutes this morning in this 
kind of general survey, then we will get 
down to details and study the details more 
closely than this paper deals with them. 

EDUCATION NECESSARY FOR A STABLE 
DEMOCRACY. 

Our present system of education had 
its origin in an aristocratic form of gov¬ 
ernment. It, therefore, partook much of 
the form of government under which it 
was fostered. In an aristocratic govern¬ 
ment it mattered not how many toiled in¬ 
cessantly, SO' long as the chosen few were 
privileged to follow the bent of their own 
inclinations to the fullest extent. Under 
such a form of government, a few ex¬ 
tremely talented individuals arose, espec¬ 
ially along those lines of study that did not 
displease the rulers. The great masses of 
humanity, however, were not thought 
worthy of attention. It was really con¬ 
sidered dangerous for them to obtain the 
rudiments of an education. The very 
foundations of a democracy rest on the 
assumption that each one of the electorate 
body has at least a reasonable understand¬ 


ing of those questions of government 
necessary to the fullest development of 
the individuals who make up the democ¬ 
racy. 

Our own government is only a limited 
democracy, and in some of the “machine- 
ridden” districts it is extremely limited. 
We are, in fact, to a large extent, govern¬ 
ed by an office-holding oligarchy, which 
differs from a monarchy only in that the 
electorate may at irregular intervals re¬ 
move the reigning oligarch, and replace 
him by another. These conditions will 
continue to exist as long as the electorate 
body remains incapable of knowing its 
needs and expressing them at the polls. 
Great holdings of property are not, to my 
mind, incompatible with a perfect democ¬ 
racy; nor are great variations in intellec¬ 
tual attainments antagonistic to a democ¬ 
racy. But it is impossible for a pure 
democracy to exist unsullied unless 
the majority of the electorate 
is capable of understanding and 
voting intelligently on both local 
and national questions. As long as we 
have an uneducated electorate, either one 
“boss” or another will rule; but, as the 
electorate becomes more educated, the 
boss retreats, and finally quits the field. 
Our own government has given us a 
striking illustration of how an almost 
perfect organization may be perverted to 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


27 


selfish ends. But, by the education of the 
masses, first one redoubt and then anoth¬ 
er has been taken from 1 the office-holding 
aristocracy. Formerly, the electorate was 
not allowed the right to select the Pres¬ 
ident of the United States, but now this 
is practically conceded, although the con¬ 
stitution of the United States reserves 
the right to an electoral college, and we 
still go through the empty form of voting 
for the members of this electoral college. 
In many of our States, the U. S. Sena¬ 
tors are voted for in the primaries or at 
the general election, and the State Leg¬ 
islatures then go through the form of 
electing these Senators. 

THE DIFFICULTY A FUNDAMENTAL ONE. 

The difficulty of education is a deeper 
one than mere dollars and cents. You 
can’t drive an American—some can be 
bought, but many more may be led. Our 
ideals, however, are toward a democracy. 

Naturally, we should say that since the 
rural population is unable to send its 
children to school, then by increasing the 
earning capacity of the rural adult, the 
difficulty will be removed, and all of our 
children will be put into the schools. Let 
us examine the public school statistics of 
a State in which the earning capacity of 
the average adult is sufficient for compar¬ 
ative ease, and where children are not 
permitted to labor in factories. Massa¬ 
chusetts will furnish us with a good illus¬ 
tration. 

In Massachusetts, according to the 
69th census, there were: 

513,000 children of school age; 

498,000 children attending school; 


404,000, or 78 per cent., in average 
attendance; 

45,000, or 8 per cent., attending high 
school (about one-fourth of those that 
shoud be there).i 

These figures show us that the difficulty 
is a fundamental one, and not a practical 
one (the want of wealth). 

In the whole United States, only 13 
per cent, of our school population have 
reached the last grade in the high school, 
or a little more than a third of those that 
should be there. 

The absence of wealth is a potent fac¬ 
tor for non-attendance on schools, but it 
is not the fundamental difficulty. This 
difficulty lies in the fact that our present 
school curriculum is faulty. We are not 
educating for the efficiency of the indi¬ 
vidual. The whole common school course, 
beginning in the primary grades, through 
the grammar school, and especially in the 
high school, educates the individual for 
professional life, which comprises only 3 
per cent, of our population. To the 
other 97 per cent, of our population the 
studies are purely non-vocational. 

Think of it, ladies and gentlemen; 97 
per cent, of our people (including 44 per 
cent, rural population) are required to 
accept a purely non-vocational course, or 
none at all, simply that 3 per cent may be 
fitted for their vocation. It is really a 
compliment to our present system that so 
large a percentage of our children are 
taking the studies in the higher grades at 
all. Our present graded and high schools 
have shaped their courses in such a way 
as to enable their graduates to enter a 
college or university without examina¬ 
tion. They are given a direct through 


28 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ticket, on a limited express train, which 
makes no stops at flag or way stations; 
while the through passengers number on¬ 
ly one-tenth of one per cent, of the whole. 
We have built splendid terminal facilities, 
but those who wish to stop at way sta¬ 
tions have to roll off like chunks of coal 
from a flat-car. In other words our pres¬ 
ent curriculum forces the teachers to 
bend all their energies toward making 
college or university candidates; while 
their efforts toward making common men 
and women, the great mass of our popu¬ 
lation, have to be purely incidental. Our 
present grammar and high schools are 
fashioned after the old academy, whose 
legitimate successor they can in no wise 
claim to be. (In passing, I may be per¬ 
mitted to say that our University has 
broadened its course during the last five 
years, so as to include instruction along 
the vocational lines that include about 
three-fourths of our population. It will 
take time, however, for the graded 
schools to fit boys for entering the Uni¬ 
versity.) 

THE WORLD-WIDE ADVANCE. 

It is not so many years ago that all ed¬ 
ucation, science, and other advancement 
of the human race were circumscribed 
and localized in more or less restricted 
communities. Some communities ad¬ 
vanced far ahead of their times along cer¬ 
tain lines. As an illustration of this, we 
have the civilization of Greece, which had 
its philosophers, poets, and to some extent 
scientists, before the Christian era. Much 
of the good work was lost by the subse¬ 
quent subjugation of these people. The 
great valley of the Euphrates, and the 


valley of the Nile, and other places may 
be called to mind where engineering 
feats of wonderful proportions were car¬ 
ried on six to ten thousand years ago, 
the results of which are still apparent. In 
later times, however, the science and the 
art of this work were completely lost. It 
has been only in recent centuries that the 
science of engineering has again reached 
the height attained by these old and al¬ 
most prehistoric nations. So long as 
these communities or nations remained 
isolated, they were able to develop along 
certain lines, frequently to the neglect of 
all other lines of education and upbuild¬ 
ing. Their advance only lasted until the 
opportune time came for a more barba¬ 
rous or more fierce and warlike nation 
to conquer them and destroy utterly their 
literature and their art. A striking and 
very similar illustration may be taken 
from America. The great pyramids 
erected by the Aztecs to the sun £nd the 
moon, are still wonders of the continent. 
These Aztecs had a high civilization, and 
must have also developed in science to a 
high grade, from the fact that they have 
shown an accurate knowledge of engin¬ 
eering work, and an accurate knowledge 
of the calendar as we know it today. 
Their literature, science and agriculture 
was swept away by the Spanish conquer¬ 
ors. The Aztecs themselves were sub¬ 
jugated and compelled to become servants 
of an alien race whose civilization, sci¬ 
ence, and literature, they were forced to 
adopt, whether it suited them or not. 

At the present time we are living in 
an age when time in the past is practical¬ 
ly annihilated, making it possible by 
means of books for us in a single hour 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


29 


to traverse the whole vast extent of time 
from the beginning of recorded data to 
the present. The telephone and tele¬ 
graph are annihilating distance. By means 
of the telegraph, we are today closer to 
the Philippine Islands and more inti¬ 
mately connected with them than we 
were seventy-five years ago with New 
York or Chicago. 

WORLD-WIDE COMPETITION. 

We are likewise much more affected 
both morally and financially by what is 
done even in remote parts of the earth, 
than ever before. To be a successful 
cabbage grower in Florida, the horticul¬ 
turist must know the extent of the Nova 
Scotia crop, the extent of the Danish 
crop, and the extent of the German crop, 
and of course must have full information 
as to the extent of the cabbage product 
of the whole United States. This is one 
illustration of the many that might be 
cited. 

We are today vitally affected in citrus 
growing by the output from distant 
parts of the world. We look upon Cali¬ 
fornia as our competitor, and one with 
whom we have to reckon. Too many 
of us, however, forget that Arizona, Mex¬ 
ico, Texas, Jamaica, Porto Rico, and the 
Mediterranean region are also competi¬ 
tors. While we have developed the art 
of producing citrus fruit to such an ex¬ 
tent that, with the aid of the tariff, we 
need not fear the introduction of fruit 
from the Mediterranean growers, we 
still find them competitors when we wish 
to ship fruit to Europe, to Canada, or to 
other places outside the United States. 
I might mention that our nursery men are 


finding Japanese nurseries competing se¬ 
riously for the market of citrus trees. 

As pineapple growers in Florida, we 
consider Cuba and Porto Rico as our 
strong competitors, and think of them as 
being alone in the field. This, however, 
is not entirely correct. Hawaii ships a 
large amount of fruit to the Pacific Coast 
States. The Malayan Peninsula com¬ 
petes strenuously for the market in 
canned pineapples. Yet the Malayan 
Peninsula is located on the other side of 
the world. 

The Florida potato grower must take 
into consideration the crop that is produced 
in practically all of the United States, 
and Europe, and the competition of Ber¬ 
muda. Nearly ten years ago the over¬ 
production of the crop for the fancy mar¬ 
ket resulted in two very bad years for 
the Florida potato growers. Since that 
time the demand has grown rapidly, and 
now it appears as though it would be al¬ 
most impossible to produce enough po¬ 
tatoes to satisfy the market. But this is 
only apparent, since the production of 
only a few carloads more than the mar¬ 
ket will quickly absorb would result in a 
serious slump of prices. I found, for ex¬ 
ample, that the Hastings market was 
around $3.00 f. o. b. per barrel, and the 
Chicago market was 25 cents per bushel. 
The Chicago buyers were buying Flori¬ 
da potatoes because they had a fancy 
market. I might illustrate with the avo¬ 
cado crop. We can sell a certain amount 
of avocados in the market at quite a 
fancy figure. It really does not make 
much difference what we charge. The 
higher the price the more people seem to 
be anxious to get them, but if we have 


30 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


half a crate more than the market de¬ 
mands, that extra half crate will not 
bring ten cents. As it is, we have learn¬ 
ed not to over supply the avocado mar¬ 
ket, but keep the supply just even with 
the demand. 

The younger generation of us will have 
to compete strenuously with the fruit out¬ 
put of South America and Africa. Al¬ 
ready these countries are sending their 
product into the markets of Europe, and 
thereby curtailing the source of consump¬ 
tion for our products. The United States 
has already seriously felt the inroads in 
the European market made by the Aus¬ 
tralian meats and other animal products. 
Argentina now stands second in the acre¬ 
age of corn. The report for 1908 gives 
her nearly seven million acres. Capital 
from the United States is flowing in a 
torrent into Mexico. A few years ago the 
United States consul at Mexico City told 
me that there was upwards of $500,000,- 
000 of United States capital invested in 
Mexico. Most of this, however, was go¬ 
ing to develop the mines, though agricul¬ 
ture was following rapidly in the amount 
of United States capital that was being 
absorbed. Large areas in Mexico have 
been and are being planted to citrus fruits. 
By tariff legislation it may be possible to 
keep these fruits out of the markets of 
the United States, but such an artificial 
barrier cannot keep them from going into 
Canada and other places where our 
fruits now find a good market. In cer¬ 
tain sections of Central America large 
areas are being planted to citrus orchards, 
and it is purely a question of developing 
transportation facilities to bring these in¬ 
to active competition with our fruits. 


The transportation facilities are being 
rapidly developed, and will be greatly 
stimulated as the time for the opening of 
the Panama canal approaches. (Of 
course we raise a superior article, but to 
millions of consumers an orange is an or¬ 
ange and nothing more.) 

All of this brings us face to face with 
the fact that we are only a small part of 
the world movement. A moment ago I 
called your attention to the fact that in 
the past these upward movements took 
place in isolated centers. By means of 
our literature we have annihilated the 
past, and by means of electricity we are 
annihilating distance. Now, in the place 
of progressive movement being localized, 
it is present in all nations. Even static 
Turkey and Persia are being affected by 
the educational movement of today. The 
leaders in scientific thought today must 
know what the results are of the investi¬ 
gations in other laboratories, whether lo¬ 
cated at Ceylon, Tokyo, San Francisco, 
Chicago, New York, Edinburgh, Berlin, 
St. Petersburg, or any other place on the 
globe. Should Dr Koch make an impor¬ 
tant discovery in connection with the 
sleeping sickness of interior Africa, on 
the next day all the newspapers around 
the earth would announce the fact. While 
the earth is no smaller than it was ten 
thousand years ago, man’s power over 
matter has increased so immeasurably 
that he is in reality brought into daily 
and almost hourly connection with even 
the remotest portions of the world. 

At first it might seem as though this 
was a long distance from citrus growing. 
To understand our present situation, 
however, it is of the highest importance

for us to understand the world move¬ 
ments. We are in such immediate com¬ 
munication with all of our competitors, 
and our competitors are in so close touch 
with us, that unless we understand the 
whole situation and take advantage of 
the opportunities as they occur, we shall 
be hopelessly outclassed in the competi¬ 
tion. The serious question with us to¬ 
day is, what are we doing and are we 
doing all we can to better our conditions, 
to increase our power of producing crops 
and to reduce the cost of production of 
the same. We all know that the cost of 
production has increased greatly in the 
last fifteen years. Fertilizers have in¬ 
creased in cost, labor nearly doubled in 
price, transportation has been but slight¬ 
ly reduced, and the purchasing power of 
the money we receive in return for our 
products has decreased nearly 50 per 
cent. We are in a decade of high prices 
but cheap money. 

We are now face to face with a situa¬ 
tion that demands the most earnest and 
energetic study of our problems, both 
from a technical and a practical stand¬ 
point. 

INCREASE OF POPULATION. 

Florida was the first place in what are 
now the United States to receive colo¬ 
nists from Europe. For various reasons 
that need not be enumerated at this time, 
the development of Florida has been ex¬ 
tremely slow. At the present time our 
area is probably the most sparsely set¬ 
tled of any State east of the Mississippi. 
Various causes have contributed to bring 
this about. We are now, however, re¬ 
ceiving immigrants from almost all parts 


of the United States, the main reason for 
this being the fact that good, available 
farm lands in other parts of the United 
States have been practically all taken up. 
The last West has been conquered. Con¬ 
sequently the pioneers who have no more 
West in which to locate, must turn in an¬ 
other direction to secure cheap and suit¬ 
able lands. A large number of the peo¬ 
ple from the overcrowded sections of the 
Middle West and West, are pouring into 
the immense unsettled portions of the 
Northwest Territory of Canada. Enough 
of our citizens have already moved across 
the border to make a population equal to 
that contained in Florida. In other 
words, the United States has already con¬ 
tributed at least one State to the develop¬ 
ment of Canada. Many of our citizens 
are not satisfied, however, to leave the 
protection of the flag under which they 
were born and raised, but prefer to seek 
employment and a livelihood even in far- 
off Florida, which has been represented 
to them as a place where it is almost im¬ 
possible to live. This movement and un¬ 
rest has its basis in some fundamental 
condition. The fundamental condition 
that is confronting these people is the 
same one that we have to meet here. The 
population of the United States is now 
increasing at the rate of a million a year. 
At first thought this would appear to be 
very encouraging, since it means a mil¬ 
lion people more every year to eat or¬ 
anges; but oranges are not absolute ne¬ 
cessities, and bread comes first. With 
this more fierce struggle for subsistence 
comes a corresponding decrease in oppor¬ 
tunity for buying those things that are 
absolutely necessary.

EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT IN FLORIDA. 

We are vitally interested today in 
knowing what factors are at work for the 
improvement of Florida conditions. We 
must improve our conditions, or be left 
far behind in this world-wide movement. 
If our methods of handling our citrus 
groves are not better next year than they 
are this year, we will find ourselves hope¬ 
lessly outclassed by this severe and se¬ 
rious competition. In our democratic 
form of government, we cannot expect 
a dictator to arise and drive us forward 
to proper handling and to proper thinking. 
The upward movement must be through 
the upward movement of at least a large 
proportion of the agricultural people. Our 
leaders may legislate and prescribe laws 
for our guidance, but unless these laws 
receive an intelligent support, they will be 
practically dead letters on the statute 
books. This may be strikingly illustrated 
by the laws on our statute books pertain¬ 
ing to the organization of a county hor¬ 
ticultural commission. These commis¬ 
sions when properly organized have all 
the power necessary to carry out any rea¬ 
sonable line of work in any county. Yet 
so far as we know, not a single county 
has taken effective advantage of this law. 

AGRICULTURE IN RURAL SCHOOLS. 

Some lines of work are being carried 
out which will in time give us much bet¬ 
ter agricultural and horticultural condi¬ 
tions in the State. One of these move¬ 
ments is the teaching of the basic princi¬ 
ples of agriculture and horticulture in all 
the rural schools of the State. Naturally, 
the introduction of agriculture has met 
with the same opposition that the intro¬ 


duction of grammar and physiology met 
with in our common school curriculum. 
It is no more likely that the teaching of 
agriculture from an elementary text-book 
in the country school will make a trained 
agriculturist, than that the teaching of 
grammar in the country school would 
produce a finished poet or prose writer, or 
that the teaching of physiology in country 
schools would produce an accomplished 
family physician. The teaching of the 
grammar has, however, added immense¬ 
ly to the accuracy of speaking and writ¬ 
ing English; and the study of physiology 
has done much toward preserving health 
and discounting quackery. 

CORN INSTITUTES. 

Institutes for young people have been 
held in a number of the counties of the 
State this year. This brings practical 
farming education to the youth who will 
soon be the bread earner. To enumerate 
all of these would require more time than 
would seem practicable in a short speech 
today. In Alachua county, as an illustra¬ 
tion, we held to March 26th, 14 of these 
institutes, with a total attendance of 955 
persons. (Since the above summary was 
made, several more institutes have been 
held, carrying the total number over a 
thousand.) Of this 955 above mentioned, 
626 were school pupils, 189 were men, 
and 140 women. This shows a lively in¬ 
terest in agricultural education in the 
State. Not only do the young people at¬ 
tend, but interest in the work is aroused 
among the older people. At these insti¬ 
tutes the lectures of the day were intro¬ 
ductory to the final object. The object 
of the lecturers was to instruct the pupils 


FLORIDA >STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


33 


in agricultural work and at the same time 
distribute packages of selected seed corn. 
This corn was intended for planting by 
the pupils, and in the fall contests for the 
best corn produced will be held, and later 
there will be a contest in corn judging. 

farmers' institutes proper. 

The Farmers Institute work during 
the present fiscal year has been carried on 
rather more vigorously than in any pre¬ 
vious year. Up to May 8, we had held 
114 sessions, scattered from Pensacola 
on the west, to Miami on the south. We 
have not visited every county in the State, 
from the fact that certain counties are 
more wide awake than others, and as a 
rule, those which make their wants known 
are the ones which are likely to have 
them supplied. The total attendance on 
these institutes will run somewhere in the 
neighborhood of seven thousand. In this 
connection I may say that the farmers of 
the State are probably more active and 
more insistent than the fruit growers. 
The citrus section which was formerly 
the progressive section has now become 
conservative and the farming section pro¬ 
gressive. 

COUNTY FAIRS. 

County fairs are being held in many 
different counties of the State. They are 
not always known under the name of 
fairs, though in substance they amount to 
the same thing. Santa Rosa, Walton, 
Washington, Holmes, Jackson, Gadsden, 
Leon, Jefferson, Madison, Suwanee, Ma¬ 
rion, Polk and Dade are all confidently 
looking forward to an exhibition of ag¬ 
ricultural and horticultural products next 


fall and winter. A number of these coun¬ 
ties held fairs last year, and in almost all 
cases the institution was a financial suc¬ 
cess. From an educational standpoint 
they were much more successful, how¬ 
ever, than from a financial standpoint. The 
total attendance upon these institutions 
would amount to hundreds of thousands. 
These gatherings are very important 
from the fact that they bring the city 
more closely in touch with the country. 

THE INTERSTATE FAIR. 

During November of this year will be 
held the interstate fair at Pensacola. A 
dozen or fourteen counties of Florida 
and Alabama will be represented. At 
the interstate fair there will be offered a 
silver cup trophy for the corn-judging 
contest and other prizes of magnitude. 

THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. 

The county and State fairs are potent 
factors in the upbuilding of the agricul¬ 
tural and horticultural interests of the 
State. They come more, however, as an 
expression of the existing conditions 
than as a direct effort toward the formu¬ 
lation and carrying forward of definite 
ideals. This work of leadership and pre¬ 
senting of ideals is to a large extent the 
mission of the University of Florida. 
Necessarily this institution, since it be¬ 
longs to the people, must adapt itself to 
the conditions as they are found. It would 
be a practical folly to attempt to copy or 
model our institution after that existing 
in any other State whose conditions were 
entirely different from those found in 
Florida. Consequently, this institution 
must blaze its own way. While the ex- 


34 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


perience in other states will be of much 
service, it can only be used in the way of 
suggestions. 

THE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE. 

To carry out the ideals of progressive 
educational work, the University has of¬ 
fered a course of agriculture by corre¬ 
spondence. This has proven to be ex¬ 
tremely popular. Last year the regis¬ 
tration in the course was over 400. This 
year the registration is about 600, and 
nine different courses were offered in 
place of the one that was offered last 
year. It is intended to continue to of- 
fer these correspondence courses. 

THE CITRUS SEMINAR. 

As an expression of the fact that the 
institution is attempting to meet the needs 
of the State, we may cite the case of the 
Citrus Seminar. This gathering was 
held, not with a view of giving informa¬ 
tion of an elementary character in con¬ 
nection with citrus culture, but to pre¬ 
sent the latest scientific discoveries in 
connection with this great industry. As 
the name indicates, no attempt was made 
to make this Citrus Seminar in any way 
a formal matter. The lectures were de¬ 
livered in an informal way, and constant 
questions and interruptions were invited. 
The speakers for the most part were from 
the experiment station staff. The citrus 
growers themselves, however, aided very 
greatly in making the effort a thorough 
success, in that certain of them volun¬ 
teered to give short talks on specific sub¬ 
jects about which they knew probably 
more than anyone else. The character of 
the work of the Seminar was such as 


would have made it of little value to one 
who was not thoroughly versed in prac¬ 
tical citrus culture. The average at¬ 
tendance on the meetings was 34.7 per 
session. Twenty-eight persons directly 
interested in citrus growing in Florida at¬ 
tended the meetings. 

CONCLUSION. 

The conditions under which we find 
ourselves existing today are very differ¬ 
ent from those that have been experi¬ 
enced heretofore. We are in the midst 
of a world wide movement,—educational, 
financial, scientific, and political. If its ef¬ 
fects are worldwide, competition is like¬ 
wise worldwide. Our sources of infor¬ 
mation are not limited only by the climate 
in which citrus fruits will grow. We 
must know what is happening in every 
land, not only of the citrus-growing re¬ 
gions, but of the agricultural regions as 
well. We are more and more interde¬ 
pendent than ever before. As our prob¬ 
lems of production are being solved, our 
problems of distribution become more 
severe. Your attention has already been 
called to the fact that the prices received 
for our fruit at the present time are not 
as great as they were fifteen years ago, 
and yet the purchasing power of the dol¬ 
lar which we receive for our fruit has 
fallen very materially. It therefore be¬ 
comes more and more necessary to cur¬ 
tail the expenses of production, to insure 
perfect and prompt delivery, and in every 
manner possible provide for a saving of 
the waste product. Every tree in the 
grove must be made to do its full share 
of work, and all deadbeats ruthlessly de¬ 
stroyed. We must by earnest study learn 


FLORIDA /STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


35 


to take advantage of every particle of 
useful information that can be obtained. 

We are here this week to test theories ; 
and if they are not in accord with fact, to 
have them brushed ruthlessly away as 
chaff. We are here to be helpful to one 
another, that we may be the better able 
to see our own way clearly. 


DISCUSSION. 

Prof. Hume: I believe I voice the sen¬ 
timent of those who are best informed 
in the matter when I say that never in 
the history of the State has there been a 
time when the Experiment Station of the 
University is so nearly filling the place 
that it should fill in the State. This Cit¬ 


rus Seminar was one of the most inter¬ 
esting meetings I have ever seen in the 
State of Florida, and while I do not 
know that it is the intention to make it 
an annual affair, I sincerely hope it is, 
and I am sure anyone would be much 
benefited by taking advantage of the op¬ 
portunity that is offered them. 

It is a strange thing to me that the 
mere act of putting a man on the program 
is to' ensure his staying away. If we 
were at all superstitious, we would say 
that putting a man on the jprogram is a 
sure sign that he won’t be at the meet¬ 
ing. However, on the subject “Methods 
of Handling Citrus Groves” we are luck¬ 
ier than usual, for we have two members 
on the committee present, Mr. Williams 
and Mr. Thompson. 









New Types of Citrus Fruits for Florida 


Walter T. Swingle. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

I had the pleasure of presenting to the 
members of this society at the meeting at 
Daytona last year some of the results of 
the recent work in the breeding of new 
types of citrus fruits. I spent the months 
from March to June last spring in Flor¬ 
ida making hybrids with a view to secur¬ 
ing new types of citrus fruits, some of 
which I shall discuss in this paper. 

The work heretofore done in connec¬ 
tion with the breeding of hardy citrus 
fruits has not been of a character to in¬ 
terest directly the orange growers of cen¬ 
tral and southern peninsular Florida. The 
hybrids between the trifoliata and the 
common orange (citranges, as we call 
them) are not of a type likely to prove a 
success for commercial culture, although 
excellent for home use throughout the 
cotton states, and are of comparatively 
little interest in regions where oranges, 
lemons and limes can be grown. 

I have had the feeling that many of my 
Florida friends, although somewhat in¬ 
terested in the work, have considered that 
it did not directly concern them. I be¬ 
lieve that the results which I shall dis¬ 
cuss today will convince you that there is 
a side of this work which has a direct 
personal interest to every orange grower 
in Florida. 


THREE-QUARTER HYBRIDS. 

Last year I showed the members of this 
society photographs of softie of the hy¬ 
brids obtained by Mr. E. M. Savage the 
year before by crossing the citrange back 
with one of its parents, thereby securing 
hybrids containing 3-4 orange and 1-4 
trifoliata. These citrangors, as we call 
them, show considerable variation, some 
having distinctly trifoliate and others 
entire leaves like the orange. The studies 
made during the past year have convinced 
me that the pollen grains of the citrange 
have a great range of diversity; some be¬ 
ing practically of the orange type and 
others partly trifoliata, consequently the 
Citrangors show almost every type from 
half-blood orange to trifoliate and from 
citrange to practically pure orange, show¬ 
ing only minute traces of trifoliate blood. 
It is obvious that in this way we secure 
hybrids showing all variations of trifol¬ 
iata blood and there can be but little 
doubt that a slight touch of the trifoliata 
would be likely to add an agreeable zest 
to the fruit and besides give additional 
hardiness to the tree. I have secured 
photographs of three or four of the more 
diverse types of Citrangors so that mem¬ 
bers can see something of the extent of 
variation in this type of hybrid.

SECOND GENERATION CITRANGES. 

When the citranges (trifoliata by com¬ 
mon orange) were first made it was not 
expected that the first generation hybrids 
grown from seed secured by such cross 
pollination would be of any value, while 
it was confidently expected that the sec¬ 
ond generation hybrids grown from 
seeds of the citranges themselves would 
show occasional combinations of the 
qualities of the two parents which would 
make them valuable. The unexpected is 
said always to happen, however, and it 
certainly did in this case. Many of the 
first generation citranges proved distinct¬ 
ly of value for home use in the Cotton 
States. Some of them were nearly seed¬ 
less so that it was difficult to try the ex¬ 
periment of securing second generation 
seedlings. Others, however, seeded very 
freely and upon growing the seedlings 
they were seen to be monotonously uni¬ 
form, reproducing almost exactly the pa¬ 
rental type. 

Among the 14 or 15 citranges now in 
fruit, 2 have been found that occasionally 
give rise to true second generation hy¬ 
brids, and 2 more the seeds from which 
all give rise to second generation hybrids. 
These citranges, it is true, are not among 
the best varieties, but one of them is of 
fair quality and the other is of large size 
and handsome appearance though of un¬ 
usually bitter flavor. The seedlings of 
these citranges show the most extraordi¬ 
nary diversity, ranging all the way from 
practically pure orange to practically pure 
trifoliata, with every conceivable interme¬ 
diate stage. It is almost impossible to 
find duplicates among the scores of plants 
now under observation. They show much 


the same variation as the Citrangors al¬ 
ready referred to but have vastly wider 
range, the Citrangors having as their two 
extremes the citrange on one side and the 
orange on the other, while the second 
generation, seedlings range from orange 
to trifoliate, a much wider field. Then, 
too, the second generation seedlings are 
secured without any further trouble than 
the mere planting of the citrange seeds; 
all that is necessary is to propagate the 
two varieties of citrange mentioned and 
then plant the seed. In this way a wealth 
of new citrus fruits can be obtained and, 
what is of interest to the Florida citrus 
growers, many of these new fruits ap¬ 
proach the orange very closely in char¬ 
acter of leaf and in growth and will 
doubtless bear fruits distinctly of the or¬ 
ange type although at least some of them 
may be expected to show something of 
the hardiness of the trifoliata in the tree 
and perhaps some of the earliness of this 
parent in the ripening of the fruit. Pho¬ 
tographs are attached showing something 
of the amount of variation seen among 
the seedlings of these two' varieties of cit¬ 
ranges; also photograph showing a few 
older seedlings of the rustic citrange 
planted in the fall of 1908, and giving 
some idea of the appearance of these sec¬ 
ond generation citranges as they get old¬ 
er. 

It should be stated, in this connection, 
that long experience has shown conclu¬ 
sively that much can be judged as to the 
character of the fruit of a citrus plant 
from the appearance of the leaves. Of 
course, the Citrangors and these second 
generation seedlings will be forced into 
fruit as soon as possible, and I hope with¬ 
in a couple of years to give the first actual 




38 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 


demonstration of the truth of what is 
here announced. 

COMPLEX CITRUS HYBRIDS. 

Besides the two classes of citrus hy¬ 
brids mentioned above there is a third 
containing a small proportion of trifoliata 
blood, which is likely to be of decided in¬ 
terest in Florida. These hybrids have 
been secured by crossing citranges with 
other citrus fruits not entering into the 
parentage of the original hybrid; that is, 
citranges have been crossed with the 
grapefruit on one hand, with the hope of 
securing new types of citrus fruits suita¬ 
ble to be eaten from the hand but still 
having some of the hardiness of the tri¬ 
foliata; and with the kumquat on the 
other hand in the hope of securing hardy 
forms of acid fruit's suitable for making 
ade. The kumquat has one important 
type of hardiness, ability to> resist spells 
of hot weather in winter without starting 
into growth; while the trifoliata is able 
to withstand very severe cold when in a 
completely dormant condition. 

VIGOR OF GROWTH OF CITRUS HYBRIDS 
REMARKABLE. 

An interesting thing has developed in 
connection with these hybrids: Citranges 
are more vigorous than either the orange 
or the trifoliate parent, often growing as 
rapidly as the combined growth of both 
parents. The Citrangors and second gen¬ 
eration citranges do not show this exces¬ 
sive vigor, most of them being about as 
vigorous as the parent they most resem¬ 
ble; that is, second generation citranges 
that look like oranges grow about as rap¬ 
idly as the orange. 


When citranges are crossed with a 
third species, especially if it is very dif¬ 
ferent, such as the grapefruit or kum¬ 
quat, then the hybrids which really rep¬ 
resent a commingling of three species, 
show extraordinary vigor, in some cases 
nearly equaling in growth the combined 
growth of all three parents. For exam¬ 
ple : A kumquat flower crossed June 6, 
1909, with pollen of the Rusk citrange, the 
fruit being picked the latter part of Oc¬ 
tober, 1909. The seeds were planted in 
the greenhouse of the Department of Ag¬ 
riculture on October 28th, sprouted with¬ 
in a week and in six weeks the young 
plants were strong enough to be inarched 
on two-year-old grapefruit stock. From 
the moment these seedlings appeared 
above the ground they have not ceased 
growing and are now from 2 1-2 to 3 
feet high, as large as most citrus seed¬ 
lings two years old, although they are 
barely six months old from the time of 
germination. 

Some of the hybrids made between the 
citrange and the Satsuma show some¬ 
thing of this unusual vigor, which is to 
be expected since the Satsuma is rather 
different from any of the other citrus 
fruits. 

At any rate, here we find a method of 
securing extraordinarily vigorous hybrids 
combining the qualities of three parental 
species. 

It should be stated, as mentioned in 
connection with the Citrangors, that the 
pollen of the citrange shows a wide range 
of character. If crossed on the grape¬ 
fruit, for example, some of the plants 
look much as if they were crosses between 
the orange and the grapefruit, while oth¬ 
ers are much like crosses between the tri- 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


39 


foliate and grapefruit, with all conceiva¬ 
ble intermediates. The same is true of 
the kumquat and Satsuma crosses. 

In order to secure the great energy of 
growth just referred to it is necessary 
that a distinctly different species of cit¬ 
rus fruit be used in the cross. If asked 
* 

if it is possible to go a step farther in 
this, the answer is that this depends upon 
our ability to find still more diverse types 
of citrus fruits, than we now have. This 
I am glad to say has been done. Within 
the past year the investigations conducted 
by the Department of Agriculture has 
brought tO' light the existence of at least 
two or three entirely unsuspected types 
of citrus fruits. One is a hardy kum¬ 
quat growing in the deserts of Australia 
and able to stand temperatures but slight¬ 
ly above zero. It bears small, edible 
fruits of the type of the round kumquat. 
As we have found the kumquat to be 
extremely useful in complex hybrids 
there is much to 1 be expected from this 
desert kumquat. 

A giant kumquat, or at least a species 
of fruit more closely allied to the kum¬ 
quat than anything else we know of, has 
been, found to grow in Burma, the Ma¬ 
layan Archipelago and the Andaman Is¬ 
lands. This tree grows to a height of 
from 25-30 feet and bears a fruit from 
1 1-2 to 2 inches in diameter. 

There has also been brought to light 
in tropical Africa a whole group of edible 
citrus fruits of a new type. The trees 
have compound leaves with from three 
to seven leaflets. The leaves themselves 
are of gigantic size, sometimes 1 1-2 feet 
long and 1 foot wide, the individual leaf¬ 
lets being much larger than any ordinary 


citrus leaf. The fruits are small but 
sweet and of good flavor. 

Here, then, are three new types of cit¬ 
rus fruits which, when secured, can be 
used in complex hybrids with strong 
probability of securing great vigor among 
their descendants. The kumquat, though 
a dwarf plant, has yielded extraordinari¬ 
ly vigorous seedlings when crossed with 
the citrange—very much more vigorous 
than would be secured by crossing the cit¬ 
range with even the largest and most vig¬ 
orous type of orange. 

TANGELOS. 

One of the first crosses made by the 
writer some twelve years ago was that 
between the tangerine orange and the 
grapefruit. This was a lucky strike since 
it gave rise to 1 the Sampson Tangelo 
which represents another valuable new 
type of citrus fruit. When oranges of the 
loose skin type are crossed with grape¬ 
fruit the hybrids often produce fruits al¬ 
most entirely destitute of the bitterness 
of the grapefruit but still containing 
much of the agreeable sprightliness of 
the latter. Some of the Tangelos are 
thin-skinned and almost all are of good 
flavor. 

In this connection, the experience of 
Mr. A. Aaronsohn, Director of the Jew¬ 
ish Agricultural Experiment Station at 
Haifa, Palestine, is of interest. Himself 
a grower of the Jaffa orange and coming 
to this country unfamiliar with the grape- 
fruit, he told me that after becoming ac¬ 
customed to the latter he had practically 
lost his taste for the orange which seemed 
insipid after once he had tasted the de¬ 
licious sprightliness of the grapefruit. 


40 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Experiences of this nature make it 
seem probable that the Tangelos will be 
found to be the orange of the future. It 
should be said that they are much more 
like a good sweet orange than anything 
else but are distinctly different in having 
more zest and sprightliness. Very few 
people, seeing a good tangelo for the first 
time, would guess correctly its parentage. 
In view of the great promise of this hy¬ 
brid a large number of crosses have been 
made between all available types of kid 
glove oranges and the best of our grape¬ 
fruits. Hybrids are also being made with 
the Chinese grapefruit which, although it 
is thick-skinned and less handsome than 
our own, has in the opinion of some per¬ 
sons a distinctly better flavor. 

Certain comparatively unknown small 
hardy oranges of the Satsuma (kid 
glove) type from Japan are also being 
used in these crosses, since it has been 
found that small-fruited parents do not 
necessarily make small-fruited hybrids. 
This Tangelo breeding is, perhaps, the 
most promising field of all from the 
standpoint of the Florida orange grower. 

BREEDING GRAPEFRUITS. 

The grapefruit is perhaps the greatest 
of the Florida fruits, but as everybody 
knows it has by no means reached the 
high state of perfection attained by the 
orange. Most varieties are very seedy, 
and even if not, have some drawback or 
other. There is every reason to believe 
that radical improvements will be made 
in the grapefruit when once its breeding 
is taken up in a systematic manner. 

Mr. David G. Fairchild of the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, has given 
much attention to the securing of new 


types of grapefruit from all parts of the 
Old World, particularly from China, 
Siam and India. Many of these varie¬ 
ties are now fruiting, and although most 
of them are distinctly inferior to our 
own grapefruit, some possess certain de¬ 
sirable qualities. It is believed that the 
hybridizing of these with our own grape¬ 
fruit will be likely to yield extremely val¬ 
uable new varieties. At the same time 
crosses are being made with the trifoliata 
in the hope of securing second generation 
trifoliata -grapefruit crosses resembling 
the grapefruit in general characters but 
partaking somewhat of the hardiness of 
the trifoliata. Such hybrids would very 
likely be less seedy than the fullblood 
grapefruit. 

TESTING NEW STOCKS FOR CITRUS FRUITS. 

A botanical survey has been made of 
the relatives of the Genus Citrus . Some 
80 species of plants, belonging to 19 dif¬ 
ferent genera, may be considered as close 
relatives of our common citrus fruits. 
These for the most part are closely 
enough related so that they can be grafted 
on each other, while many of them are so 
closely related that it will be possible to 
hybridize them with each other and with 
our ordinary citrus fruits. 

Some of these are so unlike the orange 
that hybrids would not be of any value 
for their fruits even if they could be 
crossed successfully. Some, however, 
are very vigorous growing trees and have 
been found (at least in the greenhouse 
here) to be the best stocks upon which 
to graft our common citrus fruits. 

Inasmuch as the orange blight is now 
strongly suspected to be a root disease, it

is my hope that some of these very di¬ 
verse types may prove resistant to the 
blight and at the same time be excellent 
stocks in every other respect. The ac¬ 
companying photographs show all the or¬ 
dinary citrus fruits growing on a remark¬ 
able citrus relative from the Philippines— 
the Tabog or Philippine Baelfruit. This 
has trifoliate leaves and bears a hard 
shelled fruit, utterly unlike the orange in 
that it is filled with a very aromatic and 
juicy pulp and has seed chambers filled 
with gum. Nevertheless, as can be seen 
from the photographs, this promises to.be 
a most excellent stock and is among the 
most rapid growing of all the many cit¬ 
rus relatives that we have tested in our 
greenhouse. 

TESTING OUT NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS IN 

FLORIDA. 

In order to successfully carry on the 
work outlined above it will be necessary 
to have the co-operation of Florida cit¬ 
rus growers in the testing out of these 
new fruits. It is out of the question for 
the Department of Agriculture to estab¬ 
lish and maintain orange groves over a 
sufficiently wide range of soil and climate 
to give them a fair test. All we can do 
is to make the hybrids, propagate them 
and distribute budwood to co-operators 
who are willing to test out these promis¬ 
ing new fruits. 

I take this opportunity of requesting all 
Florida orange growers who are interest¬ 
ed in the trial of such new fruits to com¬ 
municate with me, care of U. S. Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture at Washington, 
D. C. 


In this way the work will be carried 
on in the most efficient manner. The mak¬ 
ing of hybrids will be largely done by ex¬ 
perts who have acquired great skill in the 
work; the propagation will be undertaken 
by other experts who, thanks to the green¬ 
house • facilities at Washington, can push 
such seedlings much more rapidly than is 
possible out of doors in Florida; while 
the testing of the fruits will be put in 
the hands of expert growers who are 
best able to look after this phase of the 
work. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Thompson: How many of the 
growers have gotten these citranges and 
what has been the result from their 
growth ? 

I would say that I secured four from 
the government and we planted them as 
we did the ordinary stock, and results 
have been far from satisfactory. They 
have not made a very good growth. The 
soil is the same as for trees that have 
outstripped them four times. 

Mr. Skinner: I received some cit- 
ranges, and the Sampson Tangelo has 
done very well. The trees look thrifty, 
but have not made as much growth as 
our trees generally make, but they seem 
to be doing fairly well and have a good, 
thrifty appearance. However, the soil is 
very poor high pine land. 

Dr. Inman: I received from the Agri¬ 
cultural Department some years ago, ten 
hybrids. They are of the grapefruit fam¬ 
ily, but what they are hybridized with, I 
cannot say nor have I had report from 
the Agricultural Department. Prof. Gal- 



42 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIEIY. 


loway, visiting Winter Haven, was very 
favorably impressed with the fruit from 
these trees. One tree is full of fruit that 
has changed but very little. We expect 
it to carry its fruit until late in July this 
.season. 

Mr. Temple: I understood the gentle¬ 
man to ask what experience any of the 
growers had had with the trifoliate base 
on high pine land. If that was the ques¬ 
tion, I have had some experience with it 
and am perfectly willing to give it to 
you. 

About six years ago, I bought one 
thousand buds of trifoliata stock—kum- 
quats, grapefruit, King oranges and half 
a dozen other. While the King did fairly 
well, the kumquats did exceptionally welL 
but above all things the successful one 
was the grapefruit. I have over 200 
grapefruit trees on trifoliata stock that 
we set out close together because we were 
given to understand that they would not 
make very large trees. I have already 
had to take out every other tree, and will 
have to take out every other tree again. 

Last year, which was five years from 
the planting of these buds, we picked and 
marketed four and one-half boxes of 
grapefruit to the tree from every one of 
the grapefruit budded on trifoliata. 


Prof. Hume: I think we must con¬ 
cede that Prof. Swingle is bound to win 
out. Some of us have had our doubts 
about it, but I must say that I believe 
if he lives long enough and works hard 
enough, he is going to succeed. Those of 
us who know Prof. Swingle, are sure 
that he will work hard enough, and we 
all hope he will live long enough to bring 
about this result—and then some. 

I believe one of these days he will pre¬ 
sent us with an orange tree that will 
stand temperatures we have not dreamed 
of.* 

Dr. Inman: I would like to* ask Mr. 
Temple how his trees have withstood the 
recent cold we have had. 

Mr. Temple : Not only the recent cold 
does not seem to have affected that grape¬ 
fruit, either the tree or the fruit, any 
more than it has the orange trees on the 
place, but in truth the trifoliata grape- 
fruit shows less effect from the frost than 
the grapefruit we have there which were 
seedlings, or budded on the lemon or sour 
stock. 

Mr. -: What soil is it ? 

Mr. Temple: What you would call 
high hammock—that is, pine with some 
oak growth interspersed through it.

Causes of Decay of Florida Oranges in Transit 

to Market 


A Review of the Work of the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Florida 1907- 

1910. 


A. V. Stubenrauch. 

In Charge of Fruit Transportation and Storage Investigations, U. S. Department of Agricul¬ 
ture. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

I regret that my former associate, Mr. 
Lloyd S. Tenny, is not able to attend this 
meeting and give an account of the inves¬ 
tigations of the causes of decay of or¬ 
anges in transit from Florida. Mr. Ten¬ 
ny had charge of this work since it was 
started four years ago, and is fully con¬ 
versant with every part of it. He it was 
who planned the experiments and demon¬ 
strations and it is largely due to his ef¬ 
forts that the work owes its progress. I 
am not as familiar with the work of the 
Bureau of Plant Industry in Florida as 
was Mr. Tenny. I have therefore to re¬ 
ly upon the data and information accu¬ 
mulated by others, and this paper, then, 
will have to be mostly in the nature of a 
review of what has been done and an ac¬ 
count of what is planned for the future. 

The citrus transportation investigations 
of the Bureau of Plant Industry were be¬ 
gun seven years ago in California. For 
some time prior to that time the orange 


growers of California urged the bureau 
to begin an investigation of the causes of 
the decay of their fruit in transit. It was 
estimated that an average of 5 per cent, 
of the entire crop shipped out decayed 
en route, thus entailing an enormous loss 
to the growers. The progress and re¬ 
sults of these California investigations are 
perhaps familiar to most of the members 
of the Florida Society. The work was 
published as Bulletin No. 123 of the Bu¬ 
reau of Plant Industry. 

The success of the California investi¬ 
gations led to requests for a similar line 
of work in Florida. In response to these 
requests M,r. Tenny was delegated to car¬ 
ry out the investigations in the Florida 
citrus districts and he and a number of 
associates have been at work and have 
given accounts of the progress of the 
work in papers read before the annual 
meetings of this society. 

The ultimate aim of fruit growing is 
profit—to sell the crop at a profit. It fol¬ 
lows that any investigations which have 




44 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


for their object the improvement of the 
crop must also have the dollars-and-cents 
end in view. The utilitarian object can¬ 
not be neglected and the improvements 
which may follow the investigations must 
be made profitable to the growers. We 
have endeavored in the work which has 
been done never to lose sight of this fact. 

It is useless to raise a crop of fruit, 
no matter how fine it may be, unless it 
can be marketed or sold at a profit. This 
selling or marketing end of the fruit in¬ 
dustry is a special business of itself, re¬ 
quiring special talents and training. Es¬ 
pecially is this true in an industry like the 
citrus fruit industry which has now 
reached such large proportions that the 
marketing problems are becoming more 
complex every day. Fruit growers are 
recognizing this fact and now employ 
specially trained and competent managers 
and salesmen to attend to the selling end 
of the business. 

The basis of all succesful marketing of 
fruit products is good fruit put up in at¬ 
tractive shape and gotten to market in 
sound condition. The problems of hand¬ 
ling a fruit crop of the extent of the cit¬ 
rus crop are problems of wide distribu¬ 
tion, the solution of which depends largely 
upon the possibility of getting the pro¬ 
duct to market in sound condition. 

The fruit growers have mastered many 
of the problems of production. These 
have to deal with the various orchard 
practices of planting, cultivating, fertil¬ 
izing, pruning, control of insect pests and 
fungus diseases. Most attention has been 
directed toward these factors in the past. 
But it has frequently happened that 
growers who do their utmost to produce 


fine fruit, and who succeed in producing 
fine fruit, nullify all these efforts by the 
way in which they prepare their product 
for market. It has not uncommonly hap¬ 
pened that the bureau workers have ob¬ 
served fine fruit which the growers have 
spared no expense to produce, utterly 
ruined in its preparation for shipment, as 
a result of the attempt to save a few 
cents per box in the cost of handling it. 
In a general way, most fruit growers re¬ 
alize that fruit must be handled carefully. 
But few realize what careful handling 
really means, and still fewer appreciate 
or realize the amount of injury which is 
actually due to careless methods of han¬ 
dling. 

Decay affects the grower in two ways: 

First: Decay is a direct loss to the 
buyer of the fruit and is always charged 
to the grower. He always has to pay for 
it. 

Second: Decay affects the market rep¬ 
utation of the grower’s pack. 

The first loss is relatively easy to cal¬ 
culate. It is estimated that the loss to 
the California growers was from i to i 
1-2 millions of dollars annually. The 
loss to the Florida growers has equaled a 
half or three-quarters of a million an¬ 
nually. 

The second loss is perhaps the more 
important, but cannot be easily estimated. 

The actual money value of the reputa¬ 
tion of brands arriving consistently sound 
and in good, attractive condition cannot 
be stated. It means not only a premium 
above ordinary market prices, but a more 
ready sale and active demand. In times 
of low market conditions such brands will 
find sale at fair profit while those with

poor reputations can hardly be given 
away. 

At one time it was thought that a cer¬ 
tain percentage of decay was inevitable 
and unavoidable. And this is true; but 
to a much more limited extent than was 
formerly recognized. Buyers take these 
losses into account in paying the produc¬ 
er for his crop, and they also take decay 
into account when they retail the fruit 
to the consumer. 

The producer is affected both ways: He 
not only receives less for his product, but 
the demand is decreased and fewer peo¬ 
ple can afford to buy. Buyers can nat¬ 
urally pay more for sound fruit which 
will hold up in the market, and they do 
not have to charge so great a margin of 
profit to the consumer. 

The bureau investigations were under¬ 
taken to determine the causes of decay 
and to make a study of the relation of 
handling the fruit for market to the oc¬ 
currence of decay, if there is such a re¬ 
lation. 

The cause of most of the decay is the 
growth of the blue mold fungus, one of 
the commonest forms of mold or decay. 
A thorough study of the behavior of the 
fungus on citrus fruits was made both in 
the laboratory and in the packing houses. 
What is here stated may be familiar to 
almost everybody present, but the point is 
so important that it is well worthy of rep¬ 
etition. 

Blue mold is not a true parasite, i. e., 
it does not live on healthy living tissue. 
It lives and grows on dead tissue just as 
the higher plants live in the soil and draw 
their nourishment from it. The fungus 
must have dead tissue on which to start. 
It must have moisture and warmth. It 


has not the power to penetrate the sound 
healthy skin of fruits. The fruit as it 
leaves the tree is a living organism. The 
rind is a complete covering of living, ac¬ 
tive cells which protect the fruit from the 
attacks of the fungus. But let some of 
these cells be killed by a bruise, or a 
scratch, or a cut—an abrasion of any 
kind—the fungus spores will germinate 
and grow at the injured places when the 
proper conditions of moisture and heat 
are present. These conditions usually ex¬ 
ist in the packed box of fruit. 

These facts were worked out in Cal¬ 
ifornia on a large scale in both packing 
houses and laboratory. Sound fruit cov¬ 
ered with spores held in rooms where 
both the temperature and humidity were 
kept very high for two weeks showed 
practically no decay. Injured fruit un¬ 
der the same conditions always rotted. 

The same principles were worked out 
in packed fruit and fruit in transit. 

This general principle—that the blue 
mold has not the power to penetrate the 
sound healthy skin of the fruit—was the 
only thing in the nature of “a theory” 
brought into the Florida work at the 
start. Will the principle of the relation 
of handling to decay hold true in Florida 
as it did in California? There were no 
previous theories other than this, and the 
workers set out to ascertain the actual 
facts by careful investigation and experi¬ 
ments. A close study of the conditions 
of handling oranges from the tree to the 
packing house, into the box and then 
through to the markets was made. A 
large amount of data have been accumu¬ 
lated. Fruit from different sections, and 
grown under different conditions was 
studied and the work was extended 


46 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


through several seasons. All effort was 
made to have the work done under con¬ 
ditions as practical and as nearly com¬ 
mercial as possible. This has been no 
simple “laboratory” experiment. 

In brief: It has been found to our full 
satisfaction that the general principles re¬ 
lating to the behavior of the blue mold 
and the relation of handling to the oc¬ 
currence of decay are as true for Florida 
as they are for California. There is a 
definite relation between the handling of 
the fruit and resulting injury, and the de¬ 
cay caused by blue mold. 

It was found further that the Florida 
orange is more tender and more easily in¬ 
jured; yet sound uninjured Florida or¬ 
anges do not rot any more than sound 
California oranges, all conditions being 
the same. Conversely, injured Califor¬ 
nia oranges are just as susceptible to rot 
as injured Floridas under like conditions. 

This is a very important point and is 
really the crux of the whole matter. 
There are sufficient facts and data to 
prove to our full satisfaction the appli¬ 
cation of this general principle for Flor¬ 
ida conditions. 

What remains now to be done is to 
demonstrate the application to the Flor¬ 
ida growers. Our work, then, in the fu¬ 
ture will be in the nature of an educa¬ 
tional and demonstrational campaign us¬ 
ing the data we have obtained as the ba¬ 
sis of the work. The work of the past 
two seasons has been in the nature of such 
a campaign and next season, at least, it 
is planned to extend the work along these 
lines. The work has not been as exten¬ 
sive in the past as we would have liked 
to have it, owing to the lack of men and 
money. Last season the frost cut the 


work far short of what was originally 
planned. 

In order to make our educational cam¬ 
paign effective and of real value we must 
have the active and hearty co-operation 
of all the growers. We have had excel¬ 
lent co-operation in the past. We need 
more of it. It is not sufficient to give 
us respectful attention or tolerance. We 
need active support and interest. 

The application of the principles 
worked out are more difficult in Florida 
than in California. Industrial conditions 
are different. Weather, climate and sea¬ 
sonal conditions are different. 

We have found the California Fruit 
Growers' Exchange a great help in dis¬ 
seminating the results of our work in 
California. The Florida Citrus Ex¬ 
change organized this year has been 
of great assistance in extending and 
using the work and its results. 
More growers can be reached and 
with less effort than without the organ¬ 
ization. The establishment of new pack¬ 
ing houses with improved equipment has 
helped. The taking over of picking and 
handling to be done by gangs working 
under trained foremen has materially as¬ 
sisted in making our work more effective. 
This is not said with any lack of appre¬ 
ciation of the valuable co-operation which 
has been given by individuals and inde¬ 
pendent shippers and handlers, and we 
hope to continue to receive their active 
support. 

I had a trip through many of the Flor¬ 
ida. citrus districts last winter. From 
what I saw it is apparent to me that more 
careful and better methods are being 
sought and the desire to improve handling 
conditions is general.

Four years ago, Tenny stated before 
this society that a conservative estimate 
placed the loss from decay of oranges in 
transit from Florida at from io to 15 
per cent. We do not know what the av¬ 
erage loss was last season. But now we 
do know that by far the greater part of 
any such loss is preventable if care is 
used in the preparation of the fruit for 
market. 

Last season the work of gathering 
picking and handling data was continued. 
This actually became an inspection of the 
work being done in different groves and 
packing houses. In several instances the 
inspection of the work -of particular 
gangs of pickers was continued through¬ 
out The season, the results being used to 
demonstrate the necessity of doing more 
careful work. In this way, also, the 
careful and careless workmen were dis¬ 
covered. 

Last season’s investigations also< in¬ 
cluded a series of washing experiments. 
These were carried on to determine the 
effect of washing Florida oranges. 

A series of shipping experiments was 
also started. These included a compari¬ 
son of sound fruit carefully handled and 
packed with the same fruit handled and 
packed under ordinary commercial con¬ 
ditions. Part of each lot was packed and 
shipped the same day it was picked, and 
parts two and four days after picking. 

PICKING AND HANDLING INVESTIGATIONS 

This work was done at Arcadia, Bar¬ 
tow, Bradentown, Florence Villa, Clear¬ 
water, Largo, Dunedin, Sutherland, Pal¬ 
metto, Wauchula, Winter Haven and 
Winter Park. 


The first year of our work, 1906-7, the 
total average of injuries for all the fruit 
examined was 12.4 per cent., including 
clipper cuts and other types of mechani¬ 
cal injuries (scratches, punctures, etc.), 
and 6.7 per cent, long stems. 

The accompanying table shows the re¬ 
sults of these inspection records during 
the past four years.

The averages of clipper cuts are about 
the same for the first two years. There 
was a material reduction of this type 
of injury during the last two years. It 
can be reduced still lower under actual 
commercial conditions. 

There was a material increase in the 
percentage of mechanical injuries other 
than clipper cuts found during 1909-10. 
It is probable that this figure is too high 
to represent average conditions of the 
entire State. Owing to the cold weather 
the data are not as complete as we would 
like to have them. The figures show, 
however, that there is room for much 
improvement before the standard found 
possible under large commercial condi¬ 
tions is reached. 

The table shows a high percentage of 
long stems. It is important that this per¬ 
centage be materially reduced. A 
prominent grower of California has said 
that he fears long stems more than clip¬ 
per cuts. “A clipper cut orange,” said he, 
“is finished and the injury is only to 
itself, but a long stem is like a murderer 
turned loose.” One long stemmed or-

ange may injure several others in the 
course of handling and packing. 

Is it possible to handle oranges care¬ 
fully enough on a commercial scale to 
eliminate injury? I find that there was 
considerable discussion on this point aft¬ 
er the reading of Mr. Tenny’s first pa¬ 
per before this society. Many of the 
growers seemed to doubt that it would 
be practicable under Florida conditions 
to handle without injury. The best an¬ 
swer to the question is the fact that it is 
being done, not only in California, but 
in Florida also. 

The accompanying table shows the rec¬ 
ords obtained last season in different 
packing houses.

The figures show a very wide range. 
Some are very low and below the aver¬ 
age. The range is from i per cent, clip¬ 
per cuts to 5 per cent. The range of long 
stem percentages is still greater running 
from i per cent to 19 per cent. In two 
instances both the clipper cut and long 
stem percentages are very low, showing 
very good work being done. In a num¬ 
ber of cases, however, the reduction of 
clipper cutting seems to have been ob¬ 
tained at the expense of making long 
stems. This must be avoided. In Cal¬ 
ifornia the rule of making two cuts to 
every orange not in plain sight has been 


adopted. This results both in the reduc¬ 
tion of long stems and clipper cuts and 
also does away with the picker dropping 
the fruit directly from the tree into the 
bag or basket. 

The following table shows the records 
of a picking gang at the beginning of 
the season and later after the inspections 
and instruction of the government work¬ 
ers had their effect. The table also 
shows the results obtained in the same 
district by a grower who insisted on do¬ 
ing his own picking and another record 
of fruit picked by a gang working under 
the box-payment plan.

The figures hardly require explanation. 
They show that it is possible to get good 
work done. Everything depends on the 
foreman. The plan of inspecting each 
picker’s work during the day’s run is the 
one adopted to hold injuries and long 
stems in check. In this way the pickers 
who are doing rough and careless 
work are discovered and can be repri¬ 
manded or eliminated. The man who 
habitually handles roughly and cannot or 
will not be careful must be discharged. 
He is an expensive workman at any 
price. 

Naturally, it will cost more to handle 
in this way. But there are ample exam¬ 
ples to show that it pays well to do this. 
I am more familiar with conditions in 
California, but I dare say there are exam¬ 
ples in Florida sufficient to prove this. If

the saving in the fruit alone is taken into 
consideration, there is ample saving to 
pay for careful work. If we add to this 
the value of the reputation for soundness 
and holding quality on the market, -the 
extra cost will be returned many times 
over. In California frequently differ¬ 
ences of from 25 to 50 cents and even 
more per box above the ordinary market 
prices are given for brands which have a 
reputation for soundness. It is impos¬ 
sible to estimate the money value of a 
good reputation. 

In California it has required the reor¬ 
ganization of the business of handling the 
crop in order to insure careful handling. 
The insistence of quality of work instead 
of quantity has necessitated a close super¬ 
vision of the handling both in the groves 
and in the packing houses. More and 
more, associations are taking over the 
picking, putting in gangs working under 
efficient foremen. Some associations ac¬ 
complish good results by having a rigid 
system of inspection, insisting that the 
grower do careful work. 

With the number of new associations 
which are being organized in Florida, it 
will be possible to introduce better meth¬ 
ods. Good work must be made the basis 
of the business and it will be necessary 
for the association to exercise close su¬ 
pervision and possibly control of all op¬ 
erations of handling the fruit from the 
tree to market. 

WASHING EXPERIMENTS. 

These experiments were made in order 
to determine the amount of injury and 
decay resulting from washing. Wash¬ 


ing is necessary where the fruit has been 
blackened by smut following white fly 
scale. It seems to be a mistake to wash 
simply because it is supposed to improve 
the appearance of the fruit. In Califor¬ 
nia our investigations demonstrated that 
decay bore a direct relation to the amount 
and character of the handling to which 
the fruit was subjected. As a result, all 
unnecessary handling was eliminated. 
Many houses discontinued dry brushing 
when it was shown that brushing might 
be responsible for heavy decay. 

When the California work was begun, 
it was commonly supposed that fruit pro¬ 
duced near the coast was weaker and 
had poorer carrying quality than fruit 
produced inland away from coastal influ¬ 
ences. Unquestionably there was heavier 
decay in the coast fruit. It was found 
that this was not an inherent quality of 
the fruit itself. It was due to the extra 
handling necessary to put the coast fruit 
in condition for shipment. Washing was 
found to be largely responsible for the 
heavier decay in the coast fruit. Owing 
to scale, fully 90 per cent, of the coast 
fruit had to be washed, while little if any 
of the inland fruit required washing. By 
subjecting the inland fruit to the same 
conditions of washing it was shown that 
decay was nearly as heavy as in the coast 
fruit, and that if the coast fruit did not 
require washing it had practically as 
good holding quality as the inland fruit. 

The result also showed that in the op¬ 
eration of washing considerable improve¬ 
ment could be made. For example, much 
greater decay followed washing in dirty 
water than when clean water was used.

There was also considerable difference 
resulting from the use of different ma¬ 
chines and the speed and manner of op¬ 
erating the machines. 

The experiments made last season in 
Florida were designed to show the effect 
following washing of Florida oranges. 
The chart and table show the averages 
of all the washing experiments made in 
Florida.

The figures show that there is an in¬ 
crease of decay following washing. The 
washed carefully picked fruit shows more 
decay than the not washed commercially 
picked fruit. There is also more in¬ 
crease of decay following washing of the 
commercially picked lots. 

The high percentage of decay follow¬ 
ing the washing of long-stemmed fruit 
is significant. The picking data present¬ 
ed show that long stems are common in 
Florida picking. When such fruit has to 
be washed it is important to have both 
the picking and the actual washing work 
done as carefully as possible. 

SHIPPING EXPERIMENTS. 

Our shipping experiments last season 
were not satisfactory in that the work 
was seriously curtailed by the frost and 
the continuity of the experiments was de¬ 
stroyed. It is felt that the data are too 
meagre to justify any definite conclu¬ 
sions. We need much more data and it 
is hoped that the experiments can be ex¬ 
tended next season. 


The plan last season was to ship ex¬ 
perimental series consisting of sound 
fruit handled and packed very care¬ 
fully under the supervision of 
the bureau workers, in compar¬ 
ison with the same fruit picked 
and packed under ordinary commercial 
packing house conditions. Along with 
these, lots made up of selected injured 
fruit were to have been included. The 
plan also included the holding of the fruit 
after arrival to study its market holding 
qualities for three weeks, inspections be¬ 
ing made on arrival and one, two and 
three weeks after arrival. 

A study of the delay in packing and 
shipping was also attempted. For this, 
part of the lots were packed and shipped 
the same day they were picked, part held 
two days and part held four days before 
packing and shipping. Only a small part 
of this work outlined was carried out ow¬ 
ing to the cold weather. 

While the data are too meagre to be 
definitely conclusive, they show, (i) That 
the least decay follows immediate pack¬ 
ing and shipping; (2) That there is least 
decay in the carefully handled fruit and 
most in the injured; (3) That there is 
less decay following delayed carefully 
picked fruit than delayed commercially 
handled or injured fruit. 

Sound fruit stands the delay without 
serious loss, but where there are consid¬ 
erable amounts of injuries present, the 
quicker the fruit is packed and shipped 
the less the decay shown on arrival. 

In the holding tests after arrival, the 
carefully handled fruit showed a very 
great advantage. The average of the few 
shipments we were able to make was 5.2 
per cent, decay after three weeks holding 





FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


51 


of the carefully handled lots, while the 
commercial packs showed an average of 
10.8 per cent, after the same length of 
time. The same relation is shown by the 
delayed lots. The carefully handled lots 
delayed 2 days before packing showed 
5.1 per cent, after 3 weeks in market, and 
that delayed four days showed 7.3 per 
cent, after the same time. 

The delayed commercial pack after. 
three weeks showed 15 per cent, for the 
2-day delay and 20.2 per cent, for the 
4-day delay. 

These results are consistent with the 
results of our California shipping work 
which was based on a large number of 
shipments. I have no doubt that similar 
results will follow the extension of the 
shipping investigations from Florida. 


DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Temple: May I ask the professor 
whether his figures of percentages of 
washed versus unwashed fruit are the 
sum total of all his washed experiments, 
or just a specified text? Is it not true, 
however, that under certain circumstances 
there was not only no greater decay but 
in some cases less decay on the washed 
than the unwashed fruit? 

Mr. Stubenrauch: It sometimes hap¬ 
pens, that there is practically no differ¬ 
ence, and in some instances there is less 
decay in washed fruit; but it would be 
unsafe to infer from this, that washing 
prevents decay. 

Mr. Temple: Now, of course, it is 
hard to go up against a proposition where 
the scientific men have carefully compiled 
statistics to prove their point to you. But 


in my experience, I am certainly led to 
believe that careful washing will remove 
some of the conditions which tend to 
cause decay, that may be present before 
washing. I do not believe that washing 
the fruit, when it is done as it should be, 
makes it more liable to decay, nor, of 
course, do' I believe that mechanically in¬ 
jured fruit will not decay even if care¬ 
fully washed. 

It really does seem to me that there are 
some cases where the washing of fruit 
seems to remove something that causes, 
the decay. 

Mr. Stubenrauch: Please understand: 
that I am not prepared to state positively 
that washing will or will not injure the 
fruit. I have simply described our tests 
and the results which have caused us to 
form the conclusions we have. 

Mr.—I would like to ask if any 
success has been met with where antisep¬ 
tics are used in the wash. 

Mr—I tried one experiment. I 
washed the oranges with water in which 
there was a small percentage of salicylic 
acid. After several days the oranges 
were carefully examined and the decay 
was found to be practically zero. 

Mr. Stubenrauch : We tried a number 
of these experiments in California, and 
had a man there one season working on 
that alone, but we did not get any re¬ 
sults that were worth noting. 

Mr. Young: Has it been found that 
there was any different percentage of de¬ 
cayed fruit caused by the different wash¬ 
ing machines? 

Mr. Stubenrauch: I have no doubt 
that some machines do more injury than 
others. It usually goes back, however, to 
the man who runs the machine. One man 





52 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


can get good work done by a machine, 
where another can do a whole lot of in¬ 
jury. The same is true of clippers. One 
man can take a rather undesirable pair 
of clippers and bring in his fruit in good 
condition, while another man with a 
much better clipper brings in his fruit in 
poor shape. 

Mr. Porcher: I would like to ask the 
professor—and I do not intend to criti¬ 
cize his investigation—if it would not be 
possible to get descriptions in detail of 
the machines and the methods, that we 
may have instructions and advice that 
will be beneficial. I am quite positive 
that oranges can be washed with benefit 
to the fruit and the growers’ pocket, but 
I am also aware that unless the machine 
is properly handled, it will do great in¬ 
jury. 

Now, if we could have plain statements 
from someone who knows as to the best 
machines, whether sponges are used, 
what number of sponges, the flow of wa¬ 
ter passing through the cylinder, and 
such information as this, 1 am confident 
that it would be of interest and profit. 
We take it that the professor knows all 
about the proper machine for washing 
fruit; how it should be run and how it 
should be maintained. There are many 
machines that are perfect in their way; on 
the other hand, I have seen machines 
where there is a lack of sponges, where 
the lining has been ripped or torn and the 
fruit jammed under the lining, and the 
odor from one of these machines was dis¬ 
tinctly apparent. One of the best things 
we can have around the place, is a man 
with a good smeller. He can detect lots 
of things that way that might otherwise 
go unnoticed. 


Mr. Stubenrauch: You can get the in¬ 
formation you want from the Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture, or from some of the 
society members who are washing their 
fruit successfully. 

I agree with you as to the difference 
in washers. I, went into a number of 
packing houses in Florida last winter, 
and, as you say, there were some houses 
I didn’t want to go into without a hand¬ 
kerchief over my nose. Others were be¬ 
ing run on very satisfactory lines and 
were turning out fruit in fine condition. 

Mr. Porcher: I had a party of friends 
in the house and they wanted to see my 
machine in operation, so they went down 
to the washer just as they were dressed; 
they were in evening dress; my wife was 
one of them. They finally took charge 
of the washer; just pinned up their skirts 
so that they would not trip over them, 
and did all the work themselves, and I 
don’t think there was a spot or a stain 
on any of their dresses. 

Now, along the lines of injury'where 
water touches fruit. I took a box of 
fruit and dumped the contents carefully 
into a ditch. I wanted to try a little ex¬ 
periment to know just what damage it 
would do. The fruit remained there sev¬ 
eral days. I removed the fruit and found 
one orange pretty badly decayed, but that 
particular orange we had noticed before 
putting it into the water and had remark¬ 
ed at that time that there was a sign of 
blue mold on it. The fruit was washed 
off very carefully, and then we examined 
it and found it absolutely uninjured, and 
we packed it and marked it and shipped 
it, and it carried in good order. The 
point is that moisture does not injure 



FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


53 


fruit that has been carefully handled and 
is not cut or bruised. 

Mr. Stubenrauch: That takes you 
right back to careful handling. You get 
a machine that is all right with a careful 
man to run it, and you may get the fruit 
washed without injury, provided care 
has been taken with it all along the line, 
but if you have a lot of injured fruit 
coming in from the grove and put it 
through the washers, you will give it ten 
chances to one to be made more sub¬ 
ject to decay. 

Mr. Hart: Now, take the matter of 
clipper cutting or long stems. Don’t 
you find a marked difference between dif¬ 
ferent varieties of oranges in regard to 
that? Take the pineapple orange; there 
is no need of anyone clipper cutting a 
pineapple orange or of getting long stems. 

In California, I noticed that the stem 
of the orange is in more of a pit; the.or¬ 
ange is rough around the calyx and is 
very subject to clipper cutting, making it 
much more difficult to clip the stems 
close; therefore they do double clipping. 
The more careful growers and shippers 
have their fruit clipped twice. It seems 
to me that would be entirely useless with 
the Florida orange, as grown in most por¬ 
tions of the State. 

A great many have told me it was im¬ 
possible to get their fruit clipped prop¬ 
erly. I work twelve to fifteen hands, but 
it isn’t very often I have to* discharge a 
man because he does not do his work 
right. I sometimes find good workers 
who are mentally weak and in two in¬ 
stances I decided that it was impossible 
to teach them, to do good picking, but as 
a general thing I have no difficulty in 
training men so that there will not be 


more than one or two per cent, of long 
stem oranges. 

When these go into the washer, every 
one of them is examined. Either the eye 
or the thumb or the finger gets into* the 
calyx and if the stem is long it goes into 
a box to be gone over and clipped before 
being washed. 

I think it is safe to say that if the fruit 
is picked properly and washed properly 
with a Warner washer, it does not do 
it any injury to be washed. I have tested 
it repeatedly in the years gone by, wash¬ 
ing some and leaving some unwashed, 
and putting the twO' side by side, and in 
every instance so far, the washed fruit 
has stood up the best. 

I am afraid of brush washers. They 
may be all right, but I am afraid of them. 
I am not advertising the Warner washer, 
but I have tested that more thoroughly 
than any other and I believe it is abso¬ 
lutely safe if properly handled, but it is 
not properly handled in many cases. 
Either the operators do not gauge the 
fruit so that there is the proper holding 
back or resistance to its going through, 
or it is overloaded; some rivet head or 
other roughness inside the cylinder is not 
looked after and done away with, long 
stems are overlooked or too little water 
is used. The principle is simply a lift¬ 
ing up and rolling* down of both sponges 
and fruit, and with right conditions no 
harm can result. 

I believe a great deal of the injury in 
the washers is in the improper handling of 
the washers themselves. 

Mr. Stubenrauch: I do not doubt 
that you are right. I can cite an exam¬ 
ple that came under my own notice. Out 
in California we were able to compare 



54 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


the same machine being handled by two 
different parties. It happened that in one 
place a machine was causing consider¬ 
able—that is, we were getting a large per¬ 
centage of decayed fruit from the lot 
washed with that machine. The house 
had great faith in the machine itself, but 
we were almost ready to condemn it. We 
don’t, as a rule, advocate or condemn any 
machine. However, we happened to run 
across a case of the same machine being 
used with practically no decay at all in 
another part of the State. This as you 
see, brings us back to the old question of 
the “man behind the gun.” 

Now, as to the matter of long stems; 
that is a very important matter. Your 
fruit is very tender; much more so than 
the California fruit; full of juice and 
thin skinned. In the washing, the or¬ 
anges are knocking against each other; if 
there is a single orange with a long and 
jagged stem, it may do a whole lot of 
damage. 

Another matter comes to* my mind, and 
that is the clippers. You have to watch 
out very carefully to keep them in good 
condition. You will find that your work 
will be much more satisfactory if the 
clippers are kept sharp and close so that 
you do not have a jagged stem. We find 
a great deal of difference when the clip¬ 
per is kept tight instead of loose and dull. 
When the clipper is in such bad shape 
that the stem is broken off instead of 
clean cut, it leaves a sharp point or 
points that will do a great deal of injury. 

Mr. Hart: I think it makes a great 
difference as to the clippers you use. I 
have clippers which have been sent to me 
to test. I won’t say that I have had sam¬ 
ples of every kind of clipper, but I have 


had a good many. I have not reported 
on but one or two of them because I have 
found that they were not properly made. 
A great many of them have the bevel side 
on the side next the orange and it would 
be so long that you could not get close 
enough to the orange to cut it off prop¬ 
erly. To 1 get that bevel just right seems 
to be the most difficult thing for the man¬ 
ufacturers to do. 

Mr. Stubenrauch: I don’t think anv 

« 

of them get it just right, Mr. Hart. I 
have never seen one that was just right. 

Mr. Hart: I attacked that problem 
and got results that were pretty satisfac¬ 
tory, but afterwards there was careless¬ 
ness and the clippers were not kept in 
first class shape. To get the best results, 
the clippers must be given attention, but 
if the clippers are made right, you will 
escape getting the clipper cut fruit. 

Mr. Temple: Mr. Hart stated that 
while he had had no experience with the 
brush washer, he does not like it. Now, 
I would not discuss the brush washer if 
I was not familiar with it and had not 
used it. I have used two all winter. On 
one occasion, when some tests were made, 
some fruit was packed, unwashed; other 
fruit was packed, washed through the 
brush washers. At the end of three 
weeks we opened the fruit and found 
three decayed oranges in the box of un¬ 
washed fruit and two in the box of 
washed fruit. After the fruit was open¬ 
ed and examined, it stood in the pack¬ 
ing house for more than two weeks and 
finally they asked me what to do with the 
brush-washed fruit. I told them to re¬ 
pack it and send it to a hospital in Or¬ 
lando. We didn’t want to ship re-packed 
fruit. They repacked the fruit, sent it 


9 


FLORIDA (STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


53 


to the hospital, but it seems they had just 
received a consignment of other fruit 
' sent to them. It stayed around the hos¬ 
pital for awhile, and they finally turned it 
over to a grocery store to sell the fruit 
and turn the money over to them, as they 
needed the money more than the fruit. 

When I discovered that a grocery 
store was selling some of our fruit at re¬ 
tail, I looked into the matter to see how 
they got hold of it, and traced back and 
found out that it was the self-same box 
of fruit. I watched very closely the sale 
of that fruit to find what percentage of 
decay showed up in it. The fruit was all 
sold at retail, taking probably two weeks 
in the sale, and while the unwashed fruit 
showed almost one-half decay, the re¬ 
packed, washed fruit did not have a sin¬ 
gle sign of decay when it was sold here 
seven weeks after it was originally pack¬ 
ed. 

Mr. Kilgore: We had a washing ex¬ 
periment in our packing house which 
turned out practically the same. The 
company got in a new brush washer. We 
were afraid to use it, but to get it “bro¬ 
ken in” we washed the fruit in a car 
which had been standing on our siding 
for some time. After the oranges were 
washed, the water was pretty greasy. To 
see how the experiment worked, we pack¬ 
ed a few crates of the washed and of the 
unwashed fruit. The unwashed fruit 
rotted very badly and the washed fruit 
rotted very little. 

Mr. Stubenrauch: Your washed 

fruit was probably selected fruit. Of 
course, in that case it would be hard to 
make a fair comparison. 

Mr. Kilgore : There was no selection. 

Mr. Stubenrauch: I think all of this 


discussion confirms the facts brought by 
our work regarding washing. All of the 
gentlemen who have shown that they are 
not getting decay following washing are 
in a class of handlers far above the gen¬ 
eral average, and the handling of the 
fruit in their houses is being very care¬ 
fully done. Our results show, both here 
in Florida, and in California, that every 
extra process or handling that has to be 
given the fruit is a place where injury 
is liable to occur, and that where these 
processes are necessary to place the fruit 
in marketable condition, the necessity for 
extreme care becomes doubly important. 

Mi*. Stockbridge: Speaking about the 
additional care that has so much to do 
with results. The packing of fruit cer¬ 
tainly has a great influence on the amount 
of decay. I would mention that I have 
always taken pretty good care of my 
fruit and yet in spite of ordinary precau¬ 
tions, the percentages of decay were 
quite large. My crop of 1908 showed 
that the average percentage of decay was 
between 15 per cent, and 20 per cent., 
and yet my fruit was pretty well put up, 
too, and I suppose that as the average 
man goes, I put my fruit up about as well 
as the best of them and took about the 
same precautions. 

Now, after attending the meeting of 
the society at Daytona last year, and 
hearing the report of the committee on 
the investigation of the packing methods 
of California, I went to my grove and 
talked the matter over with my superin¬ 
tendent and when we came to ship the 
next crop, that is, the crop of 1909, I 
made a careful test of what I hoped were 
better methods. I shipped a carload to 
Atlanta and had it opened by three or 



56 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


four commission men. There were sixty- 
five boxes out of the car I opened my¬ 
self personally, and out of the sixty-five 
boxes there was not a single decayed or¬ 
ange. I don’t suppose out of the whole 
car there were forty decayed oranges. 
We did not wash the fruit, but we used 
the clippers distributed by the society last 
year and kept them sharp, and every man 
who went into the grove or packing 


house, wore gloves. Every man’s finger 
nails were kept short and protected. The 
result was a saving of about 15 per cent, 
in decayed fruit. 

It was my fruit that was chosen for 
the Taft banquet at Atlanta. They 
searched all over the city to get fruit 
they thought was good enough, and fin¬ 
ally purchased twenty-eight boxes of my 
fruit for that occasion. 


Methods of Citrus Culture 


C. H. Thompson. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 

While I have reason to question the 
good judgment of the committee in put¬ 
ting me on the program for a paper on 
this important subject, as there are others 
who are better qualified, yet as one who 
is vitally interested in the citrus industry, 
I shall not shirk my duty, and trust that 
what I may offer may be a help to some 
one engaged in the industry. 

I have little that is new to offer, as the 
method here advocated to a greater or 
lesser degree is followed by a large num¬ 
ber of the growers of the State. 

Having been in the business for many 
years, and having met with a fair meas¬ 
ure of success, I think I am justified in 
advising my fellow growers to seriously 
consider the method as here set forth. 

What I may say applies to that char¬ 
acter of soil known as the high pine land, 
and while it may apply successfully to 
other types of soil I am not advocating 
it for such, for my experience has been 
confined to the high pine land. 

As you well know there is very little 
natural fertility in such soil, but it acts 
as a fine anchorage for the trees, and 
many of us prefer to give our trees just 
the food we wish them to assimilate. By 
so doing we think we make a superior 
quality of fruit. This superiority will be 


governed by the knowledge of the grower, 
and his practice in caring for his groves. 

While the high pine land is deficient 
in plant food it has many fine qualities, 
among the most important being its re¬ 
sistance to drouth, as it is a well known 
fact that groves on such lands will not 
suffer nearly so much in a long contin¬ 
ued drouth, as groves on, heavier and 
lower lands. Such soil also is very easy 
of cultivation, and to keep in good me¬ 
chanical condition. 

We take it for granted some one may 
read these lines who has in mind the 
planting of a grove, so would advise the 
careful selecting* of good ground and lo¬ 
cation. A soil with clay a few feet un¬ 
der the surface with good drainage is an 
ideal condition. If it is land that has 
never been cultivated, and I prefer such 
for a grove, there will likely be some na¬ 
tive timber on it. The first important 
step is to completely clear the land of all 
trees, stumps and roots. If these are left 
in the grove to be removed later they 
will likely be for years an annoyance and 
a nuisance. Put the ground in thorough 
preparation by deep plowing and cultiva¬ 
tion, then plant good strong thrifty trees 
in rows thirty feet apart, and twenty-five 
feet in the row. This may seem, while 
trees are small, like a waste of ground.

but in a few years you will see the ad¬ 
vantage of being able to get through your 
grove with wagon and other farm imple¬ 
ments, without damage to the outhang- 
ing limbs. 

You will not make much of a mistake 
if you confine your choice of varieties to 
the Pineapple and Valencia late oranges, 
and Silver Cluster, Walters or some oth¬ 
er good sized and shaped grapefruit. 

While an orange tree can be transplant¬ 
ed any month of the year, I prefer plant¬ 
ing about the first to- the fifteenth of 
January, always using a liberal quantity 
of water when planting; and unless you 
can water these young trees at intervals 
-during the dry weeks that follow, until 
the rainy season opens, you had better not 
take the trouble to plant them, for you 
run the risk of losing some and stunt¬ 
ing the balance. 

When planting, incorporate a little fer¬ 
tilizer in the soil and use only a limited 
^quantity the first year increasing the 
- quantity each year, using a good quality 
< of orange tree fertilizer. For about three 
-years keep the tree rows clean by fre- 
vquent cultivation during the growing sea¬ 
son, but avoid cultivating late in the fall 
and winter. Space between rows can be 
planted to any good cover crops to shade 
the ground and build up the soil. 

For bearing groves I advise keeping 
the top soil, from caking by frequent har¬ 
rowing with Acme harrow. This, in the 
spring of the year while dry, should be 
constant, and after rains, harrow to con¬ 
serve the moisture. By July or beginning 
of rainy season stop harrowing and let 
grass grow. Do not let the grass or 
weeds grow too rank under and near the 
trees, but keep it mowed down. If grove 


is in good condition and soil rich, you 
can cut and remove grass for hay; but if 
soil needs the vegetation, or is lacking in 
humus, better build the soil by leaving 
hay on the ground, and buy your hay or 
raise it from outside lands. 

While one can raise trees for a few 
years and keep them in a fairly thrifty 
condition without fertilizer, by cultivation 
and raising leguminous crops to build up 
the soil, it is utterly impossible to make 
the trees fruit without a liberal applica¬ 
tion of a good fertilizer. 

For young trees I prefer a fertilizer 
made up of from four to five per cent, 
ammonia, five to six per cent, phosphoric 
acid and six to eight per cent, potash, ap¬ 
plied two or three times from spring up 
to September. 

For bearing groves I prefer to- give a 
fair application in February, before the 
swelling of the buds, of fertilizer made 
up of about 5 per cent, ammonia (half of 
which from nitrate of soda, the quicker 
acting, and half from sulphate of am¬ 
monia, the slower acting form), 6 per 
cent, phosphoric acid and 6 per cent, sul¬ 
phate of potash. 

In the latter part of May or first of 
June a liberal quantity of fertilizer with 
2 per cent, sulphate of ammonia, 6 to 7 
per cent, phosphoric acid and 10 to 12 
per cent, sulphate of potash. 

In the middle to last of November, my 
third and last application, a liberal quan¬ 
tity 2 to 4 per cent, sulphate of ammonia, 
6 to 7 per cent, phosphoric acid and 10 to 
12 per cent, sulphate of potash: the year¬ 
ly quantity being about forty pounds to 
every 10 boxes of fruit.

The quantity of. ammonia for each ap¬ 
plication. will have to be governed by the 
condition and need of the trees. 

While there is a growing tendency to¬ 
wards governing our insect enemies by 
introducing their natural enemies among 
them; yet this will not always accomplish 
the desired result. 


I have kept the scale under good 
control by fungus and lady birds. 

I have failed thus far to discover any 
natural enemy of the rust mite, and in 
order to have desirably bright fruit I 
spray three or four times during the sea¬ 
son with sulphur solution.

Mr. President f Ladies and Gentlemen : 

If there ever was a case of “many 
men, many minds,” I am sure it is in the 
handling of a. citrus grove. In view 
of this fact, I'll merely treat the subject 
from; my point of view, as I am sure we 
will have some discussions embodying 
views and methods vastly different from 
mine. In the handling of a citrus grove 
one must be governed by his own pe¬ 
culiar conditions as hardly the same con¬ 
ditions prevail in any two groves. Then, 
besides, we all have our little pet theories, 
which may possess more or less merit. 
The best place to start with this subject 
is with the raw land, which should be the 
best obtainable. Then be careful of each 
step in its development, to avoid, if pos¬ 
sible, doing anything that it may cost 
you dearly to undo. The old adage of 
“an ounce of prevention 1 ' is equally ap¬ 
plicable here. In clearing pine land, I 
clear off all the undergrowth, burn the 
saw palmetto roots, and save the ashes 
to be scattered over the ground later. 
Then I cut the pine trees, bore the stumps 
with an inch and a half augur, which has 
had the shank lengthened to about 31-2 


feet over all, put in sufficient 60 per cent, 
dynamite to open up the stump well, then 
put fire in and burn the stump out, cut¬ 
ting up the logs and piling them on the 
burning stump, unless I have some other 
use for them. It pays to- get the pine 
trees absolutely off the land, “lock, stock, 
and barrel.” After burning the stump as 
best we can, men with grub hoes and 
axes take out the remaining roofs down 
to a depth sufficient to allow a plow to 
run. I then line off the tree rows and 
windrow all remaining trash, such as 
pine tops, underbrush, palmetto' leaves, 
etc., half way between the tree rows, and 
then break up the tree row with a turn 
plow having a good cutter on. I prefer 
a one-horse plow, as it cuts narrow fur¬ 
rows and consequently leaves ground in 
better shape. The best plow that I have 
ever found’for this work is a Brinley No. 
1, Prairie, with a “fine”, cutter. It does 
fine work, is strong and light, and a good 
able bodied horse or mule can pull it very 
readily. Our land is rather low and com¬ 
pact, with clay subsoil, which holds wa¬ 
ter during the wet season, so we have to 
bed our trees, with water furrows be¬ 
tween rows, leading to cross ditches; con- 




60 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sequently I throw two furrows together 
for the tree row, and continue turning 
dirt towards the two furrows till I get a 
strip about ten feet wide. This leaves 
the trash undisturbed on the unplowed 
middle. Then I stake off for the trees 
and set them, move the trash in between 
the trees, and finish plowing out the mid¬ 
dle. I use a two horse disc harrow on 
all the plowing to pulverize and smooth 
up the ground. I mulch the trees at time 
of planting, and always put about i 1-2 
inches more dirt to the tree than should 
be there permanently when trees are set 
in winter, this helps retain the moisture 
through the spring drought, and at time 
of first working after the drought is over 
and tree is established, this surplus dirt is 
worked away, leaving the tree with the 
crown roots just covered. In preparing 
hammock land, I modify the above meth¬ 
ods to suit the growth on the land. I 
leave, on an average, four or five palmet¬ 
to trees to each orange tree, and grad¬ 
ually thin these out as trees get larger, 
and original supply of trash has rotted 
away. Live oaks, water oaks, etc., I top 
and girdle. When plowing the first time, 
I keep two men, with grub hoes and axes, 
following the plow, to remove all roots, 
etc., that had not been previously re¬ 
moved. In this way, at the next plowing, 
it should plow like old land. I find that 
young trees grow off much better and are 
much less apt to become hide bound 
where they have partial shade. In case 
of a hide bound tree, the point of a knife 
blade run the length of the trunk, split¬ 
ting the bark, and a little extra feed, will 
usually effect a cure. As regards leaving 
palmetto trees in a grove, to be removed 
later, some persons raise the objection 


that they are difficult to get down with¬ 
out damage to- the orange tree, after the 
orange tree has attained much size. This 
can be easily done in the following way. 
Take a ladder say 16 or 18 feet long, 
place against trunk of palmetto tree- to 
be removed, on side opposite to which 
you wish the tree to fall. Take a rope 
(about 3-8 or 1-2 inch) and tie in a slip 
noose around the trunk of the tree as 
high above top of ladder as is convenient; 
and push it up the trunk of the tree as 
far as you can, with a pole having a fork 
or similar contrivance on top end, then 
have a person on the ground tighten on 
the rope. Then, with a short, one-man 
cross-cut saw, saw the tree as nearly off 
as is safe at a point that is convenient 
above the top of the ladder; then get 
down and remove 'the ladder, and with 
the rope the top can be pulled just where 
wanted, and very seldom will an orange 
tree ever be injured. The snag left 
standing will do no harm, but it can be 
easily cut down if it is desirable to get it 
out o f the way. In setting trees, I have 
had fine results by thoroughly mixing 1 
or 2 lbs. of fine ground steamed bone in 
the soil before setting the tree. Other 
than this I give the trees no fertilizer for 
a year, depending upon plenty of mulch 
and trash to furnish what they need for 
that time. Then I give them about 1 lb. 
each early in the spring and another 
pound each in the summer, and continue 
plowing till I get the land shaped up to 
suit, when all plowing is cut out. After 
that our dependence is on hoe working the 
trees in circles and using mowing ma¬ 
chines once or twice per year, as occa¬ 
sion demands, on the unworked part. 
When the trees get large enough to shade 


FLORIDA ,ST ATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


61 


the ground sufficiently to keep weeds and 
grass from choking them, we depend on 
the mowing machine entirely, and put 
part of the price of the extra labor saved 
into extra fertilizer. By this method we 
get along with less labor, have healthy 
trees and fruit of fine quality, and are 
troubled very little with rust mite. No 
doubt we shall have some able discussions 
later on the subjects of fertilizing and 
spraying, so I’ll not attempt to discuss 
them. Of course no iron clad rules can 
be laid down for the care of a grove, as 
soils and conditions are so varied, but 
my general rule would be, put land in 
best possible shape when trees are very 
young, and cultivate just as little as pos¬ 
sible thereafter. I am a great believer in 
humus, and think that one should get 
something growing to shade the ground 
as quickly as possible and later be con¬ 
verted into humus. As the trees get old¬ 
er and original supply is being exhausted, 
haul in trash, woods grass, etc., to take 
its place. When I mention muck, no 
doubt our worthy president and some 
others will smile, as I recently heard one 
of them allude to' it as “harmless amuse¬ 
ment,” but we are using muck with most 
excellent results, though I must say that 
we have a fair supply of exceptional 
muck. I have seen lots of muck which I 
think I might allude to as harmless amuse¬ 
ment, unless it had maiden cane in it, 
when I’d omit the “harmless.” I believe 
there is a growing tendency towards less 
cultivation, but fear that it is still being 
much overdone in many citrus groves 
People may criticise the apparent unkempt 
condition of your grove, but the know¬ 
ledge of the extra size of your bank ac¬ 
count will more than offset the stings of 


criticism, and after all, with citrus grow¬ 
ers, as with all others, the money is what 
we are after. If, in starting a grove, one 
is seriously handicapped for lack of time 
or funds, good results can be secured by 
grubbing circles in which to set the 
tree, and then gradually breaking up the 
remaining ground, getting it all broken 
by the time the tree has been set two 
years.* But, using what method you will, 
don't destroy any more humus-producing 
material than can possibly be helped,— 
the day will come when it will be sorely 
needed. If I were caring for a grove on 
very sandy soil, an Acme harrow 
would be the most severe tool that I’d put 
into it. As to varieties of citrus trees to 
set, confine yourself to few varieties, and 
those the very best suited to your locality. 

We are confining our plantings almost 
entirely to Pineapple and Valencia Late 
oranges and a selected strain of common 
Florida grapefruit, budded on sour or¬ 
ange stock. I find that under usual cbn- 
ditions a good thrifty year old bud on a 
two year old stock gives the best satisfac¬ 
tion. Large trees suffer a much greater 
shock when transplanted, and may re¬ 
quire more careful attention to get them 
well started off. Don’t plant sour stocks 
in grove form, to be budded later. This 
is too slow and a stand of buds -is too un¬ 
certain. 


DISCUSSION. 

Prof. Hume: We certainly ought to 
have a spirited discussion after this topic. 
Suppose you start the ball rolling, Mr. 
Hart. I think your ideas with regard to 
the use of ammonia are sufficient to get 
this discussion into- full swing. 



62 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Mr. Hart: Mr. President, when you 
once get the convention to talking on this 
subject, I think there will be plenty said, 
because as a rule there is not time enough 
given to allow each one who wants to 
speak on it, time to do so. 

I really haven’t anything special in 
mind to say at this time. Just now, I 
would rather have a receptive mind and 
wait for some one else to say something 
about it. 

Just a minute, though. One little mat¬ 
ter I noticed in the papers that have just 
been presented, is to avoid cultivating in 
the spring. I cultivate early in the sea¬ 
son pretty thoroughly with a Cutaway 
harrow, and later, when the drought is 
on, I use a weeder or what is practically 
a horse rake, running over the ground 
often. 

When the rains begin, I let the grass 
and weeds grow, or plant legumes. 

I apply my fertilizer in November and 
cultivate very lightly then, and so far as 
my experience goes, I have never seen 
any bad results. I believe that cultiva¬ 
tion in the colder months will start the 
tree out sooner. I also think that the ap¬ 
plication of fertilizer at that time will re¬ 
tard it. When I put my fertilizer on in 
November, I like to have it worked into 
the soil a little ; therefore I give it a slight 
cultivation; just enough to put it under 
the surface. I think that fertilization 
late in the season helps the root growth 
a great deal but does not materially has¬ 
ten the top growth. Of course, it is not 
desirable to hasten the growth when there 
is danger of a cold spell. 

Fertilizing in November, I think, coun¬ 
teracts the effect of the little cultivation 
necessary to work it into the surface, and 


there is no hastening of the growth or 
making the tree tender in the winter. 

Mr. Brown: I do not quite understand 
Mr. Hart’s theory that the fact of fer¬ 
tilizing will retard the growth of the tree. 

Mr. Hart: You know that the root 
system of your trees grows freely in the 
winter. If you give them fertilizer in 
November, the root growth will be more 
vigorous. The top is not likely to start 
until the root growth about ceases. In 
that way, I think the fertilizing at that 
time rather retards than hastens the 
starting of the tops. 

Mr. Brown: What is the composition 
of the fertilizer? 

Mr. Hart: I give them my regular 
formula; that is, a first class orange tree 
fertilizer; about 4 per cent, ammonia, 6 
per cent, available phosphoric acid and 10 
to 12 per cent, potash. 

Mr. Williams: What proportion of 
fertilizer do you give them in the fall as 
compared to the spring and summer ap¬ 
plication ? 

M<r. Hart: I don’t fertilize in the 
spring until about the time the rains com¬ 
mence in the early summer. I do not 
think I fertilize as heavily as a great 
many do. The largest application that I 
ever made to any of my trees is twenty- 
four pounds in a year; twelve pounds at 
a time, two times a year. I give them 
pretty nearly the same each time. My 
land is good land and I do not think it 
requires as much fertilizer as pine land 
generally does. Mine is what is gener¬ 
ally called gray hammock. 

In addition to this, I give them an ap¬ 
plication of lime; and I have a man right 
now hauling in humus or leaf mold from

the hammock. About every two years I 
give the grove a good coating of leaves 
and trash. 

Mr. Temple: Mr. Thompson in his 
paper spoke of spraying with the sulphur 
solution two or three times a year. Now, 
I think we all know Mr. Hart’s position 
on spraying. Not trying to drag in the 
question of spraying or any one spray, I 
want to say that I happen to know from 
visual observation that Mr. Hart has no 
rust in his grove. I also know that Mr. 
Hart does not spray. Will Mr. Hart tell 
us how he gets bright fruit without 
spraying; whether by cultivation, fertili¬ 
zation or what? I would also like to ask 
in addition whether Mr. Thompson has 
used the sulphur or the sulphur and soda 
or sulphur and lime solutions, how often, 
and the results obtained from one as 
compared with the other; in other words, 
what I am trying to get at is what pre¬ 
caution to take tO' insure getting the most 
bright fruit. 

Mr. Hart: Replying to Mr. Temple’s 
question with regard to rust mite. I to¬ 
day heard it said that “citrus culture is 
not an exact science.” I wish I had less 
reason to realize this truth. 

I cannot attempt to say positively what 
action on my part or what element in the 
soil or condition of the atmosphere causes 
the results. I will say, though, that to 
my knowledge I have not shipped a gen 
uine rusty orange this year; haven’t had 
it to ship. I shipped a few that I marked 
russet oranges, but that rust was merely 
a manifestation of melanose, which gives 
it a rusty appearance. But not one or¬ 
ange, that I know of, has shown the re¬ 
sult of the work of rust mite. 


Years ago, one of my groves produced 
all russets, and they were such vigorous 
russets, or, rather, the rust was so vigor¬ 
ous, that the fruit was very small and 
black to such an extent that quite a por¬ 
tion of the crop I did not ship at all, and 
was much ashamed to> ship the rest of it; 
but I have noticed that on that grove this 
year not a rusty orange showed up from 
any cause. 

I have noticed that there is less rust 
on the hammock than on the pine land, 
especially where clean culture has been 
practiced; therefore, my practice has been 
to try to turn the soil into that as much 
like hammock soil as possible, raising 
grass, weeds, etc., and not taking them 
away from the land after they are cut, 
putting much humus into the soil, culti¬ 
vating early in the season while the 
drought is on, stopping it when the rains 
come, then using only the scythe until No¬ 
vember. 

The results in my groves are there, and 
anyone can see them, but I cannot say 
positively any more than the rest of you 
just what has brought them about. When 
results are right, I hold to the methods 
that bring them. 

Mr. Thompson: In regard to sulphur, I 
would say that I use very successfully 
and have used for two or three seasons, 
a solution or mixture of sulphur. First, 
I make a paste like that the paper hang¬ 
ers use to put paper on the wall. I have 
a regular formula for making it in large 
quantities. Then I take three gallons of 
that paste and mix in it seven pounds 
of Flowers of Sulphur. I use the Flow¬ 
ers because that is the lighter form. Then 
this whole mixture is stirred in fifty gal¬ 
lons of water. It mixes very readily, 


64 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


and it is kept stirred up while it is being 
sprayed on the trees. It carries the sul¬ 
phur for a long time. The paste makes 
it adhere to the foliage, and you can 
smell the sulphur after a rain on a warm 
day, long after you would think it had 
all washed off. 

I have also used the lime and sulphur, 
the regular formula, but it is very disa¬ 
greeable to handle. Then I have used 
the caustic soda, making up a stock solu¬ 
tion of thirty pounds of sulphur and 
twenty of soda and using two quarts of 
this stock to fifty gallons of water. 

However, the spray mixture I men¬ 
tioned first is, in my opinion, just as good 
as any of the others, and much simpler 
to use. 

I start to spray when the orange is 
very small; just about as big as the end 
of your finger, and I spray about three 
times during the season, I judge the 
time of spraying by the condition of rust 
on the orange. If the rust mite is in¬ 
creasing, I spray. Then I give a rea¬ 
sonable time to see what effect the spray¬ 
ing has had, and if I think the rust mite 
has not been checked enough, I spray 
again. 

Mr. Mead: I am convinced that the 
treatment of the roots can have no ef¬ 
fect whatever on the starting of the tree. 
Anyone who has noticed will find that 
the buds start earlier on the north side 
of an orange tree; the twigs and buds 
having been subjected to greater cold re¬ 
spond more quickly to the ' oncoming 
warmth of spring, but the ground and 
" roots and cultivation have nothing to do 
with it, being alike for all sides of the 
tree. 


Snow has been piled around fruit 
trees in the north, keeping the ground 
frozen for a month after the rest of the 
orchard had warmed up, but these trees 
blossomed with the rest; branches resting 
on or partly covered with snow, bloomed 
at both ends, while the cooled buds re¬ 
mained dormant. 

I do not think that fertilizer or any 
other treatment of the ground that does 
not actually warm up the branches will 
have any effect on the time of starting in 
the spring. 

Mr. Porcher: I have had quite con¬ 
siderable experience in spraying. I have 
put forth the most strenuous efforts in 
combating the rust mite. I have used all 
kinds of different sprays. I have used 
sulphur solution. I have used the dust ap¬ 
plication and have found that the appli¬ 
cation of the dust made absolutely no 
difference; the mites would crawl up¬ 
wards dragging themselves by their four 
legs and dragging their tails behind them, 
so that they would leave a mark through 
the particles of sulphur. I have been 
seeking to do everything I could to ex¬ 
terminate the rust mite by natural ene¬ 
mies. I have seen some parts of the grove 
that seemed to be free from the rust mite 
without the aid of spraying, /and a few 
feet away would be trees infested with 
the pest. 

I have used humus in large quantities; 
over 1200 double horse loads were hauled 
this past season. I find that when you 
apply lime, as I do every three years, the 
rust mite is in excess. Where the ground 
is cultivated cleanly, it is absolutely im¬ 
possible to control the rust mite with any 
spraying. Where we use the humus we 
find less of the rust mite. The only dif- 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


65 


ficulty is that where you get a sufficient 
quantity of mulching and humus on the 
soil, you are apt to give your trees a lit¬ 
tle too much rich food. They are indulg¬ 
ing in late suppers, lobster, champagne, 
and so forth. They are apt to get indi¬ 
gestion and get very sick, and you have 
trouble. 

I have land that ranges from rich low 
hammock up to scrub and pine land, and 
some land that you gentlemen would turn 
your heads away from (if you didn’t see 
the trees). Saw palmetto land, with 
hard pan. But on that same land I have 
grown some of the best trees I have. It 
is some of the most satisfactory land that 
I now have to handle. 

I am today asking the question of this 
meeting, and want to bring out from Mr. 
Schnarr as to his spray, which he claims 
will control the rust mite. Scientifically, 
I think we can bring out from our profes¬ 
sors that no oil spray has been known 
that will handle the rust mite. I have 
used the resin wash, whale oil soap, 
kerosene emulsion, etc., without effect. 
Sulphur seems to be the only thing that 
will control the rust mite at all. 

We have also with us a gentleman rep¬ 
resenting an English firm which has 
made a big demonstration in supplying a 
sheep dip, and they have a spray which 
they call Cooper’s V. I. which has done 
good work on the Mytilaspis citricola, or 
long scale and the red scale. It cleaned 
them out, and also the white fly in the 
larval and pupal stages were destroyed. 
Also, I could not find an egg that was not 
killed, although they do not claim that the 
spray will destroy the eggs.. They go fur¬ 
ther, and say that the spray is a fungi¬ 


cide. I think it will probably handle the 
rust mite. 

We begin to spray when the orange is 
the size of a small marble. We pay no 
attention to any regular time of spraying, 
but go ahead every three weeks and spray 
until we ship the fruit. We don’t finish 
shipping, sometimes, until April, so you 
can see what that spraying means. Oft¬ 
entimes the rust mite does not affect the 
fruit at all; it will seem to be thoroughly 
cleaned out; other times it will make its 
appearance early in the season and I hate 
to think about what a hard time we have 
to combat it. 

Mr. Stevens: I would like to ask Mr. 
Thompson if he noticed any change in 
the texture of the rind of the orange in 
using the soda sulphur solution and the 
other sulphur solutions. 

Mr. Thompson: I cannot say that I 
did. 

Mr. Stevens: When the sulphur and 
soda solution was first put into general 
use, it was claimed that it improved the 
texture of the rind; made it thinner and 
of a finer texture. Possibly I deceived 
myself, but I thought it did, too. It 
seemed to make the rind smoother. 

Mr. Thompson: I have never used so 
much of the lime and sulphur as the 
paste and sulphur. I cannot see any dif¬ 
ference in the orange. 

Mr. Tabor: I would like to ask Mr. 
Porcher what he has to sell his fruit for 
to cover the cost of spraying and of the 
sulphur. 

M,r. Porcher: Mr. Tabor’s question is 
bringing up a question that will come 
later. His point is well taken. The 
spraying when done ordinarily is much 
less expensive. 


66 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


I have had to rig up two complete 
plants, and the expense is about $5.00 
per acre. I have had to rig up two, so 
that when one is not working, the other 
one can be used. With us, we allow the 
trees to grow clear down to the ground 
and don’t trim the lower branches off to 
leave a clear space underneath as you peo¬ 
ple generally do. Treating the groves as 
you do, it simplifies the matter of spray¬ 
ing very much. 

I use a two-horse team and the spray¬ 
ing apparatus is mounted on a platform 
and the man on the platform sprays the 
trees as the team moves. The lower 
branches of the trees are more often af¬ 


fected than the higher, especially with 
scale. 

As to price, I am not alone in having 
to bear the cost and meeting a successful 
market for carefully sprayed fruit. 

Mr. Warner: I have two different 
spraying outfits, also. One is made at 
Elmira and has a regular 2 1-2 horse 

power engine; the other is a marine en¬ 
gine in which I utilize the same class of 
pump. The two outfits are practically in¬ 
terchangeable. 

The wagon has the body made in such 
a way that the wheels will cut under. The 
wagon turns easily and pulls very easily. 
One animal can handle it without diffi¬ 
culty. 


REPORT ON THE METHODS OF PICKING AND SHIPPING CIT¬ 
RUS FRUITS. 


L. B. Skinner. 


Mr. President and Fellow 1 Members : 

The fire this morning stopped me right 
in the midst of my paper. I thought I 
would go over it again, but I haven’t had 
time. I am sorry Dr. Inman could not 
stay and give you the benefit of his ex¬ 
perience and observation. He says he 
never packed an orange in his life; there¬ 
fore he knows exacty how it ought to be 
done. 


The first thing in the field is the ecpup- 
ment of the picker. What shall we give 
him to pick in and what shall we give 
him to pick with? Now, until the Govern¬ 
ment sent their experts here, I did not 
know the danger of clipper cuts. I didn’t 
know what a clipper cut was until Mr. 
Tenney came into my grove about three 
years ago. We went through a box of 
the champion picker of the grove and we 
found about 40 per cent, of the fruit was 




FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


67 


clipper cut. When we came to realize 
the danger of clipper cut fruit, it did not 
take us long to cut it out as far as possi¬ 
ble. 

This year we started in with our pick¬ 
ing gang; fifteen pickers, an inspector 
and a foreman. The foreman is a fellow 
of decision; he knows what he wants and 
he intends to get it. The inspector, too, 
is a conscientious man. . Mr. Ramsey, 
Mr. Tenney and one other man came to 
my grove and went through box after 
box of my picking and failed to find one 
clipper cut. I tell you, I felt a lot better 
this time than I did three years ago. 

Now, in regard to the clippers: I 
show you here a little sketch of what I 
used altogether this year; probably Mr. 
Burton is familiar with the Kyle clipper. 
With this clipper, I believe it is almost im- 
posible, with any care at all, for a picker 
to injure an orange. These clippers are 
made in California; everything good 
seems to come from California—that is, 
almost everything. 

There is another that is equally as 
good; that is the Somner-Hart clipper. 

Next is the question of what to pick 
in. I have used baskets, I have used pick¬ 
ing shirts, I have used the California pick¬ 
ing sacks and find them all, in a measure, 
unsatisfactory. We have a picking shirt 
at Dunedin that I think is the best thing 
of its kind. It has a pouch with an open¬ 
ing so arranged as to let the fruit down 
into the box very easily, but that was un¬ 
satisfactory. The latter part of this sea¬ 
son I ran across a darky with a picking 
coat. I watched him picking with it and 
watched him empty the oranges out of it, 
and he said he liked it very well. All the 


men who could get them were using them. 
There is no receptacle in the front for the 
oranges at all, but they go around to the 
sides and the back. You know, a basket 
is often in the way in getting around the 
tree. Lots of times the men are often 
placed where it is impossible to keep the 
fruit from being injured. You can dis¬ 
charge men for careless picking, but it is 
a hard matter to get other men to take 
their places. It is a much simpler prop¬ 
osition to furnish them implements to do 
good work in the first place. If they 
have the proper facilities, nine men out 
of ten will do their work right, but to 
have your work done as you want it, you 
have to give them these facilities. 

With this picking coat, the fruit is put 
into the side. It is just like a picking 
shirt except that this receptacle runs clear 
around the back. The man can move all 
around the ladder any way he pleases and 
the oranges are so placed that they are 
not in his way and it does not inconveni¬ 
ence him at all. Then, too, the opening 
is so placed that he cannot throw the 
fruit into the coat. 

There is a hook underneath the lap of 

% 

the coat, and when the coat is full, he un¬ 
snaps the ring and pours the fruit out one 
side; then he unsnaps the ring on the 
other side and lets the fruit on that side 
out. Then he buttons it up and goes back 
to work. The coat in the instance I spoke 
of was made out of bedticking. 

A member: Can you buy them already 
made, or do you have to make them, and 
have you ever used them? 

Mir. Skinner: No, I have not used 
them myself, but saw them used by one of

my neighbors, a member of the citrus 
exchange. 

LONG STEMS. 

There is no necessity for my enlarging 
upon the subject of long stems. I men¬ 
tioned long stems in the presence of Mr. 
Hart, and he looked perfectly shocked at 
the idea of anybody’s mentioning long 
stems. 

While we were out in California, M. 
Ramsey gave us a lecture at one of the 
most beautiful hotels in California, in 
which he spoke of the long stems as 
“murderers,” and that is a pretty good 
name for them. They never cease to do 
their bad work until they are delivered to 
the market. Almost every orange they 
touch has to suffer. I think the Hart 
clipper is just as good as the Kyle clip¬ 
per cutting short stems and not injuring 
the fruit on the opposite side from where 
you put the clippers. I don’t know of any 
other clippers that I would call so satisfac¬ 
tory. I think those good points are con¬ 
fined to those two. 

PICKING BOXES. 

Another thing I have had in mind, is 
to speak of the picking boxes. They are 
usually altogether too large. I think the 
picking box should not hold over half 
what the one in general use at the present 
time, holds. The fruit could be so much 
easier and I think much cheaper, han¬ 
dled. Now, it takes two men to handle 
one of them, but if we had a box half the 
size, one man could pretty generally do 
the same amount of work that it now 
.takes two. 


WASHING. 

When the fruit comes to the packing 
house, in most localities of the State we 
have to prepare to have it washed. I vis¬ 
ited Mr. Temple’s house when it was in 
operation and was very greatly impressed 
with the soaking tank. I watched Mr. 
Temple’s sales gradually getting better 
and better, and I decided to go up to Win¬ 
ter Park and see if I could find out the 
reason why. I went into his packing 
house. Maybe some of you know that we 
had a frost last winter. Of course, very 
few places in the State were affected by 
this frost, but still we had a frost. Some 
of us knew that we had some light fruit, 
and we did our best to eliminate it. We 
would instruct our men to cull out the 
light fruit, and they would judge of the 
weight of oranges until finally from fa¬ 
tigue they could not tell a heavy ; or¬ 
ange from a light one, and we would 
find a good orange with the bad and a bad 
one with the good. The men tried to help 
us out, but it is simply an impossibility 
not to make mistakes. But at Mr. Tem¬ 
ple’s place, he was able to cull every light 
orange out of his pack. When the or¬ 
anges were put up at market, the buy¬ 
ers knew that they are getting heavy 
fruit when they paid for heavy fruit. 

The light fruit were eliminated in the 
soaking tank. The process is very inter¬ 
esting. A man stands by the tank with a 
long ladle, and if an orange is floating a 
little too high, he spoons it right out. If 
an orange was floating, but a light touch 
with the ladle would send it down, and it 
came up slowly it was all right, but if 
it came up like a cork, it was ladeled out.

We should select a washer that does 
the work thoroughly and carefully: that 
is the main thing. We simply have to 
wash out fruit and we have to do it care¬ 
fully and thoroughly if we are going to 
please the trade. The washers in Mr. 
Temple’s house certainly clean the fruit 
and the results have shown that no injury 
has been done to the fruit, apparently. 

There are some washers that will wash 
grapefruit, some that will wash oranges, 
and I hope there will be some washers 
that will wash tangerine. Each grower 
has to settle the question for himself as 
to which washer he will use, and I think 
by choosing one which does the work 
according to his own satisfaction, the 
question is solved. 

DRYERS. 

After the fruit comes from the washer 
and before it goes to the sizer, it has to 
be dried. You are all familiar with the 
methods of Mr. Temple’s work. He runs 
the fruit into the rack overhead and ex¬ 
hausts the air, forces it in and draws it 
out; there are so many thousand cubic 
feet of air passed through there per min¬ 
ute. Anything as elaborate as his pro¬ 
cess is not within the reach of all of us. 
In my house we have installed a dryer 
that has been working very successfully 
for two or three years. It is not a very 
large dryer and we are unable to run 
through over three hundred boxes a day. 
This dryer is about thirty feet long. The 
fruit comes into one side on to a convey¬ 
or which moves down very slowly; then 
it comes back to the brusher and sizer. 
During the time the fruit is passing, 
which occupies 20 minutes, there is a 


blast of air going over it. It is just the 
natural air taken from up near the roof 
of the house. This air is blown in there 
by a strong blower and there is a contin¬ 
uous stream of air going in and coming 
out all the time. In damp weather, we 
use a fire and blow the heated air in and 
over the fruit. 

GRADING. 

Now we come to the grading. It is un¬ 
necessary for me to describe to you the 
grading appliances as shown in Mr. Tem¬ 
ple’s house. It is a system which will 
soon be in general use. The old methods 
of doing things in Florida are fast pass¬ 
ing away. If we are going to keep up 
with Mr. Temple (we know Mir. Temple 
is going to keep up with the best of them, 
anywhere) we are going to have to grade 
our fruit correctly. 

Our custom has been to ship under a 
brand; there is my own brand, for exam¬ 
ple, the Dunedin brand. Suppose we pack 
a car of russets, goldens and brights. Sup¬ 
pose there are sixty per cent bright; it 
all goes as the Dunedin Brand. Now, 
Mr. Temple has adopted the method by 
which the brand under which it is shipped 
indicated the grade of his fruit. His 
brights are shipped under the “Anger’ 
brand; his Angels are all bright; next 
comes the “Bull Dog’’ brand, which indi¬ 
cates another grade of fruit; then the 
“Camel” brand, I believe. Now, a man 
who quotes the camel brand does not have 
to say anything more; if he quotes out 
the Bull Dog brand, the buyer can tell to 
a certainty what he is getting and pay¬ 
ing for.

I must admit that at first I did not like 
it, but the more I know of it, the more I 
am impressed with its value. 

Another thing I must mention, is that 
we do not grade our fruit enough. We 
make two grades, and it would often be 
worth a great deal more to us to make 
three grades. 

Out in California, they grade their 
fruit away up high. All their fruit isn't 
that way, by any means; only a small per¬ 
centage of it. Their fancy brands sell 
high and the other grades try to climb up 
to it. A comparatively small percentage 
of their fruit grades up high and we hear 
a great deal about it and we judge that 
the greater part of their crop is classed 
under this grade. The commoner brands 
are put on the market, and we don’t hear 
very much about them; they don’t make 
much noise about their “camel” brands. 
Mr. Temple, on the contrary, puts his 
fruit out as just exactly what it is, and 
is not ashamed of any of it. It is just 
like having three houses to sell; one is a 
fine house for $10,000, the next is a 
smaller house for $5,000, and the third 
a cottage for $2,000. The owner is not 
at all ashamed of his cottage because his 
big, fine house sells for $10,000; it is 
just as much a part of his business to< sell 
the small house for what it is worth as 
it is to sell the big one. 

I think the brand ought to indicate the 
grade; it ought to be stamped upon the 
box; it ought to be stamped on every 
wrapper that goes on the fruit clear 
through the box to the bottom. 


SHIPPING. 

Now, about packing the fruit in the 
cars. The boxes should be stacked up in 
the California way. It is unnecessary to 
describe this here, as it has been taken 
up in several different meetings before. 
Packing the fruit in this way, there is 
complete ventilation through the whole 
car. There is a complete circulation of 
air through the car, and no matter how 
much the car is jolted about, the boxes 
remain stationary. I had a car of grape- 
fruit packed this way, once, that was in 
a wreck. It was a pretty bad wreck; I 
think the train must have been going 
about forty miles an hour for the track 
was torn up for three hundred feet, but 
the fruit in the car was practically unin¬ 
jured. 

Prof. Hume: Mr. Skinner has brought 
out a great many good points, but I be¬ 
lieve he knows something else that we 
haven’t got from his yet. I think a few 
questions would bring it out. 

A Member: I understand Mr. Skin¬ 
ner has a washing machine for oranges. 
I would like to have a description of it. 

Mr. Skinner: I devoted a good deal 
of time on my trip to California to look¬ 
ing up washers. The California people 
were very much afraid to tell us that they 
needed washers. They didn’t take us to 
the place where they did the washing. We 
went ourselves, however, and saw them 
doing it. At another place I saw' a very 
good washing machine. They have there 
very black, muddy fruit. The fruit from 
that neighborhood was shipped a great 
many years with the understanding that 
it would always have 15 per cent to 18 
per cent, decay. They changed their

71 


methods entirely, handled their fruit care¬ 
fully, and last year at the time we were 
in California, their sales were as near the 
top as anybody else. Their fruit was car¬ 
rying perfectly on account of the careful 
handling. 

By the way, I want to mention right 
here, that the National Packing Company 
is not icing a single car of fruit from Cal¬ 
ifornia. They are shipping the fruit 
packed so as to permit perfect ventilation, 
and are having perfect success. 

Now about that washer; we have lots 
of smutty fruit, we washed some of the 
fruit and finally abandoned washing be¬ 
cause the fruit was being so badly in¬ 
jured, and I didn’t like to ship it, as dirty 
and smutty as it was. I came up and 
looked at Mr. Temple’s packing house, 
but I did not find a washer that seemed 
to exactly meet my ideas. I made up my 
mind, after thinking it over, that I want¬ 
ed to get as near the motion of one’s 
hands in washing oranges, as possible; 
that is, I wanted a scrubbing motion and 
have the oranges turned at the same time. 
I think we have solved the problem and 
feel sure that we have a successful ma¬ 
chine that will wash grapefruit and or¬ 
anges and tangerines and handle them as 
carefully. 

The weight of the orange resting on 
the brushes is the only pressure it gets. 
The fruit runs down a cylinder brush 
about eight inches in diameter; as it goes 
down there is no other pressure but its 
own weight. At the same time, it rolls 
back against a flat brush which is moved 
back and forth by an eccentric, three 
inches. That turns the orange every time 
it moves, and when the orange comes out 
it is perfectly clean except for live scale. 


A Member: Does the fruit go through 
any water? 

Mr. Skinner: The water is sprinkled 
on it. 

Mr. Williams : We cannot put up any¬ 
thing as elaborate as that. We want some¬ 
thing cheaper for our packing house where 
we pack our own fruit. I am satisfied 
with a machine that will clean the orange 
and take off any scale. We haven’t the 
whitefly now, but we know we will have 
it in a short time. 

I would like to ask Mr. Skinner if his 
dryer is a solid belt of canvas or duck. 

Mr. Skinner: The one I have now is 
made with a sprocket chain on each side 
of a w'ide strip, say thirty inches. We 
rather think in the packing house that a 
cotton belt seems to absorb too much wa¬ 
ter; however, the cotton belt you saw at 
Mr. Temple’s would give less trouble. 
The air that is forced through would keep 
the belt dry. 

Now, the sprocket chain we have been 
using has been giving trouble, I am free 
to say that. If you get one sprocket 
more on one side of the chain than you 
do on the other, there certainly will be. 

There is no patent on this dryer, and I 
think Mr. Chase, Dr. Inman and one or 
two others have sent men there to get 
data about one thing and another prepara¬ 
tory to putting it up in their houses. I 
think I might be able to get this data pub¬ 
lished. 

Mr. Williams: When will the ma¬ 
chine be put on the market ? 

Mr. Skinner: I am getting material 
for 25 of the washers together, and sup- 


72

pose they can be assembled this summer. 

A Member: How many boxes can one 
of them run an hour? 

Mr. Skinner: I can’t tell you just now 
how many, but it will run a whole lot of 
them. My dryer was thirty feet long and 
three feet wide. There is a double run 
and it takes about twenty minutes for 
them to go through. Maybe you can fig¬ 
ure that out. 

Prof. Hume: I think the point brought 
out with regard to Mr. Skinner’s washing 
machine is extremely interesting and im¬ 
portant. 

We have all heard of the great success 
of the California Fruit Exchange. All 
of their work has been attempted in Flor¬ 
ida. It has met with a great deal of suc¬ 
cess, and we believe that it is doing great 
things for the State. The success of this 
exchange for the past winter has been, of 
course, largely dependent upon the men 
who have been handling it. It has passed 
through the* most critical season of trial 
and the success of carrying it through 
is due } to a great extent, to Mr. Burton, 
and I am now pleased to introduce to you, 
ladies and gentlemen, Mr. R. P. Burton. 

Prof. Hume : Three years ago, a num¬ 
ber of men interested in the growing of 
pecans met and organized a small asso¬ 
ciation known as the Georgia-Florida, 
Nut Growers Association. That associa¬ 
tion has grown to be one of considerable 
size and it has been doing a very impor¬ 
tant work in connection with the develop¬ 
ment of the nut growing industry. Those 


who are not intimately in touch with nut 
growing are not aware of the develop¬ 
ments that are taking place, but one of 
these days we will awaken to the fact 
that a new industry of vast importance 
has taken its place in the south. 

Now, we have with us tonight by spe¬ 
cial arrangement, the members of this 
Nut Growers’ Association, and the joint 
program is in their hands, and I am 
pleased to introduce to you, to take charge 
of the Nut Growers’ part of the program, 
Mr. Miller, president of the Nut Growers’ 
Association of Georgia and Florida. 

M,r. Miller: Ladies and Gentlemen: 
You will have to take Mr. Hume’s word 
with regard to the size of our association^ 
as the representatives we can produce to¬ 
night would not indicate that our num¬ 
bers are very strong. Unfortunately, a 
combination of circumstances prevented 
quite a number who originally intended 
to come to this meeting, from attending. 
Our friends in Georgia found it inconven¬ 
ient to come to this meeting at this time. 
I am glad, however, to see that we have 
a representative from the State of Geor¬ 
gia and am very sorry that we did not 
have more. 

We have something more than fifty 
members in the State of Georgia, and a 
like number in the State of Florida. 

What we lack in numbers, we will try 
to make up to you in interest tonight. 
If anyone is interested, we will be glad 
to have you ask any questions which may 
come to your mind, and we will answer 
them to the best of our ability. 


Stem End Rot 


Prof. H. S. Fawcett. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Stem end rot of citrus fruits is perhaps 
one of the most serious diseases with 
which the orange growers have been call¬ 
ed upon to contend. As if we did not 
already have our .share of troubles to 
keep us in a humble condition of mind, 
this new plague sweeps down upon us 
and threatens the destruction of the 
sound fruit itself after we have brought 
it safely past all the other enemies that 
threaten it. A somewhat similar disease 
of lemons in California, called the Brown 
Rot, threatened the very existence of the 
lemon industry there. Preventive meas¬ 
ures were worked out by the California 
Experiment Station after a good deal of 
study and the lemon growers have so 
learned to handle the crop that little 
trouble results. It is possibly along sim¬ 
ilar lines that prevention of the stem end 
rot will lie. We expect to carry out some 
extensive experiments for the control of 
this disease this next season and we will 
try out some of the best methods found 
by the California Station as well as other 
experiments suggested by the study of the 
fungus. 

It is important to investigate this de¬ 
cay at once to see if there may be any 
means of preventing its spread or of keep¬ 


ing it out of a grove or locality where 
it is not already found. The decay has 
become most serious already in a num¬ 
ber of localities in the State. It appears 
to be most prevalent in Volusia, Lake, 
and Orange counties. Our correspond¬ 
ence has shown that it is found in at 
least 20 towns scattered over the middle 
part of the State from east to west, but 
probably worst in the three counties men¬ 
tioned. It is difficult to predict what it 
will do next year. It may be worse or 
there may be different conditions of sea¬ 
sons and weather so that very little 
trouble will result from it. (The condi¬ 
tions influencing the occurrence and 
spread of the disease is a feature 
needing our study and investigation, 
x There are a number of things about it 
that are quite puzzling, but when we come 
to understand the life habits of the fun¬ 
gus causing it better, we will perhaps 
then be in a position to explain these 
things.) 

The amount of loss from this disease 
during this year is rather difficult to es¬ 
timate, since it varied a great deal between 
different localities and different groves. 
In one locality in Volusia County the loss 
from dropping of fruit was extensive. In 
one grove which I visited that had been 
well cared for and in which the trees. 



74 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


looked in good condition, it was estimated 
that one-third of the grapefruit dropped, 
due largely to the stem end rot. One- 
fourth o^the oranges were said to have 
been lost in the same grove. In another 
grove ten miles from this one, io to 50 
per cent, of the fruit was on the ground 
by the first of December and a large per¬ 
centage of this fruit developed the stem 
end rot, mostly after they had fallen from 
the trees. 

HISTORY. 

The first knowledge that I had of the 
existence of this disease was in November 
of last year when 4 specimens of grape¬ 
fruit were sent from Volusia county. 
Two of these fruits showed a softening 
at the stem end, without at first any dis¬ 
coloration on the outside. On examining 
the interior of the rag and pulp cells un¬ 
der the microscope, large fungus threads 
were seen which appeared to be quite dif¬ 
ferent from any that were known to oc¬ 
cur in connection with other decay of 
fruits. Cultures of this fungus were ob¬ 
tained from these fruits by the ordinary 
laboratory methods. 

The fungus when it grew up in the cul¬ 
ture dishes was different from any I had 
before seen in connection with citrus 
fruits. In a day or two letters came from 
two or three other places indicating that 
the trouble was more general. We then 
began to realize the seriousness of the sit¬ 
uation and I began some preliminary ex¬ 
periments to see if I could infect healthy 
oranges with this disease. I began first 
with grapefruit and then oranges, and 
found that almost invariably the fruit on 


which cultures of the fungus or on which 
pieces of diseased oranges were placed at 
the cut end of the stem, began to soften 
in from a week to three weeks’ time. 

DESCRIPTION. 

The fruit begins to soften and sink a 
little round the stem end, without the rind 
changing color. There is no blackening 
or moulding at first, and the rind remains 
intact over the softened interior. The rot 
proceeds inward along the fibers of the 
rag, and then outward to the pulp cells. 
At first both the inside and the outside of 
the fruit remain almost unchanged in col¬ 
or; but, as the softening goes on, the 
rind turns dull brown. Finally the rag 
and the pulp cells are disintegrated, and 
the entire fruit becomes soft and mushy. 

This rot usually occurs on full-sized 
fruits after they have colored. Though 
the softening may begin while the fruit 
is still hanging on the tree, it usually de¬ 
velops after the fruit has dropped or after 
it has been picked. 

The stem end rot is mainly but not en¬ 
tirely a decay of fully mature fruit and 
is usually seen on fruit after they have 
dropped or have been picked. The char¬ 
acteristic softening does sometimes oc¬ 
cur while the fruit is still hanging to the 
branches. This shows beyond doubt that 
the fruit may be attacked while yet on 
the tree, that in some way which we do 
not yet know, the fungus gets to the or¬ 
anges on the tree. How early in the de¬ 
velopment of the oranges the fungus may 
attack them I do not know. One grower 
who has had some stem end rot for two 
or three years past said that he first noticed 


FLORIDA ( STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


75 


it a little in September. At that time he 
said the fruit as they hung on the tree 
showed circles around the stems which 
ripened up sooner than the other part of 
the fruit. This would indicate that the 
fungus may make its attack at least as 
early as the first or middle of September 
while the fruit is still somewhat imma¬ 
ture. The same grower said that the rot 
was very noticeable by the middle of Oc¬ 
tober and at its height by the first week 
in November. Long hot dry spells, rain, 
and cooler weather seemed to check it. 
As said before, the symptoms of the de¬ 
cay usually show most on dropped or¬ 
anges after they have lain for some time 
upon the ground. In most of these cases 
it is reasonable to suppose that the infec¬ 
tion with the fungus is the direct cause 
the dropping and that the signs of 
the decay develop later after the fruit has 
dropped to the ground. In several in¬ 
stances where suspected fruit was picked 
from the tree and laid out on the table 
in the laboratory, they afterward develop¬ 
ed the decay. The fact, too, that it took 
from a week to three weeks for the soft¬ 
ening to show after fruits were inocu¬ 
lated with the fungus shows that infec¬ 
tion must take place one to three weeks 
before there are any outward signs of de¬ 
cay. 

If the decay of fruit showed only on 
the trees and on the ground it would be 
serious enough, but this is not the end of 
the trouble. The decay develops on the 
way to market in spite of any of the 
known precautions used for preventing 
decay from the blue mold or other rots. 
This is the most serious phase of the 
trouble. As has been indicated, the inves¬ 


tigations as to the cause brought out the 
fact that it could be started directly by 
inoculations of a species of fungus. A 
study of this fungus was made to find 
out what its nature was. At first we 
thought it might prove to> be the same one 
that causes the Brown Rot of lemons in 
California, but after some study I de¬ 
cided it was a species of Achlya. The spe¬ 
cies of the genus .Achlya are water 
moulds. They live normally in ponds and 
ditches, and fresh water streams. None 
of them as far as I know have before 
been known to be parasitic on plants, al¬ 
though some of the forms related to Achl¬ 
ya are parasites of insects and of plants. 

Two questions will probably present 
themselves to your mind. Where did the 
fungus come from in the first place and 
how does it get up into the trees to in¬ 
fect the oranges ? To both of these I will 
have to say I do not know, except that it 
evidently lives in the soil. I am trying 
to answer the latter question as to how it 
gets into the trees. The fact is that it 
gets to the tree and just how is only a 
conjecture. I find in some cases 
kinds of bunches or coils of fungus that 
develop when the fungus grows up into 
the air, out of liquid cultures. It is my 
theory that these act as a sort of spores 
to carry the fungus from the soil or from 
previously rotted fruit to the fruit on the 
trees, but this remains to be proved. 

INOCULATION EXPERIMENTS. 

I shall now confine myself to facts and 
leave theories and speculations. The de¬ 
cay is highly infectious as will be seen by 
examinations of the results of some inoc- 


76 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 


ulation experiments carried on at the Ex¬ 
periment Station laboratory. To find out 
just how the decay could be transmitted 
to sound fruit I started a number of dif¬ 
ferent experiments. 

First we placed pure cultures of the 
fungus on the stem end and on other 
parts of the surface of sound fruit. We 
also placed pieces of previously rotted 
fruit on the stem end of other fruits. We 
also wished to determine whether or not 
the fungus could get into the fruit 
through the attached stems. For this 
purpose we had oranges shipped in from 
a point where we had been unable to find 
a trace of the stem end rot, with stems 
of various lengths from 3 inches to 1-2 
inch. 

The accompanying table shows the re¬ 
sult of these tests. We kept check in ev¬ 
ery case. This experiment shows that 
infection may be produced easily through 
the stem end, but with more difficulty 
through other parts of the surface. In 
most of these tests the oranges were kept 
at a temperature of 85 degrees F. in an 
incubator. In my last press bulletin I 
said that infection seemed to take place 
only through the cut end. This was based 
on some preliminary experiments at room 
temperature during the month of Decem¬ 
ber. At the cooler temperature at that 
time no infection took place except at the 
stem end of the fruit. Since that time I 
have found that infection may take place 
through other parts of the orange. In¬ 
fection also takes place easily under labo¬ 
ratory conditions through stems 3 inches 
and shorter.

This table shows the percentage of de¬ 
cay in oranges from inoculation with 
pure cultures of Stem-End Rot fungus. 
The figures are taken 3 weeks after in¬ 
oculation. Small bits of fungus were 
placed on parts indicated and a piece of 
wet cotton placed over them. The or¬ 
anges were then wrapped as for shipment 
and kept at 85 degrees Fahrenheit. 

We also wished to determine whether 
infection took place from the fungus in 
water. Fruits were soaked in water con¬ 
taining cultures, for varying lengths of 
time, and others in water containing 
pieces of diseased fruit and still others in 
soil from under diseased trees. 

As checks some test fruits were also 
soaked in pure water under identical con¬ 
ditions to those above. The second table 
shows the results of these experiments. 
These experiments show very clearly that 
infection may take place through the me¬ 
dium of water by means of pure cultures 
of the fungus, by means of pieces of pre¬ 
viously rotted fruits, and by means of 
soil from under infected trees.

This table shows the results of soaking 
oranges and lemons in water with pure 
cultures of fungus, or with pieces of dis¬ 
eased fruit, or with soil from under in¬ 
fected trees, as compared with soaking 
oranges in pure water. After soaking for 
stated time, each fruit was wrapped as 
for shipment and kept at about 85 degrees 
Fahrenheit. The figures show percent¬ 
age of decay from Stem End Rot in 3 
weeks after inoculation. Those soaked 
in pure water showed no decay from this 
cause. 

Having found out something about the 
habits of the fungus, how it infected the 
fruit, etc., the next question was to try 
some experiments to see what would pre¬ 
vent infection. Since the disease was 
somewhat similar to the Brown Rot of 
lemons in California we planned an ex¬ 
periment similar to one that had been 
carried out for that disease. We placed 
cultures of the fungus in jars of water 
and at the same time put into it certain 
disinfectants. We used copper sulphate, 
formalin, potassium permanganate, iron 
sulphate and ammoniacal solution of 
copper carbonate. The experiment indi¬ 
cated that the copper sulphate, copper 
carbonate and potassium permanganate 
would prevent infection, but it was not 
at all conclusive since it was found that 
the oranges on which the experiment was 
tried proved afterwards to have been af¬ 
fected with stem end rot before being 
treated. 

TREATMENT. 

Treatment or preventive means that 
suggest themselves as a result of study 
of the fungus and our experiments in in¬ 


fecting oranges and in preventing infec¬ 
tion are of two kinds: (1) Treatment in 
the grove to prevent the infection of fruit 
on the trees, and (2) in case oranges must 
be washed, treatment at the packing house 
to prevent oranges from infecting one an¬ 
other at the washer. Probably the most 
feasible treatment in the grove will be to 
use the ammoniacal solution of copper 
carbonate. This should probably begin 
as early as the first of September or 
sooner, judging from; the reports we have 
of the time when the decay begins. Bor¬ 
deaux mixture could be substituted for 
the ammoniacal solution at this time, and 
the ammoniacal solution used later when 
there was danger from staining the ma¬ 
ture fruit. I tried some experiments 
with the ammoniacal solution of copper 
carbonate in December, but this was prob¬ 
ably too late to get any marked results. 
However, the treatment did show some 
results, about 10 per cent, less stem end 
rot being found on sprayed than on un¬ 
sprayed trees. 

This next summer and fall I intend to 
take up some more extensive experiments 
in some orange groves. The second line 
of treatment will consist in treating the 
wash water with some disinfectant to pre¬ 
vent the fruits from infecting one another 
in the process of washing. It seems to 
me this may be done either by throwing 
into the tank a fungicide as is done for 
Brown Rot in California or perhaps bet¬ 
ter in allowing a spray of some fungicide 
to play over the oranges as they leave the 
washer. 

To sum up, the facts about stem end 
rot are that it is caused by a fungus re¬ 
lated to the water moulds. It attacks or- 


78 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


anges, grapefruits, tangerines, lemons, 
and sour oranges. It attacks the fruits 
usually at the stem end but may under 
some circumstances enter at other places. 
It may be transmitted from diseased or¬ 
anges to healthy ones by contact or by 
soaking them together in water. The 
fungus may infect oranges through a 
stem at least three inches long. Oranges 
may be infected by placing them in water 
with soil from under trees from which 
decayed fruit has fallen. It takes from 
one to three weeks after infection at or¬ 
dinary temperatures for symptoms of the 
•decay to appear. 

The probabilities are that the fungus 
has spores or aggregations of hyphae by 
which it is carried to the oranges while 
on the tree. It is probable that the fun¬ 
gus infection may be easily prevented by 
spraying with some fungicide early in 
the season. It is quite probable that any 
new infections after packing can be pre¬ 
vented by a fungicide in the washer. It 
is also quite probable that we will find 
that it is influenced by some climatic or 
weather conditions or some weakened 
condition of the trees. This is about the 
sum of our information and probable 
theories at present. As we come to learn 
more about the habits of the fungus and 
the conditions that enable it to attack the 
fruit we will probably be in a position 
then to suggest an effective remedy. 


DISCUSSION. 

Prof. Hume: I have heard a good 
many discussions on the subject of dis¬ 
eases of plants, but I do not remember 


to have heard a clearer and more intelli¬ 
gent paper than that we have just listened 
to. I must say that the subject of stem 
end rot has been most admirably han¬ 
dled. 

Mr. Hart: I would like to ask if, when 
you are treating oranges, it would not be 
best to do' it before they go in the washer. 
It seems to me that the experiments would 
indicate that if there were any spores on 
the fruit, they would infect any of the 
fruit that goes through the washer. 

Mr.Temple: I think I can give you a 
little information on that point, having 
had more experience probably than any¬ 
one in the State. It would be very well 
to treat this fruit before it goes through 
the washer or cull it from the sound 
fruit, if there was any way you could 
tell just what fruit was affected, but it 
comes into your packing houses seeming¬ 
ly perfectly sound. I have packed it and 
let it stand in the house, and in twenty- 
four hours the box would be a perfect 
mass of pulp. 

One way you can tell is to cut the or¬ 
ange in half from the stem end down, 
but it would be pretty serious if you had 
to test all your oranges that way. If 
you cut the orange at right angles from 
the stem end to the blossom end, you will 
find a little mealy white speck which looks 
very much as though the fruit had been 
frosted; then there is a slight brownish 
discoloration, and the fruit has a decided¬ 
ly spoiled odor, but from the outside of 
the orange you could not tell to save your 
life whether the fruit was or was not 
affected in this way. 

We were almost ready to start pack¬ 
ing oranges in the fall when two of our 



FLORIDA (STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


70 


clients came to us and told us we must 
pack their fruit right then. We investi¬ 
gated it carefully and found a lot of fruit 
on the trees that was ripe, so we started 
to ship and that was where we first dis¬ 
covered the stem end rot in our section. 
I sent some to the Experiment Station 
and some to Washington. 

I have tried various things in the soak¬ 
ing tank; ammoniacal copper carbonate 
and other things, but it does not seem to 
help any. 

Prof. Fawcett: I believe the infection 
of the stem end rot which shows up aft¬ 
er the fruit is packed is made either be¬ 
fore or during the time it is going 
through the washer. I believe additional 
infection might take place in the washer, 
but if you treated them after they came 
out, it would destroy the danger of in¬ 
fection. The twenty minutes or so the 
oranges are in the bath would not be 
time enough for the fungus to grow into 
the rind. 

I believe a feasible way to prevent in¬ 
fection from the wash would be to have 
a fungicide sprayed upon the fruit when 


it comes out of the washer. I suppose 
many of the frtiit are infected on the 
trees through the rains and dews, possi¬ 
bly. 

Mr. Skinner : How about permangan¬ 
ate of potash? Would a spray of that be 
effective. That is what they are using in 
California and what I used this year. 

Prof. Fawcett: They use that in Cal¬ 
ifornia for Brown Rot and it is very good. 
The only trouble with permanganate is 
that it stains the oranges, especially if the 
orange has a rough surface. 

Mr. Temple: The trouble with the 
suggestions that we disinfect the orange 
after it leaves the washer is this: no mat¬ 
ter if you do that, and disinfect every 
orange that has become contaminated in 
the washer, the fruit that is already dis¬ 
eased goes through and shows no signs 
of breaking down, so that you cannot tell 
the sheep from the goats. After it is 
packed, it breaks down very quickly and 
the results on that box of fruit are just 
the same as though you had not disin¬ 
fected it at all. 


The Whitefly Investigations 


Dr. E. W. Berger. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

The whitefly investigations have now 
been in progress for nearly four years. 
It is the purpose this evening to review 
the general results in a few words and to 
state briefly the recommendations for 
whitefly control as they apply under va¬ 
rious conditions and localities. 

Previous investigators of the whitefly 
worked along about the same lines that 
the investigators during the past four 
years have worked. They sprayed, found 
and studied some of the fungus diseases, 
fumigated and gave the best advice war¬ 
ranted by the investigations. We, in¬ 
cluding the representatives of the Bureau 
of Entomology with headquarters at Or¬ 
lando, and the several members of the 
State Experiment Station, have taken up 
the work where our predecessors left it 
off; and while their work would natural¬ 
ly be along more general lines, it has fall¬ 
en to us to continue the work more ex¬ 
tensively in special directions. Thus 
while Dr. H. J. Webber, back in the 90’s, 
sprayed and observed the work of the red 
and brown fungi, and Professor Gossard 
later fumigated, it fell to the lot of Dr. 
Morrill and his associates at Orlando, 
Fla., to make fumigation so simple that 


any one who can weigh and measure and 
count feet can fumigate. The Experi¬ 
ment Station at the same time has found 
several more fungus diseases, namely the 
yellow fungus ( Aschersonla flavo-citrina) 
the cinnamon fungus ( Verticillium het- 
erocladum ,) and the white fringe fungus 
(Microcera sp.), and has perfected the 
spore-spraying method of introducing and 
spreading fungus. It has refined spray¬ 
ing by directing attention to its peculiar 
applicability against the younger whitefly 
larvae, and has found that the so-called 
whitefly consists of two species, namely, 
the white-winged species ( Aleyrodes cit- 
ri), and the newly discovered cloudy- 
winged species (A. nubifera). These are 
all steps in advance, but who knows that 
other investigators coming after us may 
not carry the investigations as much far¬ 
ther as we believe that we have carried 
them beyond our predecessors. We come 
and look and see a few things clearly, 
but how many important points we may 
not see! 

The speaker is of the opinion that the 
higher points of the whitefly investiga¬ 
tions have been reached except perhaps 
the one of finding more of its natural en¬ 
emies in the Orient or elsewhere. It is, 
of course, difficult to know what the out- 



FLORIDA ,ST ATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


81 


come of such a search may he, but we can 
never know until we find out by actually 
making the search. Should no more ef¬ 
fective parasites (insect or fungus) be 
found, the negative results would still be 
of value. The hope of relief from nat¬ 
ural enemies more effective than the ones 
known at present would be disposed of, 
and this would probably result in making 
more efficient use of the means of con¬ 
trol already at hand. One thing is quite 
certain, that the task of finding a more 
effective natural enemy of the whitefly in 
its native home may prove a most difficult 
one and require a more or less protracted 
search. 

While, as stated, the higher points of 
the whitefly problem appear to have been 
touched, there still remains a considerable 
number of smaller problems that need to 
be solved and the finishing touches made. 
The conclusions of previous experiments 
and observations need to be continually 
verified in relation to different localities 
and varying seasons. Some of the minor 
problems may prove to be high points, 
and we cannot always know of how great 
importance a new discovery may be until 
we have made it and know some of the 
facts connected with it. The discovery 
of the cloudy-winged species appeared at 
first to be of but little practical importance 
until it was found that the yellow fungus 
thrives upon it only, and that it differs 
from the white-winged species by appar¬ 
ently not having any food plants except 
citrus. These facts, together with the 
knowledge that the cloudy-winged species 
is less virulent, are of some importance 
when adapting repressive measures. 


METHODS OF CONTROL. 

The subject of fumigation with hydro¬ 
cyanic acid gas will not be specially dis¬ 
cussed, but referred to in its proper place, 
because Dr. E. A. Back, one of Dr. Mor¬ 
rill’s associates in the fumigation work is 
present this evening, and can answer all 
questions on this subject. Besides, bul¬ 
letin 76 of the Bureau of Entomology, 
U. S. D. A., can still be obtained by send¬ 
ing 15 cents to the Supt. of Public Docu¬ 
ments, Washington, D. C. This bulle¬ 
tin, by Dr. A. W. Morrill, gives the nec¬ 
essary information on fumigation. 

Since the speaker has recently had oc¬ 
casion to discuss the different phases of 
control, both in speech and writing, it fol¬ 
lows that what he has to say on this sub¬ 
ject tonight will be a repetition to many. 
On the subject of control the speaker fur¬ 
ther prefers to quote from a manuscript 
intended as the next Experiment Station 
Bulletin on whitefly (Bulletin 103). 

THE FUNGUS DISEASES. 

It is a well established fact, but not so well 
known, that insects are subject to diseases as 
well as other animals and men. Among the 
principal disease producing agents of insects are 
certain parasitic fungi, and the whitefly fortu¬ 
nately is subject to attack by about six. These 
are the Red Fungus ( Aschersonia aleyrodes), 
Yellow Fungus ( Aschersonia flovo-citrina ), 
Brown Fungus ( Aegerita webberi Fawcett), 
Cinnamon Fungus (Verticillium heterocladum ), 
White Fringe Fungus ( Microcera sp.), and oc¬ 
casionally a species of Sporotrichum, related to 
the Chinchbug Fungus. These are all parasites 
of the larvae of whitefly, except the last one, 
which has occasionally been found infecting dead 
adult whiteflies and presumably had caused their 
death. 

As it would fall without the scope of this pa¬ 
per to fully discuss each of these fungi, the Red 
Aschersonia will be alone treated in some detail 
followed by only brief statements on the others. 

The Red Aschersonia .—‘This fungus has giv¬ 
en satisfactory results in localities where the 
summer rains were normal, or where the trees 







82 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


were in good condition and the general moisture 
conditions about the grove were sufficient. In 
dry localities, or where the trees are out of con¬ 
dition generally, the fungi cannot always be de¬ 
pended upon to check the whitefly sufficiently 
to retain, or to bring the trees back into good 
condition. However, by diligent effort at spread¬ 
ing the fungi, some relief can be obtained even 
under adverse conditions, if these be not ex¬ 
treme. Thus, in a certain grove into which the 
red fungus had been introduced the previous 
year and in which it was not thriving especially 
well, giving only very inadequate relief, a single 
spraying in August, 1908, of the fungus spores 
into 6 trees in part of a row resulted in some¬ 
thing like 10 times the amount of fungus in 
these trees than in those on either side or to 
the ends. Ten times as much fungus, of course, 
implies ten times as many whitefly larvae killed 
and that in many instances, diligent application 
of the fungi would give results fully commen¬ 
surate with the time and money spent. Intro¬ 
ductions of fungi should be thoroughly made, 
and if necessary repeated several times during 
the period of summer rains. The grower must 
not expect the fungi to do it all alone, he must 
help the fungus destroy the whitefly by spread¬ 
ing it at the best time. It should be added here 
that proper fertilizing and cultivation of the 
trees is important, since a thrifty tree full of 
healthy foliage presents conditions favorable for 
fungus growth and, of course, can better w.th- 
stand the attacks of the insects generally. 

In order to start a growth of the Red Ascher- 
sonia, it is only necessary to spray a mixture of 
the fungus spores in water onto the whitefly 
larvae in the infested trees. The spores are the 
seeds of the fungus and are produced in enor¬ 
mous numbers in the red elevations or pustules 
of the fungus covering the dead larvae. The 
writer generally uses about 40 pustules to a pint 
of water. More can be used, or less if fungus 
is scarce. The spores are easily soaked out of 
the fungus and in practice leaves and fungus are 
soaked in the water together. It is not neces¬ 
sary to allow the leaves with fungus to soak long¬ 
er than 5 or 10 minutes, but a longer time does 
no harm and the mixture of spores and water 
may even be allowed to stand for 12 to 14 hours 
without injury. Microscopic examination of the 
fungus after having soaked it in water for a few 
minutes showed that only an insignificant pro¬ 
portion of the spores remained. The mixture of 
spores and water should be strained through 
coarse cheesecloth or fine wire gauze in order to 
remove all particles liable to clog the pump. Mix¬ 
tures of fungus spores and water should not be 
allowed to stand in copper or brass pumps and 
vessels longer than a few minutes as cop¬ 
per is a fungicide and may injure the spores. 
It is best to avoid copper and brass vessels 


altogether. Growths of fungus can generally be 
observed with the unaided eye in about three 
weeks after spraying the spores and water into 
the whitefly-infested trees. The most success¬ 
ful introductions of the Red Aschersonia have 
been made during periods of rain and when 
the whitefly larvae were young. 

Thus one of the most luxuriant growths of 
the Red Aschersonia that the writer succeeded 
in getting was at DeLand, during a period of 
rain in April, 1908, at which time also the spring 
brood of larvae were in the early stage of de¬ 
velopment and very susceptible to infection by 
fungus. Generally speaking, the period of sum¬ 
mer rains is the most certain time to spread fun¬ 
gus and to introduce it into new places. Seed 
fungus can generally be obtained from whitefly 
infested groves in which the fungi have been 
previously introduced or in which they occur 
naturally. Since the fungi do not spread during 
winter, but are nearly dormant, seed fungus is 
sometimes scarce during the spring months, but 
can generally be obtained. By midsummer a crop 
of fungus has matured upon the spring brood of 
whitefly larvae, so that fungus is then abun¬ 
dant. The writer does not recommend intro¬ 
ducing fungus after the period of summer rains 
is over, unless it is desired to get it started in fall, 
when seed fungus is most plentiful, preparatory 
to having it already started when spring opens. 
The writer has successfully introduced fungus as 
late as October and December, and while but a 
meager infection resulted at the time, this spread 
rapidly during the following spring and summer, 
or as soon as there was sufficient moisture and 
warmth. The mixture of spores and water may 
also be applied by a whisk broom when no pump 
is available. 

Other Fungi .—The methods for introducing 
any one of the other fungus parasites previously 
mentioned are in general the same as the meth¬ 
od just described for the Red Aschersonia. The 
Red and the Yellow Aschersonias, however, can 
be introduced with the greatest certainty, and 
as a whole are generally the most efficient, ex¬ 
cepting the Brown Fungus when 'conditions for 
it are right. 

One important point in regard to the Yellow 
Aschersonia must not be omitted. This fungus 
thrives only upon the cloudy-winged whitefly. 
This fact is important, since it would be useless 
to introduce the Yellow fungus on the white¬ 
winged species. The Yellow fungus might al¬ 
most be said to be characteristic of the cloudy- 
winged whitefly since wherever the Yellow fun¬ 
gus is found, there also is found the cloudy- 
winged whitefly. The converse of this is not al¬ 
ways true, however, since this fly may exist with¬ 
out its parasite. 

Pinning Leaves .—Pinning leaves having white¬ 
fly larvae infected with a fungus upon them has 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


83 


been extensively practiced but the spore-spray¬ 
ing method has now almost displaced this meth¬ 
od. If leaves are pinned, each leaf should be 
pinned, with its fungus side down, to the lower 
surface of a leaf on the whitefly-infested tree. 
Such was the position of the leaf on the tree be¬ 
fore picking, and it should again be placed in 
its original position, as the fungus will more 
readily be distributed by its natural agencies 
when in that position. 

TREATMENT WITH INSECTICIDES. 

As previously stated in the topic on the fungi, 
there are dry times, and groves out of condition, 
when the fungi will not thrive sufficiently. It 
then becomes necessary to spray or fumigate, 
keeping the fungi well spread, however, during 
the period of summer rains. 

The writer is aware that spraying with in¬ 
secticides has been more or less in disfavor. On 
the other hand, operations and experiments of 
the past year indicate clearly that effective spray¬ 
ing can be done, provided the several stages of 
development of the whitefly are taken into con¬ 
sideration and the spraying properly timed. The 
difficulties in the past have probably been that 
spraying was done at the wrong time, reinfestation 
from surrounding groves, and poor spraying. 
The difficulty of spraying so thoroughly that the 
under surfaces of all the leaves become wet with 
the spraying solutions can be overcome only in 
part, by taking special care to do the work 
thoroughly and by spraying at a pressure of ioo 
pounds or over. ^Spraying solutions are also 
more effective in hot weather. 

Spraying for whitefly can be carried on suc¬ 
cessfully during those portions of the year when 
all or nearly all of the insects are in the larval 
stages or are pupae. During the most of fall, 
beginning with October, and the whole of winter 
we have the whitefly in the stages referred to. 
During a part of April or May, following soon 
after the disappearance of the spring brood of 
adults, there is another period of about a month 
when but few adult flies and eggs are present 
and the insect is again in its larval and pupal 
stages. After May and through September all 
stages of the whitefly including the adult winged 
flies are generally present in the trees and the 
period of rains being on besides, it is not a 
good time to spray because most of the adults 
fly away and the eggs are not generally de¬ 
stroyed. 

Fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas is rec¬ 
ommended for winter use when there are no 
eggs or adult whiteflies. 

For convenience of treatment further discus¬ 
sion of the artificial insecticides will be given un¬ 
der the two following topics. 


WINTER TREATMENT FOR WHITEFLY. 

Winter is a favorable time to treat the white¬ 
fly, because it is in its larval stages, and there 
are no adults to fly away or eggs that are diffi¬ 
cult to kill. The older larvae and cooler 
weather, however, necessitate using all insecti¬ 
cides stronger. 

There are two methods of winter treatment; 
fumigation, and spraying. Where fumigation can 
be employed, it is to be preferred. Those who 
have carried on extensive fumigation experi¬ 
ments claim that it is less injurious to the tree 
than spraying with insecticides. Quicker and 
better results can undoubtedly be obtained with 
it, especially on the larger trees where it is diffi¬ 
cult to wet all the leaves by spraying. For small 
and medium-sized trees spraying can, however, 
be made just about as effective. 

That winter spraying against the whitefly can 
be made effective has been demonstrated. The 
solution must of course be used much stronger 
in winter than in summer. The writer has irs 
mind a locality in Florida in which the growers 
organized a protective league, and assessed each 
grower one cent per year for each tree he owned. 
In this locality, namely, Florence Villa, the 
whitefly had just become started in two or three 
groves, and the results of spraying have been 
so successful that but few if any more whitefly 
larvae could be found last fall than three years 
ago. These spraying operations appear to be the 
most successful on record. The insecticide was 
a good proprietary miscible oil. Another grow¬ 
er states that he has succeeded in keeping the 
whitefly confined to a few trees in one corner of 
the grove for four or five years by thorough 
spraying with another miscible oil. For winter 
spraying 'whale-oil soap should not be used 
weaker than I pound to 4 gallons of water. 

Locality Just Becoming Infested .—Winter 
treatment should not be omitted in any locality 
in which the whitefly is just coming in and is 
confined to a limited area. Under such circum¬ 
stances there is too much at stake to delay. Co¬ 
operation should be started in the form of a 
protective league. All the growers in such a lo¬ 
cality are threatened, and no grower can afford 
to omit paying his share towards keeping the 
pest confined within its present limits as long 
as possible. It pays better to help fight the pest 
in another man’s grove than to have it in one’s 
own grove. Work should not be postponed 
with the thought that something can still be 
done in the summer, since by so doing the 
whitefly is given another chance to spread 
during its swarming period in April or May. 
Fumigate if possible, if noit, then spray thor¬ 
oughly. 

Badly Infested Localities .—Where a locality is 
completely and heavily infested, the trees should

be treated in winter in order to give them a 
better chance to set fruit in spring. If co-opera¬ 
tion can be effected it is possible to do the work 
so thoroughly that no further treatment will be 
necessary before next fall or winter. If co-op¬ 
eration for an entire locality is impracticable it 
may be possible to effect co-operation on the 
part of the owners of the localized groups of 
groves. Where no co-operation whatever is pos¬ 
sible each grower should treat his own trees. In 
this instance spraying should be the method of 
winter treatment. It would be inadvisable to go 
to the expense of fumigation where the grove is 
not isolated and reinfestation certain, but spray¬ 
ing should be done. Later in April or May, when 
the grove has become re-infested from the 
groves of indifferent neighbors it should be 
sprayed again. There is a time in April or 
May when the whitefly larvae are young and ea¬ 
sily destroyed by whale oil soap (i pound to 6-9 
gallons of water) or by any other good insecti¬ 
cide sufficiently diluted so as not to injure the 
leaves or young fruit. This period comes about 
two weeks after the spring brood of adults has 
disappeared from the wing. After that, during 
the period of summer rains, if conditions are at 
all favorable for fungus growth (plenty moist¬ 
ure, and good condition of trees) the fungus dis¬ 
eases of the whitefly should be introduced. Fin¬ 
ally, if necessary, the trees should be sprayed 
again in October or November; in which case 
treatment during next winter will probably 
not be necessary. (See also under Spring, 
Summer,'* and Fall Spraying.) 

SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL SPRAYING. 

Spring Treatment .—'Spring treatment should 
begin about two weeks after the winged white- 
flies have ceased swarming and have disappeared. 
There are then only young larvae beneath the 
leaves. This period comes in April or May, and 
earlier, depending upon the season and the lo¬ 
cality. In localities where the spring rains are 
abundant and the general moisture conditions 
throughout the season generally suitable, the fun¬ 
gi, preferably the red Aschersonia, may be in¬ 
troduced as previously directed. • Where the con¬ 
ditions for the fungi are not suitable, or where 
it is desired to depend altogether upon spraying, 
the spring period indicated is a most suitable one 
in which to spray. The advantages of spraying 
at this time may be summed up as follows: (1) 
The whiteflies are in the young larval stages 
and are easily killed; (2) they are mainly on 
new growth and more easily sprayed: ( 3 ) the 
larvae are destroyed before sapping the strength 
of the new growth, and before much sooty mold 
has developed: (4) there are but few rains to 
interfere with the spraying. 


Summer Treatment .—Spraying may also be 
carried on in summer during the latter part of 
June or July after the second brood of adult 
whiteflies has passed its period of greatest num¬ 
bers for 10 days or two weeks. There being all 
stages present in considerable numbers at all 
times, and since rains are generally abundant, 
spraying at this time is not advised, except where 
the trees are suffering greatly. The fungi can 
generally be introduced to good advantage at 
this time and they should be spread freely when¬ 
ever the whitefly is present in sufficient numbers. 

Fall Treatment .—Fall is a very important time 
to spray for the whitefly and treatment may be¬ 
gin in October or November, or soon after the 
adult whiteflies of the late summer brood have 
wholly or nearly disappeared, and after the last 
layings of eggs have hatched. Groves sprayed 
in the early part of November with a spraying 
mixture whose principal ingredient was whale 
oil soap (about 1 pound to 10 gallons of water), 
showed that about 90 per cent, of the larvae 
had been killed. For the early fall spraying, 
whale-oil soap should not be used less than 1 
pound to 6 gallons of water and may be used 
stronger. The advantages of fall spraying may 
be summed up as follows: (1) The young lar¬ 
vae are abundant and easily killed; (2) (they 
are killed before 'they wax fat on the trees; 
(3) the (trees remain clean for nearly five 
months; (4) there are few rains to interfere 
with spraying. 

SPRAYING SOLUTIONS. 

Since spraying for the young whitefly larvae 
must be done in spring, summer, or fall, when 
either tender leaves or fruit are on the trees, it 
is evident that a spraying solution must be em¬ 
ployed which will not injure the foliage or the 
fruit. Almost any good contact insecticide can 
be employed, provided it is sufficiently diluted. 

It has been found that soap solutions of 1 
pound of soap to 6 gallons of water, destroyed 
all the larvae in the first three stages, and most 
of those in the fourth apd pupal stages. Thorough 
spraying resulted in destroying between 90 and 
96 per cent, of all the larvae on the leaves. Soap 
solutions of 1 pound of soap to 9 gallons of wa¬ 
ter destroyed about 90 per cent. Good’s potash 
whale oil soap No. 3 was used, and also Octagon 
soap. It is probable that any kind of soap will 
be effective against these young larvae. In win¬ 
ter the soap solution should be used stronger, 
about 1 pound to 4 gallons pf water; but a weak 
solution used in spring, summer, or fall, when 
the whitefly larvae are in the younger stages 
and the weather very warm, will give as good 
results as the stronger solution in winter. 

“Golddust” was also used on young larvae at 
the rate of 1 pound to 4 gallons of water, and 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Q 


90 to 95 per cent, were killed. Preliminary 
chemical examination of Golddust showed that 
it consisted of about 25 per cent, of soap, 62 
per cent, of washing soda, and about 13 per cent, 
of water. One part of whale oil soap with three 
parts of washing soda gave practically the same 
result as Golddust, when each was used in the 
proportion of 1 pound to 4 gallons of water. One 
pound of whale oil soap to 9 gallons of water 


gave practically the same result as the whale oil 
soap and soda mixture, at about the same cost, 
which was a little less than half a cent per gal 
Ion. Whale oil soap is therefore a cheaper ma 
terial to use for spraying than Golddust. A mix¬ 
ture equally good as Golddust can foe made 
from whale oil soap and washing soda at about 
one-half the cost. 


Dr. E. A. Back. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Dr. Back: I regret very much that 

the transfer of Mr. Yothers to other in- 

» 

vestigations makes it impossible for him 
to be with us this evening. I also regret 
that the shortness of time at my disposal 
since I knew that I was to take his place 
on the program, and press of work has 
made it impossible for me to prepare such 
a paper covering the various phases of 
the whitefly investigations undertaken by 
the federal government, as your program 
indicates. 

Since Dr. Morrill presented his paper 
before you two years ago, the investiga¬ 
tion of the life-history of the citrus and 
the cloudy-wing whiteflies, and their 
control by fumigation, spraying, and nat¬ 
ural agencies, such as fungi and possible 
bacteria, have been continued, and our 
results, aside from spraying, are now 
largely in manuscript form ready for pub¬ 
lication. I will, therefore, not dwell at 
length upon these but state briefly that 
we still believe that fumigation, when 
conducted under favorable conditions, is 
the best and cheapest method of controll¬ 
ing the fly; that control by fungi will very 
seldom prove satisfactory unless Florida 


weather conditions change very much? 
from those of the past five years; and that 
often a very large percentage of the death 
rate of either species is due more to pos¬ 
sible bacteria than to known fungi. There 
has accumulated evidence to sustain the 
belief that bacteria are even more valuable 
in controlling the fly than known fungi. 
It is difficult to explain in any other way 
the wholesale destruction of the fly in a 
grove where little or none of the known 
fungi exist. For a better term, Dr. Mor¬ 
rill and myself have used “unexplained 
mortality” in referring to this kind of 
death rate. 

At the present time, the agents of the 
Bureau of Entomology are giving special 
attention to insecticides and spraying. 
Spraying operations on a large scale are 
being carried on and gratifying results 
already have been obtained. A separate 
report on spraying will be issued at the 
completion of this work. 

Instead of a paper, I have decided to 
read certain extracts from our manu¬ 
script which give some of the results of 
our spraying work with fungi. While 
these are not in connected form, they will 
answer questions that are being asked us 
every day. After reading these, I will

show the lantern slides on fumigation 
prepared by Mr. Yothers. 

(.Manuscript read not presented for 
publication as it will shortly appear in 
bulletin form.) 

Discussion following reading and lan¬ 
tern slides. 

Mr. Porcher: I would like to ask if 
anyone present has had any practical re¬ 
sults from fumigation. 

Mr. Skinner: I fumigated a five acre 
grove and killed 98 per cent of the fly, 
and also killed all the crop for that year. 
My neighbor did not fumigate, and the 
next year all the flies from his grove— 
or so it seems to me—-came over to my 
place and camped on my ground. I 
would not fumigate again unless every¬ 
one in the surrounding country did. It 
certainly kills the flies and scales, how¬ 
ever. The Chases have two groves which 
they fumigated and absolutely kept the 
fly in check. They absolutely stamped it 
out. On their budded trees they have an 
elegant crop. 

Dr. Back: I do not consider that fu¬ 
migation is advisable in a grove surround¬ 
ed by other infested groves unless every¬ 
one fumigates at the same time. Mr. 
Temple’s “Baby” grove at Winter Park 
is a good example of the uselessness of 
fumigation when such conditions exist. 
And for this reason, also, the fumigation 
in the Earle and Sadler groves at Tan¬ 
gerine will be of no practical value in con¬ 
trolling the fly. On the other hand, the 
Friar grove at Victoria is an example of 
the good results that can be obtained by 
fumigation in an isolated grove. 

Mr. Skinner: I might add, however, 
that the grove lost last year’s crop, but 


it looks as though the trees will have 
enough this year for both years. I never 
in all my life saw trees have such a fine 
crop. The fumigation killed all the ene¬ 
mies the trees had. 

Dr. Back: The fact that Mr. Skin¬ 
ner’s grove did not bear a heavy crop the 
season following fumigation does not 
necessarily prove that fumigation was re¬ 
sponsible for the poor crop. Fumigation 
sometimes receives credit for a poor crop 
when in reality it merely precedes what 
would under normal conditions be an off- 
bearing year. Our experience at St. Au¬ 
gustine and Victoria alone demonstrates 
that a heavy crop of fruit may set the 
spring following fumigation. And those 
who have noted the crop on the trees fu¬ 
migated at Tangerine last winter, know 
that there is as much fruit on the fumi¬ 
gated as on the unfumigated trees. 

Mr.—Even when you kill ninety- 
nine per cent of the fly you don’t always 
have good results, do you? 

Dr. Back: It is a very easy matter 
to fumigate and kill from 95 per cent, to 
99.5 per cent, of the fly. While this 
seems like reducing the fly to the point of 
extinction, as a matter of fact, in a grove 
where there are from 150 to 200 living 
pupae per leaf, even if as many as 99.6 
per cent, are killed, a large number of 
flies are left. If you kill 99 per cent, you 
have left at least as many flies as you 
have leaves, and by the following fall 
they will have increased to an astonish¬ 
ing extent. The length of time one fu¬ 
migation will remain effective depends 
largely on the numerical abundance of the 
fly represented by the percentage that es¬ 
capes fumigation. In other words, one 




FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


87 


fumigation when the fly is not excessively 
abundant in a grove may be expected to 
last two, or, in some instances, three 
years, while the amount of fly escaping a 
fumigation in a badly infested grove may 
represent numerically such a large amount 
of fly that the trees may become blacken¬ 
ed by the following fall, if multiplication 
goes on unchecked by natural agencies. 
It seems probable that in very heavily in¬ 
fested groves fumigation two successive 
years can best be employed to reduce the 
fly to relatively small numbers when fu¬ 
migation once in two or three years will 
keep the fly from blackening the foliage 
and fruit. 

Mr. Scott: In Arcadia, the whitefly 
made its appearance about three years 
ago. Last winter we fumigated with 
these tents, I suppose about 1,000 or i,- 
500 trees, at an expense of $2,500.00 
which was appropriated by the county. 
This year, if the fly has been seen there, 
I haven’t seen it or heard of it. I have 
not seen a single one. 

Dr. Back: In that work, about four 
of every thousand flies escaped fumiga¬ 
tion. The percentage of fly killed in Ar¬ 
cadia is remarkable considering the ad¬ 
verse conditions. 

Mr. Scott: We had a few chinaberry 
trees that might have harbored the fly 
and we cut them down, and all the Cape 
Jasmine and privet. There was some bad 
feeling about it, but I think it is all over 
now. It was just in town that this was 
done. We took it in time so that it has 
not spread out into the county at all. 

Mr. Gillette: We use a great deal of 
spray during the summer killing the rust 


mite; that is, the sulphur solution dis¬ 
solved with caustic soda or caustic pot¬ 
ash. If the grove was full of the fungus 
you have described, would the use of this 
wash kill the fungus or have any effect 
upon it? 

Dr. Back: As most groves are 
sprayed for the mite, I do not think that 
it will. I have seen groves sprayed for 
the mite where the fungus along the edge 
of the under surface of the leaf had 
turned color and appeared to have been 
killed, although I am not positive. Since 
in spraying a tree for the mite the under¬ 
surface of the foliage is not wet to any 
extent by the spray, I doubt if the fungus 
is seriously affected. 

Mr. Porcher: If you sprayed four o*~ 
five times during the summer, what ef¬ 
fect would there probably be? 

Dr. Back: I don’t know how to an¬ 
swer that question except with this ex¬ 
ample. I know of one grove that was 
sprayed regularly throughout the sum¬ 
mer for rust mite and in September that 
grove had the finest stand of Yellow As- 
chersonia that I ever saw. 

Mr. Skinner: I might suggest that in 
spraying for the rust mite, you generally 
go at it from the top of the tree, so that 
the spray hits the upper sides of the 
leaves, and the fungi are on the under 
sides of the leaves. 

Mr. Hart: Now, about straining the 
material; I note that you say to strain 
through fine wire. Is that what you use 
altogether? 

Dr. Back: Just an ordinary wire 
strainer. We use wire strainers altogeth¬ 
er.

A NEW THEORY FOR REPELLING THE WHITEFLY. 


Chas. R. Hardy. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

The most serious menace to the citrus 
fruit industry of Florida appears to be 
the destructive effects of the whitefly. Al¬ 
most every section of the State, except 
possibly far down on the East Coast, has 
suffered from visitations of the pest and 
considerable time and money have been 
spent in combating the inroads made by 
i he insect in the groves of the orange 
growers. 

At present three methods of extermina¬ 
tion are being used with more or less suc¬ 
cess, viz: fungi, fumigation, and spraying 
with various insecticides. However suc¬ 
cessful any of these methods may be in 
cleaning up a grove they are but tempo¬ 
rary expedients at best, and must be con¬ 
tinued indefinitely, thereby adding consid¬ 
erably to the expense of growing a crop 
of fruit. The theory that I am about to 
suggest, and which I am firmly convinced 
will be the only positive and permanent 
means for successfully combating the 
whitefly differs radically from all these. 
It is simply to make the orange tree im¬ 
mune to the attacks of this insect and rea¬ 
soning from analogy, I see no reason why 
t may not be done. 

Several years ago the wheat growing 
mdustry of England was all but destroy¬ 
ed because of the rust that attacked the 
wheat fields. After experimenting with 
n large number of varieties of wheat 
which had been gathered from all parts 


of the world, one variety was discovered 
that offered great resistance to the at¬ 
tacks of the disease. This variety was 
proved to be immune and specimens grow¬ 
ing among plants of affected kinds inva¬ 
riably repelled the rust. This was an im¬ 
portant discovery, but this quality was 
about all that could commend this variety 
to the growers. In other respects it was a 
very poor and unsatisfactory grain. How¬ 
ever, by crossing it with other varieties of 
more vigorous growth and larger heads, a 
strain was subsequently built up that ex¬ 
hibited all the best qualities desired in a 
good wheat and, in addition, it was also 
made immune to the rust fungus. 

It is a well known fact to experimen¬ 
tal botanists that individual qualities in¬ 
herent in any species may be imparted to 
kindred species by cross fertilization and 
that varieties of plants may be success¬ 
fully built up that will exhibit all the de¬ 
sirable features that may be inherent in 
the parent plants. How then may this 
principle be applied in producing an or¬ 
ange that may be immune to the whitefly ? 

Two methods at once suggest them¬ 
selves. 

First: bring together every species and 
variety of citrus fruits from every coun¬ 
try of the globe where they may be found 
and subject them all to experiment. Place 
the whitefly among them and see if any 
trees exhibit repellant qualities to the at¬ 
tacks of the insect. If among them one

39 


plant should be found that does success¬ 
fully resist the attacks of the fly, then 
this plant should be used, by cross fertili¬ 
zation, to impart its resistant quality to 
an orange that should as well possess all 
the other qualities desirable in a good 
fruit. But suppose, you may well object, 
that such a tree could not be found. It 
is quite possible, nay, it is even very prob¬ 
able, that no species of the citrus fruit is 
completely immune to the whitefly’s at¬ 
tacks. In that case we must simply make 
it so. Another fact that is familiar to 
plant physiologists, is that when an or¬ 
ganism is subjected to repeated and long 
continued attacks of a malignant disease, 
it will eventually become immune to it by 
the formation of antitoxins in the sys¬ 
tem and this, in many cases, is transmit¬ 
ted to the offspring. The African races 
having continuously been subjected to the 
attacks of the malaria germ, the negroes, 
even of our own country, are largely im¬ 
mune to this disease. The Hebrew race 
offers great resistance to tuberculosis be¬ 
cause it has been subjected to attacks of 
this disease much longer than any other 
European people, and because tuberculo¬ 
sis appeared in Ireland long after it had 
become prevalent in other parts of Eu¬ 
rope, the Irish are more subject to its at¬ 
tacks than any other white race. We are 
all familiar with the efficacy of vaccina¬ 
tion in suppressing smallpox and of the 
use of antitoxins in the treatment of diph¬ 
theria and hydrophobia. But what has 
this to do, you may ask, with the immu¬ 
nizing of the orange to the attacks of the 
whitefly? Nothing, except that it points 
the way by which we may successfully 
cope with this peculiar trouble. 


Taking into account the fact that na¬ 
ture provides a natural remedy for dis¬ 
ease by gradually eliminating the weak 
and preserving the strong so that she 
may evolve a vigorous and healthy race, 
we would go to those orange trees that 
have longest been subjected to the white- 
fly’s attacks and from the most vigorous 
of them raise a large number of seedling 
trees. These, when they had arrived at 
a reasonable age, should be infected with 
the whitefly and from those that most 
successfully resisted the insect other seed¬ 
ling should be grown. This process of 
infection and elimination would possibly 
have to be carried on for a number of 
generations in order that the cumulative 
resistant effects might be realized. On 
the other hand, as almost all trees and 
plants are subject to sudden mutations,, 
it is quite possible that the desired result 
may appear in the second or third genera¬ 
tion. It is not beyond the range of prob¬ 
ability that if every infected grove in the 
State was carefully inspected more than 
one tree might be found already perfectly 
immune to the fly. I would suggest, then, 
that every orange grower in whose grove 
the whitefly has appeared should examine 
every tree to see if the resistant quality 
is apparent in any specimen. I believe, 
however, that the hope of producing a 
variety that shall be perfectly immune lies, 
in breeding from infected trees and con¬ 
tinuing the process until the resistant 
strain appears. This process offers little 
consolation to you of today, but if it 
should take fifty years to bring it about 
it will be well worth all the time, the la¬ 
bor and expense that may be expended 
on it.

The purpose of this paper is therefore 
to suggest a line of investigation and ex¬ 
periment that may prove fruitful of re¬ 
sults. It is work for the State or the 
National government rather than for the 
individual grower to undertake, yet the 


growers themselves can do much in the 
way of preliminary observation that will 
assist in clearing the ground for a syste¬ 
matic attack of the problem in the man¬ 
ner suggested. 


THE WHITEFLY PROBLEM. 


James E. Kilgore. 


Mr. President t Ladies and Gentlemen : 

I am obliged to admit that I know very 
little directly on the technical side of this 
subject that is new and that will interest 
you. My best efforts have failed to bring 
out new facts with the proofs attached, 
and my study of the subject convinces 
me that the individual efforts of any 
grower of limited time and means, how¬ 
ever observant he might be, will probably 
result the same way. But where the 
work is organized under an efficient head, 
with means to push it, the cumulative ef- 
ifect of the individual efforts may be of 
\very great value. 

I mean no reflection on the excellent 
work done by our experiment station 
rnen, or the gentlemen sent here from 
Washington. All that has been done in 
the past four years is due to them, and 
meager as the means were, especially 
those of the station, the results are far 
beyond what we had any reason to ex¬ 
pect, and make the most valuable donation 
I have known to come to any business 
that was willing to wait till it could get 


something for nothing. For incredible as 
it may seem, we as fruit growers, or as 
citizens of the State of Florida, have 
never given a penny to help this work. 

The national appropriation has given 
good results in improving fumigation and 
testing other work. Fumigation will be 
valuable to the progressive grower, if the 
less interested ones should be forced out 
of the business. If the cultivated plants 
were freed from fly in midwinter, there 
would be little fly left. It is claimed, 
that the woods are full of them, and that 
they would reinfest the groves in the 
spring, but I have failed to find a single 
citrus whitefly, in any stage, on a wild 
plant in midwinter. That there are a few 
such plants has been discovered by the 
Entomologist, but such plants could ea¬ 
sily be eradicated. 

The chief drawback with men from 
Washington, has generally been that they 
cannot stay here long enough. The ablest 
men living would need two or three years 
time to study local conditions, before they 
can do their best work. But notwith- 




FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


01 


standing this drawback most of the pion¬ 
eer work was done by these men, as well 
as some very excellent recent work. 

The discovery of several new fungus 
diseases of the whitefly with practical 
methods of spreading therm; the discovery 
of two' species of the whitefly, and the dif¬ 
ference in habits, and means of control- 
ing them, have been made by the Experi¬ 
ment Station, which has also made a gen¬ 
eral study of the spraying subject, in 
which it was found that any good spray 
will kill all the young larvae that it hits, 
but the pupae were found cpiite resistant. 
But a few new sprays seem promising. 

All this, including fumigation, the fun¬ 
gi, and spraying, with a little experience 
nearly eliminates the damage from 
whitefly, under favorable conditions. 
This information is worth one hundred 
times what it cost, besides giving us well 
learned men, and it did not cost us any¬ 
thing. If “all things come to those who 
wait,” the rest of the information we 
need so much will come to us, and may 
come free. But I am of the opinion that 
it would be better to secure the necessary 
funds and go after it, for our cheap wait 
is costing us millions of dollars, when 
with even a $25,000 annual appropriation 
from the State, we would probably in a 
few seasons see the dreaded fly no longer 
a pest of any importance, at least no 
worse than it now is in India and Japan, 
where it has been present for many years 
without serious results so far as we know. 
If we get the money, and we must get it, 
its use should be at the discretion of the 
director of the Experiment Station, and 
the Executive Committee of this Society. 
This sort of arrangement would not be 


good politics but it would be good busi¬ 
ness. 

Our native fungus in most cases does 
good work; but when we have to combat 
a fungus disease, as scaly bark, wither- 
tip, stem end rot, etc., the friendly and 
unfriendly fungi must live or die to¬ 
gether. So our most urgent need is an 
insect capable of keeping down the fly and 
scale, while we exterminate the pest fun¬ 
gi. Such insects may, and probably do, 
exist in Cuba, South or Central Ameri¬ 
ca, Asia, or Africa, where many species 
of whitefly, and many insects and fun¬ 
gus enemies to them exist, and where no 
competent person has studied the subject. 

When the right insects are found they 
must be introduced here; and may be, 
taught to be bird wise. The bird problem 
is a serious one in this line of work. Most 
of our birds are either harmless or friend¬ 
ly to the farmer. Even some, like the cat 
bird, that are generally condemned are 
decidedly in this class. All the scientific 
work, on which our literary friends base 
their beautiful songs to the farmer, how¬ 
ever, was done in places so remote, and 
where conditions were so different to 
ours, that it is of little value here, and 
I am sure that a competent unprejudiced 
observer (if there be such) would re¬ 
verse most of the claims in favor of pro¬ 
tecting the jaybird class, as they eat many 
insect eating bugs besides scattering weed 
seed, and eating valuable fruit, vegeta¬ 
bles, grain, etc., for the protection of 
which we are very largely dependent on 
bugs, wasps, and spiders. But this is an 
immense task and we will not be able to 
properly protect the good birds till some

honest, intelligent work is done in this 
line. 

The first thing is to get the insects, and 
probably while we are on the hunt we will 
find more and better fungi also. But to 
do this, we must have good men, and their 
salary and traveling expenses must be 
paid. This will take “money 1 ’ which has 
been and still is the real problem of the 
whitefly problem, and its solution is of 
an educational nature. If an automobile 
club wishes a $100,000 speedway, all it 
needs to do is to teach the farmer to con¬ 
sider the investment a good one, and it 
gets it. If any other interest wishes a few 
thousand or a few hundred thousand, a 
little missionary work among the agricul¬ 
tural classes, who directly or indirectly 
pay most of the taxes, will usually give 
the desired results. Now we must get our¬ 
selves to believe that a little money spent 
in this way would be a good investment, 
and when the favored interests who are 
so jealous of any public funds they can¬ 
not use, cry extravagance and ask if we 
are not already taxed enough, we can 
plead that such investment would make 
us better able to pay taxes. What we at 
present need is not a large amount any¬ 
way. Half of the special tax on the far¬ 
mers in the sale of fertilizer and feed 
stamps, would do a lot of good. I don’t 
see why the ever alert, educational inter¬ 
ests, railroad interests, pension interests, 
draining interests, etc., have not observed 
this splendid opportunity to increase their 
revenue. But they may fear that if “old 
dobbin” got to feeling his oats he might 
kick out of harness. If they don’t give 


us a little benefit from the load we carry, 
let’s balk till they make it a whole lot 
lighter for us. 


DISCUSSION. 

* 

Dr. Berger: There are places where 
the whitefly is just starting and where it 
is necessary to apply quick measures to 
check it, and to keep it from spreading to 
the surrounding groves. In such 
cases spraying is recommended, or 
fumigation, depending upon the 
season of the year. There are lo¬ 
calities where the fungi have done excel¬ 
lent work; did as good work as would 
have been accomplished by ordinary 
spraying during the summer. In empha¬ 
sizing spraying as I have done this even¬ 
ing, I do not mean to retract anything 
from the emphasis formerly placed upon 
the fungi. One remedy will apply in one 
place or at one time, and another in an¬ 
other place or at another time, and the 
more I study this whitefly proposition,, 
the more I find that the results obtained 
by any few experiments in any one local¬ 
ity do not necessarily apply to all locali¬ 
ties in the State. The State is too large; 
the conditions are too different. 

Mr. Skinner: I want to ask Prof. Ber¬ 
ger one question. It is not exactly about 
the whitefly, but it is one of consequence, 
and that is, the scale. I mean all kinds 
of scale, but mostly the ordinary long^

scale. What time is the best time to spray 
for the scale ? What time are they gener¬ 
ally on the move ? 

Dr. Berger: Some varieties first be¬ 
gin to move freely during March and 
April. They begin to move again later 
on, say June or July. According to what 
has been written about scales, we consid¬ 
er that there are three broods. I have 
not had occasion to work much with 
scales myself. The best way would be 
to watch the grove carefully. It is not 
so difficult to watch the trees and see the 
condition existing; whether the eggs or 
adults or crawlers are there. If they are 
hatching, that is, the young are crawling, 
that would be a signal to spray. In the 
spring, while spraying for the rust mite, 
you might mix Whale Oil Soap at the rate 
of one pound to about six gallons of the 
soda-sulphur or potash sulphur spray, 
which would apply against the young 
scales present as well as the mites. Soap 
would not mix with lime-sulphur solu¬ 
tions. 

Mr. Skinner: We generally use six¬ 
teen pounds of Whale Oil Soap to the 
barrel, and sometimes we kill them, and 
sometimes we don’t. 

Dr. Berger: Of course, no strength 
of soap will destroy the eggs. It may de¬ 
stroy the adults but not the eggs. Spray 
one or two times during spring or sum¬ 
mer when the young are crawling and 
note results. 

Mr. Skinner: Is there any solution to 
effectually kill the scale ? 

Dr. Berger: I have seen very nice re¬ 
sults with Schnarr’s solution. It was 
used at Boardman in Mr. Sampson’s 
grove last July and apparently it did not 


do any injury to the trees or the fruit. 
The Target Brand is considered in the 
same class. I have not had occasion to 
compare them, but reports put them about 
equal. 

Mr.—How about kerosene emulsion? 

Dr. Berger : Generally considered 
good; it is considered one of the best. 

Mr.—What do you think of Thrip 
Juice? 

Dr. Berger: Thrip Juice is recom¬ 
mended only against the young, crawling 
scales. 

Prof. Rolfs: I would like to have a 
word. I think in a large measure our 
scourge of the whitefly has been due to 
our carelessness and indifference to the 
information we already have. In other 
words, we let infested chinaberry trees 
grow and breed whitefly by the millions, 
and then weep and bemoan our fate be¬ 
cause the plague of whitefly is sent upon 
us. Now, I have in mind where a certain 
community thought it wiser to fight the 
whitefly when it was in another locality 
rather than to wait until it got into their 
own place. I found that it cost the peo¬ 
ple in that community one cent per tree 
per year to fight the whitefly in another 
fellow’s grove. Now, if they had waited 
until the whitefly got into their own 
groves, they would have had to pay 25c. 
or 30c. a tree. We have adopted the “let 
alone” policy, when we should have gone 
out and been in the thick of the fray. 

Dr. Inman: I think Prof. Rolfs was 
referring to our community. Winter Ha¬ 
ven. I am drawing the attention to my¬ 
self, but don’t claim any of the praise. 
I was away when the whitefly was dis- 





<94 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


covered, but I don’t think it was more 
than forty-eight hours before a fund was 
raised to fight the whitefly. The assess¬ 
ment was one cent, per tree. There were 
very few of the people who did not join. 
Since that time, we have held the white- 
fly in check and have kept our groves 
•clean and have not had a smutty leaf or 
fruit. The area over which the whitefly 
has spread, is very little, as far as we 
know. 

Another question that I will discuss 
here, is the scale question. We all have 
.some scale in the Winter Haven region, 
but we have it pretty well under control 
by adding Hammond’s Thrip Juice as 
follows: 

One-half pint Thrip Juice, beaten into 
an emulsion with an equal quantity of 
kerosene. Then add water to make a 
bucketful. Then strain the whole through 
•cheese cloth into a fifty gallon barrel of 
Sulphur Spray, and stir thoroughly. 

Thrip Juice should be used with cau¬ 
tion and only early in the season and not 
after the fruit has become larger than an 
English walnut. Continuing its use after 
the fruit has assumed considerable size, 
may cause spots on the under side of the 
fruit where the concentrated drip evapo¬ 
rates and burns the skin. Another objec¬ 
tion to using it late in the season is that 
ft destroys the acidity of the fruit and ren¬ 
ders it insipid. It is quite generally used 
in the Florence Villa and Winter Haven 
regions, and I have not for years heard 
■of a grower complaining seriously of the 
scale pests. 

It is very unusual to see scale infested 
fruit brought into the Exchange packing 
bouses. 


Mr. Porcher: We have used at Day¬ 
tona Whale Oil Soap, Good’s No. 3, as 
strong as eighteen pounds to fifty gallons 
of water. We have held the whitefly 
there in check, but have done nothing 
more than that. 

I think I read an article by Dr. Back 
in the Florida Fruit and Produce 
News in which he speaks of the Schnarr 
and of the Target Brand insecticides, 
very favorably. 

We are impressed by the fact that for 
years we have heard talk of the extermi¬ 
nation of the whitefly pest, but we are 
no nearer this end than we were when we 
began. It seems to me that these gov¬ 
ernment people, after they have made 
their scientific tests should give us com¬ 
plete, clear statement as to facts upon 
which to base conclusions. This Schnarr 
preparation as I understand it, has given 
very good results, and as Dr. Back has 
written an article, it seems to me that it 
would be a good idea for him to lead us 
along a little farther. I mean, the spray 
is recommended highly, but we hear noth¬ 
ing further than that. I would like a def¬ 
inite statement as to what it will and will 
not do. 

Dr. Back: I would like to say that 
it is a very easy matter for entomologists 
to test our various patent insecticides and 
to determine their relative value. In fact, 
we have already done this with nearly all 
the whitefly insecticides and now have in 
press a circular on the subject which will 
give the information desired more fully 
than my recent article in the Produce 
News. One objection to our spending 
time in trying out patent insecticides is 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


95 


that in the past their formulae could be 
changed at any time and such changes 
necessitate a repetition of the tests. On 
the other hand, the general public has no 
way of determining the value of sprays 
urged upon them by solicitors except by 
costly experience and it is reasonable that 
they should have some way of learning 
quickly whether the spray advertised will 
do what is claimed for it, and that they 
. have a protection similar to that given 
by pure food and the fertilizer laws. Had 
we been as active in telling all that we 
knew about certain insecticides that have 
been on the market during the past few 
years as their manufacturers were in ad¬ 
vertising them, the growers would have 
been saved many thousands of dollars. 

Dr. Berger: In regard to Mr. Porch- 
er’s statement that “We have held the 
whitefly there in check, but have done 
nothing more than that” : what more do 
you want, Mr. Porcher? You have done 
well enough. Extermination is out of 
the question.. 

I would also like to make a little ex¬ 
planation here why it is that we 
Experiment Station and Government 
people are not more anxious to take up 
these patent sprays and test them out. 
We may get a batch of dope today; we 
don’t know what the next batch is going 
to be like. The two may be just as dif¬ 
ferent as though they were entirely differ¬ 
ent compounds. The Whale Oil Soap 
heretofore has run more nearly the same; 
it is a little different in this respect from 
most of the proprietary insecticides. 

In my own case, working under the 
Adams Fund, I would hardly be allowed 
to take up these commercial insecticides 


and try them out, as I am supposed to be 
investigating other and more important 
things. It requires very little originality 
to try out a new spraying solution and see 
what results it will give. 

I think from now on it will be differ¬ 
ent. There is an insecticide law before 
Congress, and I have just received a let¬ 
ter from the chairman of the committee 
on insecticides that the bill has passed. 
This law, of course, affects only inter¬ 
state products, establishing certain stand¬ 
ards to which each insecticide must con¬ 
form. Proprietary brands must now get 
their patent and give their formula; in 
fact, it is very much on the order of the 
pure food and drugs act. 

For instance; take the Target Brand, 
which is an article in interstate commerce. 
Now we shall have a right to expect that 
the Target Brand will be the same thing 
under that name all the time, that they 
cannot change it without permission, and 
we will be notified accordingly. 

In regard to this bill, some of you here 
present received circulars and a copy of 
the bill from me. I was requested to 
push the matter the best I could here in 
this State. I received copies of the bill 
and some circulars. I sent some of them 
to Mr. Temple and I don’t know how 
much we may be indebted to him for the 
passing of that bill. A copy went before 
the Directors of the Citrus Exchange and 
they passed resolutions recommending it. 

Prof. Rolfs : I would like to say a word 
with regard to Mr. Porcher’s question. 
Three different samples of one of the 
most popular insecticides that have come 
to the State of Florida, were received in 
my office during one week. No two of 


96 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


them tested out alike, but they were all 
under the same name. Now, what would 
be the economy in trying these different 
compounds out ? 

The proprietary insecticide business is 
in such a hopeless muddle that we cannot 
get head nor tail to it until we get laws 
regulating this just as the fertilizer and 
pure food is being handled. It would 
keep a corps of chemists busy to test out 
all the insecticides that come to the Ex¬ 
periment Station. A great number of 
them are practically the same thing. A 
great many of the analyses show that it is 
the same identical thing with four or five 
different names. We haven‘t time to 
bother with them all. I assure you that 
time is a commodity with us, very little 
of which is wasted. 

Mr. Porcher: I agree with you gen¬ 
tlemen in all that; what I am trying to 
get at is that some method should be de¬ 
vised to have these patent insecticides 
tested out, because I am quite confident 
some of them are valuable. Now, the firm 
I mentioned this morning; the Cooper 
Nephews. They have produced a 
sheep dip the value of which is beyond 
question. My tests with it as an insecti¬ 
cide have been extremely favorable. 

I think we ought to come to these meet¬ 
ings and feel when we go away that we 
have found out something that will be of 
value to us. We come here and we hear 
long papers, and the next man will get 
up and tell you he doesn’t think what the 
first man says is very much good, as he 
didn’t have much success with it, and then 
a third man gets up and tells you his way 
is right. 


Personally, I do not believe for one mo¬ 
ment that we will ever succeed in exter¬ 
minating the whitefly by fungus. My be¬ 
lief is that it will be through spraying, 
or possibly through fumigation. While I 
have not, personally, any whitefly in my 
grove, I probably will have it in time, un¬ 
less we find out something that we know 
will keep it in check. I consider it a most 
serious menace. We know that fruit that 
has been preyed upon by the whitefly, has 
lost its value. You may wash it and send 
it to market, but if the consumer has any 
taste in his palate, he will not purchase 
it again. Our only method is to exter¬ 
minate that fly and, in my opinion, the 
only way to do it is by spraying in some 
form. 

Mr. Mills: It has been several years 
since I have been at one of these meet¬ 
ings. We come here to learn things and 
I came purposely to hear this whitefly dis¬ 
cussion. In Jacksonville, we do not have 
orange trees, but we have to fight it in 
the hedges. We have tried Whale Oil 
Soap; we have tried several of these pat¬ 
ent remedies, but we have had the best 
success with the William Cooper Neph¬ 
ews’ V. I. Tree Spray. There is the V. I. 
and the V. II, and we find that it gives 
the best results; better than either 
Schnarr’s or Target Brand. 

Dr. Back: We have tested the V. I. 
spray and our results do not quite agree 
with those of Mr. Porcher. At the rec¬ 
ommended strength it kills but little over 
50 per cent, of the fly when the fly is in 
the younger stages, and a very much 
smaller per cent, when the fly is largely 
in the pupal stage. Tests conducted un¬ 
der identical conditions with effective 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


07 


sprays killed close to ioo per cent. Rec¬ 
ognizing the inferiority of the V. I. spray, 
as at present manufactured, the agent of 
the Cooper Nephews & Co. has verbally 
agreed to remove the spray from the 
market until it has been perfected. 

We are not so much in need of a good 
spray, of which there are a number, as 
we are in need of thorough spraying. It 
is money thrown away if the work is done 
carelessly. For instance, last winter two 
groves here were sprayed with an effec¬ 
tive insecticide, but the work was done 
in such a half-hearted manner that only 
about 50 per cent, of the fly was killed. 
Consequently, this spring the fly is very 
abundant and the foliage blackening, and 
it is already evident that the trees will 
be as black as last season. Naturally, the 
owner feels that spraying is a failure be¬ 
cause he sees that his money has been 
thrown away. He does not realize that 
personal supervision together with a little 
educational work with the sprayers and 
an outfit more in keeping with the size of 
his trees, would have produced far differ¬ 
ent results. 

Mr. Skinner: I want to stand up for 
the work the Government people are 
doing. They have gone into this whitefly 
proposition pretty thoroughly. I have 
spent, I suppose, $5,000 in fighting the 
whitefly and if I know anything I ought 
to know a little about it. I thought a 
year ago that spraying was the thing, but 
now I am not so sure of it. In some in¬ 
stances those who have sprayed their 
groves thoroughly have more whitefly 
than those who have not sprayed their 
groves at all, and that with groves right 
side by side. I can show you groves that 


have never been sprayed that two years 
ago were just a miass of black pollution 
that today are as clean as any groves you 
every saw, and that without the introduc¬ 
tion of any fungus, except, perhaps, the 
white-fringed fungus that is native to 
the west coast. Of course, eventually we 
will find the solution of the problem, but 
I am free to confess that I think we are 
still working in the dark. 

Mr. Temple: I, too, would like to say 
a little something about the whitefly prop¬ 
osition. For more than two years, I gave 
that my hardest study. I simply ate, drank, 
slept and dreamed “white fly.” I spray¬ 
ed, I fumigated, I applied fungus, I have 
done everything that anybody would rec¬ 
ommend. I fumigated one of my groves 
and had it done in the most thorough 
manner possible; so thoroughly that I 
killed nearly all that year’s crop. That 
was in February, and I had more smut 
in November than I had in February. In 
other sections of my grove where I have 
sprayed, the result has been reasonably 
satisfactory. 

With the fungi, I think I have gotten 
the best all around results. I firmly be¬ 
lieve that if you apply your fungus thor¬ 
oughly, steadily, intelligently, that once 
in three years you will get a fairly clean 
crop. 

But, gentlemen, if the best we can hope 
for is a clean grove once in three years, 
I would take an axe and cut down all my 
orange trees and plant the groves to 
peaches, which may be profitable, or cam¬ 
phor trees, which are beautiful. The or¬ 
ange industry is not worth a snap of 
your finger if we are going to depend on 
what we know to get rid of the whitefly. 



98 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


I have been for two years, as Dr. Ber¬ 
ger and Mr. Morrill will tell you, endeav¬ 
oring to get a commission sent abroad to 
look up the home of the whitefly and find 
out what it is that keeps it in check; to 
find out what remedy Nature furnishes. 
I know Nature generally furnishes a 
means to keep the balance between the 
pursuer and the thing pursued. 

As you probably know, Uncle Sam 
brought this thing in through his private 
green houses in Washington. 

A lot of us started in and originated an 
idea of sending a committee abroad to try 
to find the original home of the whitefly 
and find the remedy that came to keep 
it down, because the whitefly came from 
somewhere and unless there is something 
there to keep it in proper limits, the place 
where the bird originated would have 
been a howling waste by this time. 

We succeeded in getting a bill through, 
appropriating $10,000. We had selected 
Drs. Berger and Back as the men best fit¬ 
ted to go on that expedition. If any more 
funds were necessary there were plenty of 
us ready to stand back of it. 

Now, I want to commit myself on the 
inside working of the powers at Washing¬ 
ton. When we had gotten the bill 
through and the Committee on Appro¬ 
priations were considering the matter, 
Mr. Howard went, unsolicited by any one 
and requested them to cut this appropria¬ 
tion in half. He said it was utterly un¬ 
necessary to spend that much; that he had 
in his office a very brilliant young man, 
thoroughly competent to make this inves¬ 
tigation and report to us. If we do any¬ 
thing with this whitefly problem, we will 
have to send someone who is competent 


to be entrusted with this important com¬ 
mission, back to the place where the fly 
came from and find what bites it there. 
We must raise the money our own way, 
and then we can spend it our own way. 

Mr. Hart: I want to say that Mr. Tem¬ 
ple is expressing my ideas exactly, as to 
the remedy we may look forward to for 
doing away with the whitefly and making 
it a minor trouble. 

It was not so many years ago since 
the purple scale was a serious menace to 
us. It is still with us, but not so very se¬ 
rious. I believe firmly that when we find 
the original home of the whitefly, we will 
find it to be a minor trouble, and if it is 
a minor trouble, there is some cause for 
it. If we find that cause and bring it here, 
the whitefly trouble will drop out of sight. 
I am ready to assist in this matter in any 
way that seems best. 

I went to Washington last September 
to see what I could do in regard to this 
matter. I was one of the committee ap¬ 
pointed by this organization. The other 
members of the committee could not well 
meet with me there at that time, but I 
expected them to go to Washington with 
me on the way back. I wanted to know 
whether the men we wanted to see would 
be there at the time we got back. I met 
with every courtesy and among others of 
the men I talked with, was Dr. Howard, 
and he put up this proposition in regard 
to Mr. Woglum. I was innocent enough, 
and supposed everything was all right. 
When I came back and reported, we start¬ 
ed to raise a sum for the Florida growers 
to help in the work. Dr. Howard’s prop¬ 
osition was that the Government would 
pay. Prof. Woglum’s traveling expenses 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

and for the Florida growers, or any other 
growers, who might be interested, to help 
with such sums as they cared to. Since 
then, it looks as though there is a nigger 
in the woodpile somewhere, and I have 
not known just what to do. If the orange 
growers want to raise the sum to send our 
professors there, Dr. Berger and Dr. 
Back, I am ready to contribute my part. 
I take it that if we must look for our help 
in the original home of the whitefly, we 
must do the whole business ourselves. 

Mr. Barber: I would like to say a 
word in regard to the whitefly. This is 
something that affects everybody in Flor¬ 
ida, whether they are orange growers or 
not. There seems to be a difference of 
opinion as to what is the best method to 
get rid of the whitefly. 

I believe the suggestion made a few 
minutes ago is the correct one. I believe 
we should send someone to find out where 
it comes from and what its natural enemy 
is, and when we do find out, bring it 
here. It affects me and every other nurs¬ 
eryman in the State of Florida, and what 
it has done is not half what it is going 
to do. I have been able to keep it out of 
my nursery, so far, but I know that it is 
coming, soon or late. You can’t convince 
people in other states that we have not 
got it in our nurseries and state after 
state has passed laws prohibiting the in¬ 
troduction of our stock into their con¬ 
fines. 

The State of California burned $50.00 
worth of pecan trees for me last winter 
a year ago, because they had passed 
laws of absolute quarantine on all trees 
out of the State of Florida. Now, we 
know that the whitefly would not live on 


a pecan tree, but they burned my trees 
just the same. 

I know everyone here is interested in 
this matter, and we will all do all we can. 

Mr. Wakelin: The question here and 
now is, what are we going to do about it ? 
Did I understand that Dr. Howard is 
the man who is going abroad? 

Prof. Hume: A Mr. Woglum, who 
was recommended by Dr. Howard, 
the one who is going abroad, and I un¬ 
derstand he is to start on his trip about 
the first of July. 

Mr. Temple : It doesn’t do us any good 
to say anything, as the matter has been 
taken out of our hands by Dr. Howard. 
Of course, we can hope that there will be 
some results, although I doubt it. 

Mr. Painter: What must I do with 
the funds? 

Mr.—I move the funds be re¬ 
turned to the senders. 

Mr. Henderson: I would like to ask 
if it would do any good to ask to have 
the men exchanged and instead of send¬ 
ing their man, send a man that we may 
select. It seems to me that we ought to 
have something to say about it. 

Mr. Temple: I move that the secretary 
of the Florida State Horticultural Socie¬ 
ty be instructed to communicate with the 
Department of Agriculture and the prop¬ 
er bureau, suggesting to them the ap¬ 
pointment of Drs, Berger and Back of 
Florida, as men to take up this investi¬ 
gation of the origin and natural enemy 
of the whitefly. ' 

M ( r. Henderson : I second that motion. 

Prof. Hume: It has been moved and 
seconded that the Secretary communicate 
with the proper authorities in Washing- 



100 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ton and try to get them to substitute our 
men for the one they have already ap¬ 
pointed to go abroad. All in favor please 
saye “Aye.” The motion is carried. 

Mr. Skinner: Mr. President, I object. 
The motion has not been carried. You 
did not ask for the negative of that 
question. Now, I feel that it is a very 
unwise move to make, and it may be 
there are others here who feel the way I 
do about it. I rise to a point of order. 

Prof. Hume: You are right, Mr. 
Skinner, and I was wrong. The motion 
has not been carried. 

You have all heard the motion; those in 
favor please say “Aye.” Opposed “No.” 
The motion is carried. 

Mr. Temple: We can’t be any worse 
off than we are now, whatever action the 
government may take. Mind you, through 
Mr. Fletcher we got the government to 
appropriate $10,000, then this man How¬ 
ard, without any initiative or request 
from anyone, went before them and told 
them it was entirely too much; that they 
might just as well cut that in half; that 
he had a young man in his office who 
would go for his expenses; that is the 
way they foisted this thing off on us. 

I think maybe when our Secretary 
takes the matter up this way it may put 
a little different light on the matter. 
Those people up there don’t know our 
situation at all. They think Howard 
knows what he is talking about and we 
poor farmers aren’t capable of judging 
what we want. 

Mr. Rosenfeldt: You have overlooked 
Mr. Painter’s request as to what to do 
with the money. I move that the money 
be returned to the people who sent it. 


Prof. Hume: It has been moved and 
seconded that the sum of money that Mr. 
Painter has in his possession on account 
of the whitefly investigation, be returned 
to the people who so kindly and public 
spiritedly sent it to the Secretary of the 
Society. Motion carried. 

Mr. Burton: I think there is one point 
that this meeting should take into consid¬ 
eration, and that is, the subject of having 
laws to protect yourselves. You ought 
to have a State law that would obviate 
the possibility of importing insects or 
pests of any kind. It is possible for your 
counties to do something, but there would 
not be much evenness about it. 

Out in California, somebody brought 
in some trees from Florida that had the 
whitefly. You ought to have seen those 
Californians. They came pretty near hav¬ 
ing a fit. They didn’t rest a day, hardly. 
They took the matter up before the Hor¬ 
ticultural Commission. The head of that 
department said, “I am very sorry, gen¬ 
tlemen, but we have not a dollar in the 
treasury.” The Exchange finally sent a 
man to Sacramento to see the governor 
and requested him to reimburse them for 
the money they would have to expend in 
stamping out the whitefly. The governor 
readily promised to do what he could for 
them, and it ended by $15,000 being ap¬ 
propriated out of the treasury, they turn¬ 
ed this over to the State Horticultural 
Commission and they did not stop until 
every whitefly was exterminated. I have 
heard since that the inspectors have been 
where the whitefly made its appearance 
and could not find a trace of a fly that 
was not killed.

Now, is such a thing as that possible in 
Florida? Could you shut out anything 
in Florida? I think it is obligatory on 
every citrus grower to use his influence 
in having a bill like this presented and 
passed. You should make the man who 
represents you swear that he will do ev¬ 
erything in his power to shut out those 
things that you have not yet been afflicted 
with. 

I was in Lakemont a few days ago talk¬ 
ing to one of the growers who is an old 
friend of mine: he said, “ I will vote for 
any law you will have drafted and sent 
up there, in this line.” He said, “We 
will have to have a Horticultural Com¬ 
mission that will have power and money 
behind it to put it in execution, and we 
don’t want any of these wishy-washy 
laws that have a thousand loop-holes you 
can get through.” It has to have the 
State finances behind it and the State po¬ 
lice power behind it. It is the duty of 
every citrus grower to get right after his 
legislators and make them pledge them¬ 
selves to go before the next legislature 
and put such an act through. 

Prof. Rolfs: I will go Mr. Burton one 
better, and say that we not only ought to 
have such a law, but the nurserymen ac¬ 
tually need such protection. The nursery¬ 
men seem to be asleep to their own in¬ 
terests. They have absolutely no protec¬ 
tion of any kind, and nearly every state 
in the Union is beginning to legislate 
against them. We may at any moment 
find that it is impossible to ship our goods 
out of the State, not having anyone to 
officially inspect them. We have been 
rocking along, simply letting the matter 


go on from day to day. It is time the 
nurserymen of the State did something. 
The Nurserymen’s Association should get 
right in touch with this Association and 
have such a law passed as will give the 
State inspector power to act. 

The Experiment Station has gone more 
than its length to help the nurserymen 
out, and I suspect before the next legisla¬ 
ture the Experiment Station will have to 
cease its inspection. The other states have 
taken our certificates because they have 
confidence in Dr. Berger and not because 
they had confidence in anything else. It 
is personal confidence in him. However, 
the inspection as it is now handled is a 
very precarious thing as well as being 
very unsatisfactory to all parties concern¬ 
ed. There is no one who can compel Dr. 
Berger to make an inspection if he does 
not want to do so. I seriously doubt if 
the Federal Government will allow any¬ 
thing like this much longer. 

I really would like to know what the 
nurserymen are going to do when the time 
comes that they cannot have their stock 
certified by Dr. Berger. 

Prof. Hume: I appreciate the fact 
that the nurseryman is worthy of all the 
condemnation that Prof. Rolfs has 
heaped upon him. It certainly does seem 
that they are a “harmless” organization. 

I thoroughly agree with both of the gen¬ 
tlemen who have spoken, that it is time 
something was being done.

of your head that would be of benefit to

Some Principles Underlying the Use of Fertilizers 


* 


A. W. Blair. 


Mr . President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

As one looks back over the reports of 
this society, he is struck with the great 
variety of opinions that have been ex¬ 
pressed with reference to the use of fer¬ 
tilizers for any given crop; and at first 
it might seem that we have made but lit¬ 
tle progress. On the other hand, we need 
not expect agreement of opinion; indeed 
in many cases there could not be such 
agreement. We must take into consid¬ 
eration the numerous types of soil, the 
difference in seasons and in methods of 
culture, and the personal equation. Be¬ 
cause A has used a certain formula or 
a certain brand of fertilizer with success 
and profit, it does not follow that B, 
working on a different type of soil or 
using different cultural methods, or with 
different moisture conditions, will have 
equal success with the same fertilizer. 
We cannot adopt certain formulas or 
certain materials and confidently say that 
they are good for all times and in all 
places. We may, however, get at some 
of the underlying principles which gov¬ 
ern the use of plant foods, and the man 
who does this will apply his fertilizers 
with more intelligence than the one who 
pays no heed to these principles. 


PLANT FOOD AND SOIL FERTILITY. 

We must learn that the terms plenty of 
fertilizer, and soil fertility, are not synon¬ 
ymous. Soil fertility refers to the crop- 
producing power of the soil, while the 
fertilizer is only one of several necessary 
conditions for crop production. There 
must be in addition, moisture, warmth, 
aeration, drainage, good texture, and the 
presence of bacteria in order that our 
soil may be productive. The crop-pro¬ 
ducing power of the soil constitutes its 
fertility. We are coming more and more 
to recognize the value of natural agen¬ 
cies in crop production and we must learn 
to so direct these natural agencies that 
they will be most potent for our benefit. 
Conditions must be made favorable for 
their activity. In the past we have per¬ 
haps relied too much upon the efficacy of 
commercial fertilizers without due regard 
to their effect upon the soil and upon 
other agencies that are at work, and in 
some instances we have entirely ignored 
other vital requirements of plant produc¬ 
tion. We have practiced constant culti¬ 
vation, and have as constantly applied 
commercial fertilizers until in some cases 
we have brought about unnatural condi¬ 
tions, and the result has been that we 
have had more than our share of dis¬ 
eases, insect pests and the like. I do not 



104 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


mean to say that all our troubles are due 
to these unnatural and unfavorable con¬ 
ditions which we have created; but we 
do know that unfavorable conditions 
often tend towards a weakened plant, 
and that a weakened plant is more sus¬ 
ceptible to diseases and insect attacks. 
To state the idea in a different way: 
Fertilizers cannot give their best results, 
no matter how lavishly or how carefully 
applied, if the crop must encounter other 
unfavorable conditions, any more than 
a powerful locomotive with a heavy train 
of cars can give its best results over a 
track with light rails and a poor roadbed. 
In the latter case the light rails and poor 
roadbed become the limiting factor, while 
in the former case any one of several 
conditions may prove a limiting factor. 

SOME FACTORS LIMITING THE EFFICIENCY 
OF FERTILIZERS. 

/. Deficiency of Water .—Perhaps I 
can make this clearer by giving some il¬ 
lustrations of what I mean by limiting 
factors. 

Not many days ago while passing over 
one of the lines of the Atlantic Coast 
Line Railway I saw citrus groves where 
the leaves were curling. Under such 
conditions no kind or quantity of fertil¬ 
izer could do much for those trees. There 
must be water to bring the fertilizer into 
solution before the plant can use it, and 
when the leaves begin to curl we know 
that the supply of moisture is failing. 
Here the efficiency of the fertilizer is lim¬ 
ited, and that too, at a most critical time, 
by a deficiency of water. To get the ben¬ 
efit of fertilizers at such times we must 


either irrigate or put the soil in such con¬ 
dition that the moisture from beneath 
may be brought up by capillary action. 
This latter, however, is impossible if at 
a depth of four or five inches or a foot 
beneath the surface there is a plow sole 
or hard stratum of earth. This hard 
stratum becomes the limiting factor (in 
the case of trees) for it prevents the roots 
from going in search of food and moist¬ 
ure and also prevents the moisture from 
coming up near the surface where it is 
needed to dissolve the fertilizer. 

2. Deficiency of Humus .—The effi¬ 
ciency of fertilizers may be further lim¬ 
ited by a deficiency of humus in the soil. 
White sand is a poor material to hold 
moisture and plant food. On the other 
hand, if this sand is well supplied with 
humus its capacity to hold these materials 
is greatly increased. This in itself may 
mean handsome profits; for although the 
soil may be well supplied with fertilizers, 
if the moisture necessary to bring these 
into solution is wanting the crop will suf¬ 
fer. Many instances could be cited where 
the crop yield has been greatly increased 
by incorporating with the soil an abun¬ 
dant supply of humus. We have heard 
much in recent years of the failure of 
groves to put on a full crop of fruit; and 
undoubtedly much of this trouble is due, 
not to a lack of fertilizers, but as has al¬ 
ready been pointed out to the lack of suf¬ 
ficient water to bring the fertilizer into 
solution at a critical time. Irrigation will 
help to solve this problem but where ir¬ 
rigation is not practicable the next best 
step is to increase the supply of humus, 
which will in turn increase the water sup¬ 
ply. Indeed it is well to have an abun- 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


105 


dant supply of humus, even where irri¬ 
gation is practiced. For thereby the loss 
by leaching will be greatly reduced. 

3. Acid Soils .—Again fertilizers may 
be limited in their efficiency by an acid 
condition of the soil. Organic matter de¬ 
caying in the soil results in the formation 
of acids which will accumulate if the soil 
is not naturally well supplied with car¬ 
bonate of lime. These acids are harm¬ 
ful to nitrifying and other friendly bac¬ 
teria, and also to some plant roots. How¬ 
ever, the great need for humus in the soil 
requires us to have the decaying organic 
matter and with it the resulting acids, but 
these acids may be neutralized by supply¬ 
ing bases where such bases do not occur 
in sufficient quantity. Examination has 
shown that the soils in many sections of 
the State are acid, and until this condi¬ 
tion is corrected the efficiency of fertil¬ 
izers applied to such soils will be limited, 
and as a result the crop-producing power 
of these soils will be lowered. Carbon¬ 
ate of lime in the form of finely ground 
limestone has been found well adapted 
for this purpose. 

When sulphate of ammonia is placed in 
the soil as a fertilizer, nitrification takes 
place, and the ammonia, in the form 
of a nitrate, is either used by the 
plant or lost in the drainage waters; 
while the acid radical which we call sul¬ 
phuric acid is left free to unite with a 
base, such as lime (in which case gyp¬ 
sum or land plaster would be formed). 
However, if not enough bases are present, 
the acid condition of the soil is increased. 
This has been well demonstrated at the 
famous Rothamsted Experiment Station 
in England, where certain plots were con¬ 


tinually fertilized with sulphate of am¬ 
monia for years, finally becoming almost 
non-productive, while on land previously 
treated with lime or marl the annual ap¬ 
plication of sulphate of ammonia has not 
had this effect. In commenting on this 
work, Dr. Hall, director of the station, 
says: “The long continued use of man¬ 
ures like the ammonium salts, which are 
effectively acids, must have altered the 
reaction of the soil and made it sour. 
This is very palpable on the plat 
which has received a very heavy 
dressing of ammonium salts alone, and on 
which there is now a large amount of sor¬ 
rel, except upon the small portion where 
the chalk had been applied.” Doctors 
Hall and Miller speaking of one of the 
fields on the farm of the Royal Agricul¬ 
tural Society at Woburn, which has been 
under experiment since 1876, say: “The 
amount of calcium carbonate present is 
exceedingly small, barely determinable in 
fact, yet the plats continue to yield nor¬ 
mal crops, except those which have been 
manured with ammonium salts. The lat¬ 
ter, in recent years, have become almost 
sterile, showing an acid reaction to litmus 
paper, and refusing to grow wheat or 
barley, unless they first receive a dress¬ 
ing of lime.” 

At no other place in this country has 
so much work been done on acid soils as 
at the Rhode Island Station, and in one 
of the reports from that station Dr. 
Wheeler says, “One fact has been fully 
established—that sulphate of ammonia if 
not applied in connection with lime or 
other substances capable of neutralizing 
or overcoming the natural acidity of the 
soil, further increases the injurious action 


106 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


upon the growth of most of our agricul¬ 
tural plants.” In another place, he adds: 
“the yields of the 38 miscellaneous crops 
show without exception, where no air- 
slaked lime was used, that the sulphate of 
ammonia was inferior in its action to the 
nitrate of soda, and in most cases proba¬ 
bly poisonous. On the other hand, where 
lime was applied in connection with the 
two forms of nitrogen, the ill effect of 
the sulphate of ammonia was not only 
overcome, but in the case of several 
crops the yield from the limed sulphate of 
ammonia plats even exceeded that where 
lime was used with the nitrate of soda.” 
He attributes the value of the lime to its 
overcoming the natural acidity of the soil 
and the acid tendency of sulphate of am¬ 
monia. Robert Warington, an English 
agricultural chemist, has made an ex¬ 
tended study of the comparative value of 
nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia, 
and he concludes among other things that 
on lands containing no carbonate of lime, 
sulphate of ammonia cannot be profitably 
used but nitrate of soda may be used. On 
lands containing a large amount of car¬ 
bonate of lime, sulphate of ammonia 
gives its best results when it has been 
plowed or harrowed in immediately aft¬ 
er it has been distributed. Loew has 
pointed out that acid compounds as su¬ 
per-phosphates, or acidity-producing com¬ 
pounds as sulphates should be avoided on 
acid soils, while alkalinity-producing com¬ 
pounds as nitrates should not be used on 
alkaline soils. 

These statements are not to be taken 
as arguments against the use of sulphate 
of ammonia, but as a plea for the more 
general use of carbonate of lime to cor¬ 


rect the natural acidity of the soil and 
the acidity which results from the con¬ 
tinued use of sulphate of ammonia. In 
some sections of the State the soils are 
just as much in need of having lime sup¬ 
plied, as they are of having phosphoric 
acid or potash. The State, is however, 
generously provided with the natural 
limestone rock; we have the mills for 
grinding it, and railroad facilities for 
transporting it; and if by failure to take 
advantage of such resources, we continue 
to limit the productivity of our soils and 
the efficiency of the fertilizers which we 
use at a great expense, we will have only 
ourselves to blame. 

SELECTIVE POWER OF PLANTS. 

Writers on Plant Physiology have call¬ 
ed attention to the fact that plants have 
the power of appropriating an acid and 
leaving the base, or of appropriating a 
base and leaving behind the acid with 
which it was combined. We thus speak 
of the basic or acid tendency of fertiliz¬ 
ing materials. Thus in the case of sul¬ 
phate of potash the plant undoubtedly 
uses more of the base, potash, that it 
does of the acid and we speak of this 
substance as acid in tendency. On the 
other hand, with nitrate of soda, the 
plant requires more of the acid radical or 
nitrogen than it does of the base, soda, 
and we speak of this as basic in tendency. 
In accordance with these principles 
Mayer has classified certain manurial 
substances according to the following 
groups: 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


107 


1. Physiologically Neutral. 

Calcium sulphate (gypsum). 

Magnesium sulphate. 

Sodium chloride (common salt.) 

Superphosphate, (acid phosphate) 

Potassium nitrate. (This ap¬ 
proaches closely group 3). 

2. Physiologically Sour. 

Potassium chloride (muriate of 
potash). 

Ammonium sulphate. 

Potassium sulphate. 

German potash salts in general. 

3. Physiologically Basic. 

Calcium carbonate. 

Wood ashes. 

Caustic lime. 

Potassium carbonate. 

Undissolved calcium phosphate. 

Sodium nitrate (nitrate of soda.) 

Bone meal. 

(Loew would probably place super¬ 
phosphates with the physiologically sour 
materials.) Such a classification will be 
helpful in determining whether certain 
systems of fertilizing are tending to in¬ 
crease or decrease the natural acidity of 
the soil. (Shell hammocks, and places 
where limestone and marl come near the 
surface are not likely to be acid.) 

LIME NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH SUPER¬ 
PHOSPHATES. 

There has been a wide-spread belief 
that liming decreases the efficiency of su¬ 
perphosphates, the theory being that the 
soluble phosphoric acid unites with the 
lime to form insoluble phosphate of lime. 
However, Wheeler at Rhode Island has 
shown with different crops and with ten 


different phosphates (including four su¬ 
perphosphates), on land deficient in car¬ 
bonate of lime, that liming greatly in¬ 
creases the yield in almost every case. I 
give herewith his results with Mangel 
Wurzels. 

Mangel Wurzel (Norbiton Giant) 

Limed Unlimed 


Dissolved bone-black. 328 3 

Dissolved bone . 380 101 

Acid phosphate . 340 8 

Fine ground steamed bone . 447 16 

Basic slag meal (“Thomas” phosphate) 362 73 

Floats . 223 0 

Raw iron and aluminum phosphate 36 0 

Roasted iron and aluminum phosphate 153 0 

No phosphate . 40 0 

Double superphosphate . 145 1 


Very similar results, though not quite 
so striking, were obtainea with Swedish 
turnips and German golden millet. From 
these it will be seen that with the four 
superphosphates (acid phosphate, dissolv¬ 
ed bone, dissolved bone black, and double 
superphosphate), the yield was invaria¬ 
bly greater where lime was used than 
where it was omitted. From this it would 
appear that the efficiency of superphos¬ 
phates is not lessened by the use of lime. 

LIME NEEDED WHERE IRON HARDPAN OC¬ 
CURS. 

Several writers have called attention to 
the fact that the efficiency of phosphates 
is increased by the use of lime, where iron 
and alumina occur in considerable quan¬ 
tities. If there is a deficiency of lime 
there is a tendency for the soluble phos¬ 
phoric acid to unite with the iron and 
alumina, forming insoluble phosphates of 
these metals. If, however, the soil is well 
supplied with lime the phosphoric acid 
would unite with this to form phosphate 
of lime. In this connection Hilgard 









108 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


says, “Very large percentages of ferric 
(iron) hydrate may, especially in the ab¬ 
sence of lime carbonate, render even large 
supplies of phosphoric acid inert and use¬ 
less by the formation of a totally insoluble 
ferric (iron) phosphate/’ It is probable 
that the free use of carbonate of lime on 
iron hardpans, which occur to a consider¬ 
able extent in this State, would have a 
beneficial effect, by preventing the phos¬ 
phoric acid from combining with the iron. 
The fact that we find phosphoric acid in 
most of the rocks containing iron, may 
I believe, be taken as evidence that there 
is this tendency for the phosphoric acid 
to combine with iron. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

After all it is not so much a question 
of whether we use n or 13 per cent, of 


potash or 5 or 6 per cent, of phosphoric 
acid. When the crop is gathered we 
would probably not be able to detect a 
difference of one or two per cent., for we 
usually apply more than the plant can 
utilize. It is a question of getting the 
greatest possible benefit from the 5 per 
cent, of phosphoric acid or the 11 per 
cent, of potash that we do apply. If un¬ 
favorable conditions make the greater 
portion of this ineffective, it may mean a 
shortage in crop returns of 1-4, 1-3 or 
even 1-2 and this becomes a serious mat¬ 
ter. There is, I believe, room for great 
improvement along the line of making 
the fertilizers that we use more effective. 
The profits will come not so much from 
saving the cost of one or two per cent, 
of plant food, but rather from the in¬ 
creased yields due to deriving full bene¬ 
fit from the whole amount applied. 


STUDIES. 


Mrs. N. M. Prange. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

This paper, like my others, is not claim¬ 
ed to be in any way the product of orig¬ 
inal research, but is the result of careful 
study. Really during the past twenty 
years, I have had a great deal of practi¬ 
cal experience with Florida soil in the 
production of both fruit and vegetables, 
but this has only helped me to under¬ 
stand my studies, for before taking up 
this fad, I gave but superficial attention 


to the groves and while managing the 
truck farm, brought about enviable re¬ 
sults by plain common sense, or perhaps 
it was nothing but luck. At any rate it 
was by no scientific knowledge. As I look 
back to those days I can see where I 
could have saved work and made even 
more money by actually understanding 
what I was doing. 

It has been my aim in these papers to- 
show people who do not aspire to become 
leaders in this line of thought, how easy 




FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


it is to grasp the fundamental principles, 
the understanding of which adds so much 
more to the life which they are following 
from both mental and financial points of 
view. 

Our first step at this time is to examine 
the plant. Whether tree or vegetable the 
process of growing is practically the same. 
There are three distinct parts,—the roots, 
the stem and the foliage. Different veg¬ 
etations have different root systems, but 
all are alike in 'that there is no real open¬ 
ing into the roots, therefore all nourish¬ 
ment must be taken in liquid form: also 
in that it is only near the tips of the root¬ 
lets that the absorption of fluids—osmosis, 
it is called—can take place. 

The extreme tip of a rootlet is protect¬ 
ed by a hard cap that it may push its way 
through the soil, while its “feeding” sec¬ 
tion is often covered with hair-like protu¬ 
berances, multiplying the surface many 
times. These tiny rootlets also give off 
certain acids which render soluble much 
plant food that cannot be dissolved by 
water alone. 

It is a root’s nature to avoid light and 
to seek moisture. It will go in the line 
of the least resistance, growing around 
obstructions, and wherever a good feeding 
ground is found rootlets are formed rap¬ 
idly, giving full service to the plant which 
they support. If, however, the environ¬ 
ment is not congenial, rootlets wither and 
die, and the plant receives no nourish¬ 
ment from that portion of its root system. 
Roots demand a proper supply of both 
air and water. To supply this demand 
the grower must cultivate his soil proper¬ 
ly. Lumpy soil is bad for several rea¬ 
sons. The hard lumps act as obstructions, 


1(D 

wasting the energy of the roots as they 
grow around them! and checking capillary 
action by the large spaces between them. 
The excess of air in these spaces rapidly 
dries out any moisture that the rains may 
give such soil so that often the rootlets 
die in the attempt to encompass such ob¬ 
structions. Plants must have water not 
only for itself but as a vehicle of food. 
The ability to hold moisture decides to a 
great degree the productiveness of a soil. 
Fine particles of soil not only increase 
capillary action by which underground 
water is brought to the plant’s service but 
they present much greater surface to re¬ 
tain the rain water and to be acted upon 
by dissolvent forces. We all know how 
much more readily a lump of sugar dis¬ 
solves when crushed, and in the same way 
all other things yield to dissolution ac¬ 
cording to the surface exposed to attack. 
Soil should hold water in a film around 
each particle—as seen on an orange that 
has just been dipped in water—and this 
is all it will retain when there is a chance 
for the water to pass off. If there is a 
lack of drainage so water fills the spaces 
between these particles there is no room 
for air and therefore the supply of oxy¬ 
gen necessary to the bacteria of the soil 
is shut off and trouble begins. 

We must not look upon the earth as an 
inert mass. A fertile soil is alive with bac- 
.teria. Bacteria are the lowest form of 
vegetable life,—tiny one-celled plants— 
but their influence for good or ill is incal¬ 
culable. We who are working the soil 
are more especially interested in nitrify¬ 
ing bacteria which are essential to the 
changing of nitrogen to nitric acid, or in 
other words, making the element nitrb- 





no

gen available for plant food. These bac¬ 
teria can thrive only where there are the 
right degrees of moisture and heat, and 
freedom from acid conditions:—hence 
another great value in perfect tilth and 
proper drainage. On the other hand 
where excessive moisture and acidity ex¬ 
ist, the denitrifying bacteria thrive. These 
tiny plants take oxygen from seemingly 
every combination found but their work 
is especially noticeable where by the 
breaking up of these combinations it sets 
the element nitrogen free and thus allows 
it to escape from the soil. Thus poor 
tilth and drainage not only prevent an 
increase of fertility but cause actual loss 
of the most valuable plant food the soil 
contains. 

We have dwelt in particular upon the 
desirability of having fine soil particles, 
but it is possible to have soil too fine to 
give best results. This is sometimes the 
case in clay lands and is particularly true 
in “puddled” soil, for “puddling” the 
soil is done by disturbing it when there 
is so much water present as to allow the 
soil grains to move freely about and be¬ 
come placed in the most compact posi¬ 
tion. This prevents proper circulation of 
air and often causes so much trouble from 
the effects on bacterial conditions and the 
general texture of the soil that it will 
take two or three years to overcome the 
results of a few hours ill-advised cultiva¬ 
tion. 

There has been so much agitation about 
the necessity of supplying humus to the 
land, that every grower recognizes the 
value of humus though often he is rather 
bewildered as to the reasons therefor. 
Humus is plant food to be sure, but that 


is its least value. It retains moisture and 
with it the plant food this moisture con¬ 
tains. It is said that a soil well-filled with 
humus will hold eight times as much wa¬ 
ter as one entirely lacking this valuable 
constituent. Humus is a most congenial 
dwelling place and also a food for nitri¬ 
fying bacteria, therefore, causes great 
multiplication of these useful organisms. 
Humus also does much good by improv¬ 
ing the texture of the soil. When the 
land is sandy and too open, the finer par¬ 
ticles of humus help to correct that con¬ 
dition, and the humus is coarser than the 
soil particles of clay, so it opens up such 
land to freer circulation of air and all 
the accompanying benefits. One can 
hardly overestimate the value of humus, 
but still he must realize that its greatest 
value comes through its retention of 
plant-food-laden soil water which oth¬ 
erwise would carry its precious burden 
onward to the drains. 

When the vegetation which produces 
this humus is grown on the ground over 
summer the fresh green blanket protects 
the soil from the excessive heat of the sun 
and thereby removes a great factor in the 
creating of acid conditions. However, 
the grower should never turn under this 
green vegetation or its fermentation will 
cause it to be a source of great harm in¬ 
stead of benefit. It should be dead and 
dry before being incorporated with the 
soil. 

Land should be thoroughly prepared 
before planting any kind of crop, whether 
it be grove or garden, and thereafter 
worked with due care for the roots. It 
is not consistent to strive to create a root 
system to feed trees or plants and then de-

Ill 


liberately impair that system to such an 
extent as to reduce its strength from 25 
to 50 per cent; yet that is what many a 
grower does time and again. During 
proper seasons land should be given shal¬ 
low cultivation to conserve moisture by 
creating a dust mulch and to avoid a 
crusting over which shuts off the circula¬ 
tion of air, but this cultivation should 
never disturb the plant’s roots. There is 
another most important reason why the 
gardener should cultivate frequently, and 
especially after a rain, and that is to keep 
the soil black. White reflects, black ab¬ 
sorbs, heat. With other conditions the 
same a dark soil is several degrees warm¬ 
er than a light one, and those few degrees 
in temperature will often increase the 
growth of the plant wonderfully. 

The plant needs in its construction 
about fourteen different elements but Na¬ 
ture makes a bountiful provision for all 
except nitrogen, phosphorus, potash and 
sometimes calcium, so we need to study 
only these which we have occasion to sup¬ 
ply. Chemistry teaches us that plant food 
is plant food wherever found, but prac¬ 
tical experience teaches us that the form 
and surroundings of that plant food have 
great influence on its effect. 

In all animal substances as well as in 
vegetable matter, the breaking down of 
existing combinations which we call “de¬ 
cay” creates more or less acidity accord¬ 
ing to the condition and surroundings 
of these substances. If there is an abun¬ 
dant supply of air, enough but not too 
much moisture, and the temperature is 
neither too high nor too low, nitrates are 
formed from the nitrogen, and the humus 
contained in the vegetable or animal mat¬ 


ter is a valuable addition to the land. So, 
under right conditions, organic sources of 
plant food, though the slowest of all “am- 
moniates” are desirable except for the cit¬ 
rus family. But if the weather be cold 
or the soil lacking in moisture the decay 
is so slow as to be scarcely perceptible, 
while if there is an excess of water, hu¬ 
mic and other deleterious acids are form¬ 
ed in place of nitrates and instead of 
plant food we have plant poison. This 
latter condition readily arises under the 
combined influences of the summer’s heat 
and heavy rains. 

We have noted the needed presence of 
certain bacteria to transform the element 
nitrogen to plant food. Their work is to 
combine oxygen with nitrogen to make 
nitric acid. After they have done this, 
it is most important that there be at hand 
a bountiful supply of base to unite with 
this nitric acid and form nitrates, and to 
neutralize, not only the nitric acid but all 
other acids. If base is lacking ft must be 
supplied before good results can be ob¬ 
tained, and it is at such times that we 
need a knowledge of the different forms 
of calcium. The form generally preferred 
is 'the carbonate of lime found in ashes 
and air-slacked lime, but the hydrated, 
the “quick” or caustic lime, and also the 
finely powdered limestone have their 
places. 

The chemical nitrates are the quickest 
acting sources of “ammonia” that we can 
apply, as they are ready for the plant’s 
use as soon as dissolved and so* deliques¬ 
cent that they invariably find enough 
moisture to dissolve them, therefore they 
are most valuable to start a quick growth, 
especially in a dry season. The great 


112

drawback to their use for a full supply 
of nitrogen is the waste that is bound to 
occur when rains come before the plant 
has used it all. Nitrate of soda and ni¬ 
trate of potash are our general sources of 
this form of plant food at the present 
time, though calcium nitrate is knocking 
at the door of the fertilizer market. The 
nitrate in each of these materials is in 
exactly the same form. The soda in one 
and the lime in another tending to sweet¬ 
en the soil, while the pdtash in the nitrate 
of potash is the straight K2O plant food. 

Another chemical used is sulphate of 
ammonia which in its action is slower 
than the nitrates but quicker than organic 
matter, even when favorable conditions 
surround 'the latter. It also is surer in 
its action and free from the disagreeable 
features attending the change of organic 
nitrogen to ammonia. The continued use 
of this chemical will call for an applica¬ 
tion of lime, as its chemical reactions in 
the soil cause loss of lime; but this is a 
small drawback in comparison with its 
incalculable value, especially to the citrus 
grower. 

Much attention has been given to the 
effects these varying sources have upon 
plant life. Generally speaking, the citrus 
tree demands chemical sources, the pine¬ 
apple, organic sources, while the garden 
products need the different sources in 
well-balanced proportions. These sources 
are all classed as “ammoniates.” 

Now we come to the essential termed 
“phosphoric acid”—another misnomer— 
for there is no real acid in any properly 
prepared fertilizer. All chemical fertil¬ 
izers are in the form of salts. A salt, as 
explained in last year’s paper, is the re¬ 


sult of an acid being destroyed by a base 
displacing the hydrogen. In nitrate of 
soda, sodium has driven out the hydro¬ 
gen, while in nitrate of potash, hydrogen 
has been exchanged for potash. In the 
first, the plant extracts the nitrogen from 
the radical of the acid, while in the last it 
takes food from both radical and base. In 
sulphate of ammonia, it is the base we 
think about as furnishing plant food after 
the necessary nitrifying process, though 
both sulphur and oxygen are essential to 
the plant’s development. In the sulphates 
of potash it is also the base that is bought 
for food. The ammonia in sulphate of 
ammonia and the potash in the sulphate 
of potash are combined with the radical 
of sulphuric acid—exactly the same part 
of sulphuric acid that exists in sulphate 
of lime and every other sulphate—just 
the sulphur and oxygen. These elements 
are absolutely harmless unless combined 
with hydrogen in certain proportions to 
form an acid. There is no possibility of 
reaction taking place for the hydrogen 
has been defeated in a fair fight. The 
base has stronger attractions or it could 
not have displaced it. It is on this prin¬ 
ciple of “a fair fight and no favor” that 
our phosphoric acid is made available for 
use. The radical of phosphoric acid is the 
form from which the plant gets its phos¬ 
phorus, but in the natural state this rad¬ 
ical is in such close combination with lime 
that neither water nor the exudations 
from the plant roots can do much in the 
way of breaking the chemical forces; but, 
fortunately for the grower, the chemist’s 
skill can overcome this difficulty and we 
have either dissolved bone or acid phos¬ 
phate to apply to our fields, knowing that 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


113 


in both ingredients we have a mono-cal¬ 
cium phosphate and a sulphate of lime. 
The same form of plant food is in each, 
but it is accompanied by a little more sul¬ 
phate of lime in the acid phosphate than 
in the dissolved bone. This sulphate of 
lime is really no plant food, but it has a 
wonderful influence on the crops because 
of the chemical changes caused by its 
presence in the soil, through which much 
latent plant food becomes available. Such 
an agent is termed a “catalyzer” and it 
is now generally recognized that phospho¬ 
ric acid is also a great catalyzer, and that 
it well pays to apply far more than is ac¬ 
tually needed by the plant, because of 
this quality. Another effect of a large 
phosphoric content is a tendency to has¬ 
ten maturity. This is a detriment in the 
raising of some crops, beans and celery, 
for instance, but the citrus grower who 
wishes to avail himself of the advantages 
of an early market finds this fact of great 
value.' 

Basic slag is another source of phos¬ 
phoric acid. It is very slow acting and 
its value is still undetermined. 

Peruvian guano is called a phosphatic 
fertilizer, but contains some of all four 
essentials. Though of organic origin, it 
cannot be classed as an organic fertilizer, 
really, for its condition is such that al¬ 
though it has all the virtues of organic 
matter it has none of the evils, therefore 
it can be used in citrus culture. Indeed, 
under some circumstances and when re¬ 
enforced with the correct proportions of 
the proper chemicals, it stands pre-emi¬ 
nent. 

We have given considerable force to 
the word available because in both am- 


moniates and phosphatic goods, the “plant 
food” is so likely to be useless to the plant. 
When there is an abundance of unavaila¬ 
ble plant food in even the poorest soils, 
why add more? The value in applied fer¬ 
tilizer is in its quick results . If we have to 
wait until the next year or the next gen¬ 
eration to get returns for the money in¬ 
vested this year we are losing the use of 
our money, for there is only the plant 
food we have paid for and the longer it 
stays in the soil the longer our money is 
locked up. Some people have expatiated 
upon the effects shown in after years. A 
certain amount of plant food will produce 
only certain results and the longer it takes 
for it to produce these results, the more 
time there is for wastes through drainage, 
etc. A grower should build up the text¬ 
ure of his soil by proper tillage and the 
addition of humus, but Nature has fore¬ 
stalled him in furnishing unavailable 
plant foods. 

All our potashes are water soluble and 
in the same form whether from organic 
sources, ashes, or from the different pot¬ 
ash salts—nitrate, sulphates, muriate or 
kainit. They differ only as to their sur¬ 
roundings. The organic source used is 
pulverized tobacco stems and the one 
drawback is the extreme high cost. This 
precludes its general use. The potash in 
ashes also costs so high that ashes are in¬ 
variably bought because of other qualities 
and not for their potash content. We have 
already taken up nitrate of potash under 
the nitrates, and dealt with sulphate of 
potash under our talk about acids. We 
would mention, however, that the low 
grade sulphate of potash contains a large 
percentage of sulphate of magnesia and is 


114 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


liked by the citrus grower because this 
magnesia acts readily as a base and aids 
in sweetening the land. Muriate of pot¬ 
ash is the richest of the potash salts, but 
because of its chlorine content cannot be 
used on certain crops. It is especially un¬ 
desirable for citrus trees and tobacco. 
Ivainit has even more chlorine, part of 
which is in combination with sodium, 
making about one-third of kainit our or¬ 
dinary salt. This is quite effective in 
vegetable raising for driving away in¬ 
sects and some fungous troubles, but for 
many crops would need to be applied at 
least a month before planting or it would 
“burn” the plants. 

Thus we have much to think about 
when trying to supply food to vegetation 
just what sources—just what propor¬ 
tion each of the different forms of am¬ 
monia used should make of the whole am¬ 
monia content, that there be no lack, no 
waste,—just how much phosphoric acid 
and potash to put with this ammonia to 
give exact balance to this particular crop. 
It is a long, long lesson and one that must 
be worked out in the field; but when it 
comes to mixing these ingredients, how 
many times does the lack of chemical 
knowledge cause great loss! I know, 
personally, one prominent gardener who 
mixes ashes with his fertilizer and chuck¬ 
les as he smells the escaping ammonia, 
because the mixture is “so strong .” It 
has often seemed to me that one of the 
wisest sayings I ever heard in regard to 
home mixing of fertilizer was: “The man 
who knows enough to mix his fertilizer, 
generally knows enough not to” 

Let us for a closing paragraph briefly 
note the course of the plant food after it 


enters the plant. It is absorbed through 
cell walls as through the walls of the 
rootlets and passes from cell to cell up¬ 
ward, remaining the same crude sap, in¬ 
capable of nourishing the plant, until it 
reaches the leaves. There it is “digested” 
and becomes “elaborated” sap capable of 
forming live substance, first in the veg¬ 
etable kingdom and then on to animal 
matter. This change can take place only 
in those portions of the plant which are 
green in color, being the result of the 
combined action of chlorophyll and sun¬ 
light. Chlorophyll is the green substance 
in leaves, young twigs and immature fruit 
and while absolutely necessary to higher 
plant life, is powerless to act except un¬ 
der the influence of the sun. All growers 
appreciate the value of color in the leaf, 
but many fail to realize the great impor¬ 
tance of abundant foliage and of giving 
sunlight free access to same. Dense 
growth encourages disease as well as in¬ 
sects. 

From the leaves, the elaborated sap 
goes by way of the inner bark to supply 
the various needs of the plant. 

Three questions naturally arise: Why 
does the soil moisture enter the plant? 
Why does it work upward? How is it 
that the right materials are carried to the 
right places to supply the plant’s needs, 
if these materials are at hand, and after 
the need of a certain substance is supplied, 
generally speaking, the roots take up no 
more of that substance, however plenti¬ 
fully it may lie around them? 

The first is answered by the fact that 
the soil water is less heavily laden with 
plant food than the plant’s juices ~o it 
pushes its way into the cells. The up-

ward circulation is caused by this action 
combined with capillary attraction and 
the tendency of Nature to fill space, and 
space for more sap is constantly being 
made by evaporation from the leaves. 
The return circulation is aided by the 
heavier weight of the elaborated sap, but 
as to the rest—well, I have studied at¬ 
tempts to explain this and have found 
only very lame “explanations.” We are 
dealing with live substance that exercises 
a control of its functions not possessed 
by inert matter. As my entire work has 
been seeking to understand with a view 
to acting in accord with Nature, and I 
fail to see how I could take any part in 
this work were it possible to understand 
it, I simply accept it as one of God’s great 
mysteries and bow my head in reverence 
for His wondrous works.

Corn As a Second Crop 


E. S. Hubbard. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

The vegetable crops of Florida are 
mainly grown in the winter and early 
spring, and whether profitable or not the 
greatest economy in farm management 
the grower can accomplish is to follow 
the vegetable crops as far as necessary 
with forage crops for the farm animals 
and poultry, and of these forage crops the 
most important is corn. 

The southern types of corn are richer 
in protein than the more starchy north¬ 
ern varieties and form a more complete 
food for stock. The Michigan Experi¬ 
ment Station has shown that horses will 
endure as much work on the same weight 
of corn as of oats at less expense, and I 
have kept my own horses in good health 
and condition for several years on no 
other grain than home grown corn. 
Ground on the cob with addition of a lit¬ 
tle cotton seed meal, home grown corn 
makes an inexpensive food for milk 
cows and the feed bill for poultry be¬ 
comes almost a negligible quantity where 
there is a well filled corn crib to draw on 
with a sheller standing by the door. 

In choosing varieties the flinty ones 
should be selected to minimize the loss by 
weevils and the farmer should select his 
seed carefully to improve and perpetuate 
the type he wants. Taking one season 


with another I do not consider it profita¬ 
ble on my soil to grow the socalled pro¬ 
lific varieties setting several small ears 
to the stalk which under unfavorable con¬ 
ditions go largely to nubbins and require 
a great deal more labor to harvest and 
shell. For the past three years I have 
been growing Cocke’s Prolific which I 
think gives me better average results than 
any I have tried. This variety shows 
eight, ten and twelve row ears, the ten 
row predominating, and sets mostly two 
ears to the stalk. By selecting twelve 
row flinty ears I have largely eliminated 
the eight row and reduced the number 
of ten row ears. Under my conditions 
two ears to the stalk, twelve rows to the 
ear seems to produce the maximum yield 
at the minimum expense of handling. 

I plant in drills with a two row west¬ 
ern style planter after digging Irish po¬ 
tatoes last of April, without giving the 
land any preparation and the dried up 
vines give very little trouble. 

This planter puts in one and one-half 
acres per hour with fair length rows. I 
plant in rows three feet four inches apart 
the same width as my Irish potato rows 
and lay by the corn in similar ridges as 
for Irish potatoes, driiling cow peas in 
the furrows with the planter when laying 
by the corn. When the corn crop is har-

vested by husking in the field I drag down 
the stalks with a cutaway harrow and 
then split the ridges with a sulky disk 
cultivator followed by a middle burster 
thereby listing all the stalks, pea vines, 
etc., into the furrows and ridging the 
land for the coming winter’s Irish potato 
crop. There is a marked improvement 
in the fertility of land where trash is con¬ 
served as humus instead of being burned 
off. After the corn has dried out several 
weeks on a floor, I keep it in old straw¬ 
berry refrigerators which are rat proof 
and as warm weather comes on about 
once a month pour in a little bi-sulphide 
of carbon to kill the weevils. I expect to 
shell, sack and sell more than enough 
corn each year to pay for making the 


crop. 1 estimate my average yearly yield 
at thirty bushels of shelled corn per acre 
chough sometimes the best land will run 
as high as fifty bushels. Several south¬ 
ern experiment stations have proved it 
does not pay to pull corn fodder, the loss 
in weight and solidity of the corn costing 
more than the fodder is worth. After 
leveling the potato land crab grass comes 
in plentifully, and two cuttings, August 
and October, average at least four tons 
of hay per acre. 

With home grown corn and hay as ro¬ 
tation summer crops for the winter veg¬ 
etables, the Florida farmers have a great 
advantage for the acreage cultivated over 
their northern brethren.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE AND CHINESE EVERGREENS 

FOR OUR FLORIDA GARDENS. 


H. Nehrling. 


Mr. President , and Ladies and Gentlemen 

of the State Horticultural Society: 

There is no country in the world 
where flowers, trees, shrubs are so 
universally beloved as in Japan. 
They are inseparable from the 
life, art and literature of the people, 
and to deprive the Japanese of their flow¬ 
ers would be to take 'the sunshine out of 
their lives. Beautiful plants are enjoyed 
equally by the high and low. The charm¬ 
ing natural landscapes of the mountain 
sides, of glades and glens and along the 
lakes and rivers are a continual pleasure 
to one and all. The richer classes, in the 
seclusion of their well-kept gardens, can 
almost constantly feast their eyes on the 
beautiful, while the poor have the benefit 
of the public parks, gardens and flower 
shows, and even the poorest of the poor 
devote a few cents of their earnings to 
the gratification of their taste. Flowers 
in beautiful and tasteful china pots or 
vases are everywhere present, and the 
private grounds—but particularly the 
temple gardens—are replete with floral 
treasures. They were the delight of the 


first explorers. The pioneer botanists and 
horticultural collectors raved over the 
many new and extremely beautiful plants, 
which they discovered in the gardens and 
forests of this island empire. In fact 
Japan, and more recently also China, have 
been almost inexhaustible treasure 
grounds for the plant collector. Our gar¬ 
dens are at present replete with plants 
from these far-eastern countries. I shall 
mention here only a few. The Japanese 
Lilies are the most exquisite, the most 
beautiful in the world. The Chrysanthe¬ 
mum reigns supreme in our flower shows 
in November. The Japanese or Kaemp- 
fer’s Iris with its huge flowers in many 
fantastic colors is a glory in many of our 
moist gardens, while the Paeony is the 
undisputed queen of June at the north. 
Unfortunately only a few of these plants 
succeed well in Florida. But we have the 
gorgeous Camellia or Japonica, as it is 
universally called in the south. We have 
the deliciously scented Banana Shrub, the 
Cape Jasmine or Gardenia, the Pittos- 
porum and the Loquat, the Hortensia or 
Hydrangea, the evergreen Azaleas, the 
gorgeous Fortune’s double Yellow Rose,

119 


and the dense Cherokee, Banksia and Mc¬ 
Cartney Roses, all hailing from Japan and 
China. For our subtropical gardens most 
of these, including the Bamboos, are ideal 
plants in every respect. They are ex¬ 
tremely beautiful, but not more beautiful 
than our own natives. It should always 
be kept in mind that the native plants 
must form the foundation of every gar¬ 
den. Among palms the Cabbage Palmet¬ 
to, and in extreme southern Florida, the 
Royal Palm should always occupy the 
first place. There is no more beautiful 
flowering evergreen tree in the world 
than our native Magnolia grandiflora. 
The charming Loblolly Bay, the Dahoon 
and the Holly, the American Olive, have 
all characters of their own, and when 
well-grown, are not outrivalled by exotic 
forms. The Live Oak is as beautiful as 
it is picturesque, and the Laurel Cherry, 
very dense and bushy, is a tree always 
graceful and conspicuous. Our native 
Juniper, commonly known as the Flori¬ 
da Red Cedar, can rival in beauty with 
many exotic conifers. The Wax Myrtle 
cannot be missed in landscape gardening, 
its broad bushy growth, and the faint 
brownish cast in the green of its aromatic 
foliage makes it particularly effective. In¬ 
deed we could make beautiful gardens in 
using only our native plants were we de¬ 
prived of exotic material. But variety is 
the spice of life, and in horticulture we 
look constantly for variety. The larger 
the number of species we grow, the more 
different their forms and flowers, the 
greater and the more lasting will be our 
pleasure. There cannot be the least 
doubt that the beautiful Japanese and 


Chinese plants supplement happily our 
own native species. 

I have experimented largely during the 
last twenty-five years with Japanese and 
Chinese plants, particularly with broad- 
leafed evergreens, having imported di¬ 
rectly from Yokohoma and Tokio large 
consignments. Many were the losses and 
few the results at first. But the blame 
was on my part, not on that of the plants. 
All these plants arrive with rootballs of 
heavy soil. If set out with the ball this 
dries out in our dry season, the roots can¬ 
not penetrate into the surrounding soil, 
and the plant is invariably lost after 
struggling hard for life. Every particle 
of soil must be shaken or washed off, 
and the plant cut back and re-set. If 
transplanted in good rich soil, it will 
usually grow. The right time for plant¬ 
ing is November and December. Out of 
a number of about 150 distinct species, I 
have found that the following are a per¬ 
fect success in my high pineland garden 
of western Orange county. 

Michelia fuscata —Banana Shrub or 
Banana Magnolia, is the jewel among all 
these plants. Flowers here at the begin¬ 
ning of April. Blossoms creamy white, 
each petal faintly edged violet. Strongly 
and deliciously fragrant, the fragrance 
reminding of ripe bananas. The form of 
the shrub, which eventually attains a 
height of 15 feet with a crown diameter 
of 10 to 12 feet, is extremely graceful. 
A native of China but largely cultivated 
in Japan, 

Michelia compressa —A native of 
southern Japan. The flowers, which are 
very fragrant, are pale yellow and over

an inch in diameter. It grows well but is 
often infested with scale insects. 

Illicium religiosnm —The Japanese 
Star Anise shrub, is a very bushy grow¬ 
ing, beautiful and interesting plant. The 
leaves when crushed are strongly aromat¬ 
ic, reminding of sassafras, and the small 
inconspicuous flowers exhale also a faint 
perfume. It attains a height of 15 feet. 
The lower growth is very broad and at 
the top it tapers to a narrow point. It is 
one of the sacred plants of Japan, al¬ 
ways planted in the neighborhood of tem¬ 
ples and common in private gardens. 
From the powdered bark, mixed with re¬ 
sin are prepared the “smoke candles,” 
with which incense is made in the tem¬ 
ples. I have quite a number of fine speci¬ 
men plants, which grow luxuriantly on 
high pineland. The Japanese and Chin¬ 
ese deciduous Magnolias,—almost ever¬ 
green in Florida—such as Magnolia Yu- 
lan, M. stellata, M. Soulangeana, M. ob- 
ovata, M. parviflora and M. Watsoni,—» 
grow well with me, flowering from No¬ 
vember to March. All my plants though 
healthy are rather stunted, never making 
such exquisite specimens as we see in Au¬ 
gusta, Ga., Atlanta, Washington or St. 
Louis where many of them grow to tree 
size and are masses of color in early 
spring, before the leaves appear. 

Camellia Japonica —One of the glories 
of our southern gardens, ranks very high 
as an ornamental shrub. Before the big 
freeze I have seen specimens from 20 to 
30 feet high in Tallahassee, Quincy and 
Monticello, and some about equally tall 
in Jacksonville. Camellias grow well ev- 
everywhere in my garden even in full 
sunshine, but they are doing best and 


flowering most profusely in half shade 
and in rich rather moist soil. There are 
hundreds of garden forms, double and 
single, and all are beautiful. 

Camellia reticulata —From Hong 
Kong and southern China, has very vivid 
rosy-red single and double flowers. It 
grows much better and flowers more pro¬ 
fusely than the common Camellia. 

Camellia Sasanqua —The Susan Ku- 
wa of Japan, is a small bushy tree of 
dense growth. There are single and 
double forms, some of them immaculately 
white. All the flowers are fragrant. They 
flower with me in November and Decem¬ 
ber. The double white form blooms 
most profusely at Christmas time. This 
species and its varieties is better adapted 
to our soil and climate than any other 
Camellia. 

Camellia Thea —The Tea Shrub, is a 
fine ornamental plant, perfectly at home 
in our State. It should be planted every¬ 
where where choice flowers are appre¬ 
ciated. The blossoms are single, pure 
white with a bunch of yellow stamens. 
Some forms are very fragrant. 

Cleyera Japonica —This is one of the 
most conspicuous and impressive of all 
my plants. The growth is dense and con¬ 
ical. The foliage is glossy green and of 
oval form. In May the nodding creamy 
white small flowers appear most profuse¬ 
ly, perfuming the air of the entire gar¬ 
den. In August the cherry like reddish, 
mealy fruits burst open and show the nu¬ 
merous vivid red seeds which form an 
additional charm. The old leaves as¬ 
sume a bright red color. 

Eurya Japonica —and its variegated 
forms are also charming shrubs, but need

shade and some attention. This is usual¬ 
ly a small shrub only a few feet high, but 
Prof. C. S. Sargent saw a specimen in 
the woods surrounding a temple near Na- 
katsu fully 30 feet in height. The col?r 
of the leaves is yellowish green on the 
upper surface and decidedly yellow be¬ 
low. 

Ternstroemia Japonica —is another 
plant, like Cleyera Japonica, which is 
considered sacred by the votaries of the 
Shinto religion and therefore planted in 
the grounds of the Shinto temples and in 
most private gardens. Though the flow¬ 
ers cannot be considered showy the foli¬ 
age and the growth are very conspicuous. 
It thrives well in Florida and is always an 
object of great beauty. 

The finest and most beautiful of all the 
Hollies is the Japanese Ilex latifolia — 
perhaps the handsomest broad leaved ev¬ 
ergreen tree that grows in the forest of 
Japan. It is much cultivated in private 
and temple grounds. The leaves are 
about six inches long and four inches 
broad and very thick dark green and ex¬ 
ceeding lustrous. The large scarlet fruit 
of this tree, which does not ripen until 
the late autumn or early winter months, 
and which is produced in the greatest pro¬ 
fusion in axillary clusters, remains on the 
branches until the beginning of the fol¬ 
lowing summer. This holly forms beau¬ 
tiful specimens in our gardens and it 
should be largely planted not only on ac¬ 
count of its brilliant fruit but also on ac¬ 
count of the size and the character of its 
abundant foliage. It requires rich and 
rather moist soil, but succeeds well on 
high pine land. My largest specimens 


planted in 1897 are now about nine or 
ten feet high. 

Ilex Integra and I. rotunda —Both are 
doing well in good soil, but Ilex crenata 
does much better. It forms an exceeding¬ 
ly dense and beautiful shrub 3 to 4 feet 
high. The leaves are very glossy and 
not at all like those of our own hollies. 
The berries are black. It is much grown 
in Japan and is now common in this coun¬ 
try as far north as Philadelphia. Varie¬ 
ties with variegated foliage are common 
and apparently much esteemed. It is sur¬ 
prising that almost all the broad-leaved 
evergreens grown by the Japanese have 
produced in the course of time many sil¬ 
ver and golden variegated forms. They 
were carefully preserved and largely pro¬ 
pagated. Even among the bamboos and 
palms, the orchids and the herbaceous- 
perennials such variegated forms are nu¬ 
merous and highly prized by the Japan¬ 
ese.’ This fact shows plainly that these 
plants must have been grown in the Mi¬ 
kado’s empire since times immemorial. 

Other a laponica —Appears to be close¬ 
ly allied to the hollies. It is a dense ever¬ 
green shrub with glossy foliage and black 
berries. It grows well with me on high 
and low land. One of the founders of 
this society, the late Mr. E. H. Hart at 
Federal Point, informed me years ago 
that he had a specimen in his grounds 
fully 15 feet high and of a dense and 
compact habit. 

Euonymus laponicus —With green, sil¬ 
very and golden variegations in its abun¬ 
dant foliage is not as often seen in our 
gardens as its beauty justifies. The plain* 
green-leaved form is a very robust grow¬ 
er, but this is also' divided by the Japan- 


122 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


ese in quite a number of forms or varie¬ 
ties. There is one with very large glossy 
foliage, E. Japonicus var. macrophyllus, 
another with very small leaves, var. mi¬ 
cro phyllus, another one having an upright 
columnar habit, var. colmnnaris, etc. 
Very beautiful are the variegated forms, 
and as they can be used very effectively 
as ornamental border and hedge plants, 
they will prove valuable for our gardens. 
There are golden and silvery varie¬ 
gated forms with large and small 
leaves. The variety E. J. argen- 
teo — variegatus, has leaves edged 
with white, another form shows white 
blotches. The form E. J. aureus has 
leaves almost entirely golden yellow but 
when they get older they change mostly 
to a deep green. In E. J. aureo variega¬ 
tus, the leaves are blotched with yellow. 
There are other forms all very pretty. 
The Euonymus to do its best in our gar¬ 
dens needs a rich deep soil and during 
winter or in the rainy season an appli¬ 
cation of good fertilizer. All are small 
growing plants rarely exceeding 4 or 5 
feet in height. There is a scandent spe¬ 
cies, the climbing Euonymus (E. radi- 
cans ) common in middle and north¬ 
ern Japan, where it carpets the 
ground under forest trees and often 
climbs 20 feet high on the trunks, which 
it encircles with great masses of lustrous 
foliage. This fine climber is of great val¬ 
ue for decorating the bare trunks of pines 
and oaks in our gardens. I had most 
beautiful specimens of this species, also a 
number of variegated forms ( E. radicans 
var. argenteo — marginatus, with foliage 
bordered white; var. roseo-marginatus , 
with leaves bordered pink) but they were 


destroyed by a severe forest fire. This 
species requires shade and moist rich soil. 

Hydrangea Hortensia (the first as well 
as the second name are used in popular 
language)—is one of the greatest orna¬ 
ments of our gardens. Requires shade 
and rich moist soil. Attains a height of 
8 feet and is covered with hundreds of 
immense flower clusters in April, May 
and June. Growth very dense and bushy. 
The Japanese grow almost hundreds of 
distinct forms'of this plant and there are 
many of them in cultivation in this coun¬ 
try. The majority have beautiful rosy- 
red flower clusters but they all change 
to a beautiful deep azure blue, (or even 
into a kind of indigo blue) in our Florida 
soil. The following varieties are the best 
for our purposes. H. Hortensia — 
(first introduced from Japan in 1790 to 
France and named after Hortensia, the 
daughter of Empress Josephine and 
mother of Napoleon III). Common in 
our gardens. H. H. var. serrata , with 
serrated segments; H. H. var. nigra with 
dark purple or violet almost black stems, 
very distinct and beautiful. One of the 
best. H. H. var. Otaksa has white flow¬ 
ers, which do not change their color. H. 
H. var. Thomas Hogg is another fine 
form. These glorious plants deserve spe¬ 
cial plant sheds for their well-doing and. 
should be grown by the hundreds and 
thousands. 

Aralia papyrifera (Fatsia papyrifera) 
—A common and most impressive plant 
of our gardens. I remember having seen 
specimens 12 to 15 feet high and as much 
in diameter in Orlando years ago. In

November they usually flowered, and 
were surrounded by numerous buzzing 
insects. 

The large, much lobed leaves, deep 
green above and silvery beneath are ex¬ 
tremely ornamental and when in flower 
the plant is still more conspicuous, though 
the large loose bunches of blossoms are 
only greenish white. This is the plant, 
which supplies the celebrated Japanese 
and Chinese rice paper. 

I have had no success with Aralia (Fat- 
sia) Japonic a and with the very orna¬ 
mental allied Dendropanax Japonicum. 
There is no doubt that I would be able to 
grow them to perfection now. My ex¬ 
periments were made ten to fifteen years 
ago. At that time I also experimented 
with the New Zealand Flax (Phormiuni 
tenax) and its varieties, and lost all 
plants. Last year I again made an at¬ 
tempt. I planted them out in my Cala- 
dium shed, and they are thriving vigor¬ 
ously. 

I have always admired the beautiful 
dense oval shaped specimens of the Ever¬ 
green Snowball in New Orleans and Mo¬ 
bile, where grand specimens 15 to 20 feet 
high can be seen in the gardens and parks. 
This is the fragrant Viburnum odoratis- 
simum. The foliage is large and lustrous, 
the branches dense, and the fragrant 
large flower trusses are produced in the 
early days of April. I have a fine speci¬ 
men in my garden but it is crowded to¬ 
gether with other shrubs. In order to 
admire its unique beauty of growth, it 
should stand aione in an isolated spot. 
It needs rich and rather moist soil for its 
development. Viburnum Azvafuki and 
the large leaved V. macrocephalum also 


grow well with us if they receive good 
care. Without cultivation and constant 
care few of these exotics thrive well in 
this sandy, thirsty and hungry soil. 

The Indian Azaleas (Azalea Indica), 
not an inhabitant of India but of sou¬ 
thern China, is one of our fashionable 
spring plants. The firm of Henry A. 
Dreer of Philadelphia alone imports from 
14 to 15 carloads each spring and all are 
sold out a few months later. In southern 
Georgia, I have seen gardens glowing 
with the beautiful shades of these gor¬ 
geous flowers. I saw them in masses and 
as single specimens. I was informed that 
they would not grow in Florida, but I 
have had beautiful healthy plants along 
the border of my lake. They were, un¬ 
fortunately, destroyed by fire. The most 
beautiful collection of these charming 
plants is undoubtedly found in the gar¬ 
dens of Mr. H. L. Beeman, of Orlando. 
In shady ravines along the shores of 
Lake Sue there are specimens 6 to S' feet 
high and these are a mass of blooms in 
late January and early February. 

Andromeda Japonica, and A. formosa, 
the latter with waxy white fragrant flow¬ 
er bells, thrive well in shady moist spots. 
Both are very handsome evergreens, the 
second species being the best of the two. 

Osmanthus aquifolium, the Holly¬ 
leaved Olive, forms a very fine dense tree 
in northern Florida, but in the southern 
part of the State it is only a rather small 
shrub 3 to 4 feet high with a compact 
head, loaded in October and November 
with small fragrant flowers. It can only 
be grown successfully in shady moist sit¬ 
uations. 


124 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Osmanthus fragrans, better known as 
Olea fragrans, the Sweet Olive, is a na¬ 
tive of China. Its strongly and delicious¬ 
ly fragrant flowers are produced here in 
the late fall or early winter months. This 
is a gem among shrubs, but though it 
thrives well in Florida, it never attains a 
large size. My plant is at least 16 years 
old but it is not taller than six or eight 
inches. I think it would prove a fine sub¬ 
ject for grafting on our native O. Amer¬ 
icana or on the True Olive. 

Ligastrum Japonicum —The Japanese 
Privet, is one of the finest avenue trees in 
New Orleans, being loaded in November 
with grape-like clusters of berries. The 
foliage is very dense and each leaf is ob¬ 
long and of a deep green color. It is 
not a success on high land but will un¬ 
doubtedly prove valuable on low rich 
moist soil. It has pendent branches, and 
is always very unique and conspicuous. 

Ehretia serrata is an interesting Chi¬ 
nese tree. The leaves are large and ser¬ 
rated, and in March large clusters of fra¬ 
grant milky white flowers appear. It 
thrives well on high and low land and is 
a rapid grower. My specimen comes 
from one of our most celebrated horticul¬ 
turists, Mr. Theod. L. Mead of Lake 
Charm. 

The Laurel family is richly represented 
in Japan and China, and almost all its 
members form very distinct and beautiful 
objects in our gardens. We all know 
the Camphor tree, Cinnamomum cam¬ 
phor a, which forms an ornament of many 
of our Florida gardens. Its dense 
growth and fine form speak for it every¬ 


where. Young specimens always look 
best. Old specimens are more picturesque 
than beautiful. 

Cinnamomum cassia, the Mock Cinna¬ 
mon Tree, is even more beautiful, a dense 
large leaved tree with bright glossy green 
foliage, which has a glaucous hue on 
the underside. It is a native of southern 
China and appears to be quite as hardy 
as the orange. There is a most beauti¬ 
ful group of these trees in Mr. E. N. 
Reasoner’s grounds at Oneco, Florida. It 
thrives well on high and low pine land. 
Cinnamomum Loureirii is a middle-sized 
tree from Hong Kong and Cochin China. 
Leaves large and glossy green, and the 
form of the dense growing mass of 
branches is rather globular. Cinnamomum 
pedunculatum from Japan, with thick 
deep green lustrous foliage, silvery white 
underneath, is also' well adapted to our 
gardens. Years ago I saw strikingly 
beautiful specimens of both of these two 
last species in the hotel grounds of the 
Sanford House at Sanford. The speci¬ 
mens were so dense and so extremely 
beautiful that they attracted my attention 
immediately. I have never been able to 
obtain plants of these two species. Ma- 
chilus Thunbergii and Litsea glauca are 
both handsome evergreen trees from Ja¬ 
pan, but they only thrive well in low rich 
soil. 

I cannot recommend the species of the 
genus Elaeagnus too highly. E. umbel- 
lata and E. longipes are two good fruit¬ 
bearing shrubs which grow finely in my 
garden and fruit abundantly. The first 
one ripens its almost cherry-like drupes, 
early in May, the latter in June and July. 
Both are interesting also from an orna-

mental point of view. The following 
kinds, known also under the names of 
Oleasters and Silver Shrubs, belong to 
the finest and most beautiful of all our 
ornamental plants and thrive particularly 
well on high and dry pineland. All of 
these kinds are half climbing, densely ev¬ 
ergreen and of unique beauty. They all 
flower in November, perfuming the air 
to a great distance with their clove-like, 
or rather carnation-like odor. A little 
after New Year the bushes are covered 
with a profusion of oblong berries, which 
can be utilized for making jelly. The 
masses of new leaves, which appear in 
early April or late in March, are beauti¬ 
ful silvery white above and almost pure 
white underneath. When mature they 
are dark glossy green above and silvery 
below with numerous minute brown dots. 

Elaeagnus reflexa with blunt recurved 
hooks along its rampant shoots is the 
tallest grower. I have masses of them in 
my wild garden among young pines, 
which they cover completely. The shoots 
grow 15 to 30 feet in a few seasons. They 
are well adapted for covering young oaks, 
camphor trees, wild cherry trees, etc. 
The flowers are small whitish, of clove¬ 
like form and exhale a strong and most 
delicious perfume during November. The 
young shoots are cinnamon brown. 

E. pangens is not quite as rampant a 
grower but it soon forms dense masses 
of foliage and branches. The leaves are 
larger, deeper green and the branches are 
of a dark grayish color. The fruit is 
large and reminds of currants in taste. 
I have hybridized these two species and 
obtained a distinct kind with large fine 
fruit. 


There are silvery and golden forms of 
this species and all are beautiful. All 
grow well in rather dry soil. E. macro- 
phylla , the Large-leaved Silver Shrub, is 
perhaps the most beautiful of this group. 
It is a rampant and dense grower. All 
are well adapted for pergolas, garden 
houses, for ornamental hedges and for 
large groups among other trees. They 
are also fine as isolated specimens. They 
should be found in all our gardens. 

Pittosporum Tobira is an old inhabitant 
of our Gulf Coast gardens. In Mobile I 
have seen trees 20 to 25 feet high, em¬ 
bellished with a dense crown of glossy 
deep green oval foliage. The creamy or 
sulphur colored flowers, appearing in 
dense trusses at the ends of the shoots, 
are about as fragrant as orange blossoms. 
There was a fine tree of this pittosporum 
in the rear of the court house in Orlando, 
fully 15 feet high, but it has disappear¬ 
ed. 

Its variegated silvery form is rather 
dwarf ? forming dense flat heads about 5 
to 6 feet high. 

The Loquat, Eriobotrya Japonica is. 
one of the most beautiful ornamental 
trees we have. Its fine form, its large 
plaited foliage, its sweet-scented flowers, 
and its conspicuous fruit-clusters combine 
to make it an object of rare beauty. 

Daphniphyllum glancescens and D. ma- 
cropodon, Aucuba Japonica, Skimmia 
Japonica, the charming and deliciously 
fragrant Daphne odor a, thrive best in 
deep shade and in rich soil. All are very 
valuable evergreens of rather low growth. 
Damnacanthns Indians, a little spiny 
shrub with white fragrant flowers and 
red berries, grows in similar situations. 


126 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Photinia serrulata so common in the 
gardens of Georgia and northern Florida 
does not do so well in my garden as I 
desire. It would perhaps do well in mois- 
ter locations. 

Rhaphiolepis Indica from Hong Kong 
is a dense large growing shrub with glos¬ 
sy ovate leaves and clusters of fine white 
blossoms, covering the entire plant early 
in March. The young leaves are bright 
red. R. ovata is of low flat growth. 
Stereospermum sinicum and Strcmvaesia 
glanca are both Chinese evergreens of ex¬ 
ceptional beauty. 

Buddleia variabilis superba adds a new 
type of beauty to our gardens, when it 
has fully developed its numerous flower- 
shoots. The flowers are bluish violet, 
fragrant and appear here in Florida late 
in April. Nandina domestica, the Sacred 
Bamboo of Japan, is also a very interest¬ 
ing and beautiful plant. We must not 
omit from our list the Sago Palm, Cycas 
revoluta, which grows equally well on 
high and low land and is perfectly hardy 
.all over the State. 

The Windmill Palms, Tr achy carpits ex- 
celsa and T. Fortunei are rarely found in 
our gardens, though very distinct and 
handsome. There is a large fine speci¬ 
men of the first named species in Mr. W. 
J. Ellsworth’s garden at Jessamine, Fla. 


The two species of Bamboo Palms, 
Raphis dabelliformis and R. humilis, 
grow best in half shade among ferns and 
caladiums and such like plants. Both 
form eventually large clumps of many 
stems, the first one growing 6 to 8 feet 
high, while R. humilis never grows taller 
than about 3 to 4 feet. 

It would lead too far to go into detail 
in describing the many fine coniferous 
plants of Japan. I have only found the 
following adapted to our soil and climate. 
Podocarpus Japonica and P. Nagei, both 
requiring shade, and Cunninghamia Sin¬ 
ensis. 

Of the evergreen climbers the follow¬ 
ing may be mentioned : Kadsura Japonica, 
Stauntonia hexaphylla, St. macrophylla 
and Trachelodspermum jasminoides, all 
exquisite woody climbers. The two Hon¬ 
eysuckles, Lonicera Japonica and L. 
Halliana, are too well known to need to 
be recommended. 

I have now in my garden a large num¬ 
ber of tender evergreen trees and shrubs 
from Yunnan, southwestern China, which 
were collected recently by Mr. E. W. Wil¬ 
son for the Arnold Arboretum and which 
were sent to me by Prof. C. S. Sargent 
of Harvard University for experimental 
purposes. None of these novelties are 
yet named. This will be done as soon as 
they have flowered.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

When we scan the pages of previous is¬ 
sues of the reports of this society in or¬ 
der to avoid what has gone before, it 


seems rather difficult to find anything to 
say that may be regarded as of sufficient 
value to justify taking the time of the so¬ 
ciety to say it. However, in a more or 
less general experience of upwards of 20 



FLORIDA ,ST ATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


127 


years in plant growing in this State there 
may be some bits of experience perhaps 
profitable to study, and these we will at¬ 
tempt to recall. 

We began the practice of horticulture, 
ornamental as well as practical, on a loca¬ 
tion among the sand hills of the West 
Coast with full confidence in the fertile 
soil of that locality and its advantageous 
situation beyond the reach of frosts, 
knowing (?) that here our much prized 
‘‘tender things” of glass houses and hot 
beds would laugh Old Boreas to scorn. 
In December we planted geraniums, helio¬ 
tropes, fuchsias, etc., not exactly for 
shade but to have some shrubbery about 
the place while our trees, such as helian- 
thus, ricinus, hollyhocks, rubber trees, 
etc., were coming on to make the perma¬ 
nent shade desired. For our hedges we 
could have nothing finer than asters, mig¬ 
nonette, candytuft, etc.; true some prun¬ 
ing might be required but our new hedge 
shears were equal to that. 

In the way of bulbous plants we had 
brought with us a good variety of tu¬ 
berous-rooted begonias, cyclamen, gold- 
enbanded and other lilies, tigridias, dah¬ 
lias, etc., all of which would be useful at 
the shows in the fall. All these w&re du¬ 
ly planted and started on their mission 
of the desert. During the succeeding 
weeks, while these things were forming 
that sturdy groundwork so necessary to 
a permanent structure, we indulged our¬ 
selves in numerous tours through the 
hammocks so common to our part of the 
State. 

In February something went wrong, 
somebody had made a mistake. And our 
embryo shade trees, hedges, etc., were 


prostrate in the grip of an icy norther. 
What was to be done ? Back to the woods 
we went to figure it out. After all per¬ 
haps nature knew what she was about, so 
we began again, with material from the 
hammock. We planted our “boulevard” 
with live oaks, water oaks, magnolias, 
red bay, gums, cherry laurel and Ameri¬ 
can holly, all of which are in abundant 
supply. 

For the embowering of our cottage 
we brought out cross vines, yellow jessa¬ 
mines, smilax, coral honeysuckles, trum¬ 
pet creepers and others. For shrubbery 
for so high and dry a situation we selected 
varieties found in the higher soils, such 
as azaleas, andromedas, gray beard or 
fringe tree, dog wood, and from the mud 
we took the needle palm, which has suc¬ 
ceeded admirably. 

As thorough work when planting is 
more than half the battle, we dug large 
holes, used an abundance of first class 
muck well mixed with the sand, pressed 
the soil firmly about the roots and water¬ 
ed liberally, after which the trees and 
shrubs took care of themselves. 

All the varieties named have proven 
well adapted to our light dry soil. Con¬ 
trary to all advices we have found the 
live oak equal in growth to the water oak. 

Some other plants found in the sand 
hills effective for use about our homes 
are “Butterfly flowers,” belonging to the 
milk-weed family. We have found nu¬ 
merous shades of orange and lemon col¬ 
ored flowers. These have thick, fleshy 
roots and transplant readily. They bloom 
in spring and early summer and individ¬ 
ual flowers hold quite a long time. 


128 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Liatris, or button snake root, in five or 
six varieties, mostly with light purple or 
magenta colored flowers; some bulbous 
rooted, others of a tuberous rooted na¬ 
ture. These bloom from September to 
November and are prominent in our list 
of fall blooming natives. 

There are also a number of varieties 
of wild asters which can probably be suc¬ 
cessfully placed under cultivation. Flow¬ 
ers one-half to one inch across, in shades 
of purple. 

Centrosema Virginiana, belonging to 
the pea family, is a charming little vine 
found along the edges of hammocks. 
The blooms, which are about i 1-2 inches 
across, come in various shades from lav¬ 
ender to light blue. 

But the season is advancing and we 
will leave the hammocks and study the 
lists of introduced plants. These we 
shall for convenience place under the 
head of Hardy, and Half Hardy. 

Among hardy plants are a number of 
Bamboos, which thrive well in almost any 
soil and are exceedingly handsome in ap¬ 
pearance. Bambusa argentea, and its varie¬ 
gated relative, argentea striata, are spe¬ 
cially vigorous growers in the hardy class, 
attaining a height of 30 to 40 feet, and 
may be considered of value for the pur¬ 
pose of windbreaks. Bambusa metake is 
a handsome dwarf sort, with broad leaves, 
attaining a height of 8 to 12 feet. The 
Golden Bamboo, Bambusa aurea, spreads 
rapidly by means of underground stems 
and is likely to prove a- nuisance on a 
lawn. 

For general purposes the Oleander may 
be classed as hardy though usually in¬ 
jured more or less by our extreme cold 


waves. While some of the varieties are 
well known, the family as a whole does 
not receive the attention deserved. Of 
easy growth, good decorative appearance 
and with an abundant return in the way 
of deliciously fragrant flowers during 
many weeks of spring and early summer, 
planting has mostly been limited to four 
or five sorts. That there is quite an ex¬ 
tended list of varieties does not seem gen¬ 
erally known. We find in one Florida 
catalogue a list of 17 varieties, consisting 
of double and single forms of red, pink, 
white and cream and various shades and 
markings in pink and white. 

The Crape Myrtle is also a very satis¬ 
factory hardy shrub of easy growth. For 
weeks in summer covered with great 
glowing umbels of flowers in many shades 
of color from lightest pink to crimson and 
purple. The white variety has not proved 
as good a grower with us as the other 
sorts but its delicate beauty justifies all 
necessary coddling. 

Pomegranates are also well worth a 
place in any grounds. Their glowing scar¬ 
let flowers resembling a bouquet of crape 
set in a crimson wax holder are very con¬ 
spicuous and pleasing amid the deep 
green foliage of the plant, while the large 
apple-like fruits are much esteemed by 
many who use their juice in making 
drinks. 

The Silk Oak, though not literally 
hardy with us, survives all except the 
most severe freezes, and excepting the 
winter of 1894-5 has not been cut back 
severely by cold. Its racemes of curious 
yellow and purple flowers are very at¬ 
tractive and the tree itself presents a 
striking and handsome appearance.

In the Camellia family we have a good 
range of sorts of great beauty. While we 
have not found the Camellia to thrive in 
full sun we have had good results grow¬ 
ing the plants in half shade. 

A very showy family of plants is the 
Chinese Azalea. Of dwarf, compact hab¬ 
it these plants so cover themselves with 
bloom as to almost conceal the foliage, 
and resemble huge bouquets. The varie¬ 
ties, of which there is quite a wide range, 
come in various shades and markings of 
pink, crimson, white, etc., and in double 
and single forms. These do well in a 
light soil in partial shade. 

The Sweet Olive, or Tea Olive, is a 
plant of easy growth and very desirable. 
Its dwarf habit and dark green foliage 
form a pleasing appearance, and it pro¬ 
duces freely in spring quantities of small, 
cream colored flowers with a most charm¬ 
ing ripe peach fragrance. 

One of the most peculiarly striking 
plants in our list is the Bottle Brush, the 
name of which adequately describes the 
blooms. These are developed in clusters 
four or five inches long and about I 1-2 
inches diameter, are freely produced, and 
the plant in full bloom forms a most 
beautiful object. The Bottle Brush 
thrives readily in poor, dry soil and 
blooms several times a year. There are 
various shades of pink, crimson, white, 
etc. 

Among Half Hardy Shrubs we have 
several varieties of Bauhinias of great 
beauty. Bauhinia alba has large pure white 
flowers 3 or 4 inches across. Bauhinia 
purpurea is one of the most showy and 
handsome of the family; the flowers are 
marked purple, white, mauve, etc., and 


are produced in great numbers in winter 
or early spring. 

Chinese Hibiscus and Allamandas are 
most valuable shrubs in this list, produc¬ 
ing freely all summer quantities of showy 
and beautiful flowers. Though easily 
killed down by frost they readily start 
again in spring and bloom freely in sum¬ 
mer. In fact the Allamanda may be said 
to be benefited by this frequent pruning 
as it results in the production of new, 
fresh wood. 

The Dwarf Poinciana should have a 
prominent place in any lawn planting. Its 
red and gold flowers are most beautiful, 
and freely produced the greater part of 
the summer. While not so ready to start 
after being killed down by cold, is readily 
grown from seed and commences flower¬ 
ing when quite small. 

Other shrubs of easy growth and that 
start readily after injury by cold are 
Cestrums, both night and day blooming 
sorts, producing myriads of small, white 
flowers that in the case of the night 
blooming sorts perfume the air for a long 
distance around. 

Clerodendrons, with flowers of white 
and deep red; Eranthemum, deep blue 
flowers; Plumbagos, pink, light blue and 
white flowers freely produced most of the 
summer; Hamelia patens, small scarlet 
flowers; Tabernaemontana or Rose Bay, 
white flowers; Thunbergias, blue and 
white. 

In Hardy Vines we have Bignonias in 
variety, flowers of yellow, red, cream, 
purple, etc., all free bloomers; Tecoma 
capensis, practically hardy, red flowers 
produced during the greater portion of 
the year; Wistarias, blue and white; Hon-

eysuckles in variety, as also a considerable 
variety of Jessamines, so called, of which 
probably the Star or Confederate Jessa¬ 
mine is of the most value. This sort pro¬ 
duces over a period of several weeks great 
quantities of small white flowers with 
a charming fragrance. 

In Half Hardy Vines there is a very 
extensive list, including some varieties of 
Bignonias, notably Bignonia venusta or 
Flame Flower, a most vigorous growing 
sort which starts quickly after injury 
by cold and flowers again the following 
fall. In bloom it is one of the most strik¬ 
ing .objects imaginable, large plants pro¬ 
ducing such numbers of blooms as to 
give the effect of great sheets of flame. 
We have a plant of this variety that 
though killed to the ground two years 
ago bloomed at the eaves of a 35-foot 
tank house the past winter. 

The Antigonon or Rosa de Montana is 
also one of the most valuable of vines; 
of an herbaceous character, starting early 
in spring commences blooming early in 
the summer and produces in the greatest 
profusion its rich pink flowers until fall. 

With so abundant a supply of hardy 
and half hardy trees, shrubs, vines, etc., 
from which to draw for our needs for 
permanent planting there would seem lit¬ 
tle requirement for annuals, which call 
for a greatly increased amount of care 
and attention to attain success. 

And while considering our plans for 
planting let’s not forget the birds. Flow¬ 
ers and birds are fit companions and both 
do much to add to the pleasure and con¬ 
tent of home surroundings. Include in 
your planting one or two wild cherries, 
some elders, lantanas, a few downy myr¬ 


tles, cattley guavas, and other fruit pro¬ 
ducing plants and your bird friends will 
sing so sweetly your home will be more 
attractive to your human friends. 

DISCUSSION. 

Discussion after Dr. Nehrling’s paper. 

Mr.-: I move that a vote of thanks 

be extended to Dr. Nehrling for his pa¬ 
per. 

Vote taken standing. Unanimous. 

M ( r. Temple: I would like to ask if 
that Sacred Bamboo can be secured any¬ 
where. Are any of the dealers in Florida 
handling that Sacred Bamboo ? 

Dr. Nehrling: I do not know. I think 
I have seen it in some of the older cata¬ 
logues years ago. My specimens came 
direct from Japan. Do you handle it, 
Mr. Reasoner? 

Mr. Reasoner: No, we do not have it. 

Mr. Mills: We carry it. It is a mighty 
bad thing to speak up for your own busi¬ 
ness right here, but since the question was 
asked, I will answer it. That we have 
is from one of the original plants brought 
to this country. D. G. Ambler had it, and 
after the fire Mrs. Ambler gave it to me 
to plant. We have propagated it, and I 
can say it is one of the best things in 
Florida. In the winter time it is a beau¬ 
tiful red color, and the plant seems to be 
perfectly healthy. 

Prof. Hume: For those who do not 
know the gentleman speaking, I would 
say that it is Mr. C. D. Mills, of Jack¬ 
sonville. I have seen the plant growing 
in Tallahassee. It seems to be perfectly 
hardy there, even though the tempera¬ 
ture goes down to fourteen or fifteen de¬ 
grees.

ORNAMENTALS FOR THE LOWER EAST COAST. 


J. B. Donnelly. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

I have been asked to present a paper 
on ornamental planting on the lower 
East Coast, but, as I am only acquainted 
with conditions and plants at Palm Beach 
and vicinity, I will have to confine my¬ 
self to that locality. 

As you are probably aware, Palm 
Beach is a strip of land lying between 
Lake Worth and the ocean, it varies in 
width from one-fourth to one mile, and 
consists of a rocky ridge along the lake 
front, and a sandy one on the ocean; the 
depression between is of a swampy na¬ 
ture. It has been filled in and drained 
in many places and makes fine garden 
land, but some of it still remains the home 
of the alligator and turtle. Along the 

lake front are the winter residences of 

* 

wealthy people who come to occupy them 
every year, and on these grounds around 
these homes, is where the plants and trees 
are grown that I will try to describe. 

The cocoanut palm (cocos nucifera) is 
perhaps the most prominent feature of 
the landscape. They grow here in large 
numbers, some of the original planting— 
thirty-five years ago—still remaining, 
beautiful trees fully fifty feet high bear¬ 
ing hundreds of nuts every year. As 
they are easily propagated, they are large¬ 
ly used as an avenue tree and for wind¬ 
breaks, etc. 


Several varieties of the Date Palm 
(Phoenix) are represented by many fine 
specimens. A good many set fruit every 
year which rarely ripens, owing to heavy 
rains about the ripening time, (August 
and September.) 

The Royal Palm (Oreodoxa regia) 
grows very well here. Many specimens 
are fully forty feet high. A few of them 
bore seed for the first time last year. 
There has been a great number of young 
plants set out in recent years that are do¬ 
ing well. 

There are not as many varieties of 
palms planted out here as might be, and 
I have no doubt they would do as well 
as those that have been planted. We 
have nice specimens of Areca lutescens 
and A. rubra, both varieties bearing quan¬ 
tities of seed every year. Latania bor- 
bonica also bears seed, Caryota urens, 
Seaforthia elegans, Pritchardia Pacifica, 
and the California palm, Washingtonia 
robusta are well represented. 

The socalled Sago Palm (Cycas revolu- 
ta) grows luxuriantly here, some speci¬ 
mens are eight feet high and bear quanti¬ 
ties of seed. 

We have a magnificent specimen of 
Cycas Circinalis, with leaves ten feet long. 

Pandanus utilis grows to a large tree 
with heavy branches and bears seed every 
year. P. Veitchii makes large clumps 
from ten to twelve feet high and holds its 
variegation well. When planted close it 
makes a fine hedge or windbreak.

132 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


A very ornamental plant which grows 
well here is Ravenala Madagascariensis, It 
grows about twenty feet high and blooms 
every year making seed freely. Strelit- 
zia regina is another fine plant that grows 
to a height of fifteen feet. The variety, 
Augusta bears seed freely, humilis blooms 
but does not produce seed. Of the Agaves 
we have several varieties that grow to a 
large size and send up tall bloom stalks. 
They are used as single plants on the 
lawn and planted on the dividing line be¬ 
tween lots, as there are no fences. 

Of the Conifers we have Araucaria ex- 
celsa and A. glauca. They make very 
handsome trees. 

Bamboos, when protected from the east 
wind do well. We have several varieties, 
many of them fifty feet high. 

Among the tropical fruit and shade 
trees which are largely planted here may 
be mentioned Albizzia Lebbek, Poinciana 
Regia, Tamarindus Indica, Cecorpia pal- 
mata, Cupania Sapida, several varieties 
of Anona, Cicca disticha, Eugenias, Per- 
sea Gratissima, Harpephyllum Caffrum, 
Terminalia Catappa, several varieties of 
Ficus, Casuarina equiseti folia, Grevillea 
robusta, Achras Sapota, and many oth¬ 
ers. The native Ficus (F. Aurea) which 
grows here to such a large size is a very 
fine shade tree. There are several oth¬ 
er native trees that are very desirable, 
such as the Satinwood (Chrysophyllum) 
Sea Grape (Coccoloba uvifera), Mastic, 
etc. 

Of flowering shrubs the Oleander and 
Hibiscus in many varieties are largely 
planted both as specimen plants, clumps, 
hedges, and windbreaks. Several varie¬ 
ties of Bauhinia, Oestrums, and Cassias, 


Cordia Sebestina, Artobotrys, Galphimia 
Nitida, Hamelia patens, Jacobinias, Ixo- 
ras, Murraya exotica, Lawsonia alba, and 
many others furnish cut flowers at all 
times. 

Of vines, the most popular here are 
Bougainvillea Sanderiana, and Bignonia 
Venusta: besides these we have Abrus 
precatorius, Allamanda Hendersonii, An- 
tigonon leptopus, Quisqualis Indica, 
Beaumontia Grandiflora, several varieties 
of Jasminum, Ipomoea, and Aristolochia, 
Cryptostegia Grandiflora, Stephanotis 
floribunda. Thunbergia—two varieties, 
several varieties of Bignonia and Tecoma, 
Stigmaphyllon ciliatum, Petrea Volubu- 
lus, and many others. 

The red flowering Bougainvillea—B. 
lateritis—is a recent favorite. It grows as 
well, and blooms as freely as B. Glabra, 
and is, I think, a decided improvement 
in the color of the flowerbracts. 

In ornamental foliage plants our Cro¬ 
tons take the lead. We grow about twen¬ 
ty varieties. They are grown in beds, 
borders, and single specimens. They are 
cut back every year, and are so easily 
propagated that every one has a supply 
of them. Some specimen plants are fifteen 
feet high and are very handsome. 

Acalyphas—four or five varieties—vie 
with the Crotons in coloring and effective¬ 
ness in beds, borders and single plants. 
They also have to be cut back, sometimes 
twice a year. Phyllanthus Nivosa var. 
Rosea picta is used for hedges and bor¬ 
ders. It is very handsome, and much ad¬ 
mired by visitors, Aralia filicifolia, and 
A. Guilfoylei, and several varieties of 
Panax are much used. Several varieties 
of Furcraeas, aloes, and Euphorbias are 



FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

used as single plants and for outlining 
boundary lines, and Yuccas are used for 
the same purpose and for protecting or¬ 
ange groves from predatory visitors. 
They make a good fence and windbreak. 

There are a great many other tropical 
and sub-tropical trees, shrubs and plants 
that I have not mentioned that grow here 
in the open ground without any protec¬ 
tion whatever. 

I have two Orchids, Vanilla planifolia, 
that are growing on the north side of two 
Date Palms for the past six years with¬ 
out any protection; they have bloomed for 
the past two years, but have not set fruit. 

During the winter months we grow 
quantities of annuals, such as Salvias, 


Petunias, Marguerite Carnations, Candy 
tuft, Mignonette, Nasturtiums, etc., etc., 
for cut flowers. Besides these we have 
good Tea and Hybrid Tea Roses, Easter 
lilies, etc. I may add that there is very 
little attempt made at landscape garden¬ 
ing. In some places plants are huddled 
together in a border without any regard 
to their future size, or else planted out 
promiscuously in the open, usually in 
straight lines with no regard to vista or 
surroundings. 

The subject of my paper is an interest¬ 
ing one to me. There are so many trees 
and plants growing here that I have not 
mentioned, and which if I did, would 
make this paper much too large, so I will 
close. 


Theodore L. Mead 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

My paper today will necessarily con¬ 
sist of only a few notes, as since I have 
been of the fraternity of market-gard¬ 
eners I have found that crops, especially 
under cloth cover, require all the time 
there is, including days and nights and 
holidays and Sundays and leave little 
time for any side interests. 

My orchids surprised me by their en¬ 
durance of hardship and neglect. I man¬ 
aged to water them with the hose about 
once a week and fired the greenhouse 
boiler on the coldest nights, but could do 
little else. The glass sashes were re¬ 
moved during the summer, leaving the 
lath shading so that the plants had the 
benefit of the summer rains. Nearly all 


the terrestrial plants in the greenhouse 
died from neglect, but at least two-thirds 
of the orchids survived and g'ave a grat¬ 
ifying display of flowers in their season. 
A few rare hybrids now ornament your 
president’s desk. 

The new amaryllis varieties, as bred 
by Dr. Nehrling at Gotha, have proved 
a great improvement upon the scarlet 
sorts commonly grown in Florida gar¬ 
dens, and we owe Dr. Nehrling a debt 
of gratitude for putting these beautiful 
forms within our reach, as his seedlings 
are nearly equal to the foreign named 
varieties, which cost often ten dollars 
and more for each bulb, when imported 
from the European fanciers. 

With a little patience anyone may now 
have a royal bed of these fine varieties 





134 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


at small expense. Two or three bulbs 
may be purchased, and the pollen trans¬ 
ferred from flower to flower when they 
bloom. Seedpods full of seeds will be 
ripe in a few weeks from which hun¬ 
dreds may be grown by the amateur. 

Three years ago I had a single bulb; 

I sowed the seeds it produced in a raisin- 
box of rich soil and gave them only or¬ 
dinary attention till the next summer, 
when I had 200 small bulbs to plant out. 
They have made a well-filled bed about 
4x20 feet and though only half of them 
flowered this year, the bed was a blaze of 
bloom, as many as 150 flowers being 
open at once, many of them of great size 
and varying in color from nearly white . 
to deep scarlet and crimson. 

My vegetable gardening experience has 
taught me that Florida soils must have a 


steady artificial water supply to yield sat¬ 
isfactory returns of either flowers or 
other products. If flowing wells can be 
had and clay is near the surface, subir¬ 
rigation is all that can be desired, but 
only a few can have such facilities. Now 
that good gasoline engines can be had for 
$30 or $40, they are as necessary and no 
more costly than a good fence is in the 
cattle and hog country which still com¬ 
prises most of rural Florida. 

Ten minutes time a day and maybe a 
cent’s worth of gasoline will make almost 
any Florida desert blossom as the rose, 
beside supplying an abundance of water 
for household purposes, and this should 
become as much a matter of course in ev¬ 
ery Florida homie as is a cook-stove or a 
set of bedroom furniture. 


Tropical Fruits 


SMOOTH CAYENNE PINEAPPLE CULTURE AT 

PUNTA GORDA, FLA. 


J. M. Weeks. 


Mr . President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Some weeks ago I was requested to 
write an article on the above subject, and 
I asked the gentleman making the request 
whether or not he wanted a true history 
of the fruit as I know it here—the fail¬ 
ures as well as the successes. “Oh,” he 
remarked, “you need not mention the 
failures.” The article was not written. 
I believe the stating of actual facts as 
nearly as we can give them, and the pre¬ 
senting, as nearly as we can, reasons for 
the successes and the failures in any busi¬ 
ness, to be better eventually for the State 
and the community, than painting every¬ 
thing “rosecolor,” thus finally creating 
discontent and disgust in the enthusiastic 
settler. 

My experience in pineapple growing 
has been limited to the culture of the 
Smooth Cayenne variety, under sheds, 
near Punta Gorda during the past ten 
years. 

Almost all the lands in and adjacent to 
Punta Gorda are adapted to the shed- 


grown, fancy, Smooth Cayenne pineapple, 
but some are better than others. For in¬ 
stance, lands lying within one-half mile 
of Charlotte Harbor are better protected 
from cold than those farther away. Then 
some low lands which can be readily 
drained are better than the higher, lighter, 
more sandy soils, because they seem to 
contain more humus and the pineapple is 
a very gross feeder. 

The country about Punta Gorda is 
nearly level, with a gradual slope from 
the interior to the shores of the bay, thus 
giving good drainage where ditched. Its 
natural growth is pine trees and palmet- 
toes. 

The first step for the prospective pine¬ 
apple grower, after selecting and purchas¬ 
ing his land, is to have it cleared, or 
“grubbed.” This will cost him from 
$30.00 to $50.00 per acre, the price being 
governed by the amount of trees and pal- 
mettoes on the tract. Then it should be 
plowed and later harrowed fine. The 
first plowing will cost $6.00 per acre, and 




136

the harrowing from $ 4 - 5 ° t° $ 5 *°° P er 
day. 

The construction of the shed is next 
in order. Ten years ago when we could 
buy the best lumber for $14.00 per thou¬ 
sand feet delivered, we used 1x3 inch 
slats, generally 16 feet long, for the par¬ 
tial covering, placing the three-inch slats 
three inches apart, thus making a half 
cover, and a protection from both heat 
and cold. These slats were placed north 
and south so that there would be alter¬ 
nately sunlight and shade over the plants 
and the fruit, as the sun makes its daily 
journey from east to west. They were 
placed on 1x8 inch by 16 ft. stringers, 
which rested on fat pine posts eight feet 
apart one way by fourteen or sixteen 
feet the other way. Those sheds then 
cost about $600.00 per acre. The great 
advance in lumber, however, necessitates 
the construction of cheaper sheds, so we 
now place our posts fourteen by fourteen 
feet apart, using No. 10 galvanized wire 
instead of the heavy 1x8 stringers, No. 
14 wire for cross supports and ordinary 
building, or plaster laths, woven with No. 
16 wire, instead of the 1x3 slats for the 
cover. This shed can be constructed for 
about $400.00 to $450.00 per acre. It is 
about seven feet high, and protects the 
pineapple from both extremes of heat and 
cold, and conserves the moisture in dry 
seasons. This, together with proper fer¬ 
tilization and cultivation, produces pine¬ 
apples so large, so juicy, so luscious, and 
so tender that one fruit will be sufficient 
for two meals for a large family and the 
pulp may, if desired, be separated from 
the peel and eaten with a silver spoon. 

Next, the beds are made up and the 


plants are set out. There are four kinds 
of plants, viz., suckers, slips, rattoons, 
and crowns. Of the four, suckers are 
best and crowns least desirable. I usually 
set plants eighteen by twenty-four inches 
apart, thus getting about ten thousand 
to the acre. Other growers set them at 
different distances, each to his own lik¬ 
ing. Plants cost from $25.00 to $50.00 
per thousand, according to whether they 
are or are not culled. As before stated the 
pineapple is a gross feeder. After hav¬ 
ing been set out the young plants should 
be fertilized immediately and afterwards 
at intervals of every six weeks, of course 
being frequently worked with the “scuf¬ 
fle” hoe. At least $100.00 in fertilizer 
per acre should be given the plants to 
bring them to maturity. 

Plants mature their fruit from fifteen 
to twenty-four months after having been 
set out, and the same plant, or rather, the 
plant and suckers thereon, will bear, if 
properly cared for, several crops. I have 
plants which were set out more than five 
years ago and which are still giving me 
good results. The richer the soil in 
which the young plants are set, the longer 
will the fruiting continue. 

The pineapple has many diseases and 
the fruit many enemies. Thus, wilts (a 
fungus growth), root-knot, dieback, ants, 
and mealybugs are some of the principal 
enemies of the plant. It matters not 
which of these diseases attacks a plant 
the result is much the same, that is, the 
roots die and the plant languishes, get¬ 
ting what nourishment it can without 
roots. Six years ago we used to throw 
these plants in piles outside the pinery and 
burn them, to prevent, as we supposed,. 


FLORIDA ,ST ATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


137 


the further spread of disease. Now, we 
simply pull them up; cut off the dead 
roots, strip them, put them back in a hole 
made by a posthole digger, throw a half¬ 
handful of fertilizer among their leaves 
and let them grow. About 75 per cent, 
of plants so treated do well. We fight 
the enemies of the fruit with poisons. 

Results after all are the test of success, 
hence, we want to know what are the re- 
suits of all this expenditure, labor, and 
waiting. If the land and plants be prop¬ 
erly selected, if the plants be carefully 
and conscientiously fertilized and culti¬ 
vated, and are thrifty, the first crop 
should be about four hundred crates per 
acre at an average price of about $2.00 
per crate. After crops will run about 
three hundred crates per acre. Of all the 
fancy varieties, the Smooth Cayenne is 


most cultivated for market here, because 
it is smooth, while all other varieties with 
which I am acquainted are serrated; be¬ 
cause its flavor is delicious; because its 
appearance is striking and tempting, and 
because it is a better shipper than most 
of the others. He who buys one real good 
Smooth Cayenne will want another. 

I have used the word “failure” in con¬ 
nection with pineapple culture, and will 
say that any one who> will not give labor, 
fertilizer, and close'attention to the busi¬ 
ness had better not go into 1 it. There 
have been failures in every section where 
the shed-grown Smooth Cayenne pineap¬ 
ple has been grown. Perhaps proportion¬ 
ately fewer in Punta Gorda than in some 
other sections. I believe the soil and con¬ 
ditions about Punta Gorda to be especial¬ 
ly adapted to> the growing of this fruit. 


Miss Florence R. Harden. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

The excellent papers of Mr. Reasoner 
and Mr. E. V. Blackman, read before 
this Society last year, on tropical fruits, 
not only gave the names of a great many 
of the varieties that have been grown in 
Florida, but discussed many points of in¬ 
terest concerning the best known varie¬ 
ties. 

This paper will, I fear, be rather ram¬ 
bling in style, and will merely touch upon 
a number of fruits and questions about 
them that will be intended to provoke 
much discussion. There is no doubt in 
my mind that tropical fruits should have 


a more important place in this Society 
than they have ever yet had. tThe limited 
area in which these fruits will thrive, and 
the undeveloped condition of that portion 
of the State, together with the fact that 
most Americans have not become ac¬ 
quainted with even the existence of such 
fruits, partly accounts for this lack of in¬ 
terest. I should say lack of general in¬ 
terest for most of the information that I 
can find about tropical fruits has been 
written by men who either live in Flor¬ 
ida, or have spent much time in studying 
her resources and problems. I do not 
know how we are to induce people to take 
a general interest in the pamphlets, bul- 



138 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


letins and reports that have been written 
for us. The government has done its 
part to help the faithful ones to teach us 
all, but, alas! I do not think they are read 
as they ought to be. Perhaps, a more 
serious difficulty is, that the tropical 
fruits ripen in summer time when such a 
large per cent, of our educated people are 
out of the State. 

It has been proven that a great many of 
the choice fruits may be shipped safely, 
long distances. I have several times had 
mangoes and avocadoes shipped to me 
when they had to make a three or four 
days’ journey and they reached me in 
good condition and kept more than two 
weeks in an ordinary refrigerator, a few 
ripening each day. 

A little of my experience in having a 
display of tropical fruits at the Michigan 
State Fair at Detroit, may be given here. 
There were more than thirty varieties in 
the collection. The weather was very hot 
in the Southern States through which 
they had to pass and yet the first shipment 
which was well packed arrived in fairly 
good condition and the fruits kept so well 
that I had a creditable display left at the 
end of ten days. 

The keen interest the people took in 
these fruits was a constant surprise to me. 
Hundreds had never seen a grapefruit 
and the citrons, pawpaws, avocados, cer- 
imans, green cocoanuts, sapodillas, mam- 
mee apples, guavas, limes and many oth¬ 
ers aroused the keenest interest and many 
amusing questions. 

Almost every minute some one would 
say: Do you eat them ? All these things ? 
This too? Others who had traveled in 
the tropics were full of intelligent ques¬ 


tions about the country where these won¬ 
derful fruits grew. The taste for most 
of these fruits is supposed to be acquired, 
but I do not remember a single person 
who did not relish a fruit that I prepared 
for tasting. One great trouble is that 
often they are either under ripe or over 
ripe when first tried and of course that 
causes prejudice. 

I can remember when few people in 
the western states knew the taste of pine¬ 
apple, and the little green things were so 
sour that it is a wonder they got a hold 
on the people as soon as they did. I have 
a great many tropical fruits growing in 
my orchard and I find that most people 
like them at first taste, when they are just 
ripe. 

Something is usually said about man¬ 
goes and avocados, and I would not take 
up your time with them, but I must say a 
little. The East Indian mangoes are cer¬ 
tainly delicious, and salable, but, so far, 
they are such small producers for me that 
I think we need to know more about them. 
I have a large budded mulgoba, a beau¬ 
tiful tree, that is eight years old and it 
had the first blossoms this year and there 
are two fruits hanging on. Other trees 
seven years old have also the first bloom 
this year and only a few fruits. The 
Bennetts have done some better, but not 
well. They bloomed splendidly, but do 
not set much fruit. The Gordon did about 
the same. 

Eight years ago, we secured four doz¬ 
en mulgoba mangoes from Mr. Gale of 
Mangonia—large luscious fruits they 
were. We planted all the seed as an ex¬ 
periment. The seedling trees are large, 
vigorous and beautiful. They are very

different in appearance. This year a num¬ 
ber of them are fruiting, and I am eager 
for them to ripen. The fruit on three of 
the trees is a dark rich purple, with green 
underneath. They look like they will be 
large—are the shape of the mulgoba, and 
I think they are going to be a month ear¬ 
lier than the budded trees.' Part of the 
other trees have fruit shaped like No. II, 
some having large fruit and abundant 
quantity, while others are thin, poor look¬ 
ing fruits and still others are rounder. 
I hope to have a more interesting report 
of them next year. 

Dr. Gifford has some of the Philippine 
mangoes that he secured in Mexico that 
he hopes will do well here. The quality 
he says is as good as the best East In¬ 
dian varieties, and they are heavy bear¬ 
ers. 

Last year, Mr. Blackman reported that 
the Department of Agriculture at Wash¬ 
ington had pronounced an avocado, orig¬ 
inated by himself, and named the '‘Black¬ 
man” to be the best avocado yet tested, 
all points considered. 

This year, I have the honor of making 
a similar report—as a fruit sent from my 
orchard and named “The Haden,” in hon¬ 
or of Captain Haden, who planted the 
seed, was pronounced to have more good 
points than any yet tested. May the hon¬ 
or be shifted each year! 

Unfortunately, I have had to leave the 
State in summer the past seven years, 
and have missed learning many valuable 
lessons. 

I believe that there are possibilities of 
preserving, evaporating and otherwise 
treating these fruits, that would prolong 
their season. 


One of my neighbors dried some of the 
fruits of the carissa and said it acted very 
much like dried apples when soaked in 
water. 

The Carissa Grandiflora is one of the 
handsomest of our plants. The large 
white flowers are both beautiful and fra¬ 
grant and the deep red fruit on the dark 
green foliage is especially attractive. The 
first is a good deal like a raspberry in 
flavor, and makes a nice sauce or jam. 

The tamarind can be dried or put up 
in sugar or molasses, as the Bahamans do, 
and makes a pleasant drink when added 
to water, or they are nice used as a con¬ 
serve. I find that almost every one who 
passes my tree stops to look for a few 
ripe tamarinds and they are eaten as rap¬ 
idly as they ripen. 

The sapodilla has been neglected, as it 
is a fine fruit and the tree is very orna¬ 
mental. I find that the fruit makes one of 
the best sweet pickles I have ever made, 
I am going to try to dry them this year. 

It takes the seedlings a long time to 
bear, and there is a saying among the 
Bahamans that he who plants a “dilly” 
tree will not live to see it fruit. This 
may account for its scarcity in the gar¬ 
dens as most people are very fond of the 
fruit, and the tree grows of itself, after 
it is started. It grows wild on the keys. 

The sapota blanca is an unusually beau¬ 
tiful tree. Only a few weeks ago I said 
that I did not esteem the fruit of it highly 
but recently I have changed my mind. 
My tree is not in a good place and has 
very little attention, but I believe if it 
were well treated that we might grow to 
value it as they do in Mexico, where it 
is a great favorite.

The Surinam! cherry is such a nice 
fruit—the tree and fruit are both beau¬ 
tiful. I hope that more people will plant 
them. Many prefer them to strawberries, 
and they are certainly much less trouble 
to grow. The Barbadoes cherry is said 
to be even superior to the Surinam cherry. 

No paper on tropical fruits should fail 
to speak of the pawpaw (Carica papaya). 

It is so delicious and so wholesome. 
The fondness for it grows upon one and 
it can be prepared in different ways for 
the table. If you are short of vegetables, 
a green papaw, stewed like squash and 
seasoned with salt, pepper and butter can 
not be told from squash. If you want 
an apple sauce, season it with lemon or 


lime juice and add sugar. When ripe the 
favorite way is to eat them from the 
shell like a cantaloupe, but strangers like 
them better peeled, cut in cubes and sea¬ 
soned with sugar and lime juice. 

The Cocoa plum grows wild on the 
beaches and when one can get them they 
make a splendid substitute for the north¬ 
ern May cherry, if lime juice and sugar 
are added after they are stewed in water. 
The guava is so well known that I have 
not spoken of it although it is a very in¬ 
teresting fruit to me. Time would fail me, 
were I to try to tell of all the interesting 
fruits that we have in south Florida, so 
I desist.

Irrigation Experiments 


Milo B. Williams. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

During the spring of 1909 a co-opera¬ 
tive arrangement was entered into be¬ 
tween the office of experiment stations, 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, and 
Dr. Charles Drennen, of Orlando, Flor¬ 
ida, for the installation of an experimen¬ 
tal irrigation plant and distribution sys¬ 
tem for the purpose of investigating the 
practical and economical methods of ap¬ 
plying water to citrus groves in Florida. 

Preliminary surveys were run and tests 
made during the spring months of 1909, 
the tests being conducted with the pump¬ 
ing plant Dr. Drennen had at that time. 
Water was conveyed through the orchard 
in open ditches and applied to the sur¬ 
face by means of furrows or in basins, 
and a study made bringing out the follow¬ 
ing general data. 

(1) That the loss of water is exces¬ 
sive when run for a length of time in 
open supply ditches made in the sandy 
soil. 

(2) That water can be distributed 
over the surface in small furrows, pro¬ 
viding the furrows are given proper 
grades and from 25 to 30 gallons of wa¬ 
ter be supplied to each furrow per min¬ 
ute. 

(3) That the tendency of the dry soil 
is to present a resistance to the taking 


of water when first applied, which aids 
greatly in the flooding of small basin 
areas. 

(4) That the water when applied to 
the Florida high land soil in furrows does 
not percolate laterally in the root zone 
of the citrus tree more than 2 or 3 feet 
distance from the point of application in 
five days’ time, but has a tendency to go 
downward rapidly and be wasted in the 
deep porous white sand, making it neces¬ 
sary for a close spacing of furrows and 
a large flow of water to each furrow for 
a short length of time. 

From this data it was decided to re¬ 
model the pumping plant already on the 
ground in such a way that it could be 
used in supplying a distribution system 
built similar to the concrete construction 
used so extensively in the irrigation of 
citrus groves by gravity flow in Southern 
California. 

THE REMODELED PLANT. 

The pumping plant as now installed 
consists of a 25-horse power Hagen gas¬ 
oline engine, connected by belt to a 5-inch 
Gould centrifugal pump of the one-stage 
type. The water is drawn from a large 
lake supply and lifted to an elevation of 
34 feet above the lake water level, where 
it is delivered into a concrete standpipe 



142 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


which is situated at a controling eleva¬ 
tion in the orchard. 

The suction consists of a 7-inch steel 
pipe, while the discharge is made up of 
two 5-inch pipe lines to utilize some of 
the pipe on hand, left from the old plant. 

The economical capacity of the pump¬ 
ing plant is 44,000 gallons per hour, and 
the distribution system is designed to han¬ 
dle this amount. 

The general design of the distribution 
system consists of large water-tight con¬ 
duits, laid below the cultivated surface 
and following the most prominent ridges 
and reaching all high points in the or¬ 
chard. At points where it is desired to 
supply water to furrows or basins small 
standpipes or hydrants are placed in the 
underground conduit and the water 
brought to the surface through this con¬ 
struction. Each hydrant is equipped with 
a valve which controls the amount of 
water taken from the underground sup¬ 
ply, while in the sides of the standpipes 
are small division gates which divide the 
total head into the individual furrows. 
By means of check valves built into the 
main lines of the conduits the water can 
be taken in part or in whole to any por¬ 
tion of the orchard. 

The construction of the distribution 
system was begun during the spring of 
1910. The first conduit to be tested out 
was built of concrete according to stand¬ 
ard specification for their making in 
southern California, which calls for a 
“dry mixture” pipe, or a concrete pipe 
made from a comparatively dry mixture 
of sand and Portland cement wetted only 
to a consistency that will permit imme¬ 
diate removal of the molds, and cured 
carefully afterwards by applying water 


in the form of spray until the cement will 
set. Each section of pipe is coated on its 
inside surface with a mixture of neat ce¬ 
ment paint and the standard design of 
tongue and groove joint, as used in 
southern California construction, mold¬ 
ed on each length. Three thousand feet 
of the above design of pipe was made and 
laid in the Drennen orchard. 

In testing this amount of pipe under 
the Drennen grove conditions, the follow¬ 
ing difficulties have been encountered: 
That the same design of joint as used in 
the California field, where the water flows 
through the lines by gravity and under 
low pressure heads, is not practical for 
the pressure heads necessary to conduct 
water in the Drennen grove. That the 
shells of the dry mixture pipe are unde¬ 
sirably porous regardless of the neat ce¬ 
ment paint lining. 

With these data on hand, together with 
the results of comparative tests which this 
office has obtained from experiments 
with “wet mixture” concrete pipe, vitri¬ 
fied sewer pipe, and “dry mixture” pipe 
during the past winter months, it has been 
decided to delay the construction of the 
Drennen system and make arrangements 
to complete it in part with “wet mixture” 
pipe and in part with vitrified sewer pipe, 
which will give us a comparison of the 
three constructions under the same condi¬ 
tions. 

Molds for the “wet mixture” pipe are 
now being built, which will turn out pipe 
8 inches in diameter in sections 5 feet in 
length with a tongue and groove joint. 
A separate mold is being made also that 
will make a reinforcing concrete collar

to be placed about each joint to overcome 
the difficulties encountered in the Califor¬ 
nia joint. 

OBJECTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS. 

The Drennen plant is being installed 
with the following experimental objects 
in view:, (i) To learn the possibilities of 
surface application of water in the irri¬ 
gation of citrus groves in Florida; (2) to 
study the effects, value, and disadvantages 
of irrigation; (3) to determine the cost 
of pumping and applying water in irriga¬ 
tion by the surface methods; (4) to gain 
data as to the quantity of water necessa¬ 
ry for the insurance of citrus groves 
against drouth, and to open a field of 
cheap pipe construction that will meet 
Florida requirements. 

The plant when completed therefore, 
will be so constructed that the different 
methods of surface application may be 
experimented with, on different plots of 
the orchard, and a study made of the fea¬ 


sibility of each method. An effort will 
be made to determine the proper size, 
depth, length, grade, and spacing of fur¬ 
rows to use in obtaining an even distri¬ 
bution of moisture through the root zone 
and give the least waste of water. The 
proper amount of water to apply per ir¬ 
rigation, and the length of time between 
applications, with respect to the amount 
of rainfall, cultivation, and soil moisture, 
will be investigated in the hope of obtain¬ 
ing data that will be of value to those 
who are developing water resources or 
designing irrigation plants. The system 
will be equipped with measuring devices, 
whereby a continuous record will be kept 
of the amount of water used, together 
with the time of application. A standard 
rain gage is placed in the orchard so that 
the exact record of. precipitation and its 
distribution as to time can be had and the 
total amount of water any one .plat of 
the orchard receives during a day, a 
month, or a growing season can be calcu¬ 
lated. 


M. E. Gillette. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen: 

I am at a loss to know why I was se¬ 
lected as chairman of the Committee on 
Irrigation, as while I am generally on 
the water wagon, I know very little about 
irrigation. Fortunately, however, one of 
my associates is Mr. Campbell of Jack¬ 
sonville, who knows as much as anyone 
in the 'State about irrigation, and upon be¬ 
ing notified as having been appointed on 
this committee, I immediately wrote him 


and asked him to prepare a report on this 
subject. He replied that this was his busy 
season and that he was working twenty- 
four hours a day and didn’t have time to 
attend to it, but I have always found that 
the busy men are those who do things. 
He told me the other day he didn’t think 
he could be here, but he came into the 
room a little while ago and gave me this 
paper. He said he never read a paper 
before an audience in his life and said he 
was too modest and wouldn’t I read it. 



144 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


I don’t know whether he meant that as a 
reflection on me or not, but I will read 
you the paper. 

(Reads Mr. Campbell’s paper.) 

Now, Mr. Campbell referred in his pa¬ 
per to a system of irrigation which I dis¬ 
cussed at the last meeting and possibly it 
may be interesting to some of you to 
know that since that time I have installed 
a plant similar to that I described at Day¬ 
tona. Perhaps some of you were not at 
that meeting, and I will tell you what the 
plant is like. 

At one time, I had a plant which re¬ 
quired the use of a hose, and I disliked 
that very much. I found the hose rotted 
out in about one year, and it took a num¬ 
ber of men to handle it, and altogether 
it was quite unsatisfactory. While we 
got water on the trees of course, and while 
the first cost was not heavy, the cost of 
putting the water on was heavy, and it 
was pretty hard work, and for those rea¬ 
sons it was quite a temptation to put off 
applying the water, hoping from day to 
day that it would rain and thus obviate 
the necessity for going to> all the expense 
and trouble until long after we should 
have begun to water. To avoid that, I 
thought I would like to have it automatic, 
So Mr. Campbell installed a plant for me 
at Winter Haven. I now have this sys¬ 
tem covering ten acres, but intend to put 
it over forty acres. 

The engine used for power is a 50 H. 
P. double cylinder Hagan; the pump is 
a two-stage Gould’s Centrifugal. The 
main is six inches. The laterals from this 
main are 2]/ 2 to ij 4 inches. The main 
line runs up to this ten acre lot and then 
the same size main runs right across it, 


dividing it into two five acre tracts. The 
trees are twenty-four feet apart. The 
whole tract now is set to nursery and the 
stand trees are the same size as the nurs¬ 
ery seedlings. I am letting them come 
right along with the nursery seedlings. 
In putting down the pipe, we put it about 
eighteen inches under ground. The pipe 
under the ground is protected with a 
preparation of asphaltum, and the parts 
that stand up outside of the ground are 
galvanized. 

There are six laterals leading from 
each side of the main. Each lateral takes 
care of two rows of trees, and where they 
lead off from the main there is a valve 
right at the main. Then a pipe is 
put in opposite and up to within a foot 
of each seedling or grove tree. Then the 
pipe goes up at right angles to just above 
the top of the tree. In other words a pipe 
is put over each tree. You see, the pipe 
is absolutely out of the way, and if it 
were not for the upright pipe over each 
tree you would not know there was an 
irrigating plant on the place. 

Now, when we want water, my man 
goes down and turns on as many of the 
laterals as the pump will supply. We 
have a four inch sewer pipe that goes 
over the valve so as to keep it covered 
and keep the dirt out. Then he goes on 
down and starts the pump. We figured 
that we would run an hour on each one 
of the six lines on each side of that five 
acres. We figured that if we start in the 
evening, by six o’clock in the morning we 
would have let each line run an hour. 
That would give me an inch and a half 
of water over the whole ten acres in ten 
hours. 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


145 


You know how dry it has been. Dur¬ 
ing the dry period I went up there one 
day. The man ran the engine until 12 :oo 
o’clock, and I told him to run only a half 
hour on each section. At midnight, one 
side of the pump failed to work. I went 
there the next afternoon and there was 
not a place on that ten acres where I could 
kick up the dirt with my foot and find 
a particle of dry earth. Everything was 
absolutely soaked. 

Now, you understand this work was all 
done with one man. While the initial ex¬ 
pense is heavy, the running expense is 
mighty light. All there is to do is to 
start the pump going, go up and open 
and close a few valves, and that is all 
there is to it. One man goes to work 
at 5 :oo o’clock in the evening and works 
until 6 :oo o’clock in the morning, and 
the whole grove is completely watered. 

Then there is another advantage of 
having the pipe over the trees. The wa¬ 
ter comes down just like a rain, and wash¬ 
es off the leaves and drips down to the 
ground. As soon as the tree grows high 
enough so that the pipe does not reach to 
the top, I will extend the pipe so that it 
does. The water coming that way is just 
as near like a rain as anything can be. If 
we ever do have whitefly, which we prob¬ 
ably shall have some time, I believe that 
we can colonize the fungi in those trees 
and keep the pest very much in check. I 
believe it was at the last meeting where 
Prof. Rolfs said he did not think it would 
be possible to have whitefly in a grove 
where you could have moisture enough to 
propagate fungi successfully. 

As I have said, the first cost is pretty 
heavy, but I have never found anything 


in this light, porous, sandy soil that we 
can grow without sprinkling. I tried 
running the water down furrows, and 
have never found it to my satisfaction. 

I believe my method is one that will 
absolutely control the amount of moisture 
in an orange grove. Now, if we can have 
the fire pots in the winter months (not 
that we ever have any cold at Winter 
Haven) and have the water overhead in 
the summer, it seems to me we have 
a cinch on growing oranges and will be 
millionaires in less than no time. 

The spring is a critical time in the life 
of a crop. We may get the bloom all 
right, but if we don’t have moisture 
enough to keep it on the tree, we won’t 
get many oranges in the fall. Most of 
them go to the ground. Now, when you 
have an irrigation system such as the one 
I have installed, where you can have it 
when you see it is necessary, and don’t 
need to be afraid of the expense or 
trouble, you can keep enough bloom on 
your trees to insure you a crop. 

I would say that the cost of watering 
a grove, when you once get the plant in¬ 
stalled, will be about $5.00 or $6.00. That 
includes the man necessary to do the 
work, the gasoline, the wear and tear on 
the engine; in other words, that is the to¬ 
tal cost to you. 

Mr. Stevens : What was the cost of in¬ 
stalling per acre? 

Mr. Gillette: It cost me $5,500.00 for 
the ten acres. Of course, this buys the 
engine, pump, 600 or 700 feet of six inch 
main, and then I had to go from my pump 
house to the lake, which took 500 feet 
more of the six inch main. It is estimated 
that the next ten acres will cost about 


146 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


$2,500.00. Of course, the nozzles and 
sprays are included. They are quite ex¬ 
pensive. You will note Mr. Campbell 
says in his paper that he has a new nozzle 
that he thinks is going to work pretty 
well. 

Mr. -: I understand you to say 

you have 3-4 inch pipe over the trees? 

Mr. Gillette: Yes, sir. That seems to 
give service. Just as soon as we start 
the pump and turn those valves on, it 
looks like a fog. It is a solid mass of 
spray, and in ten minutes’ time the ground 
seems to be thoroughly wet, but, of course, 
it takes longer than that to put on water 
enough to do any good. I don’t really 
believe that it will take longer than from 
6 :oo o’clock until midnight to water the 
grove sufficiently, however. 

Mr. -: What is the estimated ca¬ 

pacity of the pump? 


Mr. Gillette: I have forgotten, exact¬ 
ly. I think it was guaranteed 7,500 gal¬ 
lons a minute and actual measurements 
showed I was getting over 10,000. 

Mr. Campbell: Hold on Mr. Gillette, 
Make that 750 gallons instead of 7,500. 

Mr. Gillette: All right, I guess it is 
750. That shows that some people here 
know what they are talking about, so far 
as the engineering proposition is concern¬ 
ed and I don’t pretend to but when it 
comes to knowing the results I want to 
obtain and whether or not I am obtaining 
them, I know pretty well what I am talk¬ 
ing about. 

With my system, it will be possible to 
water the whole forty acres in two nights, 
and I believe I had rather have a forty- 
acre grove irrigated this way, than 100 
acres without irrigation. 


J. P. Campbell. 


Mr. President , Ladies and Gentlemen : 

In the past I have had occasion to talk 
irrigation to several of you personally, 
and believe that I have done better by the 
subject that way than I will addressing 
you as a body, especially as I have had 
my time so fully taken up that it was 
only yesterday at the solicitation of 
Mir. Gillette, chairman of the Committee 
on Irrigation, that I decided to prepare 
this article. 

It is not my intention to attempt in this 
short space to discuss the subject of irri¬ 
gation from a technical standpoint, but 
will attempt briefly to cover some of the 


points most essential to the uninitiated 
who contemplate irrigation. 

Several years ago when I first became 
interested in the subject of irrigation it 
took hard work to find a farmer or fruit 
grower who would even take the time to 
talk about irrigation. The few plants that 
had been put in up to that time were most¬ 
ly improperly designed and constructed, 
and had not been successful, so the aver¬ 
age grower dismissed the subject as be¬ 
ing impossible or impractical. Now, a 
very different state of affairs exists and 
there are very few practical growers who 
do not realize the desirability, and most of 
them the actual necessity for irrigation 





FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


147 


on almost all crops that are grown in the 
State. There are, however, a great many 
of us who have very vague ideas regard¬ 
ing the subject of irrigation, and it is for 
the benefit of such that I will attempt to 
explain very briefly something about the 
different systems used in the different lo¬ 
calities of the State, and under the vary¬ 
ing local conditions. 

Have a letter here, which is similar to 
a great many I receive, reading as fol¬ 
lows : 

“I am' interested in the subject of irri¬ 
gation, and would like for you to give 
me full information and tell me how much 
it would cost to put in five acres.” 

This is all the information given. He 
does not state what system of irrigation 
he is interested in, the source of water 
supply, the character of soil, the crops to 
be grown, or a great deal of other infor¬ 
mation absolutely necessary in order to 
give him the information he requests. 

If this party, who for convenience we 
will call Mr. Jones, had been located in 
the Sanford celery district where flowing 
wells are easily obtained, and where cel¬ 
ery, lettuce and other similar crops are 
grown, and where on account of the hard 
sub-soil sub-irrigation is successfully 
used, he would probably never have writ¬ 
ten for information, but would have fol¬ 
lowed the example of his successful neigh¬ 
bors, put in a tiling system and used sub¬ 
irrigation, although I know of very prom¬ 
inent growers having perfect systems of 
sub-irrigation, who after seeing the very 
decidedly superior results obtained by 
their neighbors with a sprinkling system, 
have decided to use it themselves, retain¬ 
ing tiling system for drainage only. 


If he is located at Hastings where sim¬ 
ilar conditions prevail, but where potatoes 
are the principal crop, he can plant on 
beds about 20 feet across with water fur¬ 
rows in between them, and by filling these 
furrows with water, it would in a short 
time spread out on the hard sub-soil and 
permeate entire land between. 

If Mr. Jones is in the strawberry dis¬ 
trict of Bradford county, the flowing 
wells could not be obtained, but the water 
supply in the driven wells would come 
up near enough to the surface to be taken 
up with a suction pump and distributed 
into head ditches running along the high¬ 
est point of the tract to be irrigated, and 
as the strawberries and other crops in this 
section are usually planted on individual 
ridges instead of on broad lands, he can 
run the water down between alternate 
rows leaving the intervening middles dry 
for convenience in cultivation and pick¬ 
ing, the operation to be reversed next time 
water is applied. For this kind of irriga¬ 
tion it takes very little power, as the wa¬ 
ter only had to be raised to the surface, 
and a very cheap style of pump can be 
used. If the well is large enough and wa¬ 
ter supply sufficient so that it will not 
lower beyond 18 ft. from surface when 
pump is in operation, a 4 H. P. engine 
will take care of a 4 inch centrifugal 
pump with an approximate capacity of 
300 gallons per minute, which would un¬ 
der ordinary conditions be ample for as 
much as ten acres. 

On smaller acreages in this territory, 
the low pressure type of Rotary pump can 
also be used to advantage, if the wells are 
free from grit. If, however, there is any 
sand in the supply this type of pump 


-* A

should not be used, as the excessive wear 
on the cams would ruin the pump in a 
short time. 

If Mr. Jones was located at Center Hill 
or some other point in the State where he 
has good heavy soil, and does not wish 
to go to the expense of putting in sprink¬ 
lers close enough together to cover, he 
will probably use the over head perforat¬ 
ed pipe system, where the lateral pipes are 
placed about 50 ft. apart and supported 
on posts about 6 ft. high. These lateral 
pipes are tapped about 3 ft. apart, and 
usually small brass tubes are inserted so 
that the orifices will not become irregular 
or stop up with rust. Each lateral is sup¬ 
plied with a union so that it can be rotated, 
and a handle so that the lines of sprinkler 
tubes can be turned from one side to the 
other gradually, and in this way the en¬ 
tire surface covered. This system of ir¬ 
rigation is very popular and is probably 
more extensively used by vegetable 
growers than any other system. 

We will next suppose that our party is 
located at Eustis or some of the other 
points where similar conditions exist, and 
wishes to irrigate an orange grove. His 
land has considerable fall but is extremely 
sandy, and as he considers irrigation 
somewhat as an experiment, he does not 
care to put much money into it. He gets 
his water supply from a clear lake, and as 
the total natural and friction head is not 
too great he can use a single stage Cen¬ 
trifugal pump and a gasoline engine for 
forcing water up along the high side of 
his grove. He should use a large size 
pipe so that the large volume of water 
will not be decreased by unnecessary pipe 
friction. On the pipe along the high side 


of grove he should have large hydrants or 
plugs not over 100 ft. apart, and follow¬ 
ing out the original idea of cheapness he 
can convey the water discharged through 
these hydrants through a cheap canvas 
hose to the intervening rows between the 
hydrant openings. When this is all done 
and the pumping plant is started, he will 
probably find that on account of the ex¬ 
treme looseness of the soil, even the large 
head of water he has will not flow down 
between the rows very satisfactorily, and 
to overcome this he can use a machine 
made especially for that purpose which 
opens up a very shallow furrow and packs 
it at the same time, not only in the center 
but on the sides as well. He can open up 
three or four of these furrows between 
each row of trees, and when he now 
turns on his water he will find that it will 
glide down these packed furrows very 
freely, and by letting it run to the very 
lowest point first and gradually damming 
up, letting it spread out until the top is 
reached, you will get a very even distribu¬ 
tion of water and quite satisfactory re¬ 
sults. Of course, where the soil is not so 
loose and sandy this opening up and pack¬ 
ing furrows is not necessary. If Prof. 
Williams is present he will probably tell 
you about the successful experiment he 
has made at Orlando, using a similar sys¬ 
tem, and Mr. Mote will probably be will¬ 
ing to tell the Society of a plant he has 
recently installed on his magnificent grove 
in Lake county, where this system is used 
in a very highly satisfactory manner. 

Again, we will suppose that practically 
the same conditions as first mentioned 
above exist, except that party has quite 
a large grove that on account of irregu-

larities of the soil it is impossible to use 
the first mentioned system to advantage, 
and that while he wishes to hold expense 
down as low as possible he is at the same 
time a believer in the sprinkling system of 
irrigation, also that the natural and fric¬ 
tion heads are so great that he cannot use 
a single stage Centrifugal pump. In this 
case we would recommend that he lay his 
main pipe throughout center of tract to 
be irrigated and have lateral pipes proper¬ 
ly proportioned, gradually increasing 
from ends up to main, laid on each side 
of main in every third or in every fifth 
middle, depending, of course, on the dis¬ 
tance apart trees are planted. Then along 
these lateral pipes between every third or 
fifth row have hydrant stands for connect¬ 
ing hose. He would use as many pieces 
of hose as were necessary to take up the 
capacity of his pump and of sufficient 
length to reach all intervening squares be¬ 
tween hydrants, the distribution to be 
through sprinkler stands placed on ends 
of these hose. If water supply is obtain¬ 
ed from lake or from a well where the 
supply comes close to the surface and is 
free from- grit, a high pressure Rotary 
pump can be used to advantage. If, how¬ 
ever, there should be considerable sedi¬ 
ment in the water it would be best to use 
a multiple stage Centrifugal pump that 
would not be affected by the grit, and to 
use strainers on the sprinklers. In fact, 
on account of their extreme simplicity 
and durability the different makes of 
Two-Stage pumps are rapidly taking the 
place of many of the more expensive 
types. Their efficiency may not be quite 
as great to start with, but their deteriora¬ 
tion is not so great. This method of ir¬ 


rigation is now used quite extensively, 
and there are many members of this asso¬ 
ciation using it. 

Finally, we will suppose that our seeker 
after irrigation information is located on 
the comparatively flat but very porous 
soils found in the lake regions of Polk 
and Orange counties and other portions 
of the State where flooding and most 
other systems would be out of the ques¬ 
tion. We will also suppose that he wishes 
the best system that money will buy, one 
that will wet his lands perfectly in a short 
time, and at the same time gently so that 
the soil will not be washed or packed, 
and which can be operated at a minimum 
expense. Under these conditions no mat¬ 
ter what crops he may wish to grow, he 
will select an engine of large power and 
a pump of large capacity. He will use 
very large main pipes to supply a system 
of laterals placed 25 to 35 ft. apart of 
such proportions as are necessary to sup¬ 
ply and give a uniform pressure to sprink¬ 
lers placed on stands 5 to 10 ft. high and 
2 5 to 35 apart along these laterals. At 
intersection of each of these laterals with 
main he will have a cut-off valve so that 
he can turn on as many of the lines of 
sprinklers as his pump will supply at a 
sufficient pressure so that the water from 
the sprinklers will over lap between. All 
the pipe system except sprinkler stands, 
will, of course, be buried deep enough 
to be out of the way of cultivation. If 
properly proportioned and installed this 
will be an ideal Florida irrigating plant. 

The only draw back to the extensive 
use of this last mentioned system has been 
the large initial expense of installation 
as the Rival type of sprinklers usually

used heretofore have been of such large 
capacity that it required a system of very 
large and expensive piping to properly 
supply them. I understand, however, 
that there are now sprinkler nozzles on 
the market that give a much less quantity 
and at the same time a very even and sat¬ 
isfactory distribution. If this is so the 
cost of piping can be considerably re¬ 
duced, and with its most perfect distribu¬ 
tion and minimum cost of operation and 
maintaining it, this system will eventually 
come into very general use. At the last 


meeting of this Society Mr. Gillette told 
about his ideas of a plant along these lines 
which he has since had installed, and I 
hope that we will hear from him regard¬ 
ing it. 

In the limited time at my disposal I 
have only touched a few of the many 
points to be considered, and I would like 
to say more regarding the different types 
of engines, pumps and sprinklers, the 
different conditions of water supply, etc., 
but time forbids and I will close. 


Deciduous Fruits of Florida 


F. P. Henderson. 


Mr . President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Deciduous fruits do not receive the at¬ 
tention in Florida that they should re¬ 
ceive. 

I do not know that I can add anything 
new on this subject, but I want to speak 
of a few of our most common fruits. 

Permit me to say first of all, that I be¬ 
lieve if we gave the same study, care, 
and fertilizer to our deciduous fruits that 
we do to citrus fruits, they would be just 
as profitable. 

I do not think this would be true of 
the orange belt alone, but taking the State 
as a whole. I realize the fact that where 
the deciduous fruits do best, citrus fruits 
cannot be grown profitably, and where 
citrus fruits do best, most deciduous 
fruits could not be grown profitably. 
There are a few sections in central Flor¬ 
ida where both do equally well. 

First, I shall speak of peaches. The 
peach is one of the four or five deciduous 
fruits that can be grown in Florida in a 
commercial way with a good margin of 
profit to the grower. 

The peach is without doubt, the most 
popular fruit in America today. 

There is a greater acreage planted in 
peaches than any other fruit. 

The peach is grown over a greater area 
and is adapted to a greater range of cli¬ 
mate than any other fruit. 


The peach brings quicker returns on 
the investment than any other fruit. 

And I believe, when we learn how to 
properly grow and market the peach it 
will pay larger dividends than any other 
fruit. I realize the fact that the peach 
business, in Florida, has almost been 
wiped out during the last eight or ten 
years by the San Jose Scale, but with the 
present improved and scientific way of 
destroying this scale with fungi we need 
hesitate no longer to plant peach trees. 

With my last two years’ experience I 
do not believe it a very difficult or costly 
task to almost entirely obviate loss from 
this pest by the latest method of distrib¬ 
uting this fungi by spraying the spores 
on the trees as soon as they become in¬ 
fested with the scale. 

But my business here is not to deal 
with insects and diseases, but with fruits. 
There are a few varieties of Florida 
peaches, such as Jewell, Waldo, Florida 
Gem, Imperial, Marguerite and a few 
others that are unsurpassed in flavor by 
any peach in the world, if properly 
grown. These varieties are becoming 
very well known in a few of the eastern 
markets and are preferred to any other 
peach. 

But aside from the market value of 
the peach, almost every land owner, not 
only in Florida, but in most of the states 



152 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


in the United States can have all the 
peaches they want the whole year round, 
by the right selection of varieties for each 
locality and by canning fruit while in 
season. But I must drop the peach here 
and mention some other fruits of com¬ 
mercial importance. Figs, kaki or Jap¬ 
anese persimmons, and plums are gain¬ 
ing in favor and importance as commer¬ 
cial fruits. The demand for canned and 
preserved figs is away beyond the supply 
and is rapidly growing. There are sev¬ 
eral varieties that succeed well in Florida, 
but perhaps the celestial or sugar fig is 
Lie best allround fig we have. 

There is no more delicious fruit grown 
in Florida than a well grown good ripe 
Japanese persimmon and as soon as the 
fruit loving public learn how and when 
Lo eat it, it will become a very profitable 
t.op to grow. 

By a proper selection of varieties we 
can have for the table or to ship, Japan¬ 
ese persimmons six months in the year. 

Figs and Japanese persimmons have a 
great advantage over most other fruits 
as they are almost entirely exempt from 
disease and insect enemies. Japanese 
persimmon trees have proved to be rath¬ 
er short lived in most places in the State, 
but in my opinion it is due almost entirely 
to want of proper care and fertilization. 
A Japanese persimmon needs as much 
fertilizer as an orange and as good care 
otherwise in order to bear the immense 
crops they bear every year and keep 
health. 

There are three or four varieties of 
plums which will pay well to grow for 
market and which should be found in 
every home garden. The Terrell, Howe, 
and Excelsior are about the best and 


most reliable varieties. They are a cross 
between the Kelsey and the native varie¬ 
ties. 

There are many other deciduous fruits 
that can be grown in Florida with more 
or less success, such as pears, quinces, ap¬ 
ples, grape, etc., but I will only name a 
few varieties of each that succeed here. 

Do not waste time and money plant¬ 
ing any of the northern pears in Flor¬ 
ida, LeConte, Keifer, Smith, Cincincis 
and Garber do well almost anywhere in 
Florida. 

The Japanese Quince does well almost 
anywhere in the State. Some other va¬ 
rieties succeed in some localities. 

I believe a few varieties of apples 
could be grown here for home use by us¬ 
ing southern varieties such as Jennings, 
Florida, Red Astrachan and Horse Apple 
and by grafting on our native wild haw 
root. In 1902 I grafted an apple on a wild 
haw root dug out of the woods and in 
1906 it bore about two dozen apples. 
That fall San Jose Scale killed it. Last 
spring I grafted a Red Astrachan apple 
into a haw root. At this time it has three 
apples on it. 

I shall experiment further in this line. 

As fine grapes can be grown here as 
anywhere in the United States. Of 
course all the Bullace or Scuppernong va¬ 
rieties do well almost any where in Flor¬ 
ida. Of bunch grapes the White Niag¬ 
ara, Moore’s Early, Delaware, Agawam 
and a few others do well here. 

The reason of our failure to have plen¬ 
ty of all these fruits is not the soil or cli¬ 
mate of Florida, but a failure to use va¬ 
rieties adapted to our soil and climate 
together with ignorance of how to 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


153 


plant and care for trees after planted. I 
will close this paper by mentioning a few 
essentials of success. 

First never buy trees grown outside of 
Florida. We have several nurserymen 
who make it their business to find out and 
grow varieties especially adapted to Flor¬ 
ida. They are as intelligent and as hon¬ 
est as any nurserymen in the world and 
will give you free of charge any infor¬ 
mation you may desire. If you are not 
well posted yourself or know a local 
agent who is, the best way to get* trees 
that will succeed, in your special locality, 
is to write to some of our nurserymen 
in the State and tell them to send you 
the varieties you need of any fruit you 
may want. Second: Always cut back 
lateral roots to one to three inches long 
according to size of tree, and cut back 
the top to one to three feet according to 
the size of the tree before planting. Third, 
keep clean either by cultivation or mulch¬ 
ing. Fourth, fertilize heavily using com¬ 
mercial fertilizer always except on pe¬ 
can trees, use about two pounds the first 
year—i pound in February and one 
pound in June for each tree. Five pounds 
the second year and from five to fifteen 
pounds every year thereafter. I regret 


that the subject of this paper covers so 
much ground that it cannot be specific 
enough to be of as much value to the 
grower as it should be. 

I regret also that so little attention has 
been given deciduous fruits by the State 
Horticultural Society, not only this year, 
but for the past several years. The So¬ 
ciety has become largely a citrus grow¬ 
er’s association rather than a Horticul¬ 
tural Society. I do not blame the citrus 
growers for this, only so far as the fram¬ 
ers of the program for the annual meet¬ 
ings may be dominated by citrus grow¬ 
ers, and thus give preference to the cit¬ 
rus industry and thus neglect to develop 
the vegetable and deciduous fruit inter¬ 
ests which, important as the citrus indus¬ 
try is, are together more important to the 
proper and well balanced progress of the 
horticultural interests of the State. I 
suggest, therefore, that these interests be 
given at least the place their importance 
deserves on our next program and that 
one man be added to the committee on 
deciduous fruits and one to the commit¬ 
tee on vegetables whose business it shall 
be to give the society the best possible 
statistics on these branches of horticul¬ 
ture at our next annual meeting. 



Florida Citrus Exchange 


R. P. Burton 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

After the grower has devoted several 
years of hard work and close study of de¬ 
tails in bringing his grove to a productive 
age, the most vital question in his mind 
is,—how to put his product on the mar¬ 
ket for the most money. After years and 
years of varied experiences with gradual¬ 
ly diminishing profits in Florida, men of 
activity bestirred themselves, not only in 
their own interest, but the general inter¬ 
est, to devise means by which this ques¬ 
tion could be solved. 

About two years ago the venerable Dr. 
Inman visited California, seeking light 
upon this subject. It was my pleasure to 
meet him upon that occasion and give him 
some suggestions relative to the market¬ 
ing of the California output through co¬ 
operation. Returning to Florida, Dr. In¬ 
man interested a large number who visited 
California about a year ago, when it was 
again my pleasure to conduct them to va¬ 
rious packing houses and show them the 
details not only of the workings of these, 
but of the associations, the sub-exchanges 
and the central exchange. Returning to 
Florida, the gentlemen composing this 
committee of investigation called a con¬ 
vention of growers together, when it was 
decided to organize the Florida Citrus 
Exchange. 


The theory of organization is, that the 
grower manages his own affairs, by first 
coming together in various communities 
organizing associations, these associations 
electing representatives who organize 
sub-exchanges, who in turn elect their 
representatives who constitute the Board 
of Directors of the central organization. 
Having no associations in Florida, it was 
necessary to begin at the top, organizing 
the central exchange, which, through the 
energy and financial assistance of the pa¬ 
triotic growers who performed this work, 
the growers were brought together in 
their associations and sub-exchanges. 

The central exchange is divided into its 
various departments: The sales depart¬ 
ment with a sales manager, through 
which the entire country is divided into 
districts and a salesman or district man¬ 
ager placed in charge of each one. These 
district managers, where there is a suffi¬ 
cient volume of business to justify, are 
employed on a salary basis; where there 
is not sufficient business to justify this, 
brokers are used; these district managers 
and brokers have been selected with the 
greatest care, the sales manager going in¬ 
to each district, canvassing the situation, 
seeking out suitable men to represent the 
exchange and arranging terms with them, 
subject to the approval of the Board of 





FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


155 


Directors of the Florida Citrus Exchange. 
By reason of his wide acquaintance 
throughout the country, the sales man¬ 
ager was successful in securing the ser¬ 
vices of the best talent in nearly all cases. 
Where he was unable to secure the best 
talent, it has been necessary from time to 
time to make changes. The sales are 
made through auction where distributing 
centers are sufficiently large to justify 
this, the exchange’s own representative 
conducting all sales through an auction 
company. The auction points at present 
are Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Bal¬ 
timore, Buffalo, Pittsburg, Cleveland, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and New 
Orleans; all other markets are private 
sale markets in which sales are made f. 
o. b. shipping point, or on a delivered ba¬ 
sis. Experience has demonstrated that 
the most effective distribution is through 
delivered sales. The fruit must be ta¬ 
ken to the wholesale dealers and the busi¬ 
ness made attractive to them by eliminat¬ 
ing as far as possible, all speculative fea¬ 
tures. The exchange adopted this course 
by which it has been enabled to go into 
new territory where dealers had ceased to 
use Florida oranges, but during the past 
season, have again taken up the handling 
of our fruit. In some instances our district 
managers have taken cars into their ter¬ 
ritory, divided them up between several 
dealers, thereby inducing them to push 
Florida oranges when they would not buy 
a car load. 

California marketed during the season 
of 1898-99 about 14,000,000 boxes of 
citrus fruits. There was no part of this 
country which they did not penetrate, 
going into all Canadian points, Europe, 


Honolulu and Australia. Sixty per cent of 
that output was marketed through the 
California Fruity Growers Exchange, 
which has served as a model for the Flor¬ 
ida Citrus Exchange in its formation and 
methods of marketing. This California 
organization is now putting its oranges 
and lemons into Florida, but not a box of 
Florida fruit goes into California, owing 
to their stringent laws against the impor¬ 
tation of insects, and fruits that carry 
them. 

In conducting the business of the Flor¬ 
ida Citrus Exchange, it is necessarily 
done by telegraph. In the course of the 
day’s work the incoming telegrams are 
put into a bulletin and sent to every as¬ 
sociation manager daily. All telegrams 
sent from the central office are put into a 
bulletin and both the incoming and out¬ 
going telegrams are sent to the sub-ex¬ 
change manager. All shipments are giv¬ 
en a serial number and all telegrams re¬ 
lating to these shipments are by the se¬ 
rial number, and when they go into the 
bulletin, the abbreviation of the sub-ex¬ 
change making the shipment is placed be¬ 
fore the number. As these telegrams are 
received or sent from the central office, 
they are entered upon a card manifest 
covering the shipment. Each sub-ex¬ 
change manager is supposed to go through 
the bulletins locating any of his ship¬ 
ments that are mentioned in these tele¬ 
grams and the telegrams entered upon 
his cards. Each association manager is 
supposed to go through the incoming tel¬ 
egrams, a copy of which he receives in 
the bulletin, and enter upon his cards any 
telegrams referring to shipments made 
by his Association. In this way, any as- 


156 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


sociation or sub-exchange manager, or 
the central office can take any one of these 
cards covering any given shipment, and 
give to the owner of the fruit covered 
by same, all information relative to that 
shipment, at a moment’s notice. If the 
association and sub-exchange managers 
keep up with the bulletins from day to 
day they see the market conditions re¬ 
flected therein and are in position to form 
their own conclusions as to the advisabil¬ 
ity of forcing shipments or otherwise. 
Every grower affiliated with an associa¬ 
tion or a sub-exchange is at liberty to go 
into the office, peruse these telegrams 
from day to day and keep himself posted. 
This system will, in the end when the 
growers have learned its merit, educate 
the growers themselves up to a point of 
keeping closely in touch with the market 
conditions everywhere and give them a 
clearer insight into their own business 
than they have ever had. 

The cashier’s department receives and 
disburses all funds of the central ex¬ 
change under order of the Board of Di¬ 
rectors. After a car of fruit has been 
sold through the sales department, it 
passes to the cashier’s department and no 
further account is taken of the transac¬ 
tion by the sales department, unless some 
inquiry is made by interested persons. All 
financial matters of either the central ex¬ 
change, or the various districts through¬ 
out the country, pass through the cash¬ 
ier’s department and are submitted by the 
cashier at the regular weekly meeting of 
the Board of Directors for their consid¬ 
eration and action. This department also 
has charge of the supplies for the central 
office, and through co-operation with the 


general northern agent, supplies for the 
district managers. It will, therefore, be 
seen that a very efficient accountant is 
necessary as the cashier. 

The traffic and claim department is the 
third, and not the least important one of 
the central organization. All matters of 
transportation rates, etc., are referred to 
the manager of this department. When 
account sales are received they are placed 
in a jacket with the card manifest cover¬ 
ing the shipment, the inspection report 
made by the inspector in the district where 
the car is disposed of, the original bill of 
lading, and all correspondence relative to 
that particular car. The claim manager 
goes through each of these jackets, scru¬ 
tinizing them closely for overcharges, 
shortages, evidences of neglect on the 
part of the transportation company in 
handling the shipment, and if any legiti¬ 
mate basis for a claim appears, he imme¬ 
diately prepares a claim) and files it with 
the initial transportation company. These 
claims are followed up from time to time 
if prompt settlement is not made. As an 
evidence of the efficiency of this depart¬ 
ment, since the opening of the season, the 
claim manager has filed 2394 claims, ag¬ 
gregating $69,647.59 and has collected 
1214 claims, aggregating $11,477.86, and 
has withdrawn as uncollectable, 10 claims, 
aggregating $187.81. I think it will be 
conceded that this is a wonderful show¬ 
ing for so short a period’s work. The 
manager of the transportation and claim 
department of the Florida Citrus Ex¬ 
change is one of the most experienced 
men in the country, having been connect¬ 
ed with the claim department as one of 
its adjustors of one of the largest trans- 


FLORIDA .STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


157 


portation companies in this country, for 
six years. His experience as a railroad 
man covers a great many years prior to 
his connection with that claim department. 
He is well up on transportation matters, 
as well as handling claims with transpor¬ 
tation companies. His policy has been 
to file claims only which had merit, there¬ 
by commanding the confidence of the 
transportation companies in his honesty 
of purpose, which has already been es¬ 
tablished. Present indications are that 
this department alone will collect enough 
from claims against transportation com¬ 
panies to pay more than one third of the 
entire running expenses of the Florida 
Citrus Exchange covering all of its de¬ 
partments. It is reasonably safe to say 
that without this department a very small 
percentage of these claims would have 
been collected and the money paid to the 
growers to whom it belongs. 

The exchange has a general or business 
manager, whose duties are multitudinous. 
All matters pertaining to the business be¬ 
tween the sub-exchanges and the central 
exchange come under his supervision. 
Also, the relations of the associations to 
the sub-exchange are often brought to his 
department for advice and adjustment. 
Matters of general interest to the organ¬ 
ization are taken up by him with the va¬ 
rious heads of the departments for con¬ 
sideration and final disposition. 

Aside from the heads of the depart¬ 
ments in the central office we have a gen¬ 
eral northern agent whose duties are to 
supervise all districts, to go in time of 
trouble to any district and look into mat¬ 
ters that may arise, ascertain whether or 
not the district managers are performing 


their duties properly, seeking out the 
weak points in the organization on the 
other end of the line, finding new men to 
fill places that are not properly filled, scru¬ 
tinizing all correspondence that may be 
sent to him from the central office and 
from the district managers, and finding 
the weak spots and strengthening them. 
It has happened during the past season 
that we have had to send the general 
northern agent from city to city where 
we had reason to believe correct reports 
were not being made of shipments to 
those districts. In every case where this 
has occurred, he has found that the re¬ 
ports that were made to this office were 
in accordance with the facts. 

The entire business of the Florida Cit¬ 
rus Exchange is conducted under the su¬ 
pervision of its Board of Directors which 
meets weekly in its office at Tampa, for 
the purpose of considering all matters that 
may be presented by the different heads 
of the departments and the general man¬ 
ager. 

It will be noted that having provided 
ourselves with a selling force in the field 
and a competent northern manager to 
keep tab on the salesmen, we have 
equipped ourselves with machinery for 
the proper distribution and sale of 
our fruits, which insures success. We 
have reason to believe from such reports 
as we have from points throughout the 
country, that our sales department is of 
the very best. It has been stated by those 
who are in position to know, that the or¬ 
ganization in this direction is five to six 
years ahead of the organization among 
the growers themselves. The weakest 
point in the organization, apparently, is 


158 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


in the local associations. It will require 
several seasons for the growers to learn 
the details of the management of their 
own affairs and learn that it is their bus¬ 
iness and that they must pay close atten¬ 
tion to details in preparing their fruit for 
market, which is done through the asso¬ 
ciation packing houses. 

Florida has been increasing her output 
from year to year. Beginning with less 
than a quarter of a million boxes of citrus 
fruits in 1895 with a market for several 
times this quantity, there was no difficulty 
in disposing of the output at home at sat¬ 
isfactory prices to dealers who came here 
for them. While that was in process, 
California was increasing her output and 
systematically exploiting every market 
that could be reached with her fruit. She 
did not wait for the dealers to go into 
her packing houses for her fruit, but took 
it to the side tracks and made it to their 
interest to handle California oranges to 
the exclusion of all others. By this 
means, California was successful in so 
distributing her crop as to give her grow¬ 
ers satisfactory prices, with increasing 
crops. Florida, on the other hand, con¬ 
tented herself with depending upon deal¬ 
ers who would come here to buy the 
fruit, or speculators on the ground who 
would buy and sell to other dealers. Of 
the latter, there were various characters. 
As a general proposition, the home specu¬ 
lator began shipping oranges early, before 
they were ready for market; in many in¬ 
stances assuring the dealers to whom they 
were selling that the fruit was mature and 
ready for market. This method of han¬ 
dling the business had the effect of re¬ 
stricting the consumption of Florida or¬ 


anges, as one purchase was sufficient to 
satisfy consumers that Florida oranges 
were not palatable. They merely served 
to fill in the time between the last ship¬ 
ment of California Valencia lates and the 
early shipment of California navels, and 
as soon as they could get the latter, they 
had no further use for Floridas. This 
has gradually driven the Florida oranges 
to a few large centers, chiefly along the 
Atlantic Seaboard. 

The effort of the exchange .has been 
to discourage the shipment of immature 
oranges and grapefruit in order that con¬ 
sumers may be brought to appreciate the 
superior quality and flavor of mature 
Florida oranges, which will insure largely 
increased consumption, without which the 
growing of this luscious fruit in Florida 
will surely be disastrous to those produc¬ 
ing it. In order to attain this end, the 
growers themselves must be brought to 
realize the actual conditions as they ex¬ 
ist. This can never be accomplished ex¬ 
cept through concerted action on their 
part, as exemplified by the workings of 
the Florida Citrus Exchange. 

Discussion after Mr. Burton’s paper: 

Mr. Hart: The interest of the men 
outside of the exchange should be men¬ 
tioned tonight‘in connection with the ex¬ 
change. I often wonder what the condi¬ 
tions would have been if it had not been 
for the exchange this year. We hear of 
the high prices outside of the exchange 
and the low prices gotten by the exchange. 
It seems to me that if we had not had 
the exchange the conditions would have 
been very different. The difference in the 
commission men alone has paid for the 
exchange several times. The way they

commenced the season was to give low 
prices, and they gave us to understand 
conditions would not allow high prices. 
The commission men have been doing 
their very best to make a good record 
this year, and they have made a record 
they would not have made if it had not 
been for the exchange. Whatever the 
exchange has done in the way of prices, 
even if -it should turn out that they have 
not done as well as the people outside, 
certainly the exchange has done a good 
thing for the shippers of the exchange 
through stimulating the efforts of the 
commission men. 

Mr. Temple: You heard in the course 
of Mr. Burton's remarks a statement of 
a fact that has come before this body pre¬ 
viously at this meeting; that is, the laws 
of California that prevent practically the 
possibility of shipping into that state a 
disease or insect that might gain a hold. 
They carry it to such an extent that you 
cannot ship a kumquat into California 
without going through all kinds of pro¬ 
cedure. 

I was there for three years and wanted 
to have a grapefruit that was fit to eat, 
and had a box shipped to me from Flor¬ 
ida. The first box didn’t show up, and 
kept on not showing up, and I finally got 
a letter from some inspector saying that 
if I would come down and pay the fumi¬ 
gation fees on that box of fruit, which 
amounted to $3.00, he would give me 
what was left of it. He said it was af¬ 
fected with a good many different kinds 
of scale—more than we ever heard of in 
Florida. I told him to go and eat that 
grapefruit himself. 


Now, I wish you would join in with 
the legislative committee and formulate 
a resolution in some way, and call on the 
State Legislature to pass laws similar to 
those now in California. Mr. Burton 
says California is sending oranges and 
lemons into this State. Their lemons are 
good, but they have some weird diseases 
out there that we don’t want to get. We 
have troubles enough of our own without 
running the risk of importing any. 

They are so exacting with us that it is 
time we ourselves should grow suspicious. 
You know what the old farmer’s advice 
is. “When you swap horses, examine the 
other fellow’s horse where he examines 
yours, and you will find the blemish.” 

Prof. Hume: I am very certain that 
this society is willing to join right in with 
them on this line. I am certain the so¬ 
ciety is willing to give it carte blanche 
along that very line. 

Mr. Burton: Let me tell you some of 
the experiences along the Pacific Coast in 
that connection. As Mr. Temple states, 
you can hardly carry a man there from 
Florida unless he goes through a course 
of fumigation. 

When the Florida delegation of grow¬ 
ers was in California last year, one of the 
Boards of Trade gave them some kind of 
a “blowout” and one of the Florida mem¬ 
bers presented them with a box of Florida 
Valencias for the occasion. They were 
brought into the board room and passed 
around. One of the most critical of the 
Board members came to me and said 
“How many more of those oranges are 
there?” I told him I didn’t know. He 
said “If they don’t eat them all, burn up 



160 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


what is left; don’t let them get out of 
this room.” 

Washington produces large quantities 
of deciduous fruits, and they have laws 
as stringent as California. We have more 
than once had oranges inspected and fu¬ 
migated at heavy loss. The inspectors 
are very critical and it is not uncommon 
to hear of whole shipments being fumi¬ 
gated, and when you fumigate a car of 
oranges or lemons, somebody is going to 
lose money. 

We shipped a car of lemons to Spo¬ 
kane which was sold at $ 4-75 f* °- b. The 
inspector examined it and pronounced it 
infected with San Jose scale. I wired 
him the car was not infected. He wired 
back that they would fumigate the ship¬ 
ment, when they would allow it to enter. 


I told him we would divert the car from 
the State. He wired back that the ship¬ 
ment was infected and it was his duty to 
fumigate it right then and there. I took 
the matter up with the State horticul¬ 
turist, who went to Spokane and inspect¬ 
ed it himself and said he was certain it 
was red scale instead of San Jose Scale, 
and it would have to be fumigated. Now, 
the red scale would not do an apple or 
a peach tree any harm, even if the ship¬ 
ment had been infected with that scale. 
That just shows you, however, of how 
much importance they consider this point, 
which you in Florida do not consider at 
all. There is not a law in Florida when 
it comes to protecting your citrus trees 
against disease.

REPORT OF AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL MEETING 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Although the programme calls for “Re¬ 
port of American Pomological Meeting,” 
it is not my purpose to go into details o>f 
the very interesting and well attended 
meeting, held at St. Catherines, Ontario, 
Canada, September 14-16, 1909, but 

rather to call your attention to the out¬ 
come of that meeting, as far as decision 
on the place for the next one was con¬ 
cerned. 

There were present at the meeting 
fourteen members from Florida, includ¬ 
ing the president, secretary, treasurer 
and one member of the executive com¬ 
mittee of the Florida State Horticultural 
Society; and we deemed that we had 
sufficient official representation to war¬ 
rant us in inviting the American Pomo¬ 
logical Society to hold its next conven¬ 
tion in this state. Such an invitation was 
duly presented by President Hume, and 
seconded by all of the officers of our 
society present, and the American Po¬ 
mological Society took the matter under 
advisement. As is customary with that 
society, the final decision as to place of 
meeting was left to its executive com¬ 
mittee. 

In March of this year, Professor John 
Craig, Secretary of the American Po¬ 


mological Society, met with the Exec¬ 
utive Committee of the Florida State 
Horticultural Society in Jacksonville, 
and informed us that our invitation had 
been accepted, and it was decided that the 
American Pomological Society would 
hold its next session in Florida in the 
latter part of January, 1911, and that 
the place of meeting should be left to 
the Executive Committee of the Flor¬ 
ida State Horticultural Society. 

Except as being held late in January, 
the exact date at which the meeting 
should be held has not been fixed, and 
this, perhaps, had better be left to the 
Executive Committee of this society, de¬ 
pendent somewhat upon the dates that 
will suit our visitors best. I have, there¬ 
fore, to announce that the meeting of the 
American Pomological Society will be 
held in such place in Florida as this so¬ 
ciety may select, some time in January, 
1911. Not only will the American Po¬ 
mological Society meet with us, but the 
Executive Committee of the Florida 
State Horticultural Society deems it 
proper that this society should sanction 
the extending of special invitations to 
other southern horticultural societies, to 
meet with us at that lime, and, with this 
end in view, I wish to submit the follow¬ 
ing: 




162 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Resolved: That the Secretary of this 
Society be authorized to issue invitations 
to the State Horticultural Societies of 
Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, 
Georgia, North Carolina, South Caroli¬ 
na, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, 
and to the Horticultural Societies of 
Cuba and Porto Rico to meet with us at 
the time of the next meeting of the 
American Pomological Society. 

Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to 
relate to you a bit of history: Our Flor¬ 
ida State Horticultural Society was or¬ 
ganized at Ocala, April io, 1888, a lit¬ 
tle over 22 years ago . Our charter 
members numbered 18. The very first 
work done by this society, after its or¬ 
ganization and election of officers, was 
preparation to receive and entertain the 
American Pomological Society, which 
was to meet in this State in the follow¬ 
ing February, 1889. In addition to the 
American Pomological Society, the Geor¬ 
gia State Horticultural Society was in¬ 
vited to meet with us. The three soci¬ 
eties met at Ocala on Feb. 20, 1889, in 
the large building of the Semi-Tropical 
Exposition, where was on exhibit one of 
the finest displays of citrus and other 
fruits that has ever been made in the 
State. In welcoming the visiting socie¬ 
ties, our president, Dudley W. Adams, 
said, in part: 

“During a somewhat busy life it has 
been my good fortune to perform many 
very pleasant duties, but among them all 
none ever gave me more pleasure than 
now, in behalf of the infant State Hor¬ 
ticultural Society of Florida, to receive 
as our guests that full grown giant, the 
American Pomological Society. 


“To be thus honored by the presence 
of the foremost pomological society of 
the world would seem to fill to the brim 
our cup of satisfaction, but when, as to¬ 
day, we can also take by the hand that 
stalwart organization, the State Horti¬ 
cultural Society of our big sister, 
Georgia, then, truly, our cup runneth 
over. 

“With the reverence due from youth 
to age, with the respect due from the stu¬ 
dent to his teacher, with the affection 
due from the child to his parents, we bid 
you welcome to our State, our city, our 
homes, our hearts/’ 

Since that time President Adams, and 
most of the other seventeen charter mem¬ 
bers, have gone to their long reward, 
but, to a certain extent, history repeats 
itself, and we are now to have the 
pleasure of welcoming again to our State 
the foremost Pomological Society of the 
Western Hemisphere—'which means the 
foremost in the world. It is a great 
pleasure to me to announce their coming, 
and it now remains for this society to 
take such active measures as shall insure 
to our honored guests the hospitality that 
is due them Io receive—and us to give. 

This society, the city that may be se¬ 
lected, and the State of Florida, should 
unite in tendering them a welcome that 
will be a royal one. Remember that the 
American Pomological Society represents 
in its membership, not only each of the 
United States of America, but Canada, 
Cuba, Manitoba, Australia, Japan, New 
Mexico, Hawaii and other foreign coun¬ 
ties. At the time of their previous meet¬ 
ing in Florida, the railroads of the State 
had their representatives in Ocala, to ar-

range in person for a ten day’s excur¬ 
sion, wherever our visitors wished to go, 
throughout the length and breadth of 
Florida, and they were taken to Homos- 
sassa, Citra, Tampa, Orlando, Sanford, 
Indian River, Mount Dora and many 
other sections. Their estimate of our 
magnificent fruit exhibit is shown by the 
fact that the committee on awards gave 
silver medals (Wilder) to Lake County 
Shippers’ Union, Marion, Sumter and 
Lee Counties, Rev. Lyman Phelps, E. H. 
Hart and Dudley W. Adams. Bronze 
medals were awarded to Citrus, Polk and 
Volusia Counties and to O. P. Rooks and 
E. S. Hubbard. I mention these facts 
to impress upon you the recognized im¬ 
portant position this society occupies, and 
as an incentive for us to do our best to 


equal or surpass the honors extended the 
American Pomological Society in this 
State twenty one years ago, as well as 
those extended them in the various other 
States, in which they have met during the 
past half century. As nothing worth 
while is ever acomplished without or¬ 
ganized effort, I sincerely hope that this 
society will take it in hand, in a vigorous 
'manner, with the result that at the close 
of the American Pomological Society’s 
meeting with us next January in Florida, 
the general verdict of that society will 
be, “the best ever.” 

(Since the above report was read the 
time and place for the American Pomo¬ 
logical Society meeting has been named 
as Jan. 31st and Feb. 1st and 2nd at 
Tampa. —Secretary.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

At the Daytona meeting your honor¬ 
able body elected Professor Hume, Mr. 
Taber, Air. Hart and your Secretary del¬ 
egates to the American Pomological So¬ 
ciety, which convened at St. Catharines 
last September. All four were present at 
the meeting. The results of the meeting 
you have in Mr. Taber’s report. 

The same committee was also requested 
to visit Washington and take up with the 
Department the desirability of securing 
some trained person to go abroad and try 
to find some natural enemy to the White- 
fly. Mr. Hart was the only one of the 
committee who could go to Washington, 
and his report will enlighten you as to 
what he learned. 

The matter was also taken up with our 
Senator Fletcher, and a bill was intro¬ 
duced appropriating $10,000 for white- 
fly investigation abroad, but was subse¬ 
quently reduced because Prof. Howard 
reported to the committee that $5,000 
would be sufficient, as he could send Prof. 
Woglum, who would only want his ex¬ 
penses. The orange growers have been dis¬ 
appointed at this, for if the first sum had 
been left, one or two whitefly experts like 
Dr. E. W. Berger or Dr. Back could 
have made an investigation that would 
have more promise, on account of their 
long-continued touch with the whitefly 
problems here. 


Your secretary and Mr. Gillett, of the 
Citrus Exchange, undertook to raise 
some funds for the expense of the white¬ 
fly investigation, but were not very suc¬ 
cessful. The following amounts were 
received: 


W. S. Hart..$25.00 

John T. Pirie. 25.00 

B. F. Chilton. 25.00 

M. S. Sams. 10.00 

G. M. Wakelin. 10.00 

John H. Sams. 10.00 

H. J. Wilmshurst. 5.00 

F. H. Boye. 2.50 

A. L. Ingerson. 1.00 

Robert Taylor. 1.00 


$114.50 

As this amount was too small to do 
any thing with, I have held the checks, 
and await the society’s instructions as to 
what to do with them. 

All of you know that our expenses 
have been running a little behind each 
year, until the deficit piled up to over 
$600.00. In my first circular letter to 
the members, I stated the case, and the re¬ 
sponse has been very liberal. Up to this 
tim)e I have received on this Deficiency 
Fund the following: 


G. L. Taber. .$50.00 

E. O. Painter. 25.00 

P. H. Rolfs. 10.00 

E. S. Hubbard. 10.00

Necrology 


DR. JOHN MILTON HAWKS 


Died at his winter home in Hawks 
Park, Florida, on April 2nd, 1910, at the 
ripe age of 83 years and was laid to rest 
in the cemetary there which he himself 
laid out many years ago in the settlement 
bearing his name and of which he was 
the founder. Dr. Hawks was born on a 
farm in Bradford, New Hampshire, No¬ 
vember 2nd, 1826, and was one of a fam¬ 
ily of five children of whom two sisters 
survive him. At the age of 16 he com¬ 
menced teaching school and remained at 
this, in various parts of the country, for 
several years while continuing his own 
studies. 

Later he returned to New Hampshire 
and studied medicine and graduated from 
a medical college in Vermont. 

He then settled in Manchester, N. H,. 
where he built up a good practice in con¬ 
nection with a lucrative drug business. 

Here in 1854 he met and married Miss 
Esther Willard and with her took a long 
honeymoon trip to St. Louis, down the 
Mississippi to New Orleans, across coun¬ 
try to Florida and then back home. 

No children were born to them. 

At the outbreak of the Civil War he 
and his wife volunteered their assistance 
to the Freedman’s Aid Society of New 
York and were sent to Hilton Head and 
Edisto Island, South Carolina. Here he 
was instrumental in forming the first col¬ 


ored regiment to enlist under the stars 
and stripes and became its surgeon. 

The deeds of this regiment have been 
memorialized by its colonel, Thomas 
Wentworth Higginson, in a work enti¬ 
tled “Army Life in a Black Regiment.” 

Dr. Hawks and wife followed the for¬ 
tunes of war until its close, the command 
being under General Saxton. 

For a time the Doctor was collector of 
customs at Pensacola, Fla. He at this 
time traveled extensively throughout the 
State and about 1872 published the Flor¬ 
ida Gazeteer devoted to the interests of 
the State. 

About this time he purchased a large 
track of land just south of New Smyrna 
and has since added others to his holdings 
there. 

Mrs. Hawks also studied medicine and 
built up a large and successful practice in 
Lynn, Mass. For the past forty years^ 
Dr. J. M. Hawks has spent most of his 
winters in Florida and his summers with 
his wife, sisters and friends in New Eng¬ 
land. He was very fond of his family 
and friends and was a most agreeable and 
entertaining companion. 

His manners were quaintly sweet and 
courtly and he commanded the entire re¬ 
spect of all who knew him.

Pecan Growers’ Association 




The pecan inlustry has grown to such an extent that those inter¬ 
ested have formed a Pecan Growers Association of Florida and 
Georgia. As many of the members of the Florida Horticultural 
Society are interested in pecan culture it was deemed wise to ask the 
pecan growers to meet with the Horticulturists. The invitation 
presented by Prof. Hume was accepted and a place on the pro¬ 
gramme given for pecan papers and discussion. The following is 
the proceedings of the Pecan Growers Association:— Secretary. 


Observations on Pecan Culture 


H. K. Miller 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

Only a few decades ago there existed 
vast area of native pecan groves in the 
bottom lands of the south-west, and even 
today this area is considerable, though 
the greater part of it has been cleared in 
order that the lands might be used for 
producing cotton. When these magnifi¬ 
cent trees were thus ruthlessly destroyed, 
no adequate market existed for their pro¬ 
ducts ; but times have changed, and to¬ 
day, the nuts from the trees which re¬ 
main, yield an income far in excess of 
that which can be derived from the cotton 
grown on a like acreage. 

For a quarter of a century a few indi¬ 
viduals, recognizing the growing impor¬ 
tance of nuts for food and the constant 
diminution of the sources of supply of 
pecans, have attempted to establish pecan 
growing under cultural conditions, upon 
a commercial basis, in various sections of 
the south. It is a matter of common 
knowledge that in a large measure their 
efforts proved futile so long as seedling 
trees were used. It is true that a few 
seedling groves, under most favorable 
conditions, have proved remunerative, 
but in most cases, after years of waiting, 
adequate returns were not realized. In 
the main, this is due to the marked indi¬ 
viduality of seedlings; many prove infe¬ 
rior, some grow very slowly, others re¬ 
quire -years to reach the fruiting age. 


some prove barren; and still others prove 
an easy prey to natural enemies. The in¬ 
troduction of grafted sorts has, to a great 
degree, eliminated these difficulties, and 
in recent years renewed interest has been 
manifested and much capital and energy 
are now being applied to the establish¬ 
ment of pecan orcharding on a sound and 
profitable basis. 

The comparatively short period which 
has been devoted to growing pecans un¬ 
der cultural methods, coupled with the rel¬ 
atively long time required for trees to 
come into full bearing, necessarily ren¬ 
ders our knowledge of this branch of hor¬ 
ticulture incomplete; in fact, meagre. The 
observation of a few trees and orchards, 
the application of theory, and in a large 
measure hope constitute the foundation 
for the faith that has led to the establish¬ 
ment of most of the pecan orchards in 
the south; rather than any actual com¬ 
mercial plantings which have demonstrat¬ 
ed a successful outcome. This has vir¬ 
tually been true of all new horticultural 
projects and it is only through experience 
that we master such enterprises. 

Within very recent years much light 
has been thrown upon the subject; new 
obstacles have arisen to be obviated, new 
evidence is at hand for renewing our 
hopes; real progress has been made in a 
gratifying degree; today we are enabled 
to set an orchard with far more assurance 
of success than was the case five years

ago. Who has not heard some old wise¬ 
acre remark as he pityingly watched an 
enthusiast planting pecan trees; “He’ll 
never live long enough to see them fruit!’’ 
Thousands of trees set less than seven 
years ago have put a quietus on this old 
knocker, and there is scarcely a communi¬ 
ty where pecan planting has been in prog¬ 
ress seven years in which he has not been 
discredited. There was reason in his re¬ 
marks so long as seedlings were planted, 
as few of these fruit under fifteen years 
of age, besides there are many such trees 
twice as old which have yet to show their 
first crop of nuts. To have asserted that 
an eight year old tree produced two bush¬ 
els of pecans in one season, would have 
relegated the claimant to a life member¬ 
ship in the Annanias Club, at so recent 
a date, as four years ago. The process of 
grafting alone induces early fruitage, but 
when scions are selected from choice trees 
having a tendency to prolificness and ear¬ 
ly fruitage, these characteristics are em¬ 
phasized in the resulting trees, thus mak¬ 
ing it certain that such trees will, un¬ 
der favorable conditions, fruit early in 
life, and abundantly. 

It is conceded that there are yet many 
problems to be solved. This is also true 
of the peach-grower, the apple-grower, 
the citrus-grower, and others; else there 
would be little occasion for the annual 
meetings of various horticultural organ¬ 
izations. For a time it was supposed the 
pecan growers were especially favored in 
having to deal with a tree free from ene¬ 
mies and diseases of all kinds; it being 
only necessary to set the trees and return 
for the harvest. A more intimate ac¬ 
quaintance with such troubles as borers, 


web-worms, case-bearers, bud-worms, 
winter-killing, scab, rosette have taken 
away the complacent feeling of immunity, 
and undoubtedly troubles that we know 
not of will require our respect in the fu¬ 
ture. Fortunately our troubles of this 
nature are not nearly so formidable as 
those which confront apple, peach or or¬ 
ange growers, and so long as these insist 
on supplying the world with peaches, ap¬ 
ples and oranges in spite of difficulties, let 
the pecan growers take courage. Pecan 
culture has reached its present status 
largely through the efforts of the National 
Nut Growers’ Association, our parent or¬ 
ganization. The efforts and progress of 
this association will doubtless be dwelt 
upon in a paper at this session. We are 
safe in assuming that the essentials of 
successful pecan culture are sufficiently 
clear to warrant the present activity in 
this new field of endeavor. Still there is 
enough diversity of opinion regarding 
many phases of pecan growing to demand 
our serious consideration along with the 
unsolved problems. 

I can but touch on a few lines of ac¬ 
tion with slight suggestions that should 
be taken up for our benefit. 

The one of greatest importance is to 
determine what varieties are adapted to 
a given soil, locality, climate. Real infor¬ 
mation in this particular is quite limited, 
and only in a general way is it known 
that certain kinds have been apparently 
successful in a given locality. We do 
know that varieties which fail at one place 
succeed at another. Some varieties even 
do better than in the place where they 
originated. Because of these facts er¬ 
roneous estimates have been made of va-

rieties, being either praised or condemned 
on insufficient evidence. Even that old 
reprobate—Rome or Columbian has done 
well in a few instances. It seems that this 
question must be thrashed out in the 
south with the pecan in much the same 
fashion as it was with the walnut in the 
west, and indeed as has been the case 
with most fruits everywhere. Such a 
process is slow and costly but will even¬ 
tually succeed. It is only within the last 
few years that varietal trees have fruited 
in any considerable localities but a com¬ 
pilation of results will in a few years add 
much to our store of information. It is 
just here that our association can be of 
great service in collecting information. 

The Nut Growers’ Association could 
engage in no more beneficial undertaking 
than securing the establishing of a com¬ 
prehensive plan of experimentation with 
leading varieties of pecans in many local¬ 
ities within the pecan belt. To insure uni¬ 
formity of treatment, this had best be un¬ 
der National control and I think we 
should use every effort to induce the De¬ 
partment of Agriculture to take the mat¬ 
ter under consideration. Much time could 
be gained by securing as far as possible 
groves already planted and by top-work¬ 
ing to varieties to be tested. From a 
theoretical view it has been thought va¬ 
rieties which remain dormant late in 
spring would do well in colder sections 
but we have instances of some of the very 
early starters doing well in rather north¬ 
ern sections, while slow starters have fre¬ 
quently been winter-killed in Fla. 

It is certain that few trees are old 
enough to serve as definite examples of 
success or failure, that is we have as yet 
few criterions. 


The question of fertilizing still offers 
opportunity for investigation, though the 
general principles are pretty well worked 
out. I am convinced that it makes a dif¬ 
ference as to the sources from which the 
plant food elements are derived. The 
pecan in some respects behaves like 
the pineapple and it is my obser¬ 
vation that rosette may be induced 
by improper fertilization of the pecan 
just as spike is induced when we 
use the wrong materials on pineapples. 
Two other matters which give opportuni¬ 
ty for research are bud-variation and 
stock-influence. It is well known that 
grafted trees of the same variety under 
similar conditions will show appreciable 
differences. This may be due to bud-va¬ 
riation, which undoubtedly gives rise to 
some variation but on the whole I believe 
we underestimate the influence of the 
stock upon which we graft trees. 

Such marked differences as we note in 
seedlings could hardly help imparting 
characteristics to the scion and this may 
account for some of our vexations, like 
winter-killing, delayed fruitage, shyness, 
susceptibility to scab, etc., manifesting it¬ 
self in individual trees. Can we not by 
selection secure types of stock that will 
render the trees amenable to our require¬ 
ments? The selection of varieties almost 
serve our purposes, cannot the deficiencies 
be made up from a combined selection of 
stock and scion? To my mind here lies 
a fruitful field for scientific research. 

A question which thus far has given us 
little concern will soon demand our atten¬ 
tion, that is the marketing of our crops. 
It is our good fortune to have this subject 
presented at this session. It has been re¬ 
peatedly stated that there was no possi- 


176 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


bility of over-production and that the de 
mand could never be fully met. Perhaps 
this is true, but it appears to me that if 
the trees already planted and those in 
prospect of being planted in the next few 
years will yield half as well as is expected 
of them, the present market will have to 
be greatly enlarged and new markets 
created. With the entire world awaiting 
conquest there are vast possibilities for 
marketing; however, this is one of the 
problems awaiting our efforts. 

We can all remember the time when a 
few cars of pomelos would supply the en¬ 
tire market of the U. S., but a million 
boxes does not now appease our craving 
for this luscious fruit. When the general 
public is educated to the merits of the im¬ 
proved pecans, who can estimate what 
demands will be made upon the south for 
this incomparable nut? 

The control of insects and diseases both 
known and unknown will require our best 
efforts and ever keep us on the alert. Any 
tiller of the soil must engage in a battle 
royal. Nature seems pitted against him, 
yet nature supplies the weapons for its 
own undoing; the master mind must or¬ 
der the battle and in proportion as it is 
wisely exercised will success crown the 
effort. 

It has indeed required an abundance of 
nerve and faith to establish pecan or¬ 
chards. The long period of waiting, un¬ 
looked for difficulties and unexpected 
items of cost, have dampened the ardor 
of many who began with enthusiasm. 
Some have fallen by the wayside, giving 
up the fight, others have pressed onward 


and are now coming into a deserved and 
just reward. 

Ample evidence has been furnished the 
past two years to warrant the belief that 
orchards properly tended will come into 
satisfactory bearing at eight years from 
planting. New life has been put into the 
enterprise, and today this branch of horti¬ 
culture is attracting unusual attention. 

It is a noteworthy fact that many of 
the commercial orchard companies have 
taken hold of their properties with in¬ 
creased energy and are giving much bet¬ 
ter care to their trees than formerly. It 
appears that ample capital is available for 
extensive operations and we may confi¬ 
dently hope to see a vast source of 
wealth added to this southern section, al¬ 
ready so abundantly blessed with natural 
resources. The present need is efficient 
help, young men properly equipped and 
willing to push forward the work. 

It is safe to predict that pecan culture 
will prove similar to other forms of en¬ 
terprise. It will not give something for 
nothing but we will get out of it in pro¬ 
portion as we invest capital, energy and 
brains. 

Nature has been lavish in her gifts to 
man, but we of the south are face to face 
with an opportunity granted to few of 
earth’s peoples. I believe we are waking 
to the facts and that the day is not distant 
when pecan culture will be one of the 
chief industries of the south, and in lieu 
of the wild groves that are gone forever 
with their inferior nuts will arise, as by 
magic, innumerable orchards showering 
down their annual contribution to human¬ 
ities’ needs. 


H ow Shall We Market Pecans 


H, Harold Hume. 


Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

In reference to the subject which I am . 
to discuss for you, I may say that until 
within a few days I was not aware that 
I should be called on, in connection with 
this part of the programme. Owing to 
the number of other things demanding 
attention I have had but little time to 
make preparation. 

For a number of years, I have been 
looking into the subject of pecan growing. 
My investigations began some ten or 
twelve years ago, and in this time, I have 
seen the quantity price of the common 
wild pecan nuts, small in size and of va¬ 
rious shapes, increase from three or four 
cents per pound to fifteen or sixteen cents 
per pound. Although much attention has 
been given to orchard planting, there has 
been no material increase in the amount 
of the product just referred to as the la¬ 
ter plantings have been made with budded 
and grafted trees of improved varieties. 
The increase in price has been brought 
about either by manipulation or by in¬ 
creased demand or both. While manipula¬ 
tion has had something to do with it, yet 
there is no reason to doubt that our in¬ 
crease in population, and the use of pe¬ 
can kernels in new ways and in vastly 
larger amounts, have been largely respon¬ 
sible for this .increase in price. 


Texas supplies the bulk of the wild 
product and it is often a fact that the man 
who owns the trees and their crop is not 
the one who harvests the crop, sells the 
product and pockets the proceeds. Since 
the sellers are so often irresponsible and 
have no vital interest in the crop, it will 
frequently be noted that there is a wide 
difference between the first price and the 
price to the retailer. It has been noted 
for instance, that at times when the whole¬ 
sale price is about fourteen cents per 
pound, the collector is getting four cents. 
There is a difference of ten cents in the 
transaction between the passing of the 
product out of the hands of him who first 
had it and its receipt by the man who 
wholesales it to the final distributor. This 
is quite a difference. It is a comparatively 
easy crop to corner and as a general rule, 
it soon passes into the hands of a very 
few soon after it is gathered. 

A few years ago, it was predicted that 
the amount of the wild product would ac¬ 
tually decrease, but owing to the increas¬ 
ed prices and the interest now being taken 
in the culture of pecans, the wild trees are 
receiving more attention than formerly 
and it is a fact that in all pecan markets, 
there will always be a considerable quan¬ 
tity of the wild crop. Since the man who 
gathers this wild crop is not always the 
owner of the trees, the question naturally 



178 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


arises as to how the marketing of this 
crop can be handled. It is a phase of 
the problem that will require careful 
thought. It may be it will solve itself. 
As the crop increases in value, the pro¬ 
duct may be more carefully looked after 
by the owners. 

This wild nut is today, the most impor¬ 
tant item in our pecan trade. Most peo¬ 
ple to whom the pecan is known, have 
never seen any other than the small wild 
nut, and could not even tell what its nat¬ 
ural color is. They have never seen it in 
its natural color. It has been stained, 
polished and fixed up to improve (?) its 
looks before it gets into their hands. It 
is hard to make them believe that there 
are any larger and better nuts than those 
to which they have been accustomed. 

PICKING AND HANDLING CROP. 

*• 

Some people, who do not know, be¬ 
lieve it entails no cost or trouble to gath¬ 
er a pecan crop. True the gathering of 

■ 

a crop from young trees is not a particu¬ 
larly difficult piece of work, but the se¬ 
curing of a crop from trees, four or five 
feet in diameter and one hundred and 
fifty feet high is another matter. In the 
case of large old trees, one must wait for 
the crop to come down or invest in a set 
of Wright Aeroplanes. Planted on the 
soils of our State, the trees are not likely 
to reach such large size and for many 
years after they come into bearing, the 
crop may be hand picked. Hand-picked! 
Some one holds up his hands in amaze¬ 
ment. But the man who' wants to get 
all that there is in his crop will have to 
hand pick it. One of the faults of some 
varieties is that their crop does not ripen 


uniformly. But the time to begin gather¬ 
ing is when the greater number of burrs 
are open and the points of the nuts are 
peeping out. Then strip the trees—tak¬ 
ing open and closed burrs together. Some 
of the closed ones will open, those which 
do not are probably faulty. Based on an 
estimate made on trees, twenty-five to 
thirty years old, the picking and shuck¬ 
ing of the crop, ready for drying, is from 
one and a half to two cents per pound. 

packages. 

Pecans shipped in sacks have a myste¬ 
rious way of being lost or reduced in 
quantity. Just why this is, is hard to 
say, but if you try to ship nuts in a sack, 
you will find out. I have even known 
shipments that started out as a sack of 
pecans to arrive at destination a sack 
of cotton seed hulls. They had been 
transformed on the way. As interesting 
as the transmutation of metals! 

To insure safety to the product wooden 
or heavy corrugated packages should be 
used. For large quantities, the barrel is 
best. It is a little unwieldy, weighing ioo 
to 125 pounds or thereabouts. Half bar¬ 
rels are good for smaller quantities while 
for still smaller shipments wooden or pa¬ 
per boxes are best. Care and neatness in 
putting the product up in attractive shape 
are well repaid, just as in the handling of 
any other fruit. 

TIME TO MARKET. 

We have heard that after we have har¬ 
vested our crop, we can sit down and wait 
until conditions are just right before mar¬ 
keting it. In my humble opinion, while 


FLORIDA ,STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


it is not wise policy to rush the product 
into the market, it is best to market it 
without waiting an undue length of time. 
There is such a thing as waiting too long. 
The active demand for the crop, the nut 
market season, begins a little before 
Thanksgiving and covers the period up to 
January first. It will probably be found 
that during this period the best prices can 
be secured. Some believe that the crop 
can be carried through into the following 
summer and marketed then. In the south 
generally, and under ordinary conditions, 
it is unwise to do so. We must not lose 
sight of the fact that the pecan kernel 
contains a very considerable amount of 
fat, sometimes as much as 70 per cent, 
and this fat or oil is likely to become ran¬ 
cid in our warm summer weather. In 
cooler regions it does not deteriorate so 
rapidly, of course, and cold storage would 
keep the nuts in good condition for a 
much longer period. 

Rancidity is brought about by the ac¬ 
tion of the air. In this connection, I 
might call attention to an interesting ex¬ 
periment. February 2, 1905, the Beech¬ 
nut Packing Company, put up pecan nuts 
and kernels in vacuum jars. The vac¬ 
uum was, of course, not entirely absolute, 
the exhaustion being about 28 4-10. The 
last of these cans were opened in April, 
1910, a little over five years after they 
were put up and found to be in good eat¬ 
ing condition still. There was a little de¬ 
terioration, but not much. In this, we 
have demonstrated that pecans and ex¬ 
tracted kernels can be held for long pe¬ 
riods without becoming rancid.

MARKETING METHODS. 

At the present time, the bulk of the pe¬ 
can crop of high quality is handled in the 
private trade. It is largely a mail order 
business, built up without resort to much 
publicity. No doubt this trade will con¬ 
tinue to take large amounts from year to 
year. Crops of several thousand pounds 
are now marketed by single individuals 
in this way. This method is a good one. 

Lately, the larger sized nuts are finding 
their way into the fancy grocery trade, in 
considerable quantities. This trade is 
good if properly and carefully handled. 

But while these and similar methods 
answer for the present, the time is not far 
distant when other methods will have to 
be worked out. Those of us who have 
the best interests of the industry at heart 
need to think along these lines. The plans 
as outlined by Mr. Burton, now in opera¬ 
tion in the handling of citrus fruits in our 
State, can, I believe be applied to the han¬ 
dling of the pecan crop. It will have to 
be handled through an exchange or a mar¬ 
keting association. The task will be a 
large one as a territory almost or quite 
as large as the cotton area will have to 
be covered. It stretches from Virginia 10 
Texas. There is no need to enter into de¬ 
tails at this time, but I am convinced that 
some of us here tonight will see the time 
when such an association is actually in 
charge of the pecan crop of the South. 
Some of us may take part in its formation. 
It will mean much to the industry. 


DISCUSSION 

Mr.-: What will the cultured 

product bring in the wholesale market ?

FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Prof. Hume: I cannot answer that 
definitely. I remember .trying this out 
when the wild nuts were selling at 4c. a 
pound. The cultivated ones were quoted 
me at 16c. a pound. I have tried it out 
when the wild nuts were 8c. a pound and 
the cultivated product was 20c. a pound 
in carload lots. I cannot tell you what 
the prices have been for the last year or 
two, but I have no doubt they run about 
the same. There is a wonderful demand 
for pecan nuts. Sometime ago, I took 
the matter up with Huyler’s. While they 
were very diffident about , giving out fig¬ 


ures they stated the extract kernels enter¬ 
ed into a very large percentage of their 
products. They use them by the ton and 
they are unable to get anywhere near 
what they require. I can remember the 
time when the only pecan we ever saw 
came with the shell on, but a large pro¬ 
portion of the product is now sold with 
the shell off, and you can .buy pecan 
kernels by the pound, just as you buy 
any other grocery product. There is 
practically no limit to the market demand 
for the pecan*

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen'. 

Mr. Charles M. Barnwell, musing 
thoughtfully on the bank of the river 
Flint, gazing into the opaque density of 
its flowing tide, would pause, if interro¬ 
gated, to observe that the best combina¬ 
tion adapted to pecan production is brains, 
experience and a fat bank account. Some 
have brains. They admit it. A few have 
experience, but rarely boast about it. I 
have heard of several persons possessing 
fat bank accounts, but have found it dif¬ 
ficult to induce them to combine the same 
with my brains and experience. 

The three component parts above nam¬ 
ed, combined in one and the same indi¬ 
vidual or company, would go far toward 
spelling success; but many of us who are 
growing and planting pecan trees will 
have to hire the brains, acquire the experi¬ 
ence and accumulate by some means 
(which I am not at liberty to disclose) 
the necessary bank account. 

Therefore it becomes necessary to dis¬ 
cuss under the title of this paper combi¬ 
nations that will produce revenue to help 
the bank account, that will help build the 
soil, that will help to reduce the great 
burden of expense incidental to caring 
properly for a large acreage of pecan 
trees. 


It is a grand and beautiful and uplift¬ 
ing thing to sit in the shade of one nine 
or ten year old pecan tree and reflect that 
it has a crop on it worth fifteen to twenty- 
five dollars. It is then highly entertain¬ 
ing to calculate what one hundred acres—- 
five hundred acres—a thousand acres of 
land, with twenty such trees to the acre, 
will produce at twenty years of age. I al¬ 
ways stop figuring on this when I get up 
into the millions. I am not very clever 
in mathematics. 

I felt, however, that I was justified in 
figuring that one hundred or one thousand 
acres of pecan trees, treated like the thir¬ 
ty or more trees in my test grove, would 
yield as big returns as my trees are yield¬ 
ing if the problem could be solved of pro¬ 
viding proper equipment and organiza¬ 
tion and means for the care of the trees. 

This problem must be solved by making 
the land between the trees produce profita¬ 
ble crops and increase in fertility, by mak¬ 
ing lands not planted in trees produce rev¬ 
enue to assist in the work. Hence the 
answer, which is the shibboleth of the 
modern farmer—cliversification. 

It is impossible to outline any fixed 
system of diversification. One must be 
governed by the extent and character of 
the land to be used for the grove. A 
body of land, all clear, free from stumps, 
with no shade or running water, permits 






182

solid planting in. trees, but there can be 
no combinations used here, except straight 
cultivation of the middles with crop ro¬ 
tation. This is the most expensive type 
of the pecan grove but it is very well 
suited to the large company plan of sell¬ 
ing in blocks. The conservative man who 
fiuys ten acres and plants two hundred 
•trees thereon, expecting to give them care¬ 
ful attention cannot combine stockraising 
with his venture. His field offers him 
poultry as a side line, or a rotation of 
farm or truck crops. He usually com¬ 
promises by getting a darkey to plow and 
hoe (and skin up) his trees in exchange 
for the privilege of growing a sorry crop 
of corn or cotton in the middles. If the 
land is worked intelligently and is suited 
to cotton this crop, with its shallow, rapid, 
clean cultivation and nitrogen conserv¬ 
ing shade, is a splendid setting for young 
growing pecan trees. This plan effects a 
saving, perhaps, but is often ineffective 
•and rarely produces any revenue. 

So the conclusion forces itself that, to 
take advantage of combinations to help 
in making a pecan orchard, rare discrim¬ 
ination should be exercised in selecting 
the land. Many acres more than are to 
be planted in trees should be secured in 
order that the land for the grove may be 
wisely chosen, in order that there may 
be room for tenant farmers who can fur¬ 
nish ready day labor, in order to furnish 
pastures for cattle and sheep and swine 
that will in turn consume forage and 
grain produced, yielding in return natural 
fertilizers that are best of all for grow¬ 
ing trees when properly combined with 
•commercial fertilizers. Water should be 
• abundant; woodland, yielding acorns and 
other “mast” and furnishing shade and 


good rooting for pigs and grazing for 
cattle, should be desired. Where these 
things are absent the help for the soil 
must come, for the most part, from the 
fertilizer warehouse, and the price there¬ 
for from the bank account. I may be 
wrong but I figured things out that way; 
and our hogs have swamp and acorn 
range, our pure-bred and graded cattle 
have meadow and stream for support, and 
our negro tenants are near at hand to fur¬ 
nish labor when needed. From this old 
southern plantation of 3,400 acres, one- 
half woodland and pasturage, I select the 
sandy hammock land with deep clay sub¬ 
soil for the pecan trees. Fields are de¬ 
voted to raising corn for feeding mules 
and finishing hogs, sufficient hay is saved, 
peanuts are provided to be harvested by 
the hogs who have acorns as well to help 
flavor the pork, graded cattle, with only 
pure-bred males in the herd, furnish milk 
cows for sale, or offer opportunities for 
dairy products which may be utilized la¬ 
ter, while all “culls” and surplus males 
are fattened for beef. Now this is my 
theory and if I am wrong I will find it 
out in time—but it is a success so far. I 
believe that animal fertilizer, when prop¬ 
erly treated is the best for pecan trees. 
To secure it one must have work-stock, 
cows and hogs. To have these one must 
have pastures and a full bin and stack. 
To have them without undue outgo one 
must make them profitable. So I argue 
that only part of the farm 1 should be 
given to the trees—for cows and hogs and 
young pecan trees will not live amicably 
together inside the same fence. I have 
tried it; the hogs and the cows tried it— 
but the trees didn’t half try. They gave 
up without a struggle. It is not meant

that solid bodies of land should never be 
planted to trees by men or companies 
with ample means. It is meant that farm 
made money and farm made fertilizer 
helps pecan trees grow—and it takes land 
and labor to make either or both of them. 

One of the best combinations for the 
good of the whole pecan section is the 
one the thrifty farmer makes when he 
improves the value of his farm by put¬ 
ting out a few acres of standard varie¬ 
ties of pecans. There are farmers in my 
home county (Jefferson) who gather from 
a few seedling trees that were planted 
under an almost passing whim and ma¬ 
tured under adverse conditions, nuts 
worth more money than the better class 
of negro tenant can get gross for the en¬ 
tire crop made behind a good mule. 

I believe in the future of the pecan 
nut. It will add to the wealth and prog¬ 
ress and fame of the south. It will make 
our laborers busier, our lands more val¬ 
uable, our citizens more comfortable. The 
cotton states are offered another monop¬ 
oly to share honors with king cotton, and 
the pecan is already a commercial factor 
in the south’s affairs. 

I am reminded suddenly of a mental 
picture that is not pleasing. It is the rec¬ 
ollection of wide fields studded with 
trees, these crowded with briars and 
weeds and promising nothing but disap¬ 
pointment and failure to those whose 
money placed them there. Many an acre, 
planted to pecan trees that were carelessly 
dug, set out late and hurriedly and cared 
for not intelligently or not at all, stands 
today, as a warning to promoters and in¬ 
vestors alike that they should not prom¬ 
ise too much, that they should not under¬ 
take too much. Better a dozen good trees 


well set and thrifty than a thousand 
gnarled and knotty and yellow and worth¬ 
less from failure of funds to furnish 
proper fertilizers and cultivation. 

So it is wise and proper that one and 
all should set about the business of mak¬ 
ing pecan groves well guarded against the 
shocks of seasons and the demands on the 
bank roll; and the remedy for ills that I 
offer and believe in and practice is in the 
words of my text—“Combinations 
Adapted to Pecan Production.” There 
are many combinations besides those I 
named, and it is for us to figure out the 
ones most suited to our several condi¬ 
tions. 


DISCUSSION 

Mr. Williams: I would like to ask if 
the pecans can be grafted on the common 
pignut hickory with any success? 

Mr. Carroll: I am making an experi¬ 
ment in that line now, and I believe they 
can be worked on upland hickory. I have 
about 25 or 30 of the upland hickories 
cut back for budding. I tried only one 
last season and the buds took as readily 
as on any pecan stock I ever worked. I 
have about 1,000 of wild hickory on my 
place. There are about 400 or 500 in one 
body and I have decided to put them to 
some use. I am going to experiment with 
them and see if they will work. I budded 
the one with the Delmas pecan and the 
bud remained dormant until this spring. 
It now has shoots four feet long and has 
begun to branch out. I have not worked 
the pignut hickory. 

Mr. Graves: I have tried the experi¬ 
ment, and while they have made splendid 



184 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


growth, they have never borne any 
amount of nuts. 

Mr. Henderson : I was down in- 

-i, where they have very good 

hammock land. A gentleman there show¬ 
ed me about 35 trees that were budded 
on this pignut. The trees were about 12 
inches in diameter and had tops large 
enough to carry a barrel of nuts to the 
tree. He told me he had never seen a nut 
on them. They were the Van Deman 
and the Stuart varieties. 

Mr. Smithwick: I have here in my 
hand a photograph of a hickory tree that 
was sixty feet high when I topped it. I 
grafted a great many different varieties 
of pecans into it and they are all growing. 
I call it my experiment for varieties. I 
have fourteen varieties in the top of that 
tree and the most of them: are carrying 
fruit the second year from budding. 

I would like to ask the gentleman from 
Gainesville if the trees around that sec¬ 
tion budded on the hickory, have matur¬ 
ed any fruit yet? 

Mr. Henderson: Not a very abundant 
crop. Mr. Moseley was budding trees 
twelve years ago and they bore some nuts 
every year, but never anything like a full 
crop. He budded trees twelve years ago 


that were twelve inches in diameter. 

Md*. Williams: This pignut hickory is 
a little different from the regular hickory. 
The pignut is a more willowy growth and 
grows along the edge of swamp land. I 
have tried to destroy them, but would like 
to put them to some usefulness, if possi¬ 
ble. 

Prof. Hume: I have seen many hicko¬ 
ries and some of considerable size with 
both top work and grafts, but I have nev¬ 
er eaten the nuts. Some of them are good 
trees now, but whether they will produce 
any nuts or not, I do not know: Howev¬ 
er, there is no reason under the sun why, 
if the graft takes and makes a growth, it 
should not bear a crop. 

Mr. Henderson: I think the ones 
around Gainesville are beechnut hicko¬ 
ries. What they have produced so fapis 
a small bitter nut of no value at all. 

Mr. Miller: It will not do to judge a 
tree too soon. The pecan grafted on the 
hickory may take a longer time to come 
into bearing. We have so much better 
stocks as a rule, it is better to use the 
pecan for grafting on except where you 
have other trees growing naturally and 
want to convert them to a profitable pur¬ 
pose.

Chas. M. Barnwell. 


Mr . President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 

I find every one is planting larger and 
better trees, and not planting so many per 
day. They are using more and better 
fertilizers. They are not planting cotton 
and corn on the tree rows, and they are 
cultivating a strip on each side of the row 
of not less than three feet, and are en¬ 
deavoring to get around at least once a 
week.

Some are planting small trees, some 
large and some medium sizes. Corn and 
cotton crops are planted on ground be¬ 
tween trees, leaving 3 feet to trees first 
year, 4 feet second year, 5 feet 3rd year, 
6 feet 4th and 5th years. All kinds of 
crops are planted between tree rows ex¬ 
cept small grain and in some places oats, 
wheat and rye, are planted in rows be¬ 
tween trees and cultivated like other 
crops. 

H. W. Smithwick. 

Thomasville and Boston section have 
planted 805 acres to pecans. I do not 
know amount at Cairo. Probably 400 
acres. 

B. W. Stone. 

Mr. Miller: Georgia is, perhaps, 
planting more acres in nuts than any 
other state, with the exception of Texas, 
and Florida is coming right along behind 
her. 

Mr. Griffing: There has been to my 
knowledge no extensive planting from 
Madison east this present year in Florida. 
Last year, when we figured the planting 
up to that time, we did not include what 
could be termed South Florida; I mean 
by that south of Ocala. The planting up 
to that time was about 1600 acres. There 
have been a few plantings of ten up to 




















186 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


fifty acres this year, which probably 
brings the total up to 1700 or 1800 acres; 
that is, what we have reports from, that 
I know of. The additional acreage of 
which I have no definite knowledge, 
would easily bring the acreage up to 2,- 
500 acres in the territory from Ocala 
north and from Lake City, east. That is 
made up largely in Alachua, Baker, Du¬ 
val and Bradford counties and in that 
territory. Figuring on 25 trees to the 
acre, would make something like about 
60,000 trees. 

Mr. Miller: We will now hear from 
West Florida, from Mr. R. C. Simpson. 

Mr. Simpson: When I got these fig¬ 
ures together, it was with the understand¬ 
ing that it was the total number of trees 
planted. I have rather accurate figures 
on Jefferson county, but on several of the 
other counties they are mere estimates 
and the accurate figures could not be ob¬ 
tained : 

Jefferson County, 36,700 trees. 

Leon County, 3,000 trees. 

Gadsden County, 3,000 trees. 

Madison County, 3,000 trees. 

In other western counties of Florida, 
10,000 to 15,000 trees. 

Mr. Miller: You can see from these 
figures what the industry is doing and 
that it will not be so many years before 
the pecan crop will rival in importance 
that of the citrus and other fruit pro¬ 
ducts. Its enormous acreage and yield is 
going to create a product that will need 
some such help to market as you are find¬ 
ing in the citrus exchange. 

Mr. Rich: I would like to ask a ques¬ 
tion. It has been said in this discussion 
that there are at least a million trees now 


planted. We have a very accurate ac¬ 
count of the planting in Georgia. I think 
you will bear me out when I say that the 
planting in Georgia last year was 1200 
acres and this year 7,000 acres. 20 trees 
to the acre is putting it very mildly and 
is really below the average. Now, the 
point I am trying to get at is: counting 
your trees at $2.00 per tree, which is a 
very moderate price, you can see where 
there is an investment of about $300,000 
in pecan trees in Georgia alone; just 
the actual trees. Take the report of 
Mr. Simpson, that in his territory there 
were about 25,000 trees. The trees he re¬ 
fers to are on an average of three or 
four years of age. Say there are twenty 
trees to the acre; they ought to be worth 
$8.00 apiece. See what that will bring 
the investment up to. It shows that lots 
of money is being put into this industry 
and there must be a reason for it. I 
would ask that some one give us practi¬ 
cal, actual experience, the good and the 
bad alike. 

Mr. Miller: I would like for Mr. Car- 
roll to tell us something about his trees 
in the way of production. 

Mr. Carroll: I experimented first on 
about one and a half acres of ground. 
So many people told me not to do it, say¬ 
ing I would never live to see any nuts 
on the trees and would get no benefit 
from them. I bought the best trees I 
could find, cultivated them and took good 
care of them and brought some of those 
trees to bearing in the course of three or 
four years. I found out that some of the 
nuts were very inferior. Then I sawed 
them off and top worked several of them. 
Now, I have 33 on an acre and a half of 
ground. About half a dozen trees were

planted in 1901. I planted more trees in 
1902, 1903 and 1904. I have trees from 
six years of age up to nine years. I am 
getting 40 to 70 pounds off of nine year 
old trees. None of them sell for less than 
20c. per pound and some of them sell for 
40c. and 50c. per pound. I have some of 
the best varieties; these are the VanDe- 
man, Nelson, Frotscher, Stuart, Schley, 
Delmas, Dewey, Hall, Alley, Bolton, 
Moore and other varieties. I have no 
trees in this grove that are not growing 
well and bearing full, heavy crops. The 
nuts are well filled and of most excellent 
quality. 

The best record I have made with any 
tree was a five year old tree from which 
I got $6.25 worth of nuts in one year, 
selling them at 25c. per pound. I got 70 
pounds from a Moore tree in 1908, which 
was set in January, 1901. There is a six 
and a seven year old tree from which I 
got a total of 50 pounds last year, and 
sold the nuts at 50c. per pound. I have 
about a hundred acres planted, part of it 
set in 1906, part in 1907-08. Of the trees 
planted in 1906, about twelve or fifteen 
are already bearing. In fact, a few set 
in 1907 are bearing a little, and they are 
growing very thriftily. 

The trees planted on the big plantation 
did not do' so well. We have had about 
eighteen months of dry weather in our 
section, but the trees are doing fairly 
well, all things considered. They have a 
good color but are not making much 
growth. 

The test grove I have at home is an 
interesting sight for those who are inter¬ 
ested in pecans. If any of the gentle¬ 
men present come through Monticello, I 
will be very glad to show them around. 


On my land I am planting heavily of 
the Moore. It is a good bearing variety; 
a small nut and a nut that no one pays 
much attention to, but it is of good qual¬ 
ity and thin shell. The Schley is also 
good. I have many varieties on my lands, 
but if I had it to do over again I would 
select the Schley, the Delmas, the Moore, 
and possibly one to three other varieties, 
and plant exclusively of these. 

A Member: Is the pecan a prolific 
grower in the southern part of Florida? 

Prof. Hume: I have seen pecans grow¬ 
ing well in Fort Myers; as far south as 
that. Now, it is a question of soil in 
Florida. You can stand on soil that is 
good for pecans, and take two or three 
steps and be on soil that is fit for nothing 
but raising disturbances on. I would 
look carefully into the matter of soil be¬ 
fore I planted. On high pine land, you 
want to see what kind of subsoil there is, 
to be certain that the drainage is good. 

Mr. Henderson: Do they bear regu¬ 
larly ? 

Prof. Hume: They will compare fa¬ 
vorably with other crops in that respect. 
I don’t think they bear as regularly as 
the citrus fruits. It depends entirely on 
where you are. As you go a little further 
south in the State, they do not bear as 
regularly as the citrus fruits in the same 
section. A great deal depends on the va¬ 
riety, also. With some varieties they will 
run, to 1 my knowledge, for ten or twelve 
year and never fail to bring some crop. 
Other varieties only bear every other 
year. The matter of varieties adapted to 
the locality has to be very carefully con¬ 
sidered, if you want to make a success of 
pecan raising. 


188 


FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 


Mr. Rich: Is the VanDeman a regu¬ 
lar bearer ? 

Prof. Hume: It is not. In some sec¬ 
tions of the lower south it does not do 
well. 

Mr. Campbell: I believe the varieties 
that would do well in the Manatee river 
section would be the Teche, which is a 
heavy and regular bearer; the Russell is 
another; the Curtis is another. The Cur¬ 
tis runs about seventy to the pound. It 
It is of very good size and one of the 
best quality nuts I know anything about. 

Mr. Carroll: In mentioning the varie¬ 
ties I did, I do not recommend them to be 
planted anywhere except on soils similar 
to my own. They might be entirely un¬ 
fitted to someone else’s land or some oth¬ 
er section. You can very easily find out 
or get a line on what is best for your 
soil before purchasing the stock. I would 
not venture to recommend to these gen¬ 
tlemen any one particular variety for their 
planting without knowing soil conditions. 

Mr. Miller: It is growing late, ladies 
and gentlemen, and we thank you for 
your kind attention. This fall the Na¬ 
tional Nut Growers’ Association will 
meet at Monticello, and we cordially in¬ 
vite you to be present and we assure you 
we will open your eyes to what we are 


doing. The association we have here is 
simply a sub-organization of the Nation¬ 
al Association. 

Prof. Hume: I am sure we are very 
glad to have had this Nut Growers’ As¬ 
sociation with us. Tonight we succeeded 
in covering nut culture for the first time. 

Mr. Hart: I know it is very late to 
call this matter up, but I want to speak of 
one thing. I, with others, was appointed 
a committee at the meeting last year to 
go to Washington and see what could be 
done to get assistance there in the matter 
of studying blight of the orange tree. I 
went to see quite a number of professors, 
but did not see Prof. Waite there. I 
saw him afterwards at St. Catherine’s. 
Such work is in his hands. He is in the 
State at the present time, and I think he 
is here largely to> see the importance of 
the work and become convinced of the 
need of giving us assistance, and I would 
ask that every one who is interested in 
the matter who may see him at any time 
during his stay, will try to give him all 
the information possible so that lie may 
come to know the importance of the work 
and aid us in getting the help we so sore¬ 
ly need.
